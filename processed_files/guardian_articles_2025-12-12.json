The price of a ticket: the integrity of the gameMarina HydeIn World Cup parlance, Qatar was Fifa president Gianni Infantino’s qualifier. Now it’s the big time for Trump’s dictator-curious protegeFri 12 Dec 2025 15.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 21.37 CETShareIused to think Fifa’s recent practice of holding theWorld Cupin autocracies was because it made it easier for world football’s governing body to do the things it loved: spend untold billions of other people’s money and siphon the profitswithout having to worry about boring little things like human rights or public opinion. Which, let’s face it, really piss around with your bottom line.But for a while now, that view has seemed ridiculously naive, a bit like assuming Recep Erdoğan followed Vladimir Putin’selection-hollowing gameplanjust because hey, he’s an interested guy who likes to read around a lot of subjects. So no: Fifa president Gianni Infantino hasn’t spent recent tournaments cosying up to authoritarians because it made his life easier. He’s done it to learn from the best. And his latest decree this week simply confirms Fifa is now a fully operational autocracy in the classic populace-rinsing style. Do just absorb yesterday’s news that thecheapestticket for next year’s World Cup final in the USwill cost £3,120– seven times more than the cheapest ticket for the last World Cup final in Qatar. (Admittedly, still marginally cheaper than an off-peak single from London to Manchester.)Like all dictator-curious populists, Fifa loathes its people – the fans. Thinking back, I’ve even been at tournaments where the governing body has sponsored show trials. In South Africa in 2010, we had something called theFifa World Cup Courts– 56 courts where Fifa indicated it had finally outgrown fast food tie-ins and slapped its branding on justice itself. Or rather, on summary justice – which became an official tournament partner as cases were rushed through to appease the governing body. A group of Dutch women who’d worn orange minidresses to a game as stunt-marketing for Bavaria beerwere arrested. Fifa filed criminal charges against the company.Again, in retrospect that all seems rather small beer (sorry). Orange-coated faux fans are positively encouraged these days, but only if they come in the sole form of US president Donald Trump, whosebromance with Infantinohas been one of the more mesmerisingly weird developments of his presidency.But then, just as power-playing moguls place themselves on each other’s company boards, so autocrats love other autocrats. Back in January, many of us were still vaguely startled to see Giannigiven a great seatat Trump’s inauguration, barely two rows behind the tech oligarchs, where he was able to laugh uproariously at the bit of the speech where Trump announced he’d berenaming the Gulf of Mexicothe Gulf of America. (Just a little niggle between Fifa co-hosts.) But now that we’ve seen Infantino pop up everywhere from Gaza peace conferences to regular turns in the Oval Office, it almost feels strange when he isn’t part of Trump’s malarial travelling court – the Dontourage, if you will.Whether Infantino will at some point end up in the woodchipper, just like everyone does with Trump, is unclear. For now, the presidentis enjoyinghaving his tummies tickled. A week ago, at the World Cup draw, Trump obligingly suggested the NFL give up the rights to calling its sport football in the United States. “But when you think about it, shouldn’t it really be called …thisis football,”Trump waffled. “There’s no question about it. We have to come up with another name for the NFL. It really doesn’t make sense when you think about it.” This is what happens when the presidentgets booedat the Super Bowl, instead of being given an inaugural award like he was at Infantino’s fever dream of a draw. Yes, even though you couldn’t believe the shamelessness until you actually saw it with your own eyes, it was incredibly credible that Infantino would indeed confect some nutty “Fifa peace prize” andaward it to Trump.In recent history, both the Olympics and the World Cup have shown they are always able to covertly or overtlyoverride local lawsof the host country for the duration of their sporting event. Fortunately, though, this is unnecessary in the US, where being ripped off for sports tickets is effectively the 28th amendment. Furthermore, this World Cup is already shaping up to be the sort of reciprocally abusive arrangement we’ve seen when the tournament previously tipped up in non-democracies. Trump can use it tothreaten Democrat mayorswith loss of city hosting rights, while Infantino can charge genuinely crazy money and have Fifa run the entire secondary ticketing/scalping market without interference. Everyone’s a winner, as long as they hold all the cards.And the peasants – the fans – just have to suck it up.Fifaelections have effectively been hollowed out by the strong-arm practice of buying off the votes of smaller nations via disproportionately large grants. The dictator makes sure countries know what’s good for them. The gravy train rolls on. So if you fancy getting rid of Gianni and everything he represents, I’d love to know the mechanism you have in mind. Maybe one day football will have some kind of revolution, in which hordes of endlessly oppressed people who actually like the sport will storm Infantino’s Zurich palace, and loot all the valuable gifts of obscure provenance. But it won’t be soon, unless one or more of the big football markets gets it together and pulls out.Until then, we’ll just have to accept that there is simply no one who cares less than Infantino, and simply no sport that hates its fans quite as much as football. In fact, if only those fans could afford the tickets, they’d have the receipts to prove it.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGianni InfantinoOpinionWorld Cup 2026FifaWorld CupDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

In a shocking twist, Starmer’s TikToks are borderline competent.The majority of the videos seem to be attempts at ultra short-form cinéma vérité: a camera operator following the prime minister around, catching snippets of him saying good morning to security guards, questioning where chief mouser, Larry the cat, is and greeting the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueThe “peek behind the curtain” style is clearly designed to make the prime minister feel more relatable to young UK voters, and while there’s definitely potential here, all his videos share the same fatal flaw.Starmer cares about looking cool.“Aura farming” is an internet term for someone posting content trying to seem effortlessly suave, handsome or charismatic.And look, for my own sanity, I have to assume Starmer’s team was being tongue-in-cheek when they captioned that plane video: “I’d explain, but it’s classified” – that they were poking fun at people trying to seem cool on the internet.But the more I look through his TikToks, with every shot so carefully curated to make Starmer seem competent and in control, the more I began to feel the accusation of “aura farming” fitted.And on a platform such as TikTok, which trades off vulnerability and intimacy, being caught trying to seem aloof is a crime worse than murder. (Or at least worse than the “millennial pause”, and that’s pretty bad.)There are some rare examples of politicians feeling authentically at home on the app: in the US,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezhas found great success speaking frankly to her iPhone camera from her living room couch. Even a lower-profile politician such as the Australian MPJulian Hillhas cultivated a dedicated following by sharing his frustrations with the opposition from his cluttered parliamentary office.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

A style, no doubt, influenced by the fact that TikTok is technically banned on government phones, due to data security concerns, and his team is, no doubt, terrified to imply he might actually have the app downloaded.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

The comments under any politician’s post are going to be filled with far more vitriol than praise – that’s just how the internet works. What’s notable about Starmer’s is just how generic the comments are.It’s all “get this clown out”, “vote reform” and the occasional “best prime minister ever”, but barely any mention of the actual content at hand.Because ultimately, the videos don’t have any content – besides a fleeting sense of novelty, there’s no reason I would ever send them to friends, let alone bring them up at the pub. These videos only exist to prove what a cool guy Starmer is. And he isn’t.So no, the UK prime minister’s first foray into the world of TikTok hasn’t been an utter embarrassment. But it might have been better if it was.Like most politicians, Starmer is an innately dorky man and if he is really serious about winning the hearts (and votes) of young people, his TikTok needs to embrace and celebrate that, not unconvincingly hide it away.I have some ideas for what he could do, and I would explain, but hey, it’s classified.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerTikTokSocial mediaDigital mediaLabourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Four years after selling Leon, the fast food chain named after his father and founded in 2004 with two friends, he has bought it back with hopes of reviving its fortunes.“In a crisis you need a pilot in full control,” the martial arts fan says, speaking to the Guardian from Leon’s headquarters near London Bridge.He is getting his metaphorical trainers on to “outrun the lion” as he ploughs his efforts and his own money into reviving the troubled chain.The former management consultant bought back Leon for a rumoured £30m-£50m – significantly less than the £100m he sold it for – from the supermarket chain Asda in October, 21 years after the first restaurant opened in Camden. It was a self-funded, debt-free deal that he hopes will turnaround the company he co-founded with his friends Henry Dimbleby, who later became a government food tsar, and the chef Allegra McEvedy. Their original mission was to make seasonal, high-quality fast food available to everyone.Vincent says he now wants to run Leon “as a family business, almost like running your own corner shop”. He says the business will be fuelled by a “founder’s mentality”, pondering problems from the early hours of the morning to late at night.The first step is to renegotiate leases and shrink the group. The plan includes the possible closure of two outlets by the end of January, taking the total number to 50. Leon had 68 outlets at the time of the buyout including 43 directly owned and operated.View image in fullscreenJohn Vincent says he wants to run Leon ‘as a family business’.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianUndera turnaround plan, Leon is shifting out of unprofitable locations and cities such as Brighton and Manchester to concentrate on its owned stores – of which there are now 29 – in London. Franchisees will continue to operate locations in, for example, motorway service stations around the country. Once that shake-up has been achieved, Vincent expects to be back on the expansion trail with plans for as many as 100 UK outlets, mostly in the capital, over the next four years. Overseas franchises and joint ventures in selected overseas cities are also on the cards, he says.Vincent is also rapidly ditching some menu items he feels are not right, such as sandwiches, improving quality with better smoked salmon and thicker slices of halloumi, while inspiring managers to ensure their restaurants are spotlessly clean with rapid service.View image in fullscreenVincent wants to improving quality with thicker slices of halloumi.Photograph: LeonThe team is also developing a new menu to be relaunched in the spring, which aims to bring back old favourites such as the fish finger wrap and new dishes aimed at reviving its healthy and tasty credentials at an affordable price.Vincent has also signed up staff to training in wing tsun, his favoured martial art, to improve coffee-making times “while lowering heart rates”.All of this is daunting in a very tough market for hospitality businesses as cautious consumers cut back on dining out while business costs – from ingredients to business rates, national insurance and labour – are on the rise.Vincent, who at more than six feet tall is built like a rugby player and speaks a mix of new age hippy and Thatcher-era free marketeer, says Leon must stand out from the crowd and ramp up sales if it wants to continue to exist.“The average player in this market is going to go bankrupt,” he says. “The only winners in this space, ultimately will outstrip everyone else on revenue.”He accused Labour of “taxing businesses to extinction” and “creating the opposite of growth.”The survival plan for Leon is to be “massively differentiated”.Leon has to be niche: it can’t be on every high street“Leon has to be niche: it can’t be on every high street. We want to be the best food company in the world but don’t want to be the biggest,” he says.“Every Leon should be magical. I want to be a beacon of what’s possible.”Seemingly the business has been waiting on his return. A side office still contains a dusty framed photo of him and the boardroom still contains its mid-century-meets industrial furnishings as if preserved in aspic.His “glimpses of brilliance” notebook has remained in a cupboard – but unused. Now Vincent and his team are back scribbling positivity missives to each other in the book.View image in fullscreenA Leon restaurant in London’s Spitalfields. Vincent says the chain must stand out from the crowd.Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian“It’s like one of those dreams where you are in your house but it is not your house,” he says. ‘It’s like someone stepped on a butterfly and here we are.”A fan of aphorisms, management theories and self-help book advice, Vincent says some may dismiss such as techniques as “woo woo” but the numbers speak for themselves.He says that until the business was hit by the Covid pandemic it was doing well, with underlying profits on the rise and new outlets opening each year.Since then it has been a different story.It has made a pre-tax loss every year since 2016 – first linked to spending on rapid expansion. Since 2019 it has struggled with a string of problems from rising costs and interest rates to increased competition, Brexit and the Covid pandemic. Sales plummeted to £38m in 2020 from £76.3m in 2019 as high street lockdowns and the shift to working from home took their toll.“It was like knock after knock in a boxing ring,” says co-founder McEvedy, who is no longer formally involved in the business but recently joined a brainstorming session on the new menu.For McEvedy, the biggest blow was Leon’s move away from its original concept of “naturally fast food” that was tasty and healthy.She says it was originally “dial changing about what was possible” led by “three friends that really cared and were really focused on everything from what the loos look like to branding, aprons and the menu”.View image in fullscreenAllegra McEvedy is no longer formally involved with Leon but recently joined a brainstorming session on the new menu.Photograph: Circe Hamilton/Allegra McEvedyMcEvedy says that under Asda “all the points of difference slowly got shaved away”.Sales had recovered to £52.2m by 2022 but that was partly down to continued store openings with the group reaching a peak of 85 stores that year.Leon then got caught up in the difficulties of the owners of Asda – the billionaire Issa brothers and their private equity partner TDR Capital.The brothers’ EG Group, a petrol forecourts operator,bought Leon in 2021, probably with the intention of expanding it across their portfolio.The deal came just months after they invested in Asda in a £6.8bn debt-fuelled deal. After interest rates soared and an apparent falling-out between the brothers Mohsin and Zuber, their investments were restructured.Asdabought out most of the UK division of EG, including Leonand it was then part of a retail group struggling with multiple problems from high debts and falling sales, rising costs, intense IT disruption and heavy competition.Last year Leon’s sales fell almost 4% to £62.5m when it made a pre-tax loss of £8m and store numbers declined to 79, according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House.But Vincent suggests there are no hard feelings.“I can’t blame Asda,” he says. The problem was, he adds, “I didn’t imbue enough understanding in the company of how to sustain itself without me. My job now is to come back and embed a culture of what good looks like.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryRestaurantsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer and his fellow leaders have to face this new realityFri 12 Dec 2025 18.36 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 21.08 CETShareWhen are we going to get the message? I joked a few months back that, when it comes to Donald Trump, Europe needs to learn from Sex and the City’s Miranda Hobbes and realise that “He’s just not that into you”. After this past week, it’s clear that understates the problem. Trump’s America is not merely indifferent to Europe – it’s positively hostile to it. That has enormous implications for the continent and for Britain, which too many of our leaders still refuse to face.The depth of US hostility was revealed most explicitly in the newUS national security strategy, or NSS, a 29-page document that serves as a formal statement of the foreign policy of the second Trump administration. There is much there to lament, starting with the sceptical quote marks that appear around the sole reference to “climate change”, but the most striking passages are those that take aim at Europe.China and Russia, which you’d think the US would see as genuine strategic threats worthy of serious attention, are addressed flatly and with relative brevity. It’sEuropethat gets Team Trump’s blood up, against Europe that it unleashes its rhetorical firepower. It warns that economic stagnation, “censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates” and above all, migration, raise “the stark prospect of civilizational erasure”.You don’t need advanced decryption software to work out what that means. The NSS worries that soon some European countries “will become majority non-European”, which can only be a euphemism for non-white. Any doubt on that score was dispelled by the rambling speechthe president delivered in Pennsylvaniaon Tuesday, in which he mused on how the US only takes people “from shithole countries” such as Somalia, asking plaintively: “Why can’t we have some people from Norway, Sweden … from Denmark?”Perhaps this would not much matter if it merely confirmed that Trump and his circle view Europe through the same culture war lens that they apply to the US, blaming migration, DEI and “woke” for enfeebling societies that were stronger when they were solidly white and Christian (their understanding of “European”). But this is not merely a Fox News rant. It’s a plan.The NSS makes clear that theTrump administrationwill not stand idly by as Europe allows itself to become “unrecognizable in 20 years or less”. It plans to join the fight, backing those far-right, ultranationalist parties it hails for their “resistance”. It says that “the growing influence of patriotic European parties” is cause for great optimism and the US will do what it can to help Europe “correct its current trajectory”. In other words, the US is set on pursuing regime change in Europe and will be throwing its weight behind the likes of Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland or AfD, France’s National Rally and, no doubt, Reform UK.Trump’s defendershave sought to arguethat the administration has no problem with Europe per se; it’s the European Union it can’t stand. A Europe of individual, sovereign nation-states would, they say, find a warm embrace in Trump’s Washington. It just so happens that that’s the precise preference of one Vladimir Putin, who has regarded the weakening or breakup of the EU as a strategic aim for decades. No wonder theKremlin lavished praiseon the new US plan, which it was delighted to see aligned with “our vision”.Maybe talk of visions is too grand. Perhaps what leads Washington to share Moscow’s low opinion of the EU is not philosophy but something more basic. Note how a chorus of Trump officials chose torestate their anti-EU stance, always in the loftiest terms of course, straight after Brussels had slapped the former Trump appointee Elon Musk with a €120m fine for“deceptive” practices on his X platform. Could it be that what Trump and his acolytes really dislike about the EU is that it’s one of the few forces on the planet that can curb their power? The EU has muscle, and that alone infuriates the likes of Musk and Trump, especially when the common thread running through this second Trump term is the desire to remove or weaken any restraint on his ability to act. Far better a loose grouping of 27 states he can divide and conquer than a mighty bloc working together.The motive hardly matters: whether the US regards the EU as an enemy for transactional or ideological reasons, it now sees it as an enemy. That much should have been clear within weeks of Trump returning to the White House, and certainly by February when he gave Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dressing down in the Oval Office. But now that the US government has spelled it out in black and white, it is incontrovertible.The trouble is, Europe’s leaders still cannot quite face this painful new truth. The head of Nato, Mark Rutte, ominously announced on Thursday that “Russia has brought war back to Europe” and that “We are Russia’s next target.” He feared that too many don’t feel the urgency of the threat. But he failed to mention that, in this new war, Nato’s most powerful member, the US, has picked a side – and it is Russia.Note how the US is piling the pressure on Ukraine to accept armistice terms congenial to Moscow, instructing Kyiv to withdraw even from those parts of theDonbas region that it still controls, with no guarantee that Russian forces would not simply move in and seize the vacated land. Via aninterview with Politico, Trump told Ukraine it had to “play ball” since Russia had “the upper hand”.Rutte warns of war, urging Europe to prepare itself, yet he has nothing to say about the one-time ally across the Atlantic now turned foe. On the contrary, only a few months ago the Nato boss wasliterally calling Trump “daddy”.Few embody the contradiction more fully than Britain’s own Keir Starmer. He prides himself on his solidarity with Zelenskyy, but remains silent as Trump demonstrates his solidarity with Putin. The prime minister knows that the defence of Ukraine requires combining Europe’s military capabilities, yet last month he allowed the collapse of a plan for the UK to join a majorEuropean rearmament effort. The UK government had wanted to take part in the €150bn (£130bn) scheme, boosting Britain’s defence industry in the process, but balked at the entrance fee.This week, Starmer ruled outrejoining the EU customs union, explaining that he didn’t want to unravel the trade deal secured earlier this year with the US. It’s the same choice, made over and over again, putting the US relationship ahead of the European one, even as the signals could not be any clearer: this love is unrequited.It’s come to something when the sharpest geopolitical voice in Europe belongs to the pope. Leo criticised Trump for “trying to break apart” an Atlantic alliance that remained essential. In the current climate, even naming the problem counts as a radical act. Now it’s time for those leaders who do not speak in the name of God, but for the peoples of Europe, to be as brave.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

From the Old Frenchbarbacane, it historically means a fortified gateway forming the outer line of defence to a city or castle. London’s Barbican marks the site of a medieval structure that would have defended an important access point. Its architecture was designed to repel. Some might argue, as they stumble out of Barbican tube station and gaze upwards, not much has changed in the interim.The use of the word “barbican” was in decline in this country until the opening in 1982 of the Barbican Arts Centre. Taking 20 years to build, it completed the modernist megastructure of the Barbican Estate, grafted on to a huge tract of land devastated by wartime bombing. The aim was to bring life back to the City through swish new housing, energised by the presence of culture. Nonetheless, the arts centre, the elusive minotaur at the heart of the concrete labyrinth, was always farcically difficult to locate. To this day, visitors are obliged to trundle along the Ariadne’s thread of the famous yellow line, inscribed in what seemed like an act of institutional desperation, across concrete hill and dale.The Barbican is one of the most important postwar developments in the country – if not the worldThe Twentieth Century SocietyThe minotaur is also ageing. Just like people, buildings also physically decay and get into bad habits, necessitating the odd hip replacement or hair transplant. Approval has now been granted by the City of London Corporation for a multi-million-pound programme to upgrade and transform the Barbican, in time for the 50th anniversary of its opening in 2032. From June 2028, it willclose its doors for a yearto undergo the most ambitious makeover in its history. There will be a fair few architectural equivalents of hip replacements.View image in fullscreenA digital rendering of the renewed foyer.Photograph: Kin CreativesThe Grade II-listed complex suffers from leaks, crumbling fabric, outdated services and accessibility issues.Navigability is a perpetual bugbear, with apocryphal tales of famous people (including a celebrated explorer) getting lost in the cat’s cradle of walkways, decks and staircases, conceived by its architects, Chamberlin Powell & Bon, in an era when such things were seen as exciting and novel.Sectional drawings made at the time show the building as a heroic, concrete layer cake, sprung from the imagination of a modern Piranesi, with levels stacked around the cavernous volumes of the concert hall and theatre. Most heroic of all is the conservatory, which took the void around the theatre fly tower, enclosed it in glass and filled it with plants. In the refurbishment proposals, this hugely popular urban greenhouse, a Kew Palm House for the East End, will be spruced up and made more accessible to the public.Over time, the Barbican’s fortunes have fluctuated, but now, in the manner of the structure it was named after, it has successfully defended itself from public opprobrium, swatting away squeals of “concrete monstrosity” to become a kind of architectural national treasure. You can buy Barbican mugs, models, tea towels and other ephemera valorising its uncompromising brutalist heft.View image in fullscreenConcrete hill and dale … the Barbican Centre’s current Silk Street entrance.Photograph: Dion BarrettRemedial strategies have been tried before. In the early 1990s, Theo Crosby of design group Pentagram introduced some ill-advised pointillist stippling, along with gilded fibreglass statues, all contrived to “soften” the concrete. Derided as “feeble tinkering” by Geoffrey Powell, one of the original architects, it was a decidedly unflattering smear of lipstick on a rather fabulous gorilla.A subsequent rebranding and remodelling by modernist fanboys Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM) went slightly better, allowing the uncompromising brutalist heft to speak for itself, but below stairs, things were creaking and leaking, and have now got to the point where doing nothing is not an option.View image in fullscreenKew Palm House heads east … a render of the Barbican Renewal.Photograph: Kin CreativesFears that the Barbican would be “starchitect-ified” by its latest glow-up appear unfounded. This is a “fabric first” approach, concerned with diligently making good, decarbonising, and fitting for the future – now common architectural practice for buildings of this size and significance. The overhaul will be overseen by Allies and Morrison along with Asif Khan Studio, which will collectively be thoughtful, steady hands on the tiller; just what an ageing minotaur needs. Turner prize-winners Assemble will get a crack at sorting out the wayfinding, though it’s probably impossible to improve on the yellow line. In short, the Barbican will become more like the Barbican.The only blot on the escutcheon concerns possible new neighbours. Plans have been submitted for two new 20-storey towers on Silk Street, directly across from the arts centre, to replace an outdated 1980s office block. Designed by American architects SOM, the hulking, Jenga-esque extrusions will loom imperiously over the Barbican’s east end, like a pair of corpulent bouncers. Residents’ groups and heritage bodies are vigorously opposing the development in its present form. “The Barbican is one of the most important postwar residential and cultural developments in the country, if not the world,” says Catherine Croft, director of the Twentieth Century Society, “and its status as a prominent, architecturally outstanding London landmark should be respected as much as the fabric itself.” It seems the Barbican may still have some repelling to do.Explore more on these topicsBarbicanArchitecturePlanning policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, at its heart is Jud (a superb Josh O’Connor), a young Catholic priest who butts heads with his new monsignor, Josh Brolin’s fire-and-brimstone Jefferson. Their flock – Glenn Close, Jeremy Renner, Andrew Scott, Kerry Washington – provide starry support in an unexpectedly moving exploration of truth and belief.Simon WardellOut now, NetflixF1View image in fullscreenSuitably spectacular … Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt in F1.Photograph: Warner BrosMade in conjunction with Formula One’s governing body, Joseph Kosinski’s pit-lane drama smacks of the real thing. Filmed at actual grand prix alongside actual drivers, it’s a high-glossredemption talein which Brad Pitt’s rule-bending, has-been racer is asked to save a failing F1 team threatened with a takeover – but only has nine races to do it. Damson Idris (surely based on producer Lewis Hamilton) is the rookie with lessons learn from the older man. It’s great fun watching Pitt do his laconic charmer routine and the action is suitably spectacular.SWOut now, Apple TVElfView image in fullscreenChristmas spirit incarnate … Will Ferrell and Zooey Deschanel in Elf.Photograph: New Line/Sportsphoto/AllstarElfis a festive comedy that, in less accomplished hands, could easily have fallen into a vat of schmaltz. Luckily, Jon Favreau’s hardy perennial has an extremely high gag rate, and in star Will Ferrell a performer with exquisite timing. Ferrell plays Buddy, adopted as a baby by Papa Elf and as a grownup sent to New York to finally meet his birth father, Walter (James Caan). Christmas spirit incarnate, Buddy’s perpetual joy at the season, and endearingly unfiltered honesty, should make even the Scroogiest of viewers melt a little.SWSaturday 13 December, 8.05pm, Sky ShowcaseParis, 13th DistrictView image in fullscreenA tangled web … Paris, 13 th District.Photograph: Shanna BessonJacques Audiard’stangled dramamay be shot in black-and-white but there’s nothing monochrome about the young people it focuses on. Call centre worker Émilie (Lucie Zhang) rents a room to teacher Camille (Makita Samba), but their instant attraction soon dissolves into hostility. Meanwhile, Noémie Merlant’s mature student Nora is mistaken by her classmates for online sex worker Amber (Jehnny Beth), but then the two start to video chat … Romantic but realistic, it’s a film about wanting the same thing – but not necessarily at the same time.SWSaturday 13 December, 12.45am, BBC TwoThe Wedding BanquetView image in fullscreenDoubling down … Lily Gladstone in The Wedding Banquet.Photograph: Luka Cyprian/Bleecker Street/APThis remakeof Ang Lee’s 1993 comedy drama covers the same hiding-sexuality-for-a-green-card theme but in these more open times has to double down on its premise. So we get Seattle lesbian couple Angela and Lee (Kelly Marie Tran and Lily Gladstone), who are in the expensive midst of IVF, and their friends, Chris (Bowen Yang) and Min (Han Gi-Chan), who hasn’t come out to his rich Korean grandmother. The partner-swapping is nicely farcical if lacking in real jeopardy, but it’s an interesting LGBTQ take on marriage and motherhood.SWSunday 14 December, 9.25am, 6.10pm, Sky Cinema PremiereThe HolidayView image in fullscreenSwoon alert! … Cameron Diaz and Jude Law in The Holiday.Photograph: AlamyThe Winslet clan will be making several appearances on your telly this Christmas (see also Goodbye June and The Phoenician Scheme). Kicking us off is Mum, AKA Kate, as one quarter of a film that strives to prove that love on the rebound can work out. She plays Iris, who briefly quits snowy England for LA, with Cameron Diaz’s Amanda swapping homes with her after a breakup. The love interest comes from Iris’s brother Graham (Jude Law) and, rather less swooningly, Jack Black’s composer Miles.SWSunday 14 December, 8.30pm, BBC TwoEverything Everywhere All at OnceView image in fullscreenEnjoy the rollercoaster … Michelle Yeoh in Everything Everywhere All at Once.Photograph: Ley Line Entertainment/Album/AlamyFrenetic fun for (nearly) all the family, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s Oscar-laden comicsci-fi adventurenever lets up during its two-hour-plus runtime. Michelle Yeoh harks back to her Hong Kong action film past as a struggling laundromat owner thrown into an increasingly surreal series of alternative universes in an attempt to defeat a powerful iteration of her unhappy daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). More exposition would be pointless – just go with the hotdog finger-verse, the anime-verse and, most hilariously, the universe where all the characters are rocks – and enjoy the rollercoaster.SWMonday 15 December, 11.10pm, Film4Dune: Part TwoView image in fullscreenGobsmacking … Dune: Part Two.Photograph: Courtesy of Warner Bros.

IfNo 2is anything to go by, it should be worth the wait. Timothée Chalamet returns as Paul Atreides, heir to a colonising dynasty but also the prophesised liberator of the people of desert planet Arrakis, AKA Dune. Amid gobsmacking effects and intricate plotting, it’s a chilling tale of power and faith corrupting the best of intentions. Paul is the messiah, but he’s also a very naughty boy.

Theeighth adventurefor the undercover agent returns him to the seemingly impossible battle against AI force the Entity, which has gained control of most of the world’s nuclear weapons. But the ins and outs of the plot are beside the point when you get to witness exhilarating action sequences such as Ethan’s dive into a sunken Russian submarine or a vertiginous fight on a biplane. But arguably the best scene is earlier on, when US military and political bigwigs are given an increasingly comical recap of Ethan’s rule-breaking exploits down the years, plus all his colleagues who have died in the process. It’s a superb encapsulation of the absurdity of the whole M:I enterprise – and why we love it so.SWFriday 19 December, 9.40am, 8pm,Sky Cinema PremiereThe Great FloodView image in fullscreenFrantic … Kim Da-mi and Kwon Eun-seong in The Great Flood.Photograph: Jeong Kyung-hwa/NetflixAn asteroid has hit Antarctica and melted it. For the residents of a Seoul apartment complex, that means a race to the highest floor before tsunamis hit them all. This frantic end-of-the-world thriller may have you working out how long you can hold your breath, as Kim Da-mi’s scientist Gu An-na and her young son Jan-in (Kwon Eun-seong) struggle through the waters. But the presence of her AI tech firm’s security operative Son Hee-jo (Park Hae-soo) hints at a weirder plot twist to come. SWFriday 19 December, NetflixShellView image in fullscreenEntertainingly silly … Kate Hudson and Elisabeth Moss in Shell.Photograph: RepublicIn between seasons of The Handmaid’s Tale, Max Minghella directed his co-star Elisabeth Moss in anotherdystopian drama– this near-future horror about the pitfalls of chasing the perfect body. Moss plays Samantha, an actor who signs up for an anti-ageing skin treatment (derived, ominously, from lobsters). It’s run by a company owned by 68-year-old – though you wouldn’t know it – Zoe Shannon (Kate Hudson). In true The Substance fashion, it all goes badly wrong, as the film gives in to its B-movie sensibilities and becomes increasingly, entertainingly silly.

Because denying them the full enjoyment of all the fable-based gags in this sublime animated comedy feels like a cruelty worthy of an evil stepmother. There is some originality here, too, not least Shrek himself (voiced by Mike Myers), a grumpy green ogre forced to save the kingdom from the petty Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). And let’s not forget Eddie Murphy’s Donkey, one of the greatest comic creations this century.

But Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) has a cunning plan: every Christmas Eve, he and his “elf” helper Marcus (Tony Cox) rob the mall in which they set up their grotto. Terry Zwigoff’scomedyis true to its unsentimental premise despite the tinselly trappings, and Thornton wholeheartedly embodies a man who – even when his heart is tugged by a lonely, bullied boy – is still a wrong ’un.

The story of a man driven to suicidal thoughts by decades of relentless self-sacrifice, the bulk of it has precisely zero to do with Christmas. The fact that it can meander in such gloomy waters and still result in the most thrillingly life-affirming third act in cinema history is a testament to director Frank Capra and star James Stewart.Stuart HeritageSunday 21 December, 12.45pm, ITV1OppenheimerView image in fullscreenThe least Christmassy film ever made – watch out! … Cillian Murphy in Oppenheimer.Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures/APChristopher Nolan’sbiopicof Robert Oppenheimer is an impossible thing. It’s the story of the leading brain behind the atomic bomb, told in a non-chronological fashion that doesn’t care a jot whether its audience can keep up. Paced like a thriller, it contains plenty of spectacle, a truckload of career-best performances (including Cillian Murphy in the title role) and moments of all-out dread that will stay with you for years. It deserves every scrap of the commercial and critical success it got. It is also, however, the least Christmassy film ever made, so watch out for that.Sunday 21 December, 9pm, BBC TwoNativity!View image in fullscreenA full-hearted magic trick … Martin Freeman and Ashley Jensen in Nativity!Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyAlthough its impact has been diluted by several sequels that failed to recapture its joy, the first Nativity! film still feels like a full-hearted magic trick. Ostensibly the story of a miserable teacher (Martin Freeman) who rediscovers his sense of self as his school gets ready for a visit from a Hollywood producer, the joy of Nativity! comes from the child performers, who walk the line between chaotically silly and so aggressively heartfelt that they will reduce you to tears. The closest any film has come to a school nativity, for better or worse.Monday 22 December, 2.20pm, BBC OneChallengersView image in fullscreenOne of the sexiest films ever made … Mike Faist, Zendaya and Josh O’Connor in Challengers.Photograph: Metro Goldwyn Mayer PicturesLuca Guadagnino makes films like a man running out of time. Last year he directed both Queer andChallengers. And while Queer was arguably the best work of his career, Challengers was by far his most successful. A tale of former tennis doubles teammates who find themselves competing against each other after years of differing fortunes, Challengers is also one of the sexiest films ever made. There’s a simmering tension at all times between Josh O’Connor, Mike Faist and Zendaya, the three leads, that culminates in a breathtaking final sequence.SHMonday 22 December, 10.40pm, BBC OneGoodbye JuneFilm pickView image in fullscreenMachine-tooled to generate tears … Toni Collette in Goodbye June.Photograph: Kimberley French/NetflixMake mine a double Winslet. Not only doesKate Winsletproduce, direct (for the first time) and star in this seasonal weepie, but her son Joe Anders wrote the screenplay. Helen Mirren plays the titular June, who is dying in hospital from cancer and probably won’t make it to Christmas Day. Her grownup children – reliable Julia (Kate Winslet), resentful Molly (Andrea Riseborough), nervous Connor (Johnny Flynn) and new-agey Helen (Toni Collette) – rally round, but the agonising wait for the end brings all the family’s imperfections to the surface. Although it’s almost machine-tooled to generate tears (death, cute kids, hugs), the great cast pitch it perfectly between tragedy and joy.SWChristmas Eve, NetflixPaddingtonView image in fullscreenThis film has it all … Paddington.Photograph: Studiocanal/PAPaddingtonis now such an immovable national treasure that, whenever a beloved celebrity dies, social media fills with images of him literally escorting them to heaven. So it’s worth bearing in mind that Paul King’s film was a complete punt when it was made 11 years ago. At first, people complained about everything – from the slapstick comedy to the character’s weird design. But in the end, we’re all helpless before Paddington and his ability to show us who we want to be. Silly and sincere, hilarious and moving, this film has it all.SHChristmas Eve, 5.30pm, BBC OneA Minecraft MovieView image in fullscreenExpect pandemonium … A Minecraft Movie.Photograph: Warner Bros EntertainmentThink very carefully about the time you put this on for the kids. While A Minecraft Movie is fun and fast and colourful, effortlessly blending the lore of the world-beating video games with Jack Black’s high-voltage buffoonery, you may remember that its “chicken jockey” scene led to outright pandemonium in cinemas around the world. Putting it on first thing on Christmas morning, when they’re high on Haribo, will almost certainly lead to disaster. Much better to wait until after they’re groggy and full from dinner.SHChristmas Day, 7.10am, 6.15pm, Sky Cinema PremiereWallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most FowlView image in fullscreenIrresistible … Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl.Photograph: Richard Davies/Courtesy of NetflixOne year old and already a festive mainstay,Vengeance Most Fowlmarks the return of Feathers McGraw, the silently evil penguin last seen in 1993’s The Wrong Trousers. The runtime here is beefed up from that, however, thanks to the sheer amount of elements it has to fit in. The Aardman animation crams in mystery, suspense, more shameless puns that you can possibly count (Anton Deck remains a masterpiece) and a surprisingly sharp critique of AI. All that wrapped in a charming faux-nostalgic bow. Irresistible.SHChristmas Day, 11.40am, BBC OneMatilda the MusicalView image in fullscreenExcellent … Emma Thompson and Charlie Hodson-Prior in Matilda the Musical.Photograph: Dan Smith/NetflixAlthough Danny DeVito’s 1996 adaptation of Roald Dahl’s beloved novel has its strengths,Matilda the Musicalfeels like the film the book always deserved. Based on the stage musical by Dennis Kelly and Tim Minchin, it tells the story we all know – a lonely, self-reliant girl finds herself developing magical powers – while blasting it into orbit. The mood is heightened. The performances, especially Emma Thompson (literally) swinging for the fences as the abominable Miss Trunchbull, are excellent.SHChristmas Day, 1pm, BBC OneJawsView image in fullscreenStill a work of remarkable tension … Roy Scheider in Jaws.Photograph: Pictorial Press /AlamyIt is right and proper to end the50th-anniversary year of Jawswith a special screening on terrestrial television. After all, this is probably how most of us encountered the film in the first place. Incredibly, though the shark itself has now fully aged into kitsch, Jaws has lost none of its power. It is still a work of remarkable tension, and John Williams’s score still manages to fill you with instant terror. The mayor’s Johnsonian insistence on carrying on as normal in the face of obvious doom is just as maddening as it ever was, too. A classic for a reason. A making-of documentary follows straight after.SHChristmas Day, 9.15pm, BBC TwoNotting HillView image in fullscreenNever bettered … Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant in Notting Hill.Photograph: AllstarNotting Hillis arguably the pinnacle of the entire romcom genre. The storyline you will remember; Hugh Grant (playing a regular old bookshop owner in west London) falls in love with Julia Roberts (to all intents and purposes playing herself). But their differing statuses, and the attention of a clamouring media, work to drive them apart. However, on rewatching you’ll be struck by just how pin-sharp Richard Curtis’s dialogue is, and how it manages to fling the film forward even when the pacing starts to dawdle. Much imitated, never bettered.SHChristmas Day, 11.15pm, Channel 4The Rocky Horror Picture ShowView image in fullscreenWhat a classic … Tim Curry in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Sportsphoto/AllstarRare is the film that can outpace a reputation as a cult classic and simply become a classic, butThe Rocky Horror Picture Showis exactly that. A strait-laced couple enter the bizarre world of scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter and his muscular creation Rocky. In the space of a single evening they encounter musical numbers, sci-fi pastiche, horror, comedy and debauched excess.

From the My Lai massacre in Vietnam to Watergate to the Abu Ghraib prison abuses in Iraq, Hersh has been the driving force in revealing some of the biggest US scandals in modern history. He does get things wrong, as this documentary makes clear, and he’s a hard man to warm to, but it’s obvious that the struggle for accountability and transparency is far from over.SWBoxing Day, NetflixSinnersView image in fullscreenA runaway success … Michael B Jordan and Miles Caton in Sinners.Photograph: Warner Bros PicturesFilms like Ryan Coogler’sSinnersdon’t come along very often, especially now. A period vampire movie about the Mississippi delta in the 1930s that functions both as broad entertainment and an allegory about white appropriation of Black culture, Sinners was at once a critical darling and a runaway financial success. This might be down to how unashamedly sexy it is, or it might be down to its wildly good soundtrack. Either way, it’s a sign that people will still show up for quality projects.SHBoxing Day, 11.25am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere"

Please do not strike at this moment of crisis for the NHSRowena MasonandAndrew GregoryFri 12 Dec 2025 19.00 CETLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 00.47 CETShareKeir Starmer has said it is “frankly beyond belief” that resident doctors would strike during the NHS’s worst moment since the pandemic, in remarks that risk inflaming tensions with medical staff.Writing for the Guardian, the prime minister made an outspoken attack on the strikes planned for 17-22 December for placing “the NHS and patients who need it in grave danger”.Starmer’s intervention comes a day after Wes Streeting argued the strikes could overwhelm theNHS, increasing pressure on resident doctors to accept his offer of more training places, but no extra money.The British Medical Association said the government “should not be scaremongering” and making the public think “that the NHS will not be able to look after them and their loved ones”.Dr Jack Fletcher, chair of the BMA resident doctors committee, said ministers were “laying the blame for the failings of the NHS to cope with an outbreak of flu at the feet of resident doctors”.Fletcher said he would meet Streeting any time “to try to agree a deal to avert next week’s strikes” but it was “cruel and calculated” for the health secretary to fail to have any engagement outside strikes and then come to the BMA “with an offer he knows is poor and expects us to just accept it within 24 hours”.An indicative online ballot of resident doctors, formerly known as junior doctors, is due to close on Monday morning.“I am a Labour prime minister, who believes in workers’ right to strike,” said Starmer. “But let’s be clear when it comes to the strikes planned by resident doctors next week. They should not happen. They are reckless.”The prime minister added: “Right now, resident doctors’ colleagues will be cancelling operations, cancelling their Christmas leave and preparing for this coming storm. The idea that strikes could still take place in this context is frankly beyond belief.”Strikes could collapse flu-hit NHS amid worst crisis since Covid, says StreetingRead moreWith theNHS saying it is facing a “worst-case scenario”with an unprecedented wave of super flu, Streeting, the health secretary, has cautioned that the strikes could be the Jenga piece that causes collapse.Doctors and charities also said on Friday they were growing increasingly concerned about hospitalisations among older people in particular, even though case numbers are highest among the young.Tony O’Sullivan, a co-chair of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign group, said it was “the height of irresponsible behaviour” for the government to “go to war with doctors and the BMA amidst the flu epidemic”.“The government cannot pretend that they had no warning, that they didn’t see it coming,” he said.Fletcher said doctors did not have to go on strike if Streeting “puts an offer on the table that we can accept – not necessarily enough to end the dispute overall, but enough to stop the strike, we will do just that. Instead of offers to extend a mandate and talking of strikes in January, his focus should be on ending strikes altogether and working with resident doctors to do just that. We don’t need sticking plaster fixes; we need workable sustainable solutions.”The BMA claims Streeting “holds all the cards to both postponing the strike and ending the dispute once and for all, but he seems more interested in political grandstanding and exploiting public fears than he does in doing anything useful that would stop the strikes”.YouGov polling conducted on Friday found that a third of people surveyed either “strongly support” or “somewhat support” resident doctors going on strike, against 58% who either “somewhat oppose” or “strongly oppose” it.View image in fullscreenResident doctors on a picket line at St Thomas’ hospital in London last month.Photograph: Guy Smallman/Getty ImagesIn his piece for the Guardian, Starmer said he was still hopeful that the strikes could be averted through the “good deal” on offer, saying his message to doctors was “simple – take it”.“The ‘super flu’ epidemic now sweeping the country is the NHS’s most precarious moment since the pandemic,” he said. “Last week, an average of 2,660 hospital beds each day were occupied by flu patients – up 55% on the week before and much higher than this time last year. And the epidemic is still growing.“Having lived through a pandemic, we all know what this means. It means a battle. On hospital wards across the country, NHS staff will now be working around the clock to make sure patients get the care they need and the NHS stays above water.”Internal projections suggest between 5,000 and 8,000 flu patients could be in hospital next week, which could top the previous highest record of 5,400. At this point in 2024, the figure was 1,861. In 2023, it was 402.Antonia Ho, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Glasgow’s Centre for Virus Research and an honorary consultant at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lanarkshire, said: “Although the highest case numbers are in those aged five to 14 and 15 to 44, the steepest rise in hospitalisation is in older age groups, aged over 75, who are most vulnerable to flu complications and poor outcome[s].”At the same time, almost three in 10 people aged over 65 are still not vaccinated against the flu, with the rate standing at 71.7%, according to the UKHealthSecurity Agency.Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, said: “Australia has just had its worst flu season ever and that’s a powerful warning to us here in the UK to take care and get vaccinated if we can.“Sometimes we talk about ‘having the flu’ when really, it’s just a cold, but the influenza or flu virus that’s circulating here now is a much more serious health threat than that, especially if we are older, have underlying health conditions or compromised immunity.”Abrahams said the rapid rise in flu cases was “alarming”, particularly because older people were not able to fight off seasonal viruses and infections as easily as others.“This means flu can lead to complications and the need for admission to hospital in severe cases. Older people in poor health can deteriorate rapidly if they are left untreated, so early recognition is vital.”Abrahams expressed hope that resident doctors would drop their plans to strike for five days from 7am on 17 December.“This winter looks like being an especially worrying one for many older people since along with the upsurge in flu there is the possibility of another strike by resident doctors next week – the last thing anyone in ill health needs.“Against this miserable context we hope and pray that the resident doctors decide not to exercise their right to withdraw their labour and that the revised deal offered by the government brings about a permanent end to a dispute that’s been going on for far too long,” she said.Flu outbreaks are hitting pupil attendance and school staffing, a union said on Friday, after a number of schools were disrupted by illness.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “We have seen flu outbreaks in schools having an impact on both pupil attendance and staffing levels.” Schools would do what they could to reduce the risk of infection spreading, he added, and closing was a last resort, though there had been “some isolated cases”.Explore more on these topicsNHSKeir StarmerHealth policyFluHospitalsIndustrial actionTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The batch also includes more photographs of the yellow dentist’s office that was featured in a similar release of images and videos by the committee on 3 December, as well as a bathroom, a “Trumpkin” (a pumpkin decorated as Donald Trump), and Epstein in a bathtub.As Epstein files release looms, questions abound on what happens next: ‘Possibilities are endless’Read moreThree of the images feature Trump’s former political adviserSteve Bannon– two of them with Epstein, and one with Allen in a social setting.The photographs were released without context or captions, but according to Robert Garcia, the California Democrat and ranking member of the oversight committee, they raise more questions about Epstein’s connections to wealthy individuals.“It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors ofJeffrey Epsteinand his powerful friends,” he said in a statement.“These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth.”The White House responded to the release in a statement accusing Democrats of selectively “cherry-picking” the photographs for political purposes and “to try and create a false narrative”.“The Democrat hoax against President Trump has been repeatedly debunked,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said, insisting that “the Trump administration has done more for Epstein’s victims than Democrats ever have by repeatedly calling for transparency, releasing thousands of pages of documents, and calling for further investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends.”A bill to release all files held by the government in relation to Epsteinpassed the House and Senate last monthdespite strong opposition from Trump. The justice department has until 19 December to comply. Hundreds of thousands of documents are expected to be released. A federal judge alsoruled on Tuesdaythat the department can publicly release investigative materials from a sex-trafficking case againstGhislaine Maxwell,Epstein’s longtime confidante, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence over the charges.Trump features in three of the 19 images initially released on Friday. In one, he is photographed with six women, some in Hawaii dress, and whose faces are blacked out. In the second, he is seen alongside Epstein listening to a woman with blond hair who appears to be sharing a joke. In the third, apparently taken aboard an aircraft, he is sitting alongside another woman with longer blond hair, and whose face is also blacked out.View image in fullscreenJeffrey Epstein and Woody Allen in a partially redacted photo released by House oversight Democrats.Photograph: House oversight DemocratsThe president’s face in cartoon form, and the words “I’m huuuuge”, appear in another image on square packets with a sign advertising a “Trump condom” for $4.50. The novelty items wereon saleprior to Trump’s first election win in 2016, and earned a place in the Smithsonian Institute’spolitical satire collection.Trump wasclose friends with Epstein for 15 years, and called him “a terrific guy”, before insisting he fell out with him and booted him as a member of his private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.The new photograph of the former Prince Andrew, meanwhile, shows him in a business suit alongside Gates. Cropped from the picture released Friday is King Charles III, then the Prince of Wales, who was in the original news wire photograph taken at a business summit in London in 2018. Mountbatten-Windsor wasstripped of his royal status and titlesin October over his dealings with Epstein.Epstein does not appear in the original or cropped versions, and there is no explanation why the photograph was part of the Epstein estate.The image of Clinton, which the former president looks to have autographed, shows him posing next to Epstein and Maxwell, whowas convictedin part for procuring teenage girls for Epstein and his associates to abuse.A collection of sex toys, including restraints, a catalog and a guide to the Japanese art of shibari (a form of bondage), appear in three more. Epstein was accused of hosting sex parties for clients at his homes in New York, Florida and at his private Caribbean island retreat, Little Saint James in the US Virgin Islands.The former treasury secretary Larry Summers and Epstein’s former lawyer Alan Dershowitz, appear in two other images, the latter in a previously published news wire photograph from 2004.The photograph of British billionaire Branson on a beach with Epstein also features Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway, according to the Boston Globe, which said Kamen did not return a request for comment.An inquiry to Branson’s office was not immediately returned.NBC Newsreported no immediate response from any of the unidentifiable individuals in the photographs, all of whom have denied wrongdoing, the outlet said.In a statement, the Democratic members of the House oversight and government reform committee promised that more photographs would be released in the coming days from the batch it had just received from the Epstein estate.“This latest production contains over 95,000 photos, including images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein,” it said.“Images also include thousands of photographs of women and Epstein properties. Committee Democrats are reviewing the full set of photos and will continue to release photos to the public in the days and weeks ahead. Committee Democrats are committed to protecting the identities of the survivors.”A statement from the committee’s Republican majority replicated the accusations in the White House statement of “cherry-picking” and selectively censoring the photographs.“Democrats’ hoax against President Trump has been completely debunked. Nothing in the documents we’ve received shows any wrongdoing. Ranking Member Robert Garcia and Oversight Democrats should be ashamed of this disgusting behavior of putting politics above justice for the survivors,” it said.Friday’s release is the latest of a number of similar recent events. Last week several still images and videos were publishedof Epstein’s Caribbean island, including bedrooms, a living room, what appeared to be a dentist’s office, an office or library, and a chalkboard on which several unexplained words were written, such as “fin”, “intellectual”, “deception” and “power”.The New York Timesreportedthat Epstein’s last girlfriend was a dentist who shared an office with one of his shell companies.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

His medical team will assess how much longer he will require treatment to protect and prioritise his continued recovery.In a prerecorded video message on Friday for Channel 4’s Stand Up toCancernight, Charles spoke of how early detection had transformed his own journey and how early diagnosis could give “invaluable time to medical teams – and, to their patients, the precious gift of hope”.Without disclosing what type of cancer he has, Charles said: “Today, I am able to share with you the good news that thanks to early diagnosis, effective intervention and adherence to ‘doctors’ orders’, my own schedule of cancer treatment can be reduced in the new year.“This milestone is both a personal blessing and a testimony to the remarkable advances that have been made in cancer care in recent years; testimony that I hope may give encouragement to the 50% of us who will be diagnosed with the illness at some point in our lives.”Speaking of the importance of early diagnosis, he said: “I know, too, what a difference it has made in my own case, enabling me to continue leading a full and active life, even while undergoing treatment.”But he expressed concern that at least 9 million people in the UK were not up to date with the cancer screenings available to them.He was therefore “encouraged” to learn about a newnational screening checker, launched earlier this month, which shows who is eligible for existing breast, bowel and cervical cancer screening programmes.A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: “His majesty has responded exceptionally well to treatment and his doctors advise that ongoing measures will now move into a precautionary phase. This position will be continuously monitored and reviewed to protect and prioritise his continued recovery.“As the king has said, this milestone on his recovery journey is ‘a great personal blessing’.”Charles is said to remain profoundly grateful to all those involved in caring for patients, in particular to his own medical team. “He sends his particular good wishes to all those affected by cancer and will continue to hold them and their loved ones in his thoughts and prayers,” said the spokesperson.The king was approached to lend support to the online screening tool and thought it a “fitting moment to provide a brief update on the positive trajectory of his own continued recovery”.The spokesperson said: “The king has taken great comfort and encouragement from being able to continue leading a full and active life throughout his treatment, while always heeding the advice of his medical team. His ability to uphold all of his state duties, and to continue with public engagements and overseas tours, has helped greatly with the positive mindset that, as many families will know, is such a vital part of the recovery journey.“The advice from cancer experts is that, in his determination to support the whole cancer community, it is preferable that his majesty does not address his own specific condition but rather speaks to those affected by all forms of the disease.”The king’s cancer diagnosis was announced in February 2024 as he was treated for benign prostate enlargement, though the palace has confirmed he does not have prostate cancer. His message should not be interpreted as a view on therecent debate over a national screening programmefor prostate cancer, it is understood, and the palace consulted the government before issuing the message.The prime minister said he was “glad” the king’s cancer treatment was to be reduced.In a post on social media, Keir Starmer said: “A powerful message from His Majesty The King. I know I speak for the entire country when I say how glad I am that his cancer treatment will be reduced in the new year. Early cancer screening saves lives.”The screening checker has been developed by Cancer Research UK and Channel 4 for the Stand Up to Cancer campaign to help people understand which NHS cancer screening programmes they are eligible for.Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, of which Charles is patron, said: “We know that when public figures speak openly about their cancer diagnosis, it can prompt others to check in on their health and speak to a GP if something is worrying them. We wish his majesty well with his continued recovery.”Explore more on these topicsKing Charles IIICancerHealthMonarchyCancer researchnewsShareReuse this content"

This, it notes, poses a specific threat to Denmark, which used to ruleGreenlandas a colony and continues to control its foreign and security policy.“The increased great power competition in theArctichas significantly increased international attention to the region,” it said. “This applies in particular to the United States’ increasing interest in Greenland and its importance to US national security.”It adds: “At the same time, the attention increases the threat from espionage, including cyber espionage, and attempts to further influence all parts of the kingdom of Denmark.” Greenland remains part of the Danish commonwealth or kingdom.Last week, the new US National Security Strategy policy document, with an introduction signed by Trump,claimed that Europe faces “civilisational erasure” within the next two decades as a result of migrationand EU integration, arguing that the US must “cultivate resistance” within the continent to “Europe’s current trajectory”.It came at a time of already heightened tension between the US and Denmark after Trump’s repeated assertions over the past year that he wants to take control of Greenland.Earlier this year, vice-president JD Vance visited US military base Pituffik and accused Denmark of having“not done a good job”in Greenland. In August, an allegedUS influence campaignin Greenland resulted in Denmarksummoningthe US charge d’affaires. In a damning symbol of the changed dynamic between Denmark and the US, traditionally its largest and most important ally, it was recently revealed that Copenhagen had established a“night watch”tasked with monitoring Trump’s unpredictable words and actions while Denmark sleeps.Despite the report’s warnings, the head of the DDIS, Thomas Ahrenkiel, said that the US was still Denmark’s closest ally.“The United States has been and continues to be the guarantor of Europe’s security through its involvement in the transatlantic alliance, its presence inEuropeand through the American nuclear umbrella,” he told broadcaster DR.“The United States is leveraging economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.It also warns of the uncertainty around the role of the US as a “guarantor of European security”, which it said will increase Russia’s “willingness to intensify its hybrid attacks against Nato”. It adds: “The military threat fromRussiato Nato will increase, even though there is currently no threat of a regular military attack against the kingdom of Denmark.”Explore more on these topicsDenmarkNatoUS foreign policyGreenlandCyberwarEspionageEuropeShareReuse this content"

The organisation, once a little-known part of international financial plumbing that is now in the spotlight, has no say on how the frozen funds are used.EU has a plan to use frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine – how will it work?Read moreThe lawsuit, being filed in a Moscow court, claims Euroclear’s “illegal actions” had caused “damage” to the central bank’s ability to manage funds and securities.Euroclear declined to comment, but a spokesperson said it was “currently fighting more than 100 legal claims in Russia”.Last week,the European Commission proposed a €90bn (£79bn) loanfor Ukraine, secured against Russian assets immobilised in the EU since its full-scale invasion. But the plan has been blocked by Belgium, which fears a cascade of lawsuits from Moscow and the seizure of Belgian assets in the country.Belgium’s prime ministerBart De Wever met Keir Starmer in Downing Streeton Friday for long-planned talks on the EU-UK reset, migration and the Russian assets.De Wever’s spokesperson said they had discussed “the possible use of the value of immobilised Russian sovereign assets” and “agreed to continue to work closely to make progress on this complex issue”.A Downing Street spokesperson issued a near-identical statement, saying: “It was clear, they agreed, that keeping up the economic pressure on Russia and putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position would remain the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace.”View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer held talks with his Belgian counterpart on Friday.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesThe meeting comes ahead of an EU summit next week, when leaders have promised decisions on funding Ukraine in 2026-27, amid warnings that Kyiv will run out of money next spring to fund its defence and pay doctors and teachers.EU officials believe the proposed €90bn loan will meet two-thirds of Ukraine’s financial needs for the next two years, and expect Kyiv’s other “international partners” to provide the rest.The Belgian government says it must have guarantees from EU partners that it will not be on the hook for a multibillion-euro bill if it is sued by Russia.De Wever has previously described the proposal as “fundamentally wrong” and argued it would violate international law and endanger the stability of the euro currency.In a sign of tensions around the plan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Malta and Italy said only EU leaders should decide on use of the immobilised assets. In a statement announcing support for the emergency powers clause to freeze the funds indefinitely on Friday, they urged EU countries “to continue exploring and discussing alternative options in line with EU and international law”.Belgium argues the EU should borrow money on capital markets to fund Ukraine, secured against unallocated funds (headroom) in the EU budget. But many member states are loath to take out more common debt.Germany, usually a champion of economic orthodoxy, sees the frozen assets plan as the best option and has pledged to provide one-quarter (€50bn) of needed guarantees for Belgium.EU officials argue that the legal risk to Euroclear, and therefore Belgium, would be limited.Under the complex scheme, the EU would borrow cash from Euroclear, then loan the funds to Ukraine, while Russia remains the legal owner of the assets. Ukraine would only repay the money if and when it received reparations from Moscow for colossal damage inflicted during the war.The UK, which hosts €27bn (£23bn) of frozen Russian assets, supports the idea and expects some, but not all, G7 countries to move forward with a similar plan, following a decision on the Euroclear-held assets. US participation in the scheme is less certain, although it holds only a modest €4bn (£3.5bn) in immobilised assets.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionRussiaUkraineEuropeEuropean CommissionnewsShareReuse this content"

The age of two-party politics is dead.”Meanwhile, the Times reported that, according to internal figures, the Labour party’s paid-up membership had fallen below 250,000.Mainstream, the centre-left group backed by Andy Burnham, said the Labour’s “plummeting membership” showed that its “top-down model has failed”.Its interim council said in a statement: “To transform Britain and defeat the far-right, Labour needs a grassroots movement in every community. The answer is to democratise, open up, and empower members. A vibrant, member-powered Labour party is the only way to win – for our party and the country.”Labour does not publish a running tally of its membership figures, disclosing them only once a year as part of its annual reporting.Party accounts published in August showed in the year ending December 2024 it had 333,235 members, down from 370,450 at the end of 2023.The numbers have fallen over consecutive years from a high of more than 500,000 under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.A Labour party spokesperson said: “Our membership figures are published in our annual report. We do not give a running commentary on them throughout the year.”The apparent increasing number of membership contributions to Reform will boost its electoral war chest alongside a recent spate of donations.The party received a £9m donation in August from the Thailand-based businessman Christopher Harborne, Electoral Commission records recently revealed. The sum was the biggest single donation in modern history to a political party from a living person.Farage insisted Harborne wanted “nothing in return” for the donation and said he was “very, very comfortable and confident” in the source of the cash.The Greens haveseen their membership swell fromabout 70,000 to more than 180,000 since the party’s new leader, Zack Polanski, was elected in September.This suggests the Greens have overtaken theConservatives, whose membership numbers have dwindled in recent years and now stand at about 123,000.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsReform UKNigel FarageKemi BadenochKeir StarmerGreen partyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

It had already been reissued once before, in 2016, as the Snow Queen Edition. Nevertheless, the Fully Wrapped version counts as a new album in chart terms, and so continues a non-consecutive run of No 1s that began in 1988, when Minogue’s self-titled debut spent six weeks at the top.Overtaking Abba, Coldplay, Michael Jackson, Elton John and Queen in the chart-topper list, she also draws level with Rod Stewart and U2, but is still some way off joint leaders the Beatles and Robbie Williams, who both have 15 No 1 albums to their names. Williams will be hoping to become the all-time leader in February with the release of his forthcoming studio album, Britpop.Minogue is also in the singles chart this week with Xmas, one of the retailer Amazon’s now yearly exclusive Christmas songs. Xmas is at No 16, though will undoubtedly rise during next week’s race for the Christmas No 1 as CD and vinyl editions are released today, sales of which contribute greatly to chart positions in the streaming era.Taking an early lead in the race is Wham!’s Last Christmas, which is this week’s No 1 single, displacing Taylor Swift’s The Fate of Ophelia, which spent seven non-consecutive weeks at the top. Last Christmas never made it to No 1 when it was first released in 1984, but finally reached the top in January 2021, and has topped the chart each year since, becoming the Christmas No 1 for the past two years.Its biggest annual rival in the nation’s festive affections, Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas Is You, is at No 3 this week, while Brenda Lee’s Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree is at No 4. Kelly Clarkson’s Underneath the Tree underlines its status as the most popular new-school Christmas song, getting its first Top 5 placing since its 2013 release. There are 20 Christmas songs overall in the Top 40.But these classics will have new rivals for the Christmas No 1 next week, as a number of charity and novelty singles enter the race. Together for Palestine, the humanitarian aid projecthelmed by Brian Enoand others, has released Lullaby, featuring Palestinian artists alongside British stars including Celeste and Neneh Cherry.Line of Duty actor Vicky McClure has teamed with jacket potato brand SpudBros for Brighter Than the Night, to raise money for her charity Our Dementia Choir, while Bob the Drag Queen has recorded Giant Armadillo to support conservation efforts for the armoured mammal, and home care service Visiting Angels has overseen a cover of Robbie Williams’ Angels to benefit care workers.Less profoundly, Denise Welch has released Slayyy Bells, a tie-in with confectionary brand Celebrations, in which the Loose Women star and “hun” icon is paired with a Charli xcx-esque trashy dance track.But British pop singer Raye could cause an upset with her un-Christmassy tale of singleton frustration Where Is My Husband?, which is at No 2 this week. If so, it would be the first non-festive or charity song to be Christmas No 1 since Ed Sheeran’s Perfect in 2017.The UK Christmas No 1 will be announced at 4pm on Friday 19 December.Explore more on these topicsKylie MinogueUK chartsPop and rockChristmasnewsShareReuse this content"

The Tory leader was, her allies say, a little bemused. But they were clear about what the approach meant: cut-through.Badenoch’s leadership got off to a poor start. Still reeling from the Tories’ worst general election defeat, she took over a diminished and disheartened party, which was languishing in the polls and facing an existential threat in the form of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK.For months, impatient Conservative insiders shared concerns about her political strategy, her inner team and the struggle to get a grip on the party’s dire finances and broken machinery, as well as her visceral dislike of the media and combative demeanour.By the time of her first party conference as leader in early October, many MPs feared the Tories were drifting into irrelevance. They privately agreed the clock was ticking on Badenoch, with her first anniversary in the job the moment when, under party rules, she could first face a leadership challenge.But despite the Tory party’s reputation for regicide, the challenge did not come. Instead, almost six weeks after that moment of potential peril, her own side finally appears to be warming to her. There are even signs the public is starting to give her a hearing.While overall Tory poll ratings remain stubbornly low,a More in Common poll this weekput Badenoch’s approval rating at -14. Though still significantly down on when she became leader, it is nearly level with Farage and the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, and well above the prime minister, Keir Starmer, languishing at -48.What changed? Tory insiders say the turning point was Badenoch’s confident performance at the party’s annual conference, includinga policy-heavy speechdesigned to improve her standing with members. It was billed – rightly – as a make-or-break moment.It probably helped thatRobert Jenrick, the nakedly ambitious shadow justice secretary, emerged from conference a diminished figure, after his complaint about “not seeing another white face” in part of Birmingham led to accusations of toxic nationalism.One Conservative MP who was previously sceptical about Badenoch’s chances of hanging on said the conference had changed their view. “It boosted morale among activists, it settled MPs’ nerves and, most importantly, it gave her some confidence, which you can now see in prime minister’s questions [PMQs].“It has taken some time, but she has worked out how she wants to do opposition. We’re going into the new year in a much better place than we were a few months ago, let alone a year ago.”Badenoch – who in government had a reputation for abrasive belligerence, but who in opposition had been accused by some in her party of being slightly invisible – appears to have rediscovered her fighting spirit.In particular, they singled out her attacks on Peter Mandelson and Angela Rayner – both of whom ultimately lost their jobs – andher rather brutal response to Rachel Reeves at the budget, with polls suggesting the economy is the Tories’ strongest card in an otherwise weak hand.“It was the budget response that cut through everywhere. I kept going to events and people would say, ‘Your Kemi is doing well’,” one shadow minister said.“My colleagues have noticed the difference, too. They’re now starting to see her as a strong, confident leader. Starmer has been unbelievably patronising to her over the past year, but even he can see she has got her mojo.”The upturn in party mood, they added, was helped by the impressions that the Labour government were doing “astonishingly badly”.Badenoch, who had faced criticism for ceding the spotlight to Farage, has also noticeably stepped up her visibility, including regular press conferences and attending events with donors and party members across the country, as well as post-PMQs lunches with MPs.Tory insiders suggest that changes to the top team have helped, with the departure of some of her closest allies from government and the promotion of more experienced hands, including former aides to Michael Gove.Others, however, say this is overstated. “That is just the new lot blaming the old lot and puffing themselves up,” said one shadow minister. “The reality is she has got more confident and at the same time Keir Starmer has been making mistakes. It also helps that she has learned to punch Labour’s bruises rather than trying to set the political agenda from opposition.”Many, however, credit the shadow minister Neil O’Brien with bolstering her credibility on the economy. It was O’Brien, for example, who drew up the list of proposed spending cuts in her conference speech. John Glen, the former chief secretary to the Treasury, has also joined her team, while the ex-MP and television presenter Rob Butler helps with presentation.Badenoch’s performance has helped ease concerns that more Tory MPs could follow Danny Kruger out the door to Reform. “The whips are more relaxed than they have been for a while,” said one, even though grassroots party members continue to flock to Farage.She faces other challenges, too. While most Tory MPs are sanguine about the slow pace of building up a policy platform, this has brought confusion at times, as shadow ministerial teams fill the vacuum with their own ideas.Most notable wasa draft bill on migration, which could have led to many thousands of people being retrospectively stripped of their right to live in the UK. It took more than a week beforeBadenoch disowned it.Will she survive? The odds – and the polls – remain stacked against her. The May local elections are likely to make her position even less secure. But despite that, some Tory MPs now think Badenoch is safe.“I don’t see a leadership challenge happening at any point, now. It’s baked in that we’re going to do disastrously in the May election, but the government are likely to do worse,” said one.Others counsel caution, however. One party official said: “There’s no doubt there has been a bit of a Badenoch bounce, and she is doing well at PMQs, but we need to keep it in proportion – this is one step of many.“It’s still not clear if we have a strategic plan to take on Reform – beyond maybe with the economy. Kemi might be devising one, but it remains to be seen if she stays long enough to see it come to fruition.”Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, agreed. “Performatively, clearly she is doing better, but although her personal rating seems to have gone up, the party’s rating is still stuck under 20%. And, in the end, it’s the latter that matters. If that measurement doesn’t improve, I don’t think they’re going to be any more generous towards her because she occasionally wins PMQs.“It’s very difficult for a party that was in power for as long as the Tories were – and who crashed the economy and starved public services – to overturn people’s negative impressions in just one parliamentary term,” he added.Explore more on these topicsConservativesKemi BadenochRobert JenricknewsShareReuse this content"

But, when I asked drummer Nick Mason how he would rank the album in their catalogue, he slotted it below the set that came next, Wish You Were Here. Speaking of Dark Side, he said, “the idea of it is almost more attractive than the individual songs on it. I feel slightly the same about Sgt. Pepper. It’s an amazing album that taught us a hell of a lot, but the individual parts are not quite as exciting, or as good, as some of the other Beatles’ albums.”By contrast, he says of Wish You Were Here, “there’s something in the general atmosphere it generates – the space of it, the air around it, that’s really special,” he said. “It’s one of the reasons I view it so affectionately.”Simon, you crazy diamond: Armitage poem marks 50 years of Pink Floyd’s Wish You Were HereRead moreIt’s hardly the only one. As Mason spoke by Zoom from his office in London – a crowded space he jauntily refers to as “more a toy shop than an office” – he talked about everything that went into making an album that became a classic of its own, making it fully worthy of a new box set elaboration for this, its 50th anniversary. The set not only features the obligatory remixed versions of all the songs from original album but also revealing demos, significantly altered versions of key tracks, and formative live recordings from the tour that led up to its creation.For Mason, the best part of the set is the chance to listen to it from front to back in its vinyl version. “I had lost that thing of sitting down and listening to an entire album properly,” he said. “It’s always streaming. The big take away for me from the vinyl is the quality of the recording, which is a credit to Abbey Road and the technical people there. I remember how meticulous they were, and by God, that paid off 50 years later!”The way the album as a whole pays off strikes Mason as particularly surprising given the fact that, for a protracted period, they didn’t think it would come off at all. “We had major false starts,” he said. “Several, in fact.”View image in fullscreenNick Mason.Photograph: Tracey Kraft/Sony Music EntertainmentThe cushion provided by Dark Side’s gargantuan popularity gave the band the time to indulge that throw-it-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks approach. Small wonder Mason laughingly described their mood at the time as one of “relaxed desperation.”After all, as much good will as Dark Side had bought them, its outsized success put them in the position of having to create an equally momentous chaser. This, at a time when everything about the band was in the process of change, from their working relationship to who they were as people. “We weren’t the lovable mop tops anymore,” Mason said. “We were around 30 then. Some of us had kids. We began to have lives outside of making records and going on tour. And that’s going to make a difference.”In fact, it affected the entire recording process. “When we did Dark Side, there were four of us in the studio most of the time,” he said. “With Wish You Were Here, we came and went. If it got a bit boring, you’d go away for the weekend and leave Dave to carry on with the guitar parts.”That explains why Wish You Were Here is the first Pink Floyd album in which Mason had no co-writing credits. By then the writing had become less collaborative in general. “It was more a case of Roger bringing in something that’s ready to go,” Mason said.Proof can be found on the new set by a demo Waters made of Welcome to the Machine, here simply titled Machine Song. The bulk of the final song is already apparent from what Waters created himself, though the demo also features some eerie/cool sound effects that didn’t make the official cut. Way before such songs were even formed, the group went down a daft, but fascinating, rabbit hole. The original idea was to construct the music entirely from random objects, like rubber bands, wine glasses and brooms – no formal instruments allowed, a notion inspired by the work of artists like John Cage. It wouldn’t be the first time Pink Floyd banished conventional instruments. On their 1969 album Ummagumma, one track was constructed entirely from manipulated mouth noises provided by Waters, designed to imitate the sounds of various animals. They called their later attempt in that direction The Household Objects Project, an idea that “went absolutely nowhere”, Mason said.Even so, two of its tracks eventually found their way out. One, titled Wine Glasses, appears again on the new set. Some glassy sounds from those sessions also made their way to the final mix of Shine on You Crazy Diamond. After the Household Objects idea went south, the band had another wacky notion. “We were individually left in the studio to put down some sounds, then the others would come in and put down some sounds on the same tape without reference to the original thing put down,” Mason said. “Frankly, it was madness.”A far better approach he now thinks, would have been to continue touring with Dark Side for some time rather than rushing back to the studio. It wasn’t until months into the recording process that formal songs finally began to emerge. At that point, by April 1975, the band returned to the road, performing the best parts they’d developed so far. The new set features sixteen tracks from that tour, including two songs that ended up on the final album, including Shine on and Have a Cigar, along with formative runs at the songs Raving and Drooling and You’ve Got to be Crazy, which didn’t find a studio home until their Animals album in 1977 under the titles Sheep and Dogs, respectively. To Mason, playing untested material before an audience has “an enormous benefit. The problem with recording is that the tendency is to record it to the point where you’ve got it right and then you stop,” he said, “What works far better is to not only get it right, but to develop it. Only paranoia about bootlegging stopped us from doing that later.” (Ironically, the 1975 live parts of the set comes from a bootleg).Another rare track on the set unearths a take on the title song that features an extended jazz violin solo from Stephane Grappelli, barely a bit of which made the official version. Initially, the band also tried to use the esteemed classical violinist Yehudi Menuhin on the track but backed off because, as Mason explains, “Yehudi absolutely could not improvise, even when pushed by Stephane. It was hard to understand why.”All told, the formal recording process of Wish You Were Here, following those false starts, took six months. Regardless of the mess they’d started with, the final work wasn’t only highly focused, it also became their most personal statement ever. While Dark Side explored the mysteries of the inner life, this album dealt with the real world the band now found themselves in. Two of its songs – Welcome to the Machine and Have a Cigar – railed against the greed and manipulations of the music business, using that as a metaphor for the individual crushed at the hands of the system. Those tracks were matched to a pair that found the band confronting their own past (Shine On and the title song). The latter reflected the oft told, and bizarre, story of their estranged, mentally unwell original leader, Syd Barrett, showing up unannounced in the studio at one of the sessions looking disheveled and disoriented. “No one had the slightest idea that was going to happen, or how he even knew we were working there that day,” Mason said. “It wassoodd.”The emotional fall-out from that resulted in Waters refocusing lyrics he had already begun writing on Barrett’s lost promise. Mason believes the reason those songs, as well as the two about the music business, wound up resonating so deeply with listeners is because their true subject is “distance and absence”.View image in fullscreenPink FloydPhotograph: Storm Thorgerson/Sony Music EntertainmentTo Mason, those themes offered “a kind of prelude to the thinking on The Wall,” a classic expression of alienation that became another mega-blockbuster for the band. It’s interesting that songs which complain about the treatment of artists in the music industry arose just then, given that the band had just experienced an astounding windfall of success with Dark Side. Mason credits a key part of Dark Side’s commercial impact to the marketing savvy of EMI’s label chief, Bhasker Menon – ironic since, by the time of its breakthrough, the band had already signed a new contract with CBS, thus leaving their greatest benefactor in the lurch. “In many ways we behaved far worse than the record company,” Mason said with a laugh.The album the band finally delivered to CBS matched those highly emotional lyrics to songs dominated by explorative instrumental sections. “In that aspect, this really is a musician’s record,” Mason said. He thinks that may be why guitarist David Gilmour and the late keyboardist Rick Wright have called Wish their favorite Floyd album. Mason loves that it showcases so much of Wright’s visionary keyboard work. “If ever there was someone who was underrated and under-sung,” its Wright, Mason said.Matching the impact of the music was the album’s cover, which famously featured a man on fire. The idea, according to Aubrey “Po” Powell, co-creator of the design company behind it, Hipgnosis, was to provide a visual corollary to Waters’ incendiary lyrics. “George Hardie, one of our collaborators, said at a company meeting, ‘people get burned in deals in the industry all the time,” Powell said. “Then Storm (Thorgerson, his partner in Hipgnosis) said, ‘I got it! It will be two businessmen shaking hands with one being burnt in the deal.”View image in fullscreenThe cover of Wish You Were Here.Photograph: f8 archive/AlamyBecause Photoshop was years from being invented, however, that meant they would have to hire a stuntman and set him on fire for real. The one they found, Ronnie Rondell Jr, told Powell it was an insanely dangerous stunt since he would have to stand still, and the slightest breeze would turn him into a human blowtorch. Luckily, on the day of the shoot, the air was dead still so, after enduring 15 takes with Powell shooting as fast as he could, he got the shot, leaving only a singe of Rondell’s eyebrows and moustache as a consequence. When Rondell died last year, the headlines all identified him as the man from the Wish You Were Here cover. “Ronnie always told me, ‘I’ve done thousands of stunts but the one thing everybody remembers is that damn cover,’” Powell said, with a laugh.The flaming image was one of several striking pieces in the package. Another, featuring a red scarf wafting through the air, extends the album’s theme of absence. “That was a nod to Syd Barrett’s mental state,” Powell said. “How much is he present or not present?”The notion to offer fans multiple images in the package was to “add to the joy” of it, said Powell. That’s also why they got the impish idea to shield the cover in black plastic, a move that was also meant to underscore the theme of absence. At the same time, the packaging was “supposed to be like a Christmas present where you don’t know what’s inside”, Powell said. “Of course, the record company hated it because we were covering up all these expensive images. But the band had total creative control, so they had to back off.”For the band, such images perfectly suited the music and words they’d taken such trouble to create. “Wish You Were Here was harder work than almost any album we ever did,” Mason said. “But, at the end of the day, we came out with something that we’re still talking about today.”Wish You Were Here 50th Anniversary Deluxe Box Set is out nowExplore more on these topicsPink FloydPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Debate in New Zealand over extremely long summer breakThe country’s ‘unofficial shutdown’ has sparked a national conversation, with arguments about whether the break is affecting productivity or a vital respiteJessica O'BryanSat 13 Dec 2025 00.01 CETLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 01.33 CETShareIt sounds idyllic: weeks off work at the warmest time of the year, with relaxation mode kicking in before Christmas and little rush to return to the office until late February.But inNew Zealand, there are concerns that what’s been labelled by some an “unofficial shutdown” could be hurting the country’s productivity.Simon Bridges, the head of the Auckland Business Chamber and former National party leader, has been contributing to a national debate over the length of New Zealand’s summer holidays, telling Guardian Australia there is a view that the country “shuts down not just for Christmas and New Year but in many cases all the way through to March”.‘I’m rapt!’: meatball chants but no mania as New Zealand assembles for first Ikea storeRead more“Even when businesses are physically back at work many are ‘easing into it’, not properly working until rather later than their actual holidays,” he said.“People will say in November, ‘I will come back to you Feb/March’ hence the phrase ‘mad March’ when things actually start to feel fully on again.”The longNew Zealandsummer break has become a national conversation, with arguments emerging about whether it is too long, affecting productivity, or simply allowing employees to rest.The debate was ignited when business adviser and director Toss Grumley raised his concerns in aLinkedIn post, after getting responses in late November and early December of “let’s circle back [in] February”.“Everyone needs a break, but there seems to be this unofficial shutdown period where not a lot is done,” Grumley said.View image in fullscreenThere are fears the long break is affecting productivityPhotograph: Stuart Black/AlamyNew Zealanders are entitled to a minimum four weeks paid annual leave each year, but often choose to take most or all of their leave over summer and the Christmas period, leaving little room for rest throughout the year, and causing lower productivity levels in weeks before and after the break.Grumley said the “long window” of little productive work in February and March has negative impacts on the “already quite fragile” New Zealand economy.He says the start of the year is not the time to take “a bit of oxygen out of the economy”.“You want to keep the momentum going to get us back on track,” he said.But some argue that a long break is necessary for people exhausted by working all year. This fatigue is felt first-hand by small businesses owners, including creative director Sam Ashby, who said he feels “shattered” by November.Before moving to Wellington five years ago, Ashby lived in London, where he said there is “an even cadence of holidays”. He said combining Christmas, New Years’ Eve and summer in New Zealand means holidays become “bunched up” and don’t provide adequate rest throughout the year.Ashby says the long break can be “very disruptive” for business, where he may not see a client for two or three months, or projects may be paused for long lengths of time.The self-employed business owner says he also notices “massive” financial implications on his design business because he is not able to invoice “nearly as much” in December and January, due to the holiday period.“It’s going to take me until February/March to really get the money rolling again, so you have to have either that money saved up or you have to really tighten your belt … for small businesses, I think it’s pretty tough in that respect,” he says.The implications of a long holiday can also reach beyond New Zealand, with Bridges warning it can complicate international business relationships.“Most of Asia, including China and India are always on, communicating quickly and expecting swift responses. If you want to do business with them, you need to be in that mode as well,” he said.Are several shorter breaks the solution?Massey University professor of innovation and economics, Christoph Schumacher, speaking on NewstalkZB on Tuesday, said holidays may not be structured as well as they could be.“The question is just can we structure it better? Can we organise it better, so that not everything shuts down but we scale things. Some people stay here to keep business going as usual, some people take off, and we rotate this,” Schumacher said.Spreading holidays throughout the year could be one way to prevent fatigue and improve productivity, according to Bridges. “This could be more productive for business as well as the wider economy as people are more refreshed and rested all year round,” he says.However, Kristy Phillips, chief executive of Hospitality New Zealand, says a shorter holiday period could hit the hospitality industry.“While a shorter holiday period over our summer may help with economic productivity at a macro-level, many Kiwis like to take their mid-winter break overseas rather than having a domestic holiday, so the benefit to hospitality would likely be minimal,” she said.Bridges admits the long holiday would be “really hard to change” in New Zealand culture. “We all feel entitled to our long Kiwi summer, me included.”Chris Hipkins, the former prime minister who will be taking three weeks off over summer, agrees. When asked by New Zealand media for his take on the long break, he replied“It’s good”.“In some respects it is better for business that everybody takes their holidays all at once, rather than as we see in some other countries where they are staggered and they have to manage all of the ups and downs that go with that.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Does this mean that the DC universe is getting darker?Sat 13 Dec 2025 00.54 CETLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 01.00 CETShareSince James Gunn’s Superman became the biggest superhero movie at this summer’s box office, the world has been waiting to find out what the rest of the DCU sandpit will look like. Now, withthe debut trailer for Supergirl, we have our first proper glimpse. On this evidence, the new Kara Zor-El lives in a brave new universe of gods and monsters that reflects her loneliness and fury right back at her.Milly Alcock’s “woman of tomorrow” may not be like anyone we’ve seen on big or small screens before – which is impressive given how often Supergirl has been wheeled out over the decades. Helen Slater’s 1984 version is now widely regarded as a kind of sun-bleached Reagan-era artefact – a well-meaning but terminally camp experiment. Sasha Calle’s Supergirl in the recent The Flash looked soulful, angry and potentially gamechanging. And Melissa Benoist spent six seasons headlining a Supergirl series that was warmly received by its audience but rarely intruded into the consciousnesses of people who actually buy comic books.The new film is heavily aligned with Tom King and Bilquis Evely’s 2021-22 miniseries Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. In the comic, Kara does not arrive on Earth as a baby – she is sent off after the infantSupermanwith the explicit job of looking after him once she arrives, but her mission fails catastrophically and she is left to watch Krypton die in front of her eyes. The trailer shows us a Supergirl who seems older than her 23 years: a hard-drinking, perpetually hungover figure who does not have the luxury of Superman’s hopeful outlook; who arrived on Earth traumatised and burdened by awful memories.We know from the comic that the film will see her reluctantly enlisted by a young alien girl, Ruthye, who is seeking revenge for her murdered father. This is likely to drag Kara into a grim vendetta wherein godlike powers offer no clear moral advantage, and being the strongest person in the room turns out to be the least useful skill she has. There are also hints that the DCU’s vision of space beyond the borders of the solar system will look nothing like the one that Gunn invented with Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy films. Ruthye is a child who wants revenge, not rescue, and this is the perfect, desolate cosmos for a story that could boast heavy space western vibes.If so, this will be a sea change from the way space was dealt with in the pre-Gunn DC era, when it was seen as more of a looming threat than an actual place. Alien gods arrived to punch Earth, not wander forgotten worlds. Supergirl instead suggests a cosmos full of moral dead zones and abandoned frontiers – the kind of place where hope doesn’t travel well.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekJames GunnDC ComicsSupermancommentShareReuse this content"

Millions bought the film’s Mozart soundtrack and it remains one of the bestselling classical music albums of all time, shifting more than 6.5m copies globally, and earning 13 gold discs.It even inspired anovelty hit when Falco mixed Europop with rapin Rock Me Amadeus – the first German-language song to top the US Billboard chart (Nena’s 99 Luftballons only reached No 2 in the US, pop-pickers).On 21 December, Sky will release a miniseries based on Peter Shaffer’s 1979 play, which was the basis of Miloš Forman’s 1984 film. In an age of streaming, short-form content and even shorter attention spans, will it bring new listeners to Mozart’s music? Its team hopes so.“The music is like a character in the show,” said its musical director, Benjamin Holder. “One version of Mozart’s voice is delivered in Will Sharpe’s performance as Amadeus, another version of that voice is delivered through the music.”There are about 115 works by Mozart scattered throughout the five episodes. Although the musical passages are invariably short, they are unadulterated Mozart, recorded on instruments as authentic as possible to the late 18th century.“There are shows where it’s set in period but the music is modern, but that was never the idea here,” said Chantelle Woodnutt, the music supervisor. “There are other classical composers in there – Salieri, of course, but also bits of Haydn and Bach, as well as contemporary folk music from Turkey and Hungary, to show how Vienna was a melting pot of cultures and people were being influenced by all these different things.”Holder said: “Everybody making the series understood that the music was already really cool. What becomes clear is that Mozart was a rock star.”As Mozart, Sharpe learned to play everything himself. Holder said: “We started the piano stuff months ahead. Will spent weeks and weeks just playing scales.”Sharpe came fresh to Mozart’s music. “I had never had my opera epiphany but, making this, I started to understand it,” he said.“The music is extraordinary. Some of it is so playful and light and kind of mischievous and dainty. And then in other places, it’s really dark and grand.”View image in fullscreenAmadeus explores Mozart’s rise and downfall.Photograph: Adrienn Szabo/©Sky UK LtdMeanwhile, Rory Kinnear, as the music-loving Joseph II, had problems. “He is extremely musical and a brilliant pianist,” said Holder. “The difficulty was in making it look plausible that he keeps missing the notes when he plays Salieri’s piece in the first episode.”Simon Callow, who played Mozart in Shaffer’s original play at the National Theatre in 1979, said: “Peter Shaffer broke the image of Mozart as this perfect little porcelain figure which survived nearly 200 years, and he helped to define the image of Mozart that we have today. He opened the ears of a lot of people who didn’t care for Mozart or had no real concept of what his music was like.”Martin Cullingford, the editor of Gramophone magazine, welcomes the new show. “Anything in the wider media that makes classical music a compelling part of the story is a really good thing,” he said.“It might simply be that a lot of people haven’t encountered Mozart and if they watch this and think, wow, that’s extraordinary, then it will make a difference.”Does he see generation Z embracing Mozart the way generation X did? “Borders between genres feel more porous than they ever have done – partly as it’s so easy to range far and wide with streaming,” Cullingford said. “I’m hopeful that if people want to respond to this they no longer have to go into a specialist record shop – which might feel intimidating – and spend £15 on a CD. Instead they can just explore the music via streaming services.”Holder agrees. “A short-form version of the Queen of the Night’s jaw-dropping aria from The Magic Flute features in episode five,” he said. “I’d like to think that watching that will make people go: ‘Wow, that’s pretty epic.’”View image in fullscreenPaul Bettany stars as composer Antonio Salieri.Photograph: Adrienn Szabo/©Sky UK LtdThe two are echoing a point made by the late conductorSir Neville Marriner, who with his Academy of St Martin in the Fields orchestra recorded the 1984 film’s music and welcomed how it introduced Mozart to such a large audience.Onan ASMF podcast in 2015he shared his memories of working with Forman (he arrived in Devon to discuss the music ‘with a very big Hungarian sausage for them to spend the weekend eating’, and played tennis – ‘he was quite good but didn’t win’) and actor Tom Hulce (who spent a happy Christmas with the Marriners learning to look as if he could play the piano), and spoke of the importance of the film.“Young people sometimes feel a little ill at ease [with classical music’s] grand occasions – symphonic concerts and operas, say. The film was like going in the back door,” Marriner said at the time.“Going around the world still now, it doesn’t matter whether it’s in China or America, one of the first things people want to talk about is Amadeus and how much it influenced their life.”The one group who won’t be cheering the return of Amadeus is team Salieri. Poor maligned Salieri, who surely deserves a better epithet than Shaffer’s “patron saint of mediocrities”.“There’s beenvaliant attempts to rehabilitate his reputationover the years,” said Cullingford. “This will undo all the good work.”Explore more on these topicsClassical musicTelevisionWolfgang Amadeus MozartPaul BettanySky AtlanticfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Phone chargers with lots of leads for all your devices that have stupidly different ports. Those woolly hats that cover your neck and lower face, so you look daft but are impregnable to winter cold. The Nars blusher stick that is also a lipstick and eyeshadow.When it comes to dramas, however, it’s best to stick to one field of endeavour. The Revenge Club is a gallimaufry of tones, styles and performances. Watching it is like looking through a kaleidoscope that someone twists for you every few minutes; it’s fun but quite disorienting after a while.The club of the title begins as a divorce therapy group, comprising six pained souls. First among grieving equals is Emily (Aimee-Ffion Edwards), a happy and successful thirtysomething until she found her husband in bed with her best friend. The treacherous pair now have a baby, live in Emily’s beloved former home and bought her business for peanuts when she became unable to work in the wake of the disaster. We meet Emily in a now-standard flash-forward scene being interviewed by the police because “people are dead”. Dum-dum-dah! “It all started with the group,” she says, and – Big Little Lies style – every episode begins with a new member being interviewed and further interrogation scenes are interwoven with the main action, dropping crumbs of information as they go. It’s enough to keep you hooked even after you realise too many of the characters are ciphers, the main action is preposterous but that the brutal misery of divorce is somehow perfectly evoked and underlies every moment. It makes you want to cry even as you laugh in disbelief at the shenanigans unfolding.View image in fullscreenCareless talk therapy … The Revenge Club.Photograph: Gaumont/Paramout GlobalMartin Compston plays Callum, a father whose ex-wife is a real piece of work and trying to turn the wean against him by giving him the wrong times and dates for her school shows and so on. He and Emily come from one kind of show – standard thriller – and soon have the hots for each other. I’m sure nothing can go wrong there.Then there’s the ex-sergeant major Steven, whose wife “went mad at 40” and kicked him out. He lives in a caravan in their-now-her driveway, watching her come and go with her new man. His bitterness is brilliantly played by Douglas Henshall but seems to come from a much darker show altogether. He is the main driver of the group’s adventures – at first lighthearted, involving rats down chimneys and discombobulating the woman who took your house and usefully believes in ghosts, karma and the rest – into taking revenge on their exes.Tej (Chaneil Kular) is a relative youngster, whose divorce seems to have stemmed from the loss of their first baby at birth, though his vengeful attitude suggests something more at work. He belongs in the same show as Steven.Rita (Meera Syal) is a middle-aged woman who is sick of being invisible. Even the group leader overlooks her during introductions. A simmering mass of … well, everything, she could have her own show and it could be anything from a cartoonish journey through her serial-killing years to an award-winning portrait of a woman coming undone. Which it is will depend how much of a role goes to HRT.Finally, there’s another youngster, Rachel (Sharon Rooney, a natural comic actor), who has a rich daddy, two children and secret she is hiding from the group. She comes from a dramedy, at least at first.Leading them all is Malcolm (Amit Shah), licensed therapist, Sagittarius and divorce survivor, talks about himself in the third person and comes from a comedy I would watch.After the therapy session, the group reconvenes in the pub and begins its evolution into a tool for vengeance, retribution, restorative justice and all manner of come-uppery. Alas, what begins as a cathartic joke gradually morphs into something bigger and more dangerous – until, we must assume, it leads to corpses and police interrogations.As Christmas filler, The Revenge Club fulfils its duties. It’s entertaining, there’s always something happening and although preposterous, essentially makes narrative and emotional sense. But if it could have been more certain of itself, decided early on whether it was a caper or a thriller or a psychological drama about what extremes the effects of betrayal and grief can bring us to it could, as any one of them, have been really good.The Revenge Club is on Paramount+.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionParamount+reviewsShareReuse this content"

Tate Modern’s Turbine Hallis currently occupied by a feeble installationthat would be weak in an ordinary-sized art space, let alone this gigantic one. It’s become genuinely hard to understand what Tate’s priorities are when it chooses artists for the annual Turbine Hall commission. And the Turner prize is even more mystifying. Once the stage of shocking, provocative art that engaged – whether they were for or against – a massive public, it has retreated into wilful obscurity, its trips around the UK starting to seem part of a studied wholesomeness. What’s the point ofstaging it in Bradfordwhen the shortlist just exports the enigmatic tastes of a metropolitan elite?Is Maria Balshaw,who is quitting her post as director of Tate, solely responsible for this? No, but perhaps she is courageously taking the blame and allowing the institution to reinvent itself as it needs to, fast. The achievements Tate stresses in its announcement of her departure centre on how she has “diversified” the collection, exhibition and audiences. But in that noble quest, there has been a loss of artistic ambition, aesthetic thrills, raw horror and beauty. Sometimes we really do want art for art’s sake and Tate has lost sight of that.This is appallingly evident in the collection displays, which critics don’t often write about but visitors have to endure. Tate Modern’s galleries have slid into insulting incoherence, and in the last few years treasures like its Rothkos, Picassos and surrealists have often been out of view. The rehang at Tate Britain did get critiqued in 2023,with justifiable harshness, for it puts politics before art, patronising everyone with loftily proclaimed yet naive readings of British history – such as criticising baroque artists for not being Ranters or Hogarth for being heteronormative. I can think those things for myself. Or perhaps better things.There have been some great Tate shows too, yet they were often marred by silly side battles. I was astounded by thesuperb Cézanne blockbusterin 2022. It didn’t worry me that contemporary artists were invited to make irrelevant, politically charged interventions – but in truth, when you are trying to understand what Cézanne is up to in paintings that pixelate the sunburnt rocks of Provence into cubism and abstraction, it doesn’t help to also have to work out what makes one of these stony landscapes colonialist. It would have baffled Edward Said.View image in fullscreenBathers (Les Grandes Baigneuses) at Tate Modern’s Cézanne exhibition, 2022.Photograph: Guy Bell/AlamyYet since Cézanne and Rodin, the brilliant retrospectives of modern greats that used to grace Tate Modern – it began, back in the noughties, with the unforgettableMatisse Picasso– have thinned out. Tate brags aboutLeigh Bowery!as a highlight of Balshaw’s time but this was a wasted opportunity: the great, unmissable exhibition would have been one that reunited all Lucian Freud’s portraits of Bowery.So the critic moans and gripes and – guess what? – the public agree. People have voted with their absence. Presumably it’s the poor attendances at Tate’s museums that are behind Balshaw’s departure. But she should not be made a scapegoat by an institution that simply ploughs on regardless. Tate has made arrogant, crass choices to put ideology ahead of art, worthiness ahead of aesthetic pleasure and bad politics over thoughtful radicalism. It needs to change its ways, not just its boss. Otherwise, given that Penelope Curtis left Tate Britain after criticism in 2020 while its current male head seems impermeable to an even worse performance, this will look like another misogynist removal of a powerful woman.Explore more on these topicsTate ModernTurbine HallArtPaintingSculpturecommentShareReuse this content"

It was therefore entirely predictable that theforward’s commentsafter Liverpool’s3-3 draw at Leeds– where he was relegated to the bench for a third consecutive game – would become the singular, all-consuming topic across his homeland’s sports media.“Egyptian media was always going to stand by Salah,” says the Egyptian journalist and co-founder of the sports website KingFut, Adam Moustafa. “When you look at the content over the last five years or so of Egyptian football, 60-70% has been based around him. He’s a nique status that we’ve never had, for someone abroad to be so successful. He’s the golden child of Egypt.”‘Mo has misjudged the mood’: five Liverpool fans on the Salah sagaRead moreThe true measure of Salah’s cultural weight became clear in the breadth of national conversation, as talk around his interview spilled beyond the confines of football punditry. One of Egypt’s most known news presenters, Amr Adib, whose loud, brash political and economic opinions often go viral for all the wrong reasons, staunchly came to Salah’s defence. Political commentators dissected Salah’s words through the lens of negotiation tactics. Even YouTube film critics and foodie TikTokers felt compelled to offer their analysis. “It feels as if every public voice has an opinion to air,” says the president of one of Liverpool’s oldest fanclubs in Egypt, Ahmed Fahmy. “The dramatics of it all proves that a crisis involving Salah is a crisis for the nation.”Unlike in the UK, the consensus in Egypt was overwhelmingly supportive of Salah, with an almost uniform agreement he was justified in his public interview. “We’re getting two ends of the spectrum,” says Moustafa.While British media were quick to describe Salah as disrespectful and selfish, in Egypt the main view was that his character and past form should be enough credit in the bank to give him the right to air grievances. “The conversation about how Salah broke the sacred dressing-room code, that doesn’t really exist here,” says Fahmy. “Our football culture has always revered its stars – over managers, over clubs – and sees little benefit in keeping things quiet.”View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah has drawn sympathy in part thanks to his homeland’s culture of revering star players over managers or clubs.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesThe finger of blame was quickly pointed at everyone but Salah. Online analyses on football websites blamed Arne Slot, with FilGoal labelling the Liverpool manager a “coward” and Salah an “opportunist” in the headline of a piece that said: “[Salah] is like a boxer who appears calm, dodging blows, then pounces and delivers his knockout punch, thus deciding the fight in his favour.” At Kooora, Slot was accused of “double standards” as Virgil van Dijk’s mistakes this season left the author wondering why the captain had not been dropped. Television pundits theorised that Michael Edwards, the chief executive of football at Liverpool’s owner, Fenway Sports Group, and the club’s sporting director, Richard Hughes, would have been unhappy with Salah’s public contract pleas last season and pondered whether they were who the Egyptian was referring to when he said “someone doesn’t want me at the club”.Jamie Carragher fanned the flames. On Sky Sports, he described Salah as a “Chelsea failure” who threw Trent Alexander-Arnold “under the bus for eight years” and questioned his lack of a trophy with Egypt. The former Egypt forward Mido, known in the UK for stints with Spurs and Middlesbrough, said Carragher “exploit[s] any situation to always be in the spotlight”.Slot reveals plan for Salah talks and insists he has ‘no reason’ for wanting him to leaveRead more“He was a very average player … and tries to compensate for this by criticising star players,” Mido said. “But this style of media has proven, throughout history, to be very short-lived. He would not be able to say those comments about an English player. I lived in England for years. English people are very kind but, unfortunately, in certain situations, they are harsh [on foreign players].”Fahmy says: “Pundits have a responsibility to get their facts right. Especially if they go on live television to criticise a player. Carragher may think Salah was a Chelsea reject but Liverpool did not save Salah’s career. He was one of the best players in Serie A when he signed. Likewise, Jürgen Klopp would not have put up with him if he ‘threw his right-back’ under the bus for seven seasons.”A myriad of former Egypt players came to Salah’s defence alongside Mido, including Hazem Emam and Mohamed Aboutrika, the latter widely regarded as one of Africa’s greatest players. Both emphasised Carragher’s lack of context regarding Salah’s failure to win an Africa Cup of Nations.View image in fullscreenEgypt players pose with the Africa Cup of Nations trophy after winning the 2006 edition.Photograph: Karim Jaafar/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter Egypt won their most recent of sevenAfcon titles in 2010, the country experienced extreme political turmoil. Seventy-four people died in the2012 Port Said stadium riot– including afan who passed in Aboutrika’s arms. A two-year suspension of the Egyptian Premier League followed which was detrimental to the team’s heavy reliance on domestic players. With most of the squad retiring and a lack of funding and resources, Egypt failed to qualify for the 2012, 2013 and 2015 editions. Salah is widely agreed to be the catalyst for Egypt’s return to prominence, guiding them to two Afcon finals andqualifying for two World Cups, an achievement that eluded the previous golden generation.“Even if I were to assume [Carragher’s] point was Salah needs a team to win titles,” says Fahmy, “his proof – what he was using to back up said point – was factually incorrect. If it is all false, does your argument hold merit?”After Liverpool host Brighton on Saturday, Salah will join Egypt for his fifth Afcon campaign. “I think this is going to spur Salah to prove his point,” says Moustafa. “He’s going to want to redirect that anger and motivation on to the pitch.“I don’t want to believe he wasn’t trying in past editions but I think he always had an eye on returning to Liverpool, and [now], maybe he’s not sure where he ends up. I think you’re going to see a man whose back is against the wall.”The Pharaohs, drawn in Group B alongside Angola, South Africa and Zimbabwe, are expected to advance to the knockout stages. But there are persistent questions about whether Hossam Hassan, Egypt’s all-time top scorer and head coach since February 2024, can guide an ageing and uneven squad to the title with the lacklustre support of a failing federation.A more certain fact remains: Egyptians will defend their captain vehemently until the end. In their eyes, Salah has long since earned their loyalty and respect and there is little that could make their commitment to him waver.Explore more on these topicsMohamed SalahLiverpoolEgypt football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, despite the growing outrage, it is understood none of the international federations expect world football’s governing body to change its policy.Anger among supporter groups continued on Friday after it emerged that the cheapest tickets will cost 10 times the price promised in the original bid for the United States, Canada and Mexico to host the tournament. ForEnglandfans it will mean having to pay at least $220 (£165) for group games – when the bid document’s ticket model stated the cheapest seats should be $21 (£15.70).Fifa urged to halt World Cup ticket sales after ‘monumental betrayal’ of fansRead moreThe cheapest tickets for the World Cup final will cost $4,185 (£3,120), more than 30 times higher than originally planned. And that is before travel costs and accommodation are factored in.The Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) described the prices being proposed to the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) as “scandalous” and said they were “a step too far for many supporters who passionately and loyally follow their national sides at home and abroad”. “Everything we feared about the direction in whichFifawants to take the game was confirmed – Gianni Infantino only sees supporter loyalty as something to be exploited for profit,” the FSA added.England fans also expressed their outrage on the private Facebook page of the ESTC, which has 11,200 members, with many saying they would go to fewer games in the tournament or consider boycotting it all together. Another member voiced his frustration that wheelchair users would have to pay the same price as able-bodied match-goers, and their companions would have to pay, too.The FA is yet to comment publicly on Fifa’s ramped-up prices for the tournament. However, like other football associations, it is understood that it only found out on Thursday about Fifa’s plans. The organisation is also aware of the strong feelings of England fans and the FSA, and it is understood that it will pass those concerns to Fifa.Scotland fans also face paying prices almost as high as England, having qualified for their first finals since 1998. John MacLean, of the Scottish Football Supporters Association (SFSA), called on national associations to “hold Fifa to account” over the ticket prices. MacLean also expressed what he called “the widespread disappointment of Scottish fans and indeed fans all around the world at ticket prices that are, in some cases, five times the cost in Qatar”.Meanwhile, the German football association (DFB) has admitted that it would have “preferred more affordable tickets” but had no control over them. Andreas Rettig, the managing director of the DFB, said: “From Germany’s perspective, the World Cup is a long way away, and a visit already involves considerable effort and high travel costs.“That’s another reason why we would have preferred more affordable tickets for our fans. Fifa alone sets the ticket prices; the DFB has no influence over that. We were only informed of the prices a few hours before the application period opened.”Keir Starmer’s spokesperson has confirmed that the government would not be getting involved in the dispute: “That’s clearly a matter for Fifa to speak to. The prime minister would always hope that any major sporting event was accessible to as many people as possible, but it’s for Fifa to speak to their ticketing policies, not for me.”Fifa has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026Football ticket pricesFifaThe FAEnglandWorld CupFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This is just another project, as it always wasFri 12 Dec 2025 21.12 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 21.13 CETShareTea and cake. Cobble-close streets. Collectivism. Sugar rush. Hollywood fairytales. And also, as of this week, a minority owner with historical links to celebrity paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Wait! Welsh cakes! Welsh tea! Aggregated tourism benefits. The sloeblack, slow, black, crowblack, fishingboat-bobbing sea. And also, at one remove, historical links to deceased celebrity paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.Two important things have happened toheartwarming Disney TV vehicleWrexham AFC in the past fortnight. First it was announced that a grant of £18m would be provided by the Welsh Labour government to help renovate the Racecourse Ground, which is unusual, public money to a private entity, but justified as part of a wider regeneration.Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney sell Wrexham stake to US private equity groupRead moreAnd second, Wrexham’s co-owners, the TV guys, Rob and Ryan, announced the sale this week of aminority stake to Apollo Sports Capital, which is owned by Apollo, a US hedge fund.Now. It is important to state that the new minority owner of Wrexham has no current links to Epstein. Those links were severed in March 2021, which is a whole four and a half years ago, when one of the cofounders of Apollo, Leon Black, resigned from the board after it emergedhe had paid Epstein $148min return for some kind of personal financial advice, and had also – hard to get past this one – written a mildly salacious poem in Epstein’s 50th birthday card.So, zero connection. You could be of the view, if you wanted to be pedantic here, that the financial muscle of Apollo was built in part through the expertise of a guy who wrote: “Blond, red or brunette, spread out geographically” in a paedophile people trafficker’s birthday card, which is middling verse, but top-of-the-range creepiness.But Apollo Sports is a legit fund, provides a necessary service, and has purged itself of its seemingly dodge-pot founder. We know how this world works. All hedge funds seem dirty at one remove, because money is dirty. And all football clubs at this level are owned by people who have money.The most obvious point of dissonance is the grant of public funds. Why is the Welsh administration giving money to an entity now part-owned by US financiers? Why are they doing this at a time when the NHS is ailing and infrastructure in decline?The new minority owners have limitless finance available to them. They can build a stand and fix some floodlights. If the world were run on morality and fairness this money would now be returned to the public purse. It isn’t and it can’t, so it won’t.But let us be fair toWrexhamhere. There are plenty of whatabouts. Who built the Etihad Stadium? Who built West Ham’s Olympic-scale temple of sadness? In the end, it was you and me. And let me please introduce you to Sir Big Sir Jim Ratcliffe, also seeking public money to boost his rebuild of Old Trafford’s surrounds.This can be addressed. When the state regulator gets to work, its role should involve scrutinising exactly this kind of situation. For now it will continue to happen, because things need to be built, the UK has so little spare capacity, and the cap must always be out there upturned on the pavement.It may be depressing that this is our notion of growth now. Could the public money have been used to generate jobs in a way that doesn’t rely on a US TV show being recommissioned for another series? But there is also the hard reality of jobs and economic activity. The creation of a tourist hub in a town notable previously for possessing the biggest slag heap in the Western hemisphere may be one of the strangest things that has ever happened in British football. But it has also worked, at least for now.View image in fullscreenWrexham co-owner Ryan Reynolds (right) and Ollie Palmer with the League One trophy in April 2025.Photograph: Jon Super/APThe real point here is the people around the table now. This is information. Wrexham is telling us what it is, and what football is. This has always been a TV product, to some extent a useful lie, investment disguised as a buddy-tale underdog story.They’re not even buddies! Wrexham’s owners met for the first time filming the show. But it’s also great casting. They work on screen, wandering around Wrexham like handsome alien royalty, entirely believable as regular-dude fairy godmothers refinding their own blue collar blah‑di‑blah, like Reese Witherspoon in Sweet Home Alabama, but with middle-aged gym muscles and teeth that look as if they were made in Dubai by a robot.But wait! They do have a fish-out-of-water everyman-type figure as club director, Humphrey Ker, who looks like someone created if you asked AI to make an image of an agreeable man from the 1990s who likes pesto and the music of Shed Seven. But Ker is also a construct, an actor, comedian, TV impresario and scion of the fourth earl of Cheese-Flaps or similar, the kind of Englishman who in another life would be striding around in massive starched shorts being Governor General of Bechuanaland.Humphrey found the right club, did the work, recognised that if you’re going to monetise grit and heritage then selling warm, underdog Welshness gives you bang for your buck.Strip this stuff out, front-load it, present it to America. And with the arrival, finally, of the hedge funders, there is no pretence now. This is just another project, as it always was, albeit an interesting one. Even the financial doping element, often mentioned by fans of rival clubs, is nuanced. Wrexham have powered their way up the leagues not with magic or story-telling but with hard speculative cash, £40m or so over five seasons, the biggest net spend of anyChampionshipclub this summer according to Transfermarkt, a transfer net outlay bigger than any club in the Bundesliga.But this is also just what you have to do. You can’t make the journey without constantly regearing your squad. Most importantly, it is also sustainable, because Wrexham make a huge amount of commercial revenue. It is in its own way a model of financial probity, of eat-what-you-kill good sense capitalism.This may involve a televisual illusion. But it’s workable. It won’t fail the profitability and sustainability rules. This is also a historically powerful club with the reserves and interest to function on this scale. It provides social benefits, has made the town pulse with life, made people happier.It is also far from an anomaly. Rather, Wrexham is part of the same process that is happening everywhere, the new model of US sports capitalism that views this industry as an under-leveraged global entertainment product ripe for the streaming age.Premier League owners will talk openly about the dream of piggy-backing football for its unique quality of cut-through, creating a new global platform around it, making real Zuckerberg billions, Google billions, leveraging the endless hunger for content.Wrexham are a part of the same process that means Mo Salah not playing football is the biggest story of the season so far for eyeballs and dramatic energy. It’s part of the same dynamic that means the Word Cup is unaffordable, because capitalism says you will pay what we can make you pay and that is good and right and just a functioning market.Good art, good TV, good dramatic writing always tells you about the world around it. Wrexham have done this in the guise of a rootsy fairytale. But they will also take your public funds, will do what they must to grow their footprint. As the project heads towards the overclass tier, driven on now by that mix of schmaltz, theatre and sharp-toothed finance, it is at least doing it right out in the open.Explore more on these topicsWrexhamChampionshipFootball politicsCLScommentShareReuse this content"

But a missed penalty from Billy Searle at the start of the second half and a soft try for Jamison Gibson-Park shifted the momentum and ultimately – despite being far from their best – the Irish province were deserved winners. Gibson-Park and Dan Sheehan scored Leinster’s tries, with Harry Byrne kicking three penalties and a conversion. Sam Prendergast also added a conversion.Radwan and his fellow wing Ollie Hassell-Collins crossed over for Leicester’s tries as Searle added a penalty and a conversion.“I’m incredibly proud of the effort as our defence was outstanding, the best performance of the season in that area, but I’m frustrated as the game was there for us,” Parling said.“A lot of people had written us off before the game and it would have been an incredible day had we won as Leinster haven’t lost a European pool game for four years. Going toe to toe with them gives our fans hope and belief for the future but we need to double down on our accuracy.The way the competition is set up, we are still in with a chance of progressing.”View image in fullscreenJamison Gibson-Park touches down in the corner for Leinster’s first try.Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/ShutterstockIt was a different story in the Irish camp as they now have nine points from their opening two fixtures and that should already be enough for them to progress to the next round of the competition.Leinster had to cope with the loss before kick-off of prop Tadhg Furlong, and head coach Leo Cullen said: “I’m very pleased how we stuck at it, although if we had taken our opportunities, we would have made it easier for ourselves. It’s an incredibly tough place to come and although we played with great intensity, they were very dogged and made life difficult for us.“We had a lot of early disruption with Tadhg feeling unwell on leaving the hotel and then losing two players [to injury] in the first 11 minutes. We then had a try harshly ruled out but we showed great composure even though we were trailing 15-6 at half-time.”Explore more on these topicsChampions CupLeicesterLeinsterRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

And that’s probably why they’ll never be in the Premier League. You need to have a personality as well as being at the top of your game. You need to balance both.”And frankly, has anyone in the sport made a better fist of it than Bunting himself? A few years ago, the man they call the Bullet was little more than a capable journeyman on the fringes of the elite, as well-known for his resemblance to Peter Griffin from Family Guy as for his darts. Now he is the world No 4 and a multiple tournament winner, with a loyal and passionate following that – in its most spine-tingling moments – seems to transcend sport itself.Littler lights up Ally Pally opening night as prize money raises stakesRead moreThe interesting part is the way these two narratives have unfolded in harmony with each other. The rise of Bunting the dart player, and the rise of Bunting the snackable social media phenomenon who can bring a stadium to its feet, are really a single development with a single root: the story of how an ordinary lad from St Helens learned to embrace his authentic self. Learned to be happy again.“I always wanted to be a dart player,” he says. “Sixth form, we used to wag off school and go down to the pub, a game of snooker, a game of darts and a few pints. But I also want to be remembered as one of the nice guys. For being a bit stupid and having a laugh.”To watch Bunting take the stage these days is to witness a quasi-religious experience. He walks on to the song Titanium by Sia and David Guetta, chosen for no other reason than that his son liked it. As the music swells, the crowd rises, belting out the top notes in a kind of mass ecstasy. Bunting stands atop the platform, cajoling and conducting them like a preacher, the entire room in his grip. Eventually the music dies and the crowd launch into a chorus of “Let’s Go Bunting Mental”. It is a stirring, albeit deeply strange spectacle.There is no artifice to this, no masterplan. An infinity of marketing geniuses locked in a room for infinity could never concoct a campaign this catchy. Nobody even really noticed when Bunting changed his walk-on music to Titanium from Bird is the Word – a Family Guy in-joke – around the time of the pandemic. Even now Bunting isn’t sure how or why it went quite so viral.View image in fullscreenStephen Bunting tasted success in the 2024 Masters that he credits in part to undergoing hypnotherapy.Photograph: Rob Newell/CameraSport/Getty Images“I never really thought too much about it,” he says now. “But the song is brilliant, and the lyrics – ‘bulletproof, nothing to lose, fire away’ – all relate. When I get on stage and the fans are all singing it back, you feel like you’re orchestrating something special. And then it gives you the power to go and produce performances.”Any feedback from either of the artists themselves? “I messaged Sia on Instagram. She didn’t get back to me.”Of course darts has never been short of novelty acts and outsized characters. The difference with Bunting is that he backs it up with brilliance. Above all, it so clearly comes from an authentic place. “It’s 100% me,” he says. “I don’t hide behind fakeness. My dad taught me that from an early age. No matter how much money you’ve got in your bank, you’re still the same person.” The problem, for much of his early career, was that Bunting himself was still trying to work out who that person was. Right from his earliest years growing up in St Helens he had been a daft lad and a very decent player, good enough to be Lakeside world champion in 2014, but still never quite comfortable in his own skin. “Then you start losing,” he says. “You start doubting. It took a few years to rebuild myself.”Bunting got help. Racked with depression and starting to take every defeat like the end of the world,he visited a hypnotherapistcalled Chris O’Connor to “get my mind in the right place”, as he puts it. “He taught me, no matter how hard things were, to try to take my mind away from darts. Don’t look at negatives, look for positives. That helped alleviate the demons.”There were technical improvements as well. Bunting had always thrown a light dart, but over the years, through sweat and abrasion his copper-tungsten arrows had whittled away to around 12g. (The average pro throws around 20-25g.) “If I didn’t change my darts, soon I was going to be throwing with bookie pens,” he jokes.“Moving up six grams gives me so much more control of the dart. It’s paid dividends.”Slowly, the wins and the consistency began to come: a first major title at the Masters in early 2024, an invitation to the Premier League in 2025. Meanwhile, away from the oche his legend was building: late-night TikTok livestreams, YouTube tutorials, viral Instagram moments. In an intensely psychological sport where character and talent are often two sides of the same coin, Bunting was learning to master not just the craft but the business of darts.View image in fullscreenStephen Bunting is feeling good about his chances at the PDC world championship as he beat Luke Littler in an exhibition recently.Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PA“We do exhibitions, and a lot of the other players like to lock themselves away in a private room,” Bunting says. “They don’t really see the fans, unless it’s a meet-and-greet. Whereas I like to be the centre of attention, easily accessible. And listen, these fans are paying our wages.”The burning question is whether Bunting can give his fans what they truly want. He’s never reached a world championship final. His Premier League campaign was a crushing disappointment. His recent record in the majors hasn’t been great. Even so, he reckons he’s in good shape. He beat Luke Littler in a recent exhibition in Portsmouth. “Hundred point three average,” he says. “Hitting lots of 180s, and my big finishing seems to be back.”I ask again about the kid growing up in Liverpool, chucking darts in the pub while skiving off school. Did he ever, in his wildest imagination, think it might ever turn out like this? Bunting pauses for a moment.“Maybe not thought,” he says after a while. “Maybe dreamed. I always dreamed of becoming this darts player that everyone looked up to. To play on the biggest stages and win the world championship. Half my dream’s been met. Now let’s try to make the other half happen.”Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipsDartsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Maresca revealed that the 23-year‑old had a “mixed feeling” after training on Thursday, said that he was “completely bad” after making his comeback as a second-half substitute against Leeds last week and added that he is currently in the group of players whose minutes require careful management.The comments from Chelsea’s head coach did little to boost the sense that Palmer, who was rested as a precaution against Atalanta in the Champions League on Tuesday, will be able to build momentum in time for the World Cup. Maresca explained that it is an unpredictable situation with the playmaker, whose absence has allowed Jude Bellingham, Eberechi Eze, Phil Foden and Morgan Rogers to move in front of him in the fight to earn a spot in attacking midfield for England. “Yesterday he finished the session with a mixed feeling,” Maresca said of Palmer. “Overall he was fine but still a little bit painful.”The Italian is confident that Palmer, who is available when Chelsea host Everton on Saturday, does not need surgery to fix the longstanding groin problem and is hopeful the injury will not need managing for the rest of the season.“It’s something that is a little bit day by day,” Maresca added. “You can see if he’s getting better, some days it can be worse. For instance after Leeds, he was completely bad the day after. And he played half an hour. After Bournemouth, he was OK. He played one hour. There’s not any sense [to it]. It’s day by day that decides how he feels.”Jacob Steinberg2.Moyes will talk to Tarkowski about flashpointDavid Moyes has admitted James Tarkowski needs to tread more carefully with video assistant referees after barging into Dan Ndoye during Everton’s 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest.Forest have made a formal complaint to Professional Game Match Officials after Tarkowski escaped punishment for knocking down Ndoye in the 11th minute last Saturday. Speaking in the buildup to today’s match at Chelsea, Sean Dyche said he was “amazed” his former captain at Everton and Burnley was not shown a card of any description.The referee, Chris Kavanagh, did not see the incident on-field while the VAR, James Bell, could not intervene in what might have been considered a yellow card offence.View image in fullscreenDavid Moyes takes his in-form side to Stamford Bridge.Photograph: David Blunsden/Action Plus/ShutterstockTarkowski has had several run‑ins with opponents this season. “I’ve not [spoken to Tarkowski] but I should do really because with the world we’re in you’ve got to be careful,” the Everton manager said. “The action in the game, I had turned away and was looking at something else but I watched it back on the telly and thought it could have been a yellow card. I didn’t think personally it was a red card but it’s the sort of thing where you don’t want to give the referees or VAR a situation where they might have a decision to make.  We had just gone 1-0 up. I probably will have a word with him and just talk to him about it.”Four wins out of five have moved Everton to within a point of Chelsea and a rare victory on Saturday – they have not won at Stamford Bridge since 1994 – would lift them into fourth place overnight.Andy Hunter3.Arteta says Jesus will stayMikel Arteta has insisted Gabriel Jesus will not be sold and can be Arsenal’s first-choice No 9. Jesus made his injury comeback as a second-half substitute in the 3-0 win against Club Brugge on Wednesday after 11 months away. The Brazil international, 28, brings an extra dimension to Arteta’s frontline but he has just 18 months to run on his contract.After splashing out £64m on Viktor Gyokeres and with Kai Havertz, albeit sidelined with a knee injury, another striking option, Arsenal could be tempted to cash in on Jesus before his deal expires. However, speaking before Arsenal’s match against Wolves at the Emirates on Saturday, Arteta said: “No, I don’t consider that [selling him], especially with the situation that we have right now.“Gabriel has a lot to offer to the team and he’s proven that straight away in the first minute that he was available to play.

Solanke’s fitness has been a regular topic of discussion in Tottenham head coach’s press conferences this season given the £65m striker has only made three appearances.An ankle issue disrupted Solanke’s pre-season and Frank has been without the England international since he featured at Manchester City on 23 August, with minor surgery on 1 October unable to speed up the recovery process. Before Sunday’s trip to Nottingham Forest, Frank returned to the subject after Solanke posted an image on Instagram that included an hourglass emoji to hint he may return soon.Frank said: “When he is training fully with the team and is available for selection that’s when I will say something. Hopefully there will be lots of footage of him training but yeah, that is my message.” Pressed further on Solanke given the lack of information around him in recent weeks, Frank provided a number of polite one-word answers that confirmed the 28-year-old is training individually and back on the grass.Pushed further on if he had kicked a ball yet, Frank said with a smile: “I’m happy to answer all these questions. I’m just a little bit bored of it because let’s talk about Forest, it’s much more interesting.”PA Media5.Bowen crucial to Nuno’s escape planNuno Espírito Santo is hopeful a fit Jarrod Bowen can help propel his team away from the Premier League relegation zone. Bowen has been the Hammers’ best player of a tough season so far and scored a brilliant goal inSunday’s 1-1 drawat Brighton. Nuno’s team are in the relegation zone and two points adrift of the last safe spot before Sunday’s game at home to Aston Villa.“I hope he can be involved in every minute because what he gives to the team is huge,” said Nuno of Bowen. “He leads by example, but if the situation comes [that he is injured], I have a group of players who I believe can contribute in the aspect of leadership.”Nuno said he was hoping for an improve defensive showing for the visit of Unai Emery’s team. With 29 goals conceded, West Ham have the joint-third worst defensive record in the league. “We haven’t achieved a clean sheet yet,” said Nuno. “That is something we need to do. There is improvement. But not total improvement.”PA Media6.Forest double down on Aina’s availabilityNottingham Forest are standing firm in their stance that Ola Aina was not fit enough to go to the Africa Cup of Nations with Nigeria. The right-back has not played since suffering a serious thigh injury in a World Cup qualifier for his country in September. He is nearing a return to fitness after surgery and the Nigeria Football Federation repeatedly asked Forest whether he was fit enough to be included in their squad for the tournament in Morocco.However, Forest insisted the player would not be able to go and he was subsequently left out of the Super Eagles squad. Sean Dyche said: “It’s just that he’s not fit. He hasn’t been fit, he’s still not fit. He hasn’t played any football yet. So, that’s all we can offer to that situation, that he’s still not fit. We’ve made that very clear.”View image in fullscreenNottingham Forest’s Ola Aina.Photograph: Andrew Kearns/CameraSport/Getty ImagesForest will lose Ibrahim Sangaré to the competition, though, as he has been named in the Côte d’Ivoire squad. “He’s done well since we got to the club and he’s kind of earned his place back into the side because when we came in it was like a fresh set of eyes for me and my staff,” Dyche added. “That’s the way it goes, these are the sort of challenges we’ve got as a club.”PA MediaExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe talknewsShareReuse this content"

We have great education programmes which help but they don’t impact the intentional rule-breakers in elite sport.“Our ineffectiveness in dealing with those who are beating the rules is hurting the anti-doping movement’s credibility, with the resulting risk that our clean-sport message falls on deaf ears.”Ironically the AIU is widely seen as the gold standard when it comes to catching cheats, having sanctioned 427 elite athletes for doping offences since 2017.However, Howman said the AIU could do more, despite its successes, adding that “it was not catching enough of them and significant improvements are necessary”.Howman, who spent 13 years as Wada’s director general, also urged the anti-doping community to “move beyond compliance to a system that supports effective, ambitious anti-doping efforts”.Focusing on compliance-based testing, Howman warned, would not catch what he called the “sophisticated dopers” and he urged Wada to be more proactive in “promoting the pursuit of anti-doping excellence” and for greater transparency on anti-doping data.“We must all do better to support our clean athletes by catching the dirty ones, especially those at the pinnacle of sport,” he added. “Let’s resolve to strengthen our anti-doping system as we strive for cleaner, fairer and more credible sport.”Explore more on these topicsDrugs in sportWadaAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

The win ­establishes her as one of the ­favourites for the downhill in February’s Winter ­Olympics in Milan-Cortina, the event she won her only gold medal in, back in Vancouver in 2010.“It was an amazing day, I couldn’t be happier, pretty emotional,” Vonn said. “I felt good this summer but I wasn’t sure how fast I was. I guess I know now how fast I am.”Vonn led by 1.16sec after a ­storming first run and she consolidated her advantage in the second to secure her 44th career win in World Cup downhills – and the 83rd World Cup victory of her career – with Austria’s Magdalena Egger in second place, 0.98sec back.After her victory was confirmed, Vonn collapsed into the snow before thrusting her ski poles in the air to celebrate. It was the perfect start to her Olympic season and a first World Cup win since March 2018 at Are, Sweden.“Obviously my goal is Cortina but if this is the way we start I think I’m in a good spot,” she said.View image in fullscreenLindsey Vonn on her way to victory in San Moritz.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesThe American has another ­downhill followed by a ­Super-G – and the ominous news for her rivals is that she thinks there is still room for improvement.“I still didn’t ski the best I could have on the compression on the ­bottom but I just tried to be dynamic, tried to be clean, the way I’ve been skiing in training and it was pretty solid,” she said.“I’m really excited for Super-G because I’m ­skiing better in Super-G than I am in downhill.”The previous oldest World Cup race winner was Switzerland’s ­Didier Cuche at 37 in a men’s Super-G in 2012.

Inside the final days of LeBron James in Los AngelesA new book explores how an all-time great and a world famous franchise handle the waning of a monumental careerRich TenorioFri 12 Dec 2025 11.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 11.02 CETShareIn a book about LeBron James and theLos Angeles Lakers, it’s only fitting that one memorable scene involves a Hollywood star: Will Smith.Yaron Weitzman’s latest book is titled AHollywood Ending: The Dreams and Drama of the LeBron Lakers. Suffice to say the plot thickens when Smith goes to the Lakers’ film room to speak to the team in 2022.Six months had passed since Smith had slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars. Now Smith was participating in a series of celebrity talks to the Lakers, an innovation brought in by general manager Rob Pelinka. According to the book, James asked Smith question after question until a scheduled half-hour visit had ballooned to nearly twice that amount, with fellow Laker Russell Westbrook growing visibly frustrated, frowning in a team photo with Smith.“You get to see the personal, intra-office dynamics that impact the game that you don’t always think about,” Weitzman says of the scene.He notes that those who’ve read the excerpt “seem to be cheering on Westbrook” and “latching on to the idea that it was LeBron’s fault, LeBron was a phony.” He points out that Westbrook has played for multipleNBAteams, and in LA, he was “awful on the court, hardheaded, no willingness to adjust his game.”As for James: “He is the defining, not just basketball player … but athlete of my generation,” says the 37-year-old Weitzman. And, the author adds, “It seemed like the ‘merger’ between LeBron and the Lakers was fertile ground for the sort of reporting and storytelling” that’s fueled by what Weitzman calls behind the scenes drama.Weitzman is no stranger to dissecting NBA franchises. It’s what he did in his previous book, about the Philadelphia 76ers, Tanking to the Top. With the Lakers, though, the spotlight was more intense. There was the team’s location in America’s entertainment epicenter. There was a legacy of championships won by stars from Magic Johnson to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to Kobe Bryant to Shaquille O’Neal, the last two coached by the legendary Phil Jackson. (Last season brought another addition to the pantheon – Luka Dončić – but we’ll get to him later.) There was the role of the Buss family, especially the late longtime team owner Jerry Buss and his daughter, Jeanie, who succeeded him in the executive office. Then there was what Weitzman called the “merger” between the Lakers and James, who brought a star power all his own – as well as the increasingly powerful agency that represented him: Klutch Sports Group, run by James’ friend Rich Paul.The Luka Era begins: inside the transformation powering the post-LeBron LakersRead moreHow rare is James’s status in the NBA? The book notes his estimated billion-dollar-plus worth while still on an NBA roster, and his dream of someday owning a franchise. Weitzman tracks the impact of James’ comments to the media – including some much-scrutinized remarks at a press conference after the Lakers’ 2023 playoff exit: “I’ve got a lot to think about, to be honest. Just for me personally going forward with the game of basketball, I’ve got a lot to think about.”Neither James nor team ownership would talk with Weitzman for the book. He filled in the gaps by reading the news coverage from as far back as 15 years ago, supplementing this by watching documentaries, listening to podcasts and speaking with whoever would talk to him, a list that grew to almost 300. Keep an eye out for the footnotes while reading the book. Weitzman describes them as “like someone winking at the reader.”On page 54, you’ll find not one but two footnotes relating to Daenerys Targaryen. Why? Bryant is quoted urging Jeanie Buss to emulate the Game of Thrones character in early 2017. That’s when, according to the book, she won a George RR Martin-esque power struggle for control of the team. The next year, James came to LA for four years and $154m.“The Lakers were in a dark period,” Weitzman says. “They certainly needed LeBron. LeBron saved Jeanie Buss’ legacy by coming there.” He adds that unlike past stars such as Magic, Kobe or Shaq, LeBron came to the Lakers as “a fully formed icon, which they had not had before.”There were significant if not immediate benefits: A championship in James’ second season with the Lakers, 2019-20 – a season that ended amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests. It was also a season that saw the death of Bryant and his daughter Gianna in a helicopter crash. Coach Frank Vogel kept the team focused as it played before empty stands in the NBA bubble. It was title No 17 for the Lakers, tying them with the Boston Celtics for the all-time league mark.Would there be an encore? Pelinka tried to add more talent around James, and in 2021 he brought in Westbrook. Yet the 2021-22 team couldn’t even qualify for the playoffs to defend its title, and Vogel lost his job.Darvin Ham succeeded Vogel as coach. James continued to dazzle on the court, yet the team struggled around him. The book finds a perfect microcosm: On 7 February 2023,James broke the all-time NBA scoring record, surpassing Abdul-Jabbar, in a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. There were cheers for James after he set the mark late in the third quarter, and a salute from commissioner Adam Silver. However, as the book points out, it was the Thunder who won the game. The Lakers stood at 25-30, in danger of missing the playoffs once more.Cue more plot twists. The Lakers traded away Westbrook, and saw their fortunes surge. They made the playoffs, going all the way to the West finals, which Denver swept. It was an encouraging first season for Ham, yet the following season the Nuggets ousted the Lakers again, this time in the first round of the playoffs. The hated Celtics won the title that season, moving them ahead of LA for that record 18th banner.Parting ways with Ham, the Lakers flirted with UConn coach Dan Hurley before he ultimately turned LA down. The Lakers hired player-turned-podcaster JJ Redick and made a unique decision in the draft: They selected James’ son Bronny at No 54, setting upa rare father-son pairing in the lineup. Then, earlier this year, Pelinka made a league-shattering move, dealing Anthony Davis for Mavericks superstar Dončić, who is already one his way toreplacing James as the face of the Lakers.By that point, Weitzman thought he was finished with the manuscript, which initially ended with Bronny joining James on the Lakers. As they say in Hollywood, get me a rewrite.“I live in New York. The Lakers were playing the Knicks that night at Madison Square Garden,” Weitzman recalls of the Dončić trade. “I was at the game, then I was driving my way home, saw the tweet – oh my God.”The book wraps up in where-are-they-now style, giving readers updates on the cast. Among them: The Buss family has sold its majority stake to Mark Walter, the owner of the cross-town LA Dodgers, with Jeanie Buss remaining as governor and keeping 15% ownership.“I’m curious to see where this goes,” Weitzman says. “Is she going to stay or go? I’m dubious whether she actually can stay … Usually, people who pay the money want to be in charge.”As for James?“Playing into his 40s, it’s something unparalleled,” Weitzman marvels. “In the major professional American sports, the four major sports, Tom Brady is the only comparison. I’ve never seen anything like it.”Explore more on these topicsLeBron JamesNBALos Angeles LakersBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Let us come together to protect the institution we all loveKeir Starmer is the British prime ministerFri 12 Dec 2025 19.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 19.02 CETShareIam a Labour prime minister who believes in workers’ right to strike. But let’s be clear about the strikesplanned by resident doctorsnext week. They should not happen. They are reckless. They place the NHS and patients who need it in grave danger.I remain hopeful they can be averted. A good deal is on the table, and the British Medical Association (BMA) isputting it to membersthis weekend. My message to the doctors is simple – take it.‘Beyond belief’ that resident doctors could strike amid flu crisis, says StarmerRead moreAfter all, you are no longer fighting a government that sees industrial conflict as a way to score cheap political points. We recognise the damage caused by years of Tory austerity. With this government, your pay has increased by 28.9% over the past three years. Wehave investeda record amount in the NHS, cutting waiting times. And we have listened to your concerns about jobs and training.That is what’s new about the latest deal. We are offering legislation that will prioritise British medical graduates for speciality training jobs starting next year. We will boost the number ofplaces by 4,000,giving new hope to doctors without a job next year. And we have offered to cover the costs of other training expenses such as royal college membership and exam fees.But we also made another offer to the BMA leadership: the chance to extend their mandate so strikes could be rescheduled for after Christmas if our offer was rejected. Don’t get me wrong – of course I would rather they were cancelled. I would rather resident doctors take a deal that improves their training and career prospects and puts money in their pockets. But under the circumstances, I wanted to be sure we have left no stone unturned in our efforts to protect theNHS.Because be under no illusions, those circumstances are potentially dire. The “super flu” epidemic sweeping the country means this is the NHS’smost precarious moment since the pandemic. Last week, an average of 2,660 hospital beds each day were occupied by flu patients – up 55% on the week before and much higher than this time last year. And the epidemic is still growing.Having lived through a pandemic, we all know what this means. It means a battle. On hospital wards across the country, NHS staff will be working around the clock to make sure patients get the care they need and the NHS stays above water. In fact, resident doctors’ colleagues will be cancelling operations, cancelling their Christmas leave and preparing for this coming storm. The idea that strikes could still take place in this context is frankly beyond belief.So resident doctors should vote to stop them. For patients, for the NHS and for the entire country, this dispute should now end. A fair deal for doctors is on the table. And instead of conflict this Christmas, we can come together to improve the NHS we love.Keir Starmer is the prime minister of the United KingdomExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionKeir StarmerIndustrial actionDoctorsHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

A toxic debate does no one any favoursSimon JenkinsThe courts are a clumsy means to negotiate social relationships. Let organisations make up their own minds about inclusionFri 12 Dec 2025 11.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 11.09 CETShareTowards the end of her life, I was a friend of the writer Jan Morris. I had known her for many years and, much to my regret, had declined an offer to do her “tell all” interview when she transitioned. Jan presented herself as a woman and had undergone an operation. To me she was simply a remarkable woman. She touched, sometimes humorously, on embarrassing incidents in her life. But it never occurred to me that a legal ruling might hover over our restaurant table and block her from going to the ladies.Last April, the supreme court issued a ruling confirming that the word “sex” in the Equality Act 2010 refers to biological sex, not a person’s legal gender. This has a wide-reaching impact on how equality law is applied in practice, particularly in providing sex-based rights such as single-sex spaces. Six months later, adraft codeon the ruling’s implementation was sent bythe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to the equalities minister, Bridget Phillipson. She has been sitting on it ever since, pleading for more time.The WI and Girlguiding have been pressured to exclude trans women – yet the law is clear as mud | Jess O’ThomsonRead moreTo be fair, this territory is deep in fudge. The court verdict was ostensibly clear. Girlguiding was for girls, the Women’s Institute (WI) for women. If a toilet says it is for “women”, it means biological women. But the issue isnot so clearcutfor former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption. He told the BBC that what the court really meant was that women-only services “are allowed to exclude trans women from facilities, but are not obliged to do so”.With this the outgoing EHRC chair, Kishwer Falkner, disagreed. Speaking to the BBC, she said: “If a male person is allowed to use a women-only service or facility, it isn’t any longer single-sex, then it becomes a mixed-sex space.” Presumably, if the WI wanted to allow trans women as members, then it would become the “Women’s and Trans Women’s Institute” and would need unisex loos.Whose interpretation is correct? The EHRC has sincetaken downinterim advice on the subject from its website. Everyone is waiting for further guidance.Common sense must be with Sumption. Sex as defined as biological sex should clearly apply to physical sports, but less so to most women’s clubs or job quotas or competitions or restaurant loos. Trans people have a right to dignity and respect.Over the decades, the tiny percentage of the population who have transitioned have quietly integrated into the community. The gender recognition certificate – used for new passports – need not have legal status to be informally acceptable in most circumstances.The few trans people I have encountered are discreet. They avoid controversial situations and do not march for “trans rights”. They understand that they are exceptional and that it will take time for many others to accept them for who they are. It is for the world to judge whether to accept them as such, but in my experience most people are ready to do so, and most institutions as well. It is for Refuge, the women’s rescue hostel service, to decide whether it will or will not accept trans women.It has decided it will. The most liberal interpretation of the supreme court judgment is plainly called for.We are dealing here with the most intangible of phenomena, the pace of change within society. It was much the same with other exceptional groups, such as gay people, immigrants and some religious minorities. Often, as in the Church of England, objections become overt and lead to bans and litigation, as over the status of property in single-sex marriage. But change comes about fastest when the least fuss is made, and when a minority knows that it is initially different and reacts to antagonism with moderation.The new code needs to be nuanced, to suggest how single-sex bodies might help trans people towards acceptability. Rights are always sensitive, but there should be few cases that require litigation. The courts are a clumsy discipline to apply to the intimacies of social relationships.This is a real mess. If ever hard cases made bad law, this is a classic.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After a minor bump over the past 20 years, the EU rate appears to be declining once more, and now stands at 1.38. The UK’s is1.44. A population’s replacement rate is 2.1. You may or may not see this as a disaster, but the maths doesn’t care what you think. We are gliding, as if by gravitational force, towards the ground.Civilisational erasure is the term the Trump administration used in its newnational security strategy, published last week. It claimed that immigration, among other factors, will result in the destruction of European civilisation. In reality, without immigration there will be no Europe, no civilisation and no one left to argue about it.Of course, we’re talking about different things. The Trump administration appears to see “civilisation” as a white and western property, threatened by Black and Brown people, regardless of whether they were born here or have recently arrived. This week, Donald Trump claimed that, with the exception of Poland and Hungary, European nations “will not be viable countries any longer”, as a result of immigration. Well, Poland has atotal fertility rate of 1.2, which means a rapid slide to inviability unless it allows more immigration. “Civilisation”, as it has often been over the past two centuries, is in Trump’s case a racist and white supremacist concept. The erasure the Trump government appears to fear is of “white” culture.There is and was no such thing. Our language, science,mathematics, music, cuisine, literature, art and – thanks to the legacy of colonial and post-colonial looting – much of our wealth, originated elsewhere. Italian cooking might be unimaginable without tomatoes but, originating in South America, they were not widely useduntil the 19th century. The balti might have a greater claim to be the UK’s national dish than fish and chips (aPortuguese import), as itoriginated here. The roast beef of Old England, from an animal domesticated in the Middle East, was enjoyed by the elite: the rest derived much of their protein from dal (pease pottage, pease pudding, pea soup). This changed only when the means were found ofpreserving and shippingmeat from animals raised in the colonies. Widespread beef consumption in Britain required the civilisational erasure of Indigenous peoples in the Americas, Australia and New Zealand, and the eradication of their ecosystems.Some rulers once understood the power of pluralism. King Stephen I of Hungary, who reigned from 1001 to 1038, noted that the cultures and knowledge of foreignersenriched the realm, while “a country unified in language and customs is fragile and weak”. A thousand years later, Trump appears to have forgotten this obvious truth.What I’m talking about, by contrast, is actual erasure: the literal disappearance of society. Once the fertility rate falls below 2.1, it keeps falling, and the slide towards zero looks inexorable. This doesn’t mean I’ve become a “pronatalist” (wanting to see rising birthrates). I’m neither pronatalist nor antinatalist, as both positions are equally futile. As David Runciman points out in his excellentsummary of the sciencein the London Review of Books, the opportunity costs of having children rise with prosperity, leading inexorably to falling birthrates. In some parts of the world, this process began in the 16th and 17th centuries. No government constraint or incentive, it seems, can significantly alter the trajectory.For years I’ve been arguing with peoplewho want to reducethe human population for environmental reasons. I’ve pointed out that the growth rate today was established before most of us were born: as aUN reportexplains, “Considerable population growth continues today because of the high numbers of births in the 1950s and 1960s, which have resulted in larger base populations with millions of young people reaching their reproductive years over succeeding generations.” In other words, those who obsess about too many people are fighting a mathematical function. Global (and, in the UK, national) population will continue to rise for a while, beforesweeping dramatically downwards, largely as a matter of demographic momentum.The only thing the obsessives could do to change the peaking point by more than a couple of years would be mass murder on an unprecedented scale: slaughtering hundreds of millions of people. This is because the issue is not rising birthrates (the global rate hasbeen in declinesince the year of my birth, 1963), but a risingchild survival rateand greatlyincreased longevity. Ironically, the person who might have caused the greatest depopulation is the self-professed pronatalist Elon Musk, whose dismantling of USAID could, according to an estimate in the Lancet, cause14 million deaths. He wants to see more children born, but appears to care little about whether they survive.It’s Elon Musk’s ‘pronatalist’ bonanza – so many families, so little time | Marina HydeRead moreOtherwise, if the “population control” advocates have any significant impact, it will – because of the long and compounding time lags involved – be to hasten the plunge on the other side of the curve. People have devoted their lives to this fatuity.Why do they cling to the idea long after the evidence has departed? Partly, I believe, because population growth is a highly convenient scapegoat for, and distraction from, the impacts of consumption: wealthy people in the global north canblame much poorerBlack and Brown people in the global south for the environmental crises they themselves have caused. Switching to a plant-based diet or from fossil fuels to renewables, by contrast to altering the size of the human population, are things we can do immediately, humanely and effectively. But blaming other people requires no change, and no confrontation with power.Without immigration, there will, within a number of generations, be no Europe and no United Kingdom. Today’s racist obsessions will look incomprehensible to our ageing descendants, desperate for young people to look after them and keep their countries running. Before long, we’ll be fighting to attract people from overseas. But, as Runciman remarks, “There soon won’t be enough immigrants to go around.”Perhaps this is why, in the new novel by the always prescient Ian McEwan,What We Can Know, set 100 years hence, the dominant global power is Nigeria, one of the few countries that today still has a fertility ratewell above replacement, though it’s also falling fast.Trump’s security strategy, like all far-right politics, is simultaneously preposterous and sinister. But above all, it is wrong.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here’s howRebecca SolnitThere’s much more to do, but we should be encouraged by the progress we have madeFri 12 Dec 2025 12.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 21.05 CETShareToday marks the 10th anniversary of the Paris climate treaty, one of the landmark days in climate-action history. Attending the conference as a journalist, I watched and listened and wondered whether 194 countries could ever agree on anything at all, and the night before they did, people who I thought were more sophisticated than me assured me they couldn’t. Then they did. There are a lot of ways to tell the story of what it means and where we are now, but any version of it needs respect for the complexities, because there are a lot of latitudes between the poles of total victory and total defeat.I had been dreading the treaty anniversary as an occasion to note that we have not done nearly enough, but in July I thought we might be able celebrate it. Because, on 23 July, the international court of justice handed down an epochal ruling that gives that treaty enforceable consequences it never had before. It declares that all nations have a legal obligation to act in response to the climate crisis, and, as Greenpeace Internationalputit, “obligates states to regulate businesses on the harm caused by their emissions regardless of where the harm takes place. Significantly, the court found that the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is fundamental for all other human rights, and that intergenerational equity should guide the interpretation of all climate obligations.” The Paris treaty wascitedrepeatedly as groundwork for this decision.Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s special envoy for climate, said of the decision: “I choose my words carefully when I say that this may well be the most consequential case in the history of humanity.” Costa Rica’s Christiana Figueres, who presided over the negotiations that created that Paris climate treatydeclared, with jubilation, on her podcast: “The reason why I am truly tearful is this is without a doubt, the most far-reaching, the most comprehensive and the most consequential legal opinion we’ve ever had.”This case that ended in the world’s highest court began with 27 law students in the University of the South Pacific who in 2019, asked themselves what they could do about climate – and it’s not hard to imagine a “what can we do, we’re only students” or “what can we do, we’re from tiny remote nations” stance. Instead, they set out to take a case all the way to the international court of justice in The Hague, unimpeded by the conventional wisdom that they were nobody from nowhere. They needed a law firm, and they choseBlue Ocean Lawfirm, sticking with the Pacific island nations, with indigenous leadership, with the impacted global south. And they needed a country to be plaintiff and the island nation of Vanuatu stepped up. The unanimous court decision in favor of the litigants matters most of all in how it is implemented, either through direct cases or through its impact on nations that take notice and reduce their climate devastation before they’re brought to court.It’s not widely known that most countries and negotiators went into the conference expecting to set a “reasonable” two-degree threshold global temperature rise we should not cross. As my friend Renato Redentor Constantino, a climate organizer in the Philippines, wrote:“The powerful exerted tremendous effort to keep a tiny number, 1.5, out of United Nations documents. 1.5 degrees centigrade represents what science advises as the maximum allowable rise in average global temperature relative to preindustrial temperature levels. It was the representatives of the mostly global-south nations of the Climate Vulnerable Forum who fought to change the threshold from 2 degrees to 1.5.”I remember them chanting “1.5 to stay alive”, because two degrees was a death sentence for too many places and people. The officially powerless swayed the officially powerful, and 1.5 degrees was written into the treaty and has became a familiar number in climate conversations ever since. Even though we’ve crashed into that 1.5 threshold, far better that it be set there than at 2 degrees, in which case we might well be complacent in the face of even more destructive temperature rise.It takes far more than storytelling to get where we need to go, but how we tell the stories is crucial. I asked the climate policy expert Leah Stokes of UC Santa Barbara about the impact of Paris and she told me: “When small island nations pushed for 1.5 degrees as the target, they also requested the IPCC [intergovernmental panel on climate change] write a special report on what policy would be required to get there. That report came out in October 2018, and rocked around the world with headlines like ‘we have 12 years’. It changed the entire policy conversation to be focused on cutting pollution in half by 2030. Then, when it came time to design a climate package, Biden made it clear that his plan was to try to meet that target. You can draw a line between small islands’ fierce advocacy through to the passage of the largest climate law in American history.”That’s how change often works, how an achievement ripples outward, how the indirect consequences matter as well as the direct ones. The Biden administration tried to meet the 1.5 degree target with the most ambitious US climate legislation ever, the Build Back Better Act that passed Congress after much pressure and conflict as the Inflation Reduction Act. Rumors of the Inflation Reduction Act’s death are exaggerated; some pieces of its funding and implementation are still in effect, and it prompted other nations to pursue more ambitious legislation. In the US, state and local climate efforts, have not been stopped by the Trump administration. Globally not nearly enough has been done to stop deforestation, slash fossil-fuel subsidies, and redesign how we live, move, and consume.The renewables revolution is a bright spot. It’s often overlooked because it’s incremental, technical, economic, and dispersed, and even its major milestones don’t receive nearly the recognition they should. When the Paris treaty was signed, renewables were overall more expensive than fossil fuel, and were not widely implemented. But the drop in cost and spread of solar has outstripped virtually all predictions. The energy-policy group Emberreports: “Record solar power growth and stagnating fossil fuels in 2025 show how clean power has become the driving force in the power sector. Historically a growth segment, fossil power now appears to be entering a period of stagnation and managed decline.” The International Energy Agencynotesanother 2025 landmark: “The electricity sector is now the largest energy employer, surpassing fuel supply for the first time, as the age of electricity gathers pace.”Anyone who in 2015 accurately prophesied what the energy landscape would look like in 2025 would have been thought to be ridiculous, delusional, or crazy (just like anyone who said in, say, 1995 that the UK would close its last coal-fired plant in 2024 would have been). 2025 is the year that renewablesoutstrippedcoal as an energy source. Ancillary developments like battery storage technology and design improvements and innovations have led to widespread renewables adoption from Denmark (which gets only 10% of its electricity from fossil fuels) to Texas to Pakistan (where small-scale solar panels from China have led something of an energy revolution). Solar power is nowso cheap and abundantin Australia that electricity is going to be free for three hours in the middle of the day.Problems that the enemies of climate action liked to cite, such as the intermittency of sun and wind, have been addressed with battery storage. California now often produces more than 100% of its electricity needs through renewables, led by solar, in the daytime. The excess goes into the batteries so that the state literally runs on sunshine at night. California uses 44% less natural gas to produce electricity than it did two years ago. China is reducing its emissions because it’s speedily transitioning to renewables; earlier this fall, in the United Nations, for the first time it made an actual commitment to reduction targets; and for the last eighteen months its CO2 emissions have been flat or falling.Is this good enough? Far from it, but we are, as they say, “bending the curve”: before Paris the world was headed for 4 degrees of warming; it’s now headed for 2.5 degrees, which should only be acceptable as a sign that we have bent it and must bend more and faster. In the best-case scenario, the world’s leaders and powers would have taken the early warnings about climate change seriously and we’d be on the far side of a global energy transition, redesign of how we live, and protection of oceans, rainforests, and other crucial climate ecosystems. But thanks to valiant efforts by the climate movement and individual leaders and nations, we’re not in the worst-case scenario either. Landmarks like the Paris treaty and the Vanuatu victory matter, as do the energy milestones, and there’s plenty left to fight for. For decades and maybe centuries it has has been too late to save everything, but it will never be too late to save anything.This article was amended on 12 December 2025 to clarify that 2025 is the year renewables, not just wind and sun, outstripped coal as an energy source.Explore more on these topicsParis climate agreementOpinionRenewable energyCOP 21: Paris climate change conference 2015EnergyClimate crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

The US declares itself our enemy. Europeemerges as its main adversaryin theUS national security strategy. Russia is its friend, not us. Everything that looked solid since the second world war is turned upside down; the land of the free becomes the destroyer of democratic values. Appeasement fails.He may ramble, but Donald Trump speaks plainly. He means what he says, and he hates everything European. Except its emerging“patriotic” parties, which he wants to support. His strategy warns of “civilizational erasure”, claiming Europe will soon “become majority non-European” and parroting the racist conspiracy known as the great replacement theory. Describing Europeans as “weak”, “decaying” and “destroying their countries”, with “real stupid” leaders, Trump responded to the question of whether they would still be allies, ina Politico interview, with a hint of threat: “It depends.”Note this: the official US strategy says that “the growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism”. He is what he is, in plain sight. No more pretending his fickle ways can be reversed. He appears to back the EU’s nativists, which his strategy suggests are “political allies”. Why wouldn’t he? British politics is already under threat from Russian and Chinese hacking and interference, as in the case of Reform’sformer Welsh leader– who has been jailed for taking Russian bribes. Expect electoral threats from the US from now on. Trump regards Europe’s vain struggle to protect itself – via itsDigital Services Act– from the worst excesses of US tech giants as an act of treachery.Britain looks singularly vulnerable to danger from this US friend turned enemy. But at least here’s one simple political defence that needs immediate action. Next month, the government is expected to publish its elections bill, but so far it has only weak suggestions for protecting our democracy from gross interference by hostile actors. Unlike many countries, we have no cap on political donations. Elon Musk wasreportedly going to back Reformwith £100m, a sum that buys a party – although he denied that specific figure. Though foreign, he can do it legally by paying out of his companies’ UK profits. He fell out with Farage, but might swerve back, and other plutocrats may support the hard right wherever the door is left open to their malign influence.This week, the government published itsanti-corruption strategy, drawn up by Margaret Hodge, its anti-corruption champion, together with David Lammy, and designed to arrest a steep decline: this year the UKfell from 11th to 20thin Transparency International’s corruption perceptions index.This new strategy on tax evasion, money laundering and the professional enablers of corruption – lawyers, accountants, PR companies – was welcomed by campaigners. More than £100bn islaundered a yearin Britain, according to the National Crime Agency, not just through the seedy world of fake barber, vape and sweet shops but reaching to the very top. Kleptocrats launder their reputations as well as their money using philanthropy, cultural institutions,private schools, universitiesand football teams, all over-eager for funds with too few questions asked.But one section of the strategy concerns political influence:Home Office pollingshows 73% of people are concerned about corrupt actors in the political system, and they are right to be. Today the FT revealed that a German private bankgave £300,000 to the Toriesbefore the last election: as it came from an illegal foreign source, it was given back. But it shows how many interests want to sway our elections. A£75,000 donationto Robert Jenrick was revealed to arrive from a UK-based company that took significant loans from a business registered in the British Virgin Islands. Jenrick said the donation was “perfectly legal and valid”, which is what’s wrong with the law.This month, the Electoral Commission has reported that a £9m donation to Reform UK isthe single largest everfrom a living person. Of all donations to Reform, 75% have come from justthree wealthy men. That £9m from one of them, a crypto investor, was not in cryptocurrency, but future donations could be. The government is weighing up whether to ban crypto donations, a shady sector that should be kept well away from political donations.On lobbying rules and onrestoring the independenceof the Electoral Commission, as called for by campaigners, we wait to see if the bill will be tougher than suggested so far. (For another day is the lack of proportional representation, which Labour will regret eternally.) As it stands, cleaning up political donations is a clear win for a distrusted party. Hodge has managed to drag them as far as at least reviewing it. Now they need to do it. As Full Fact, the Electoral Commission and a coalition of democracy and anti-corruption organisations propose, multiple reforms are needed: an annual cap on spending on election campaigns, instead of just restricting it in the pre-election period, would stop vast sums spent on preparing data and social media ahead of time. They want a £15,000 maximum single-person donation, but any cap would be a start.It will take unflinching action to restore public trust, but Labour could wash away public suspicion after the cabinet’s minor but painful moral embarrassment in taking gifts and tickets. Cash for honours is illegal, but a Conservative benefactor donatingmore than £3m to the partycan find a seat in the Lords. Stop donations from companies and unions when these eyewatering sums swashing about in our politics disgust the public. Brave public wrath by explaining that public subsidy to politics is a lesser evil than private corruption.The Labour manifesto says: “We will protect democracy by strengthening the rules around donations to political parties.” Will it, really? The democratic threat is terrifying. The time for timidity is over, for appeasing the US, for pretending Brexit can ever work – and for allowing big money into politics. For a government so low in the polls, boldness is the only way up.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsParty fundingOpinionDonald TrumpThe far rightEuropean UnionEuropeCorruption index and barometerReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Reports suggest that heeagerly discussedthe prospect of an invasion behind closed doors. Advisers eventually talked him down. Instead, the US pursued a “maximum pressure” strategy of sanctions and threats.But Mr Maduro is still in place. And Mr Trump’s attempts to remove him are ramping up again. The US has amassed its largest military presence in the Caribbean sincethe 1989 invasion of Panama. It has carried out more than 20 shockingstrikes on alleged drug boats. Mr Trump reportedlydelivered an ultimatumlate last month, telling the Venezuelan leader that he could have safe passage from his country if he left immediately. There was already a $50m bounty on his head. This week came expanded sanctions and theseizure of a tanker.Mr Maduro, who took over from Hugo Chávez in 2013, swore himself into officefor a third termin January despitecompelling evidencethat the opposition candidate Edmundo González had easily beaten him in last summer’s election. But Mr Trump is not concerned about his dubious electoral credentials and authoritarianism. Nor do the administration’s claims to be tackling drugs cartels convince – though images of boat bombings may be viscerally pleasing to Mr Trump’s base. Venezuela is neither a significant producer of nor major conduit for drugs consumed in the US. And Mr Trump has just pardoned the former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández for major drugs-related convictions.But Mr Maduro’s failures have given Venezuelans good reason to flee. Around 700,000 of the 8 million who have left the country because of its economic collapse have ended up in the US. Mr Trump is determined to cut migration – though destabilising Venezuela, by turning the economic screws further or ousting Mr Maduro, is more likely toincrease refugee flows.Mr Trump’s declaration that the US would probably hold on to the tanker shipment will play to Mr Maduro’s claims that the US is solely motivated by oil. Those seemoverblown. The country has a fifth of the world’s known reserves, but accounts for less than 1% of production.María Corina Machado, the country’s best-known opposition leader and the winner of this year’s Nobel peace prize, described the US seizure as“very necessary”. She has previously proposed a $1.7tn privatisation programme, promisingmassive opportunitiesto foreign investors. Mr Trump is also clearly concerned about China’s growing role in Latin America, and Venezuela has signedenergy and mining dealswith Beijing – though it reportedlyoffered the USaccess to its mineral wealth in the vain hope that it would back off.But one might also surmise that Mr Trump is piqued at failing to remove Mr Maduro the first time around. Though his envoy Richard Grenell has promoted talks with Caracas, his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, is a longstanding hawk on leftist authoritarians in Latin America. His secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host, appears far out of his depth. While a full-scale invasion remains unlikely, land strikes cannot be ruled out if Mr Maduro clings on. Democratswarnthat the administration is “sleepwalking us into a war” that would further punish Venezuelans. Yet there is little reason to believe that escalated coercion would succeed where years of sanctions, isolation and economic collapse have failed.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This year it has achieved both. For the first time, an artist with learning disabilities has won. Glasgow-bornNnena Kalutook the award for her colourful, cocoon-like sculptures made from VHS tape, clingfilm and other abandoned materials, along with her large swirling vortex drawings. Kalu is autistic, with limited verbal communication. In anacceptance speechon her behalf, Kalu’s facilitator, Charlotte Hollinshead, said that “a very stubborn glass ceiling” had been broken.Kalu’s win is a high-profile symbol of a shift towards greater inclusivity that has been happening in the UK arts world over the past five years. Last month,Beyond the Visualopened at the Henry Moore Institute, Leeds, in which everything is curated or created by blind and partially sighted artists. The exhibits range from Moore sculptures (which visitors are encouraged to touch) to David Johnson’s10,000 stone-plaster digestive biscuitsstamped with braille.Design and Disabilityat the V&A South Kensington is showcasing the ways in which disabled, deaf and neurodivergent people have shaped culture from the 1940s to now.During the pandemic, arts institutions were forced to close and to reconsider their purpose. The2021 Turner prizeresponded with a shortlist comprised entirely of artists’ collectives, including the Hastings-basedProject Art Worksfor neurodivergent people. The following year, disabled artists staged a one-day takeover of museums and galleries entitledWe Are Invisible We Are Visible (WAIWAV), uncovering hidden aspects of the disabled experience from Gateshead to St Ives. In 2023, theMiddlesbrough Institute of Modern Art (MIMA)set up a residency programme for disabled curators, with ashow by 15 disabled, deaf and neurodivergent artistslast year.This year’s Turner prize has brought this work into mainstream contemporary art. The judges compared Kalu’s sculptures to 3D versions of abstract expressionist paintings andsaidthat while “the quality and uniqueness of her work is inseparable from who she is as an artist”, her neurodivergence did not influence their decision. Some critics were unconvinced, accusing the panel of confusing“therapy with talent”and making“a collective act of goodwill”over aesthetic judgment.But all art is inseparable from who the artist is to some degree. Kelu’s work can only be understood visually – her sculptures and drawings must speak for themselves. They challenge us to look and think in new and different ways. This is what art can do.In a week when US diplomats were farcicallyorderedto return to using Times New Roman typeface in official communications, rather than the presumably “woke”Calibri– adopted because it is more accessible for people with disabilities – a recognition of the insights diversity can offer couldn’t be more timely.Credit must go to the charityActionSpace, which has supported Kalu and other learning-disabled artists in London for many years. It is part of a growing network of supportive studios across the country, includingIntoart,based in south London,Venture Artsin Manchester andProject Abilityin Glasgow. At a time of crisis in the arts, and controversy over disability and special educational needs funding, the Turner prize has shone a light on their vital work. If these organisations are not given the financial support they need, they will no longer be able to support prize-winning artists of the future.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I spent more than 30 years working on the prototype – the large complex of buildings that the architects Chamberlin, Powell and Bon designed for the University of Leeds, constructed circa 1970.All of the design features in theBarbicanwere there in the Leeds complex of offices, laboratories, library and so on, including all the problems. I always explained to visitors that I regarded the Chamberlin buildings primarily as a large-scale piece of brutalist sculpture rather than as a working environment.Several cycles of remediation and refurbishment have been undertaken by the university over subsequent decades and, if they haven’t done so already, those undertaking the Barbican refurbishments might consider jumping on the train to Leeds to see how the university has weatherproofed and humanised the buildings.Alan RadfordHorsforth, West YorkshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

One aspect he did not mention was the strategic nuclear balance. Since the late 1940s, responsibility for deterrence has always lain with the Pentagon and has succeeded in keeping the peace, though at times a very fragile version of it.The recent US statement on defence makes it clear thatEuropeis no longer seen as a priority by the Trump administration, the danger now being that doubt is crucially being raised as to the credibility of Nato’s deterrent. Without certainty of a reaction in kind, Russia, under its ambitious and risk-taking president, might be tempted to chance its arm in what almost looks like a ceding of Europe by the US into a Russian “sphere of influence”.IfVladimir Putintriumphs in Ukraine, the future of the Baltic states will probably move up Putin’s agenda – and after that, who knows? In the 1930s, Europe ignored a clear existential threat, and millions paid for it. Europe has to realise that its superior economic and military potential has to be mobilised to secure not just the future of Ukraine, but the stability of Europe.Bill JonesHonorary professor of political studies, Liverpool Hope UniversityThe suggestion by Timothy Garton Ash thatBelgiumis acting egotistically in resisting the seizure of Russian assets is somewhat harsh. The potential financial liability in the unlikely event of an adverse international legal ruling at some future date would virtually bankrupt the country. Surely it is the resistance of the other EU countries in sharing this liability that is the problem.Robin WilsonLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I no longer have the dread of weekends and holidays with insurmountable mountains of work. The move to a four-day teaching week would need to be thought about carefully.I, for one, would not want to have one full day out of school – this would mean four straight days of teaching. In most schools, a day not teaching would equate to five planning, preparation and assessment periods (PPAs).I think most full-time teachers would rather this was spread across five days, with the option of blocking an afternoon where they could leave the building. Flexibility in teaching needs to be about giving teachers a choice. Five PPAs is hardly radical ideology – it was the norm when I started teaching in 2007.Peter RussellSheffieldFlexible working for teachers has clear benefits, but it cannot solve the fundamental issue: schools are underresourced and workloads are extensive. Within current time requirements, a four-day week is not deliverable. Compressing teaching hours would only intensify pressure, limit schools’ ability to cover staff absence and increase reliance on supply or cover supervisors, to the detriment of pupils.Rather than a blanket four-day week, the priority for the government should be reducing workload (including through streamlined accountability), improving resourcing and embedding genuinely healthy flexible-working practices across the sector.Antonia SpinksChief executive, Pioneer Educational TrustHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is that Starmer shows through this the complete dearth of ideas available to European social democracy.Faced with the growth of Hayekian anti-state politics in the 1970s and 1980s, social democratic parties abandoned the idea of ameliorating the worst impacts of capitalism and became little more than a reserve managerial class occasionally allowed to manage. The problem is that they are now entirely devoid of coherent politics.Europe’s ageing populations and stagflating economies desperately need immigrant labour. Facing a rightwing discourse that is as wrong on immigration as it is on the climate crisis, Starmer and co can’t mount an ideological retort, and instead bleat about “legitimate concerns”, falling into line with Donald Trump’s power play about the “stark prospect of civilisational erasure” (‘Cultivate resistance’: policy paper lays bare Trump support for Europe’s far right, 5 December).When John F Kennedy was killed, Malcolm X said the chickens were coming home to roost. Starmer’s attack on the European convention on human rights is more like turkeys dressing up to celebrate Christmas.Nick MossLondonKeir Starmer and Mette Frederiksen claim to be speaking for all citizens when they say want to amend the ECHR in order to “control our borders” (We must protect our borders to defend our democracies. Here’s how, 9 December). They don’t speak for me, and, I’d argue, a majority of citizens whose voices never get heard in the press or in government policy.Migrants – whether refugees or “economic migrants” – have made this country better culturally and economically, bringing in new ideas, entrepreneurialism and some wonderful friends and neighbours.Freedom of movement is a core part of the human experience throughout time, and the ECHR doesn’t just protect refugees, it defends the rights of all of us, so chipping away at it will impoverish our freedoms when we need them more than ever. Who knows when people in the UK might need to flee a natural or human-made disaster?Starmer’s government is Blue Labour through and through, echoing many bot-inspired Maga talking points from migration to disability because they have little else to offer. It is not the Labour party I know and have voted for.Dr Deborah TalbotHarescombe, GloucestershireLet me get this straight. Donald Trump accuses Europe of being weak on immigration (Trump lambasts ‘weak’ and ‘decaying’ Europe and hints at walking away from Ukraine, 9 December), and hours later our leaderswrite that they want to take tougher action to protect our borders. I don’t think most Europeans want Europe to become Little America. We want to be a continent where human rights matter, and where our politicians, instead of scapegoating our migrant friends and neighbours, tackle the real crises we face: housing, wages, and public service cuts.To defend our democracies, we need our leaders to addressextreme wealth inequalities, not protect our borders from vulnerable people. The rise in popularity of green and truly progressive parties shows that if they are not willing to act for the many, we will replace their politics of fat cats and division with the politics of care and solidarity.Dimitra BlanaAberdeenSo, in order to halt the racist far right, you compete with them to abandon liberal democratic policies and beliefs?

A further hazard was the ever present risk of an inadvertent airstrike by US warplanes hunting alleged cocaine smugglers.After three hours drifting in the darkness, the flimsy boat finally made contact with a larger vessel sent to take Machado to Curaçao, a former Dutch colony that remains part of the kingdom of the Netherlands. From there, the 58-year-old politician would travel by private jet, via the US, to Oslo, where the Nobel prize was due to be awarded to her within hours. The relief was intense.“There was a moment when I felt like there was real risk to my life,” Machado told the Guardian in Oslo on Friday. “But it was a very spiritual moment because in the end I felt like I was in God’s hands and it would be in his hands. He decided for me to be here and able to hug my family and other families of political prisoners.”The clandestine 5,500-mile (8,850km) journey fromVenezuelato Norway was organised by Bryan Stern, a US special forces veteran who heads the Grey Bull Rescue Foundation, a Florida-based NGO specialising in the “rescue [of] Americans and allies from conflict and disaster zones”, according to its website.View image in fullscreenMachado in Oslo on Friday.Photograph: Ole Berg-Rusten/APSterndescribed on Wednesdaythe challenges of organising the escape of Machado. “She has a very large target on her back,” Stern told CBS News. “This is not a random shopkeeper who doesn’t want to be in Venezuela any more. This is moving around a rock star.”SinceNicolás Madurotook power in 2013, Venezuela has been in economic mayhem, subjected to hyperinflation, hunger and increasingly authoritarian rule. Last year, Maduro was accused of stealing the presidential election and launched a wave of repression, forcing Machado into hiding. Independently verified data shows the poll was won by Machado’s ally Edmundo González.The Wall Street Journal reported that Machadowore a wig and a disguiseto flee a safehouse in a suburb of Caracas, the Venezuelan capital. She then crossed 10 roadblocks before arriving in a remote fishing port where helpers had prepared a small fishing skiff.The battered boat had been chosen primarily because it was so different in appearance from the powerful and fast vessels favoured by cocaine smugglers.‘Follow the path of exiles’: María Corina Machado’s US-aided escape from VenezuelaRead moreBut still, the fear lurked that US forces could mistake the high-seas rendezvous for a contraband handover and inadvertently launch an airstrike on the conservative leader who dedicated her Nobel win to Donald Trump.Since August, the US president has ramped uppressureon Maduro, putting a $50m bounty on his head and ordering a massive military buildup in the Caribbean – as well as a series of deadly airstrikes on alleged narco vessels,killing more than 80 people. On Wednesday, the USseized a “dark fleet” oil tankernear Venezuela, which Caracas denounced as “blatant theft”.In order to reduce the risk of an airstrike, Stern told US defence officials some of his planned route. But many perils remained.He said: “It was dangerous. It was scary. The sea conditions were ideal for us, but certainly not water that you would want to be on … The higher the waves, the harder it is for radar to see. That’s how it works.”A technical fault delayed the skiff, while its primary GPS system was swept away by waves and a backup navigation device failed, the WSJ reported. “The seas are very rough. It’s pitch black. We’re using flashlights to communicate. This is very scary, lots of things can go wrong,” Sterntold the BBC.Amid growing fears they could miss the rendezvous, the two boats finally met and the politician reached Curaçao by mid-afternoon on Tuesday.On Wednesday mornin,g a private jet carrying Machado departed for Norway, via a stop on the US east coast.She arrived in Oslo too late for the Wednesday eveningprize-giving ceremonybut appeared on a balcony of the Grand Hotel in the Norwegian capital early on Thursday, waving and blowing kisses to cheering supporters chanting “freedom”. The last time she had appeared in public was in Caracas in January, when sheprotested over Maduro’s inauguration for his third term.0:57Crowds cheer as Venezuelan Nobel laureate María Corina Machado appears in Norway – videoTheNobel peace prizewas awarded to Machado for “her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy”.Stern said the operation to get her to Oslo was financed by “a few generous donors” and that the US government “did not contribute a single penny”. The decision to leave Venezuela and join the Nobel events in Oslo would have come at both personal and political risk to Machado, say analysts.Benedicte Bull, a professor specialising in Latin America at the University of Oslo, said: “She risks being arrested if she returns even if the authorities have shown more restraint with her than with many others, because arresting her would have a very strong symbolic value.”In her acceptance speech on Wednesday, read by one of her daughters, Machado denounced kidnappings and torture under Maduro, calling them crimes against humanity and “state terrorism, deployed to bury the will of the people”.She added: “Of course, the risk of going back, perhaps it’s higher, but it’s always worthwhile.

According toCNN, the criminal charges involve 54 specifications of “indecent visual recording” and other related offenses concerning 44 identified victims.While the military’s case centers on the alleged recordings, the updated civil suit goes further, accusing McGraw of assault, sexual assault and battery underTexaslaw. The filing claims he “intentionally and knowingly made harmful and offensive physical contact” during gynecological exams. McGraw treated patients at Fort Hood beginning in 2023.One active-duty soldier described an encounter during a rape-kit examination in which she suspects McGraw took photos of her.“During that deeply vulnerable procedure, he was constantly on his phone while between her legs,” the lawsuit states. The woman now believes he used his phone to photograph her during the exam.The complaint also says that McGraw “failed to document in her medical records that a rape kit had ever been performed”. Prosecutors who subsequently pressed her case in criminal court “lacked clear forensic documentation, and her assailant was ultimately acquitted”, the complaint contends.“McGraw’s misconduct in this setting did not merely fail to protect a victim of sexual violence,” the filing adds. “It actively undermined her access to justice and allowed her perpetrator to escape accountability.”Legal experts and advocacy groups told theWashington Postthe case may test whether recent Pentagon reforms to address sexual misconduct and support survivors are working as intended.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryUS crimeTexasWomennewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, we were so much better off under the Tories, you could get a meeting, they engaged with you. This whole process has been incredibly haphazard.”Another figure in the sector noted that after the murder of Sarah Everard, the Conservative government reopened a public consultation. “We saw more senior ministers and had more contact with the secretary of state under the last government,” they said. “Ministers like Alex Davies-Jones andJess Phillipshave clearly worked hard on this, but it feels the machine has worked against them.”The Guardian view on policing: the lesson of Sarah Everard’s murder is that a culture of impunity must be stamped out | EditorialRead moreFurther concern is that the publication of the strategy, which is expected just before parliament closes for the Christmas recess, will be lost. “They’ve had 18 months and now they’re scrabbling around in the last week of parliament. It just feels like an afterthought,” said one source. “It hasn’t felt like it’s been a properly considered process where they’ve really sought the expertise in a considered way. It’s been slightly haphazard.”On Tuesday Karen Bradley, the chair of the home affairs committee,wrote to Phillips and Davies-Jonesto complain that “there has been poor engagement and transparency with VAWG stakeholders throughout the development of the VAWG strategy”. She noted that the VAWG advisory board – which contained experts to guide policy – had met only twice in person and once online and its role had been limited.Andrea Simon, the director of the End Violence Against Women and Girls coalition, said there had been positive moves from the government, including£550m of funding for victim support, and proposed law changes toimprove the fair treatment of victims in rape trialsand bandepictions of strangulation in pornography. She called on the government to commit to a monitoring and evaluation structure for the strategy, to ensure accountability.“Without that, the government will potentially fall foul of the lack of oversight we’ve seen in previous, underresourced strategies,” she said. “There has been a lot of rhetoric about commitment to halving VAWG through a cross-government approach, but that won’t stand up unless they are willing to be open, transparent, and bring in external scrutiny.”While stories were emerging about the strategy in the press, a different figure said a full document had not been shared with even a small number of trusted parties. “You have to ask how a cross-governmental, strong strategy is being built if none of the experts are at the table,” they said.Karen Ingala Smith, a co-founder of the Femicide Census, said it was “disappointed” not to have been invited to join the VAWG advisory board, adding that the two wider meetings she or her co-founder, Clarrie O’Callaghan, had attended felt like “box-ticking” exercises.“It felt like it wouldn’t have mattered what we said, it wasn’t going to make any difference to what was written,” she said. “It felt perfunctory and tokenistic.”For the past decade the Femicide Census has provided Phillips with the names of all women killed by men over a year for her toread out in parliament near International Women’s Day. The VAWG minister told the Guardian last year thatending the “scourge of femicide”would be a “fundamental part” of the government’s promise to drastically reduce violence against women and girls. “But it has been quiet since then, and we are concerned that promise will be watered down,” said Ingala Smith.A government spokesperson said: “It is our mission to halve violence against women and girls within the next decade. This requires a total transformation across government.“Our violence against women and girls strategy does exactly that. It is targeted at preventing these awful crimes, tackling perpetrators so they can’t offend again, and helping victims to get justice.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsViolence against women and girlsJess PhillipsLabourConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

The basin is the lowest point in North America, according to theNational Park Service.Repeated storms from September through November filled the flat with runoff, forming a thin layer of water. This year’s version is smaller and shallower than the one seen two years prior, when remnants of Hurricane Hilary drenched the area – and briefly even made it possible to kayak there.The park received in just two monthsmore precipitationthan it usually does in an entire year. From September to November, 2.41in of rain fell in Death Valley, according to the National Weather Service. November alone brought 1.76in, surpassing the 1923 record of 1.7in.Between 128,000 and 186,000 years ago, glaciers blanketed the Sierra Nevada. Meltwater from those ice sheets fed rivers that drained into a massive valley lake, the original Lake Manly, which once stretched nearly 100 miles (160km) long.Today, the basin is ordinarily bone-dry, its surface cracked by sun and wind. But the recent deluge transformed it once again, offering visitors a glimpse of how the desert might have looked millennia ago.Rock star: Sasha DiGiulian on making history with a ‘crazy, audacious’ climb of El CapitánRead moreExperts have also warned of the broader environmental shifts taking place in Death Valley. When temperatures in recent years climbed near 130F (54.4C), so-calledheat touristsflocked to experience the extreme conditions first-hand. The rising heat has prompted concerns about the risks posed to native plants, birds and wildlife.In August 2023, more than 2in of rain fell in asingle dayin Death Valley, breaking previous records for rainfall. The flooding washed away trails, causing the park to close until mid-October. In July of that same year, the valley brokeheat recordsby reaching temperatures of 128F (53.3C). The hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth is 134F (56.7C) in July 1913 in the same section of the park.In 2016, a series of storms with heavy rainfall brought a raresuperbloomof millions of wildflowers to Death Valley.

His wife Viviane Barci de Moraes – who was added the sanctions list in September – was also removed from the register on Friday.The move had been repeatedly requested by Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in negotiations withDonald Trumpto roll back the 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports.The decision is a major setback for Bolsonaro and his congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who left his post inBrazilto lobby in Washington for punitive measures over what he called a “persecution” of his father.Trump imposed the punishment shortly after imposing tariffs on Brazil, justifying it as a response to what he claimed was a “witch-hunt” against Bolsonaro. Eduardo Bolsonaro has alleged that he influenced Trump’s decision.Moraes presided over the trial hearing in September when Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting to overturn Brazil’s 2022 election. Days later, the Magnitsky sanctions were extended to the justice’s wife.Bolsonaro’s supporters had hoped for further retaliation against Brazil, but what followed wasan unexpected rapprochement between Trump and Lula.The US president first praised his Brazilian counterpart during the UN general assembly; the two then exchanged calls, held their first in-person meeting, and, in November, Trump removed most of the tariffs.With the sanctions lifted from Moraes and his wife, Eduardo Bolsonaropostedon social media that he “received with regret” the news, while thanking Trump “for the support demonstrated throughout this process and for the attention he gave to the serious crisis of freedoms affecting Brazil”.He added that he will continue “working firmly and resolutely to find a path that allows for the liberation of our country, for as long as necessary and despite adverse circumstances. May God bless America, and may He have mercy on the Brazilian people.”Bolsonaro is already serving his sentence in a special cell at the Federal Police headquarters in Brasília.This week, the lower house approved a law that could reduce his time in a closed regime to just over two years.The bill – which still falls short of the full amnesty sought by the far-right leader and his sons – must still pass the senate, where there is also apparent support, before going to Lula; any veto by him would likely be overturned.Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroDonald TrumpAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Email us at changebydegrees@theguardian.comSupported byAbout this contentJames NormanSat 13 Dec 2025 00.00 CETLast modified on Sat 13 Dec 2025 00.28 CETShareAs the Australian summer gets under way, many of us are planning holidays.When it comes to limiting emissions associated with travel, a staycation or local holiday –by train, bus or car– remains the lowest-impact option. But overseas travel by Australians has been increasing in recent decades, with Indonesia, New Zealand, Japan, the United States and China among the top destinations,according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.Globally, tourism makes upabout 9%of global greenhouse gas emissions, with Australians among the top 20 countries in terms of our tourism carbon footprint.While it’s impossible to escape the emissions associated with flying, sustainability remains important formost travellers, and some travel methods are more carbon intensive than others.Fir or faux: which Christmas tree is best for the environment?Read moreSo how do we minimise our impact while fulfilling our human desire to see the world, and how close are we to carbon-free travel?The way you fly mattersAviation accounts for about 2.5% of global CO2emissions, but the climate impact is effectively double due to an added warming effect, called radiative forcing, resulting from emissions at high altitudes.Aviation emissions are also growing exponentially – with a 3.5% increase each year from the travel industry between 2009 and 2019, according to a 2024 study published in Nature Communications.Takeoff and landing are the most carbon intensive parts of flying, so the more directly you can fly, the smaller your overall impact will be. It’s also worth researching which airlines offer the most carbon-friendly flights, which the German climate protection groupAtmosfairmonitors and ranks in its annual reports.Brett Mitchell, Intrepid Travel’s managing director for Australia and New Zealand, says the most effective way for travellers to reduce their carbon footprint is by choosing destinations closer to home, which reduces the carbon intensity of long-haul flights and replacing flights with land-based alternatives where possible.“Travellers can also select lower‑impact itineraries that prioritise sustainable transport options such as walking, cycling or rail … In addition, bringing reusable water bottles, bags and utensils helps minimise single‑use plastics throughout the journey,” he says.Do carbon offsets actually work?The most common way passengers try to minimise their emissions is through carbon offsets, which airlines such as Qantas offer passengers for as cheaply as $2 on a Sydney to Melbourne flight – but do they actually work?Not according to Prof Andrew Macintosh, the former head of the Australian government’s Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee, who has described carbon offsets as“largely a sham”that hurt the environment.“Offsets make you feel like you’re doing something for the climate but are basically a con,” says Rod Campbell, research director at the Australia Institute. Campbell points to Australia Institute research that showed23 examplesof carbon-offset schemes failing to deliver their promised environmental outcomes.He says the whole notion of offsets is flawed and a better alternative was for people to focus on directly reducing their emissions, either through travel choices or in other aspects of their lives.If you can’t avoid flying – to visit family overseas, for example – Campbell suggests supporting companies “that are doing real decarbonisation” rather than relying on offsets. “It can take a bit of research, but lots of companies have been moving away from the most flawed schemes and that deserves support.”Embracing eco-tourismOn a recent trip to Europe from Melbourne to visit my partner’s family, I caught direct flights through China to Athens, and then travelled through Greece, Bulgaria and Romania by boat, train, bus and rental car.Don’t want waste this Christmas? How to give green and sustainable giftsRead moreI drove to asmall organic homestaynear the village of Răchițele, Romania, which welcomes guests and volunteer workers from all over the world. The volunteers can work on the farm and interact with the local community, including assisting with organic vegetable growing and cheesemaking.Zsuzsi Máthé, who runs the farmstay with her partner, says their vision is to bring visitors one step closer to nature, while helping to grow local natural food. “True eco-tourism builds responsibly, eats locally and respects deeply, creating meaningful experiences that honour both nature and the communities that care for it,” Máthé says.From my experience, it can also provide the most nourishing travel experiences possible, stepping out of the hustle of hotel bookings and providing meaningful human connection and nature immersion.The future of travelThe International Energy Agency’snet zero by 2050scenarios anticipate rail will replace a significant share of long-distance road and regional air transport. Some countries,like France,have already banned flights on specific routes where a fast rail service is available.While we’re not there yet, there’s a strong international push towards carbon-free flying. Denmark has pledged to have all domestic flights fossil fuel-free by 2030, Finland by 2035, Iceland by 2040 and Germany by 2045.One Brisbane-based company is hedging its bets on hydrogen-propelled electric flights, noting that Australia has a unique edge because of the amount of space and sun available to produce and export hydrogen using solar.Steffen Geries, chief operating officer ofStralis Aircraft, says the electrification of air travel is already happening, similarly to what has happened with cars. However, the key challenge to overcome is that unlike cars, flights are extremely weight sensitive and require an extraordinary amount of propulsion energy and power.The company is about to fly six-seater hydrogen-electric test flights, which it hopes to extend to 15-seater planes capable of travelling up to 800km by 2030. He says electric air travel will favour more direct, shorter travel routes. “We want to start with Brisbane to Gladstone flights, but we’d hope to improve the technology so we can take more passengers at longer distances of up to 3000km by the mid 2030s.“We are still at the crawl stage now before we start to walk, run or fly.”Explore more on these topicsCarbon footprintsChange by degreesClimate crisisAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The pair scurry past charity shops and through deserted streets, the encounter lit by the security lamps of shuttered takeaways. Each animal inspects the nooks and crannies of the high street before disappearing into the night, ending the unlikely scene captured by CCTV last month.Unlike the fox, the otter has been a rare visitor in towns and cities across the UK. But after decades of intense conservation work, that is changing. In the past year alone, the aquatic mammal has been spotted on a river-boat dock in London’s Canary Wharf, dragging anenormous fish along a riverbank in Stratford-upon-Avon, andplundering garden ponds near York. One otter was even filmed causing chaos in aShetland family’s kitchenin March.Janice Bradley, head of nature recovery for the NottinghamshireWildlifeTrust, says: “Twenty years ago, they were almost nonexistent. Then we saw them coming up the River Trent from other areas. Now, we’ve got records of otters in virtually every river and watercourse in the county. It’s remarkable.”CCTV footage of a fox following an otter around Lincoln city centreNobody knowshow many otters there are in the UK, although it is widely agreed that the population has increased, after nearly being wiped out in the polluted waterways of mid-20th century Britain. Some naturalists estimate there are 11,000 nationwide, but acknowledge that it is guesswork.In the 1970s,surveyors searched nearly 3,000 sitesacross the UK, but found the animals at just 6% of them, mainly in strongholds in Scotland, Wales, Norfolk and south-west England. Now, they are widespread, using their sensitive whiskers and webbed feet to hunt in waters across the country.Their return is afragile tale of improving water quality, say conservationists. The dumping of industrial waste from factories and toxic pesticides ravaged fish populations in British rivers in the 19th and 20th centuries, with disastrous consequences for otters, which ended up consuming a lot of the toxins.View image in fullscreenImproving water quality in rivers has helped otters return, but problems with chemicals and sewage in waterways remain.Photograph: Iain Tall/AlamyBans on harmful pollutants, improving water quality – notwithstanding more recentproblems with water utilities’ dumping of raw sewage– and a targeted reintroduction campaign in the east of the country have all helped their return.Jon Trail, of the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, says: “I think the surveys in the 70s were a lightbulb moment for people, when they realised otters had been seen historically and they couldn’t see them any more.Otters are a really good way of monitoring the health of our waterwaysDr Elizabeth Chadwick, Otter Project“There are old documents detailing encounters between otters and naturalists, yet people had not seen them for years.“It has been a slow burn. Otters typically have one, two, sometimes three youngsters that the female looks after for a year, so it’s a slow recolonisation rate. Over 10 years, you might just have five or six kits, so it was always going to take a bit of time. But now it has passed a tipping point.”Not everyone is happy about the return of the otter in the UK. Anglersblame them for devouring fishat their favourite spots, accusing the animals of disrupting the balance of the river, but many experts say this claim is overblown.Despite theirtraditional portrayalas only preying on fish, otters eat a diverse range of rodents, birds and amphibians, and analysis of their diet shows they rarely go for the large fish prized by the angling community.View image in fullscreenAn ‘otter crossing’ road sign in Northumberland.Photograph: FLPA/AlamyDr Elizabeth Chadwick, head of Cardiff University’sOtter Project, which tests dead otters across the country to monitor pollution levels, says: “When it comes down to native species of fish, there is no evidence that otters are responsible for wiping out stocks. Part of this is a misunderstanding, but it also reflects limited resources.In some UK woodlands, every young tree has died. What’s going wrong?Read more“In British rivers, fish stocks are limited in some places. That’s not because the otters have recovered,” she says.The Otter Project’s findings paint a complicated picture of the recovery, showing that heavy metals,Pfas “forever chemicals”, and pesticides arestill building up in the mammals. But amid growing concern about the health of the UK’s rivers, Chadwick says the otter could become a symbol of the change that many are demanding.“Otters are a really good way of monitoring the health of our waterways. A lot of chemical pollutions build up in an animal over time. They are often at trace levels in water so we cannot detect them in samples. But if you test the top of the food chain, they become detectable,” says Chadwick.“If we can use otters as a sort of charismatic ambassador for river health, that can be really quite a powerful thing.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsWildlifeThe age of extinctionRewildingMammalsRiversConservationPollutionWaterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fewer than 800 Tapanulis were left in the wild before the flooding, and the entire population dwells solely in this tract of forest already threatened by mining, palm oil plantations and a large hydropower project.“It’s a total disaster,” said biological anthropologist Erik Meijaard, one of the first experts to describe the species. “The path to extinction is now a lot steeper.”In a photo reviewed by the Guardian, a dead orangutan was hoisted out of a mud pit in the Central Tapanuli region.View image in fullscreenA Tapanuli orangutan in the Batang Toru forests.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/Alamy“One of the rescue team members who was in search of human casualties had shown me a body believed to be an orangutan that was found in the logs and mud,” said Panut Hadisiswoyo, founding director of the Orangutan Information Centre in Indonesia. “After seeing the photos, I am confident that the decayed body, reddish hair and the size of the skull was a Tapanuli orangutan.”It’s the world’s rarest ape. Now a billion-dollar dig for gold threatens its futureRead moreThere are few modern precedents for such a sudden shock to a great ape population, Meijaard said, apart from the 2000s Ebola outbreaks that devastatedwestern gorillaand chimpanzee populations in central Africa.Biologists have said that even a loss of just 1% of the Tapanuli population each year would be sufficient to drive the Tapanulis to extinction, as the animals only reproduce every six to nine years.Meijaard’s preliminary findings on the toll of the Sumatra floods, to be published this week, estimate a loss of between 6.2% and 10.5% of the Tapanuli orangutan population in just a few days – a critical demographic shock. The draft paper warns that it represents an “extinction-level disturbance” for the species.Assessing the affected zone from satellite imagery, Meijaard and his colleagues found that nearly 4,000 hectares (9,900 acres) of previously intact forest were swept away by landslides and floods, and estimating another 2,500 hectares (6,200 acres) was probably affected though unobserved due to cloud cover.Satellite imagery shows huge gashes in the mountainous landscape, some of which extend for more than a kilometre and are nearly 100 metres wide, Meijaard said. The tide of mud, trees and water toppling down hillsides would have carried away everything in its path, including other wildlife such as elephants.View image in fullscreenAn aerial photograph shows the extent of the devastation caused by the flooding in Indonesia.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesDavid Gaveau, a remote-sensing expert and founder of the conservation startup the Tree Map, said he was flabbergasted by the before and after comparison of the region.“I have never seen anything like this before during my 20 years of monitoring deforestation in Indonesia with satellites,” he said.The devastation means remaining Tapanulis will be even more vulnerable, with sources of food and shelter now washed away.View image in fullscreenA Tapanuli orangutan skeleton found in mud in North Sumatra – between 33 and 54 of the critically endangered apes are thought to have perished.Photograph: Decky Chandra“The rainfall was intense. If you lose your fruit, you lose your flowers, there will be a significant reduction in habitat quality,” Meijaard said.Scientists and environmental advocates have fought for years to protect the endangered apes from mining, hydropower projects and palm oil plantations. The Guardian recently reported that in the weeks before the flooding, PT Agincourt’s Martabe Gold Mine had begun operationsto expandinto a second open pit near Tapanuli orangutan habitat.While human-caused climate breakdown is estimated to have increased rainfall intensity by between 28% and 160% in the affected region, according to a rapid analysis by World Weather Attribution, deforestation and associated land degradation has played a significant role, the government said.In response to the floods, Indonesia’s environment ministry has halted all private-sector activity in the Batang Toru area for an undetermined period.The orangutan experts urged an immediate halt to development that will damage the remaining Tapanuli habitat, and an immediate survey of the region.They also back the expansion of protected areas and work to restore lowland forests.Hadisiswoyo said the region had become eerily quiet after the landslides.“This fragile and sensitive habitat in West Block must be fully protected by halting all habitat-damaging development,” he said.AFP contributed to this reportFind moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsIndonesiaThe age of extinctionEndangered speciesConservationAsia PacificAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

Maia, nine, and her brothers, aged 11 and seven, huddle by a campfire. Their mother, Gisel, rummages through bags that smell of rotten fruit and meat.Situated at the northern end of Argentinian Patagonia, 100km (60 miles) fromVaca Muerta– one of the world’s largest fossil gas reserves – children here roam amid twisted metal, glass and rubbish spread over five hectares (12 acres). The horizon is waste.“Mum, can Icachurear?” Maia asks, using the local slang term for searching out cans, wires or sellable items. She grabs sticks to open bags, looking for toys, false nails, or items to sell. She is saving to buy her mother a gift. Her brothers sit by the fire; the youngest sleepy, the eldest angry.“Cachureanear me,” says Gisel. Slipping on a glove full of holes to dig through the bags, she expects the supermarket truck before noon and hopes for canned or frozen food. Perhaps they will eat meat again, after washing and frying it.View image in fullscreenManzana 34 settlement is 300 metres from the dump and home to about 400 families.Photograph: Nicolás SuárezFrom atop the rubbish mountain the dirt tracks and tin-and-wood shacks of her neighbourhood, Manzana 34, can be seen. About 400 families live there, 300 metres from the piles of refuse. For many, the dump is not just a permanent health and environmental hazard, but also a means of survival: they find food, school supplies, furniture and construction materials.In Neuquén and hundreds of Argentine towns,150,000 childrenlive within 300 metres of rubbish dumps in households where families cannot meet their basic needs. Children here often go hungry, drop out of school or finish without having learned the essentials, according to theArgentine Catholic University(UCA)’sBarometer of Social Debt in Children.Across Argentina, there are about5,000 open-air rubbish dumps. In many of them, children scavenge daily – a source of revenue in a country where1.2 million childrenunder 17 live below the poverty line.“Children who live or work in landfills are invisible,” says Sebastián Medina, chief of staff at thenational ombudsman’s officefor children and adolescents.After inspecting 11 open dumps, his team found no government protocols in place to protect these children, whose living conditions contravene the UNConvention on the Rights of the Child, which is constitutionally recognised by Argentina.View image in fullscreenThe homes in Manzana 34 are constructed from materials recycled from the dump.Photograph: Nicolás SuárezThe ombudsman’s report recommendsthat municipal, provincial and national governments establish care centres for children whose parents work in dumps, and develop plans to close the sites and provide alternative employment.National authorities insist thatresponsibility lies with provincial governments.When asked whether specific policies exist, they cited “different care programmes, such as early childhood centres” as already in place.The provincial government of Neuquén declined to comment on the landfill beside Manzana 34.In the absence of solutions, the problem goes on. On a spring afternoon in Manzana 34, the heat presses down and the few trees offer no shade. The acrid smell of the dump drifts in on the wind, as Gisel drinks mate at her neighbour Johana’s home.Johana has four children between the ages of nine and 15. The women’s houses are constructed from recycled materials: sheets of metal, cardboard, plastic and demolition debris. Beds are wooden pallets.View image in fullscreenGisel dreams of leaving the dump and opening a bakery.Photograph: Nicolás SuárezLast night, Gisel and her partner searched through rubbish from midnight until 7am, while their children were looked after by her sister. “It was a good day,” she says. Selling aluminium cans earned enough for noodles and tomato puree. “Yesterday, I only had two tins of tuna from the rubbish tip. The children went to bed hungry,” she says.She found clothes to sell at a flea market. With the money, she will buy cold cuts from a neighbourhood WhatsApp group: “There are neighbours who sell everything they find in large quantities and in good condition. It’s like a small online market.”View image in fullscreenThe football pitch provided by the municipality of Neuquén. Local parents have started a club to keep children off the streets in the evenings.Photograph: Nicolás SuárezFaced with the shortcomings of the state, charities and community organisations are stepping in to ensure a better future for the local children.Amid rough gravel roads, a patch of green synthetic grass stands out: the football pitch of Club Deportivo La Colonia.Until February, it was bare dirt. The municipality of Neuquén provided turf and a fence. Four parents founded the club to keep children off the streets. From 6pm to 9pm, 140 children play and eat a snack – often their only evening meal.Three hundred metres away, the dump smokes on the plateau. On windy days, the fence catches clouds of plastic bags, and when the smoke thickens, football is cancelled. When there is no wind, the smell of burnt cable can drift over. Scrap collectors burn insulation to extract the copper inside. “The worst is when the rubbish explodes – the smoke burns your throat,” say neighbours.Living near poorly managed landfills posesenvironmental and health risks, asresearch shows. These sites release toxic leachate that contaminatessoil and waterand produce gases such as methane and CO2, contributing to the climate crisis.View image in fullscreenTwo of Johana’s children inside their home. Children near the dump suffer from illnesses and injuries caused by the rubbish.Photograph: Nicolás SuárezResidents face higherrisks of illnesses, including respiratory, skin, gastrointestinal infections, congenital disabilities andcancer risks. Exposure to heavy metals and organic compounds can cause toxicity and long-term health problems.Nazarena Bauso, a researcher at the UCA, says that poverty is not merely income-based but also reflects living conditions.“A child exposed to a rubbish dump and who doesn’t eat well gets sick more often. If they share a bed and lack space to study or play, they don’t develop privacy or intellect. If they drop out of school to work at the dump, they never know other realities, such as aspiring to a formal job,” she says. “When they take them to the rubbish dump, parents don’t realise all this because hunger is more urgent.”“The little monkeys,” Johana points from the pitch toward the dump. That’s what they call the children who climb lorries to grab expired goods dumped by supermarkets. “Once, a child lost four fingers. A few years ago, another was run over and killed. The lorries don’t check if there are children there,” she says.View image in fullscreenJohana’s partner now has a job at the sawmill, so her family no longer needs to scavenge from the dump.Photograph: Nicolás SuárezUntil recently, Johana scavenged with her children. “Thank God my partner got a job at a sawmill and we don’t go any more,” she says.Children suffer most from existing alongside the dump as it affects everything: the air they breathe, the food they eat, and the dangers it creates where they play. “They have cuts from glass, bronchospasms, gastrointestinal diseases and skin allergies,” says Dr Ignacio Veltri, who runs a health post in a container near the dump.Veltri and student volunteers from the National University of Comahue set up the post to offer medical care, vaccinations and check-ups. “Many parents bring their children to the dump because they have nowhere else to leave them. When there is such scarcity, it’s better not to judge but to help,” he says.Despite the vulnerabilities they face, Maia, her siblings and Johana’s children have big plans. Their mothers love to talk about dreams: a stable job, happiness for their children. Gisel wants to leave the dump and open a bakery. She shows photos of decorated cakes. Maia also wants to be a baker. The other children dream of being footballers, architects or police officers.View image in fullscreenSmoke often hangs over the dump as scrap collectors burn the plastic insulation off wires to reveal the valuable copper beneath.Photograph: Nicolás SuárezWhen the dump swelters under the sun, whipped by the Patagonian wind, Maia and her siblings stay home in the neighbourhood below. The streets are deserted. Within an hour, a yellow weather alert will be issued due to strong Patagonian winds that amplify the environmental problem.On the plateau, the storm begins: copper-coloured dust and flying plastic bags shrouding those who scavenge. Two thin boys, 11 and 14, struggle forward with burlap sacks heavy with their day’s haul. Some would say they have had a good day.For Maia, a good day is finding false nails or toys. A bad one was when her mother pricked her hand with a syringe. Still, she prefers to talk about her dream – shared with her mother – of apple pies, sweet white cream and the scent of vanilla.This story is a collaboration with Fundación La Nación in Argentina.Read it in Spanish here.Explore more on these topicsChildrenSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanPovertyPollutionLandfillArgentinaWasteSocial exclusionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Every child has the right to grow up safe from harm but for these girls their childhood was snatched from them in the cruellest of ways.”A judge on Friday sentenced the four Romanian men and one Albanian man to jail terms of between 18 months and 14 years.The men are:Bogdan Gugiuman, 44, of Gateshead, who was found guilty of three counts of rape, and supplying a class A drug. He was jailed for 14 years.Codrin Dura, 27, of Gateshead, who was found guilty of four counts of rape, four counts of sexual activity with a child, blackmail, attempted rape, serious sexual assault, supplying a class A drug, and arranging or facilitating commission of a child sex offence. He was jailed for 13 years.Klaudio Aleksiu, 28, of Windsor, who was found guilty of rape. He was jailed for six years.Leonard Paun, 23, of Gateshead, who was found guilty of five counts of rape, two counts of arranging or facilitating commission of a child sex offence, sexual activity with a child, sexual assault, supplying a class A drug, distributing photos of a child. He was jailed for five years and one month.Stefan Ciuraru, 22, of Gateshead, who was found guilty of four counts of sexual assault, sexual activity with a child, and causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. He was jailed for 18 months, given his youth at the time of the offending.Barr said police began investigating after receiving complaints in April and May 2019 from two girls who did not know each other.He said a complex abuse inquiry was launched in July that year as it became apparent that there was “a group of males known to each other” who were offending against several victims.A significant effort was made to gain the confidence of victims, Barr said. “The offending ranged from sexual assaults, like touching, through to the most serious offences of rape, including rapes by multiple people against the same victim,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCrimeRape and sexual assaultNorth of EnglandNewcastlenewsShareReuse this content"

The video concluded with the words: “Our government is complicit in genocide.”TheRoundhouse said it was appalled by the video, which it said had been done without its knowledge. The incident was also reported to police by the Community Security Trust (CST) which offers security, advice and training to protect British Jews.On Friday, Primal Scream, in a post on its Instagram account, defended the video, saying: “The film is a piece of art. It clearly draws from history to question where the actions of current world governments sit in that context.”It added: “It is meant to provoke debate, not hate. In a free, pluralistic and liberal society freedom of expression is a right which we choose to exercise.”Some people that attended the gigaccused Primal Scream of racism. The Roundhouse issued an unequivocal apology to those individuals and to the wider Jewish community.Primal Scream, who were founded by frontman Bobby Gillespie in 1982, were performing a 25th anniversary show for their album XTRMNTR.A CST spokesperson said: “Entwining a Star of David with a swastika implies that Jews are Nazis and risks encouraging hatred of Jews. There needs to be an urgent investigation by the venue and the promoter about how this happened, and we have reported this to the police.”TheCreative Community for Peace, a pro-Israel advocacy group that campaigns against antisemitism in the entertainment industry, described the display as “an act of profound malice, desecration, and cruelty”.It said: “The Star of David is a sacred symbol of Jewish identity; the swastika is the emblem of a genocidal regime responsible for the murder of 6 million Jews. To merge these two symbols is an act of profound malice, desecration, and cruelty. It is antisemitism in its starkest form.”Explore more on these topicsLondonPrimal ScreamAntisemitismGig economyIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

She would do anything for anyone and was loved by both friends and family.”Clarrie O’Callaghan, co-founder of the Femicide Census, said it was “an amazing result”, adding: “This is a moment when you want to herald that the criminal justice system actually does work sometimes. The police and CPS were tenacious in securing this conviction – the system can work.”Explore more on these topicsCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

During the summer heatwave the rubbish caught fire and burned for nine days, forcing the school to close and residents to stay indoors.Josh Simons, the MP for Makerfield, said: “This decision throws mud in the face of my working-class constituents in Bickershaw, Wigan, but also of people across the country suffering from toxic, illegal dumps that don’t have the privilege of living in middle classOxfordshire. I am so angry about it.”View image in fullscreenThe illegal waste site in Bickershaw.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images“My constituents will feel this is unfair, unjust, and once again like a public body is ignoring working-class communities in the north.”The EA’s policy is to refuse to clear up illegal waste dumps across the country, instead pursuing the perpetrators and landowners. But officials said on Thursday they had taken the exceptional decision to clear up the waste outside Kidlington, which is next to the River Cherwell, because the scale of the fire risk set it apart from other illegal waste dumps in England and presented an overriding public imperative.The agency has been given no extra money to clear the waste, the cost of which is likely to run into several millions of pounds. The EA said this would come from “making efficiencies in its operations”. Thecost to the taxpayer will also includethe payment of the landfill tax on the waste to the Treasury.Environment Agency faces landfill tax bill worth millions to clear illegal wasteRead moreSimons said. “What is not ‘exceptional’ about a toxic waste dump on fire right next to a primary school and bunch of local businesses? Could it be because the kids and businesses are not in Oxfordshire? I will fight tooth and nail for the Environment Agency to treat my towns equally and clear the Bickershaw site – and treat us like the good people of Oxfordshire.”This week ministers rejected all recommendations of an inquiry into waste crime by the House of Lords environment and climate change committee.Lords highlighted how organised criminals were making millions every year from illegally dumping rubbish. Peers called for the government to carry out a “root and branch review” of responses to waste crime. The report said 38m tonnes of waste – enough to fill Wembley Stadium 35 times – was being illegally dumped every year, mainly by established organised crime groups often with links to other criminal activity such as money laundering and modern slavery.But the environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, rejected the call for a review and all other suggestions in the report. She said the government wouldbe announcing policiesin the New Year that would drive criminality away from the waste sector, informed by previous reviews, investigations and intelligence.Thedumping in Kidlingtontook place under the noses of the EA, which was monitoring the site after being alerted to suspicious activity. Similarly in Wigan, Simons alerted the EA in January to dumping taking place on Bolton House Road, and was told it would monitor the site. Over the course of several months, lorryloads of waste were dumped in the residential street. Part of the illegal waste has been tipped into a field where the primary school children played sport.The EA said: “In both Kidlington and Wigan, we are laser-focused on finding the offenders and bringing them to justice.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironment AgencyWastePollutionOxfordshireGreater ManchesterLabourLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

This is a time for unity and decisive action for Canada’s future.”Ma made the announcement the day after attending the Conservative Christmas party and posing for a photo with Tory leaderPierre Poilievre. He then attended a party hosted by the Liberals the next evening, appearing on stage with Carney to raucous applause.The Liberals now have 171 seats in parliament: one short of a majority.In a statement on social media, Poilievere said Ma “chose to endorse the very policies he was elected to oppose” and would join a party that was increasing the cost of living. “The people he let down the most are the ones who elected him to fight for an affordable future. He will have to answer to them.”The crossing will sting theConservatives, who have now lost three lawmakers. One crossed to the Liberals in November and another said he would resign in the coming months.On Friday, government house leader Stephen MacKinnon said he believed there were more frustrated opposition members who might be tempted to defect to the Liberals.Canada minister resigns from cabinet over Carney’s controversial oil pipeline dealRead more“All of my colleagues here have the same experience of speaking to Conservative members, unfortunately a group which is in the minority in their group, who are extremely frustrated with the leadership of their party,” he said during a press conference, adding members were forced to participate in a “charade of obstruction” in order to oppose the Liberals that is “soul-destroying experience for many Conservative[s]”.While the addition of a new member to caucus has buoyed Liberals, Carney has faced discontent within his own party.Earlier this month, a prominent cabinet minister, Steven Guilbeault,resigned from his post, protesting Carney’s decision to support a controversial oil pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Ocean.Guilbeault, a longtime environmental advocate, warned the pipeline to the west coast “would have major environmental impacts … contribute to a significant increase in climate pollution, and move Canada further away from its greenhouse gas reduction targets”. Guibeault warned that lifting the moratorium on oil tanker traffic would significantly increase the risk of accidents in the region.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasConservativesMark CarneynewsShareReuse this content"

A paradise of sun, sea and sand. But to step off the cruise ship or away from the all-inclusive resort is to see a more complex picture: a history of colonialism and a future of climate devastation. Newresearch from the Common Wealth thinktankmaps how, over the 400 years since the first English ships arrived in Barbados, empire engineered a system of wealth extraction that shapes the tourism economies of today.SirHilary Beckles, Barbadian historian and chair of theCaricom Reparations Commission, describes Barbados as the birthplace of British slave society. Between 1640 and 1807, Britain transported about 387,000 enslaved west Africans to the island. Extraordinary violence, from whippings to amputations and executions, were a regular feature of their lives. On theCodrington Plantationin the mid-18th century, 43% of the enslaved died within three years of their arrival. Life expectancy at birth for an enslaved person on the island was29 years old. This was the incalculable human cost of the transatlantic slave economy.On the back of this suffering was built extraordinary wealth for European colonial powers. Historian Joseph E Inikori has estimated that in the 18th century, 80% of the value of export commodities in the Americas was generated by enslaved Africans’ labour. Although plantation owners in the Caribbean did grow rich – the Drax family, ancestors of former Tory MPRichard Drax, made about£600,000 a year in today’s moneyfrom their Barbados plantation in the mid-19th Century – British imperial policy was designed to ensure most of the wealth flew away from the colonies. Two-thirds of the economic value of the sugar industry went to Britain, via the merchants who shipped unrefined sugar across the Atlantic, the businesses such asLloyd’s of Londonthat insured them, and the sugar refineries that created the final product.These geographies of production left a lasting mark on the Caribbean, long after the collapse of the sugar industry. Islands such as Barbados now have a “rebranded plantation economy built for leisure instead of sugar”, says Fiona Compton, a St Lucian artist, historian and founder of theKnow Your Caribbeanplatform. She highlights how most of the region’s hotel chains, cruise lines, airlines and booking platforms aren’t owned locally. For every dollar spent in the Caribbean,80 cents will end up overseas, thanks to large foreign firms repatriating their profits.Hoteliers were wooed with the prospect of generous tax breaks, while large cruise lines have been able to negotiate extremely low port charges because if a government tries to charge them more, they can just weigh anchor and dock elsewhere.Segregated inside all-inclusive resorts, tourists often have little interaction with the local economy. On cruise ships, the onboard spas, restaurants and casinos may entice passengers away from even venturing to port. If they do, they typically go ashore through “approved” vendors that have paid to be featured in promotions or, in a growing trend, they set foot on theprivate beaches and clubs owned or leased by the cruises themselves.Like the plantations before it, tourism also wreaks havoc on local ecosystems. In one day,a typical cruise ship produces21,000 gallons of sewage, a tonne of rubbish, 170,000 gallons of wastewater, more than 25 pounds of batteries, fluorescent lights and other chemical and medical waste, and up to 6,400 gallons of oily bilge-water from its engines. Meanwhile, on land, hotelsguzzle water and pollute additional supplies, something the water-distressed countries of the region can ill afford, and also consume huge amounts of energy. “Their lights are on all night, they’re burning energy 24/7,” says Rodney Grant, a Barbados government adviser. “Governments alone can’t carry the burden of the social and environmental fallout.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Common Wealth thinktankSo why, despite these costs, is tourism so prevalent in the region? “This is the only industry, at least in the current configuration of the global economy, that can generate significant foreign exchange earnings for small Caribbean countries,” notes Matthew Bishop from the University of Sheffield, whose research looks at the political economy of development in the region. In the 1970s and 1980s, some newly independent Caribbean countries experimented with more socialist development models and government ownership of key industries. These were abandoned or violently overthrown under pressure from the US, which even brieflyinvaded socialist Grenada in 1983. With the only available pathway one of attracting foreign investment to transition away from sugar agriculture, tourism emerged for the Caribbean as the “last resort”.Although Black resistance – from slave rebellions in the 19th century to worker uprisings in the 20th – forced formal concessions from Britain, catalysing the process for the abolition of slavery and the granting of political independence, the hard truth about the history of empire is that these processes were never accompanied by the kind of transfers of wealth necessary to support real economic freedom. Instead,compensation was paid to slave-ownersin 1837 to the tune of 40% of the Treasury’s annual income, while Black workers, especially in smaller islands such as Barbados, were denied access to land that might have freed them from having to keep working in the sugar industry.Today, across the region, tourism continues to lock local people out of control and access to land. “It’s cultural and economic dispossession continuing in real time,” says Compton. “So many of our childhood spaces where we enjoyed total freedom have been taken over by beach chairs and security guards, who, if they don’t tell you to leave, hover around you to make you feel unwelcome.” She argues that the same land stolen from Indigenous people and systematically kept from Black people during colonisation is now “packaged and sold back to the world as ‘paradise’”.Threatening the “paradise” image is the climate crisis. Despite being responsible for only 0.3% of historic global emissions, the Caribbean is the second most-hazard prone region in the world, suffering floods and increasinglydevastating hurricanes such as Melissa. Between 2000 and 2023, climactic events caused more than $200bn worth of damage. This is an existential risk not just for the tourist industry, but the entire fabric of local people’s lives.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Common Wealth thinktank“You’ve got this sense that they’re suffering twice,” says Bishop of the countries being battered by extreme weather. “They’re suffering from the original historical injustices of slavery and the period after it, and then they’re also suffering from climactic shocks today. And they’ve received no recompense for either of those two things.” Indeed, rather than money flowing into the region to help with the climate crisis, it flows out to creditors.Many Caribbean countries are heavily indebted, having borrowed in the 20th century to tackle problems of colonial underdevelopment such as poor public health and education and to build new tourism infrastructure such as airports and harbours deep enough for massive cruise ships. Recent analysis from theClimate and Community Institutefound that the region loses roughly the same amount annually in debt service payments as the UN predicts it needs to fund climate adaptation and resilience. Jamaica, which played by the neoliberal rules to reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio from 140% in 2013 to 62%, stockpiling some of its surplus for future disasters, found that the $500m it managed to save could barely touch the sides of the more than $8bn of damage done byHurricane Melissa.Rather than continuing to lean on the uncertain and volatile returns of luxury tourism,Caribbeanleaders and civil society activists are vocal about the need for reparations. This is about more than mere apologies or token sums of money; real repair would mean a rethink of the entire economic structure that has continued to marginalise the Caribbean.Compton, for example, wants to see a less extractive model of tourism based around community ownership of hotels, eco-lodges and heritage tour companies. She has created theCaribbean Green Bookas a resource for travellers looking for locally owned businesses. Grant also emphasises that Caribbean governments can and should do more. “Tourism doesn’t function in a vacuum, it’s been supported by legislation that we put in place,” he says. He wants to see policy changes to encourage companies to pay more tax and buy food and other goods locally. But while individual travellers can certainly try to make more ethical choices, and Caribbean governments can nudge tourism in a more sustainable direction, deeper structural changes around debt and compensation for climate loss and damages, and funding for adaptation such as new flood defences will require more organised political efforts.However much luxury resorts try to scrub clean the Caribbean’s past, raking the white sand beaches clean every morning of thesargassum seaweedthatblooms more than ever thanks to warming oceans, we all live in a world forged by empire. The question for all of us is – how do we remake it?Explore more on these topicsSlaveryCotton Capital: ongoing seriesReparations and reparative justiceCaribbeanColonialismClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At his memorial, human rights activists gathered to protest against what they view as a suspicious and potentially state-linked killing.”Officials in Iran’s Razavi Khorasan province said Alikordi suffered a heart attack, but a tightening security crackdown that coincided with his death has raised questions about its circumstances. More than 80 lawyers have signed a statement demanding more information.“Alikordi was a prominent figure among Iran’s community of human rights defenders,” the New York-basedCenter for Human Rights in Iransaid on Thursday. “Over the past several years, he had been repeatedly arrested, harassed and threatened by security and judicial forces.”Mohammadi’s family members said security and police forces used teargas and violence to disperse people who had gathered for Alikordi’s memorial. Speaking from Paris, Mohammadi’s husband, Taghi Rahmani, told the Guardian he was worried not only for his wife but also for the other rights activists arrested at the same time.Rahmani described the arrest as part of an escalating strategy by the Iranian authorities to suppress dissent. “This is a targeted attack on democracy and the right to freedom of expression,” he said.Mohammadi’s children, Ali and Kiana, said they were also worried for their mother and the other activists. “She had a surgery just a year ago and many others arrested have also been fighting medical conditions,” Ali told the Guardian. “She was arrested two hours ago and we still don’t know where my mother is.“These people don’t belong in the prison.”Footage from the memorial ceremony showed Mohammadi at a microphone, calling out to the crowd and starting a chant in the name ofMajidreza Rahnavard, who was publicly hangedby the Iranian authorities in 2022.There was no immediate comment from Iran over its detention of Mohammadi and it was not clear whether authorities would return her to prison to serve the rest of her term. Supporters had cautioned for months she was at risk of being put back in jail.Hasan Hosseini, the city governor of Mashhad, said prosecutors ordered security officials to temporarily detain some participants at the ceremony over the chanting of “norm-breaking” slogans, Iranian state television reported. Hosseini described the detentions as preventive to protect those there from others in the crowd.Before her release last December, Mohammadi had been imprisoned since November 2021 for convictions relating to her campaign against capital punishment andthe obligation for women in Iran to wear the hijab.Her supporters say she suffered multiple heart attacks in prison before undergoing emergency surgery in 2022. Late last year, her lawyer said doctors had found a bone lesion they feared could be cancerous and which was later removed.“Her health could deteriorate very quickly under these conditions,” Rahmani said. “The repression inside the mosque today was carried out with extreme brutality. Teargas was fired, and Narges and other activists were beaten even though they have serious health issues.”Mohammadi’s sentence was supposed to be suspended for three weeks when she was released last year, but her time out of prison lengthened, possibly because of pressure from activists and western powers. She remained free even during the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.She kept up her activism with public protests and international media appearances, including demonstrating at one point in front of Evin prison, the notorious facility in Tehran where she was held.Chirinne Ardakani, Mohammadi’s Paris-based lawyer, said: “I am calling for the immediate release of my client, as well as of all the human rights activists who have been arbitrarily detained alongside her. I also reiterate my client’s demand that truth and justice be established regarding the suspicious circumstances surrounding Alikordi’s death, for which we have reason to believe the state bears responsibility.”Mohammadi’s family said they did not know in whose custody she was being held, with Ali adding: “My mother could be in the custody of the Revolutionary Guards or the security forces or police. We don’t know anything.”Rahmani said: “We urge the western media to continue following events in Iran and to please keep reporting.”Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIranHuman rightsNobel peace prizeActivismMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said if the changes are confirmed next week, it would “keep millions of European families stuck driving dirtier and more expensive petrol cars for longer”. Having hybrid cars as a continued option would merely delay the switch to electric vehicles (EVs), he added.Somecar manufacturers, including Volvo and Polestar, have attacked those calling for a softening of the 2035 cutoff for traditional combustion engines, arguing it would just give further advantage to Chinese rivals.Weber said the rule change would be an important signal “to the entire automotive industry and secures tens of thousands of industrial jobs”, reflecting concerns over the future of one of Europe’s most important industries.He suggested the EU would pave the way for the continued sale of plug-in hybrid cars, including a future generation of powerful hybrids with long ranges, but with backup combustion engines for long journeys, for example, more than 373 miles (600km).“For new registrations from 2035 onwards, a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions will now be mandatory for car manufacturers’ fleet targets, instead of 100%,” Weber told Bild.A European Commission spokesperson, Paula Pinho, said on Friday that the 2035 deadline was “still being discussed”. She added that the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, had already said several times that that there was a clear demand for “more flexibility on the CO2 targets”.Volkswagen, Stellantis, Renault, Mercedes-Benz and BMW have argued in favour of dropping the ban, arguing that consumers are not taking up EVs in the numbers anticipated when the 2035 date was approved in 2022.According to reports, the EU will also propose a package of measures to incentivise Europeans to make and buy small EVs as part of a new push to dent the growing presence of Chinese electric cars in the bloc.Incentives for a “made in Europe” small EV would take inspiration from Japan, which offers significant breaks including lower insurance and car tax for those who own electric kei cars, a category of small, lightweight vehicles notable for their boxy appearance.Norway, which has the highest take-up of electric vehicles in Europe, drove adoption of the zero-emission cars with VAT and purchase tax exemptions along with 50% road toll fees.It has meant more than90% of all new cars sold in 2025 were electric, in extraordinary contrast to southern Europe where a lack of infrastructure and incentives has led to a slow take-up of EVs.In Norway almost 30% of all cars are now electric, compared with Italy where numbers are growing, but still account for only 12% of the market, according to figures for November.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryEuropean UnionGermanyEuropeManufacturing sectornewsShareReuse this content"

He has repeatedly defied Trump’s demands for drastic cuts to interest rates, prompting the president to launch a string of public attacks.Fed cuts interest rates by a quarter point amid apparent split over US economyRead moreTrump is also considering his adviser Kevin Hassett, who leads the National Economic Council, as a potential chair of the Fed.“I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They’re both – I think the two Kevins are great,” the presidenttold the Wall Street Journalon Friday. “I think there are a couple of other people that are great.”He is expected to soon nominate a candidate to lead the Fed, having lambasted the central bank’s policymakers for their cautious approach to cutting rates since return to office in January – and has eventried to fire a member of the central bank’s rate-setting policy committee.Warsh “thinks you have to lower interest rates,” Trump claimed in the interview, in line with the views he has expressed himself for months. “And so does everybody else that I’ve talked to.”Trump argued that the next Fed chair should listen to him on the future direction of rates. “Typically, that’s not done anymore,” he acknowledged to the Wall Street Journal. “It should be done.”“It doesn’t mean – I don’t think he should do exactly what we say,” Trump added. “But certainly we’re – I’m a smart voice and should be listened to.”Earlier this week, the Fedcut rates by a quarter pointfor the third time this year. But policymakers signaled their reluctance to cut more than once next year, amid heightened uncertainty around the direction of the economy.In a press conference on Wednesday, Powell said the Fed was trying to balance “significant downside risks” in the jobs market with inflationary pressures from Trump’s tariffs that are “pretty clear to see”.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveDonald TrumpTrump administrationJerome PowellUS economyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

On 14 December a revamped railway timetable goes live across Great Britain, with the biggest fanfare and radical changes for the east coast mainline, where passengers are promised more train services, faster journeys and a new era of reliability.But the spectre of a previous,disastrous timetable change from May 2018still looms over the railway. So will Sunday’s revamp be a great gift for passengers that the industry expects – or usher in a bleak midwinter ahead?LNER, the leading intercity operator on the line from London to Scotland, will have 60,000 extra seats a week in total, and cut the fastest journey times from the UK capital to Edinburgh to shortly over four hours, and to Leeds to a little over two, with six instead of five trains an hour out of Kings Cross most of the day.More TransPennine Express trains will run north of Newcastle upon Tyne and there will be more East Midlands services between Nottingham and Lincoln. Northern will start a new hourly fast service between Leeds and Sheffield, and more trains from Middlesbrough. At the southern end of the line, Greater Anglia and Thameslink are tweaking routes and adding extra seats.With more than £4bn invested in track and trains over the last decade on the east coast mainline, the Treasury expected to see results sooner. A major revamp for the timetable initially was planned for 2021, before the pandemic upended assumptions. A full overhaul was then lined up in 2024, but concerns over the readiness led to plans being postponed for another year.Timetables change every six months, but rarely to this degree. The railway still bears the scars of seven years ago, when no one pulled the alarm cord before a similarly sweeping timetable change, despite what became retrospectively evident: just how unprepared and ill-equipped the railway was to deliver the new services.Overrunning track works in the north eventually led to hastily redrawn timetables, finalised just weeks rather than months in advance – while train operators, struggling already to provide drivers, belatedly admitted to not having trained enough people for all the new services.Tony Miles, a rail writer and industry expert, remembers being with the then chief executive ofNetwork Rail, Mark Carne, just before the fateful change. “Carne wasn’t anxious. He told me: ‘Everything will run perfectly on a good day,’ which is what he had been assured by his minions. But when I spoke to train planners, they said they didn’t have diaries that went far back enough to find the last good day,” says Miles.View image in fullscreenThe last major timetable revamp was in 2018. Widespread cancellations and delays led to a full review of the whole industry.Photograph: Mike Kemp/In Pictures/Getty ImagesIt was grim for rail and worse for passengers:widespread cancellations and delaysover a calamitous few weeks led to a full review of the whole industry and ultimately to the fundamental changes that the government is bringing in, for a single “directing mind” to run an integrated Great British Railways.So can the public be confident in the new timetable this time? It comes when rail punctuality is already erratic in many areas: the recent debacle of the 7am Avanti Manchester-London express service, which wasdue to run as an empty “ghost train”under the revamped timetable but wasreinstated after a backlash, highlights nervousness over a capacity crunch.With new open-access operations starting on the west coast mainline – First Group’s Lumo running from London to Stirling – the Office of Rail and Road had wanted a firebreak, or room in the timetable to minimise the fallout when things, inevitably, go wrong. Several more open access services will also use the east coast mainline in the new timetable.There are, as one industry insider puts it, some “heroic assumptions about performance”. But with the timetable so long in the planning, and the key operators under direct state control, anxiety owes more to lingering trauma from 2018 than any of the danger signals that presaged that fiasco.The rail minister Peter Hendy, who was chair of Network Rail in 2018, has signed this one off – and makes clear it is time for the railway to deliver on the investment, given the huge spend and scant reward for HS2, and Treasury scepticism surrounding other projects. As the government drags its feet over the funding of the Northern Powerhouse Rail programme, the railway needs to show money is well spent.“The £4bn that has been put in was designed to increase the level of service, to create economic growth and better connect jobs and homes,” Lord Hendy says. “It’s taken several years to get any sort of agreement within the railway industry about putting this timetable in and we’ve finally done it. There’s been a lot of preparation.”The major works enabling the changes, over the course of a decade, include: the remodelling of tracks at King’s Cross station and reopening a disused tunnel to reduce congestion; building a “dive-under” tunnel at Werrington in Cambridgeshire for freight trains to reach east England’s ports without crossing the main line; and new platforms at Stevenage and Doncaster stations to aid the swift passage of trains.View image in fullscreenAn LNER Azuma train at King’s Cross station, London.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PAAlongside that, the government splashed out on Hitachi Azuma trains thatstarted running for LNER in 2019. A separate, ongoing multibillion-pound programme to “digitise” the line – replacing the line side signalling with direct communications to the train’s cab, to bolster reliability and capacity – will not be finished until 2030.Hendy says he is not taking anything for granted, heading to York this week to see the gold control in the regional operating centre “to make sure that I’m satisfied that everything’s been done. I’ll be watching on Sunday and for the days afterwards, but we’re pretty confident that it will work well because a lot of effort’s been put into doing it.”LNER says it has used “cutting-edge technology to work through numerous simulations of the timetable” to refine its plans, with staff in the control room at York preparing for several years, working directly alongside teams from other operators and Network Rail.A Network Rail spokesperson says: “The new timetable has been developed through a whole railway approach, setting us on the right path to provide further journey improvements in the future for the passengers and communities we serve.”The timetable, Hendy says, “represents possibly the maximum amount of service for the moment that you can run … but the prize is really significant”.Fundamentally, that prize is a better railway; but the east coast intercity service in its various guises has also long been a significant contributor to Treasury coffers, and annual revenues to the state-owned operator are expected to go up by tens of millions of pounds.“It’s squeaky bum time,” says Miles. “This timetable’s pushing everything to the limits of perfection. It may be brilliant but a lot of people in the industry are saying the government pushed it through rather than the operators. The concern is, is this over-optimism again?”The headline and text of this article were amended on 12 December 2025 to refer to Great Britain rather than Britain.Explore more on these topicsRail industryRail transportTransport policyTransportNetwork RailfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The blame should be pointed at me for everyone’s suffering.“I have spent almost every waking moment of the last few years thinking of what I could have done different and what I can do now to make things right.”Kwon’s lawyers had argued that he should be sentenced to no more than five years in prison, arguing that his actions were motivated by a desire to prop up Terraform’s TerraUSD stablecoin, not personal gain.The judge called the request “wildly unreasonable”.Kwon has been in US custody since his extradition from Montenegro last year, where he was imprisoned for using a fake passport.As part of his guilty plea, Kwon agreed to forfeit $19.3m and some properties that prosecutors claimed he gained from the fraud.Prosecutors said they would support Kwon serving the second half of his sentence in South Korea, where he still faces charges, if he abides by the terms of his plea deal.Prosecutors said they would not seek restitution for the investors who lost a total of $40bn, saying the prospect of determining each of their losses would be too complex.The judge said that some of Kwon’s investors still believed in him, even after his guilty plea, and that reading some of their letters was like “reading the words of cult followers”.Engelmayer said he had received letters from 315 victims all over the world, many reporting they had lost their homes, retirement savings, money for medical expenses and college funds to Kwon’s fraud.A graduate of Stanford University, Kwon returned to South Korea and launched the startup that would become Terraform Labs in 2017 with the co-founder Daniel Shin.Prosecutors alleged that when TerraUSD slipped below its $1 peg in May 2021, Kwon told investors a computer algorithm known as “Terra Protocol” had restored the coin’s value.Instead, they said, he arranged for a high-frequency trading company to buy millions of dollars of the token secretly to artificially prop up its price.Prosecutors said that false claim, and others, drove retail and institutional investors to buy Terraform products and boost the value of Luna – a more traditional token that fluctuated in value but was closely linked to TerraUSD – to $50bn by the spring of 2022.Kwon is one of several cryptocurrency moguls to face federal charges after a slump in digital token prices in 2022 prompted the collapse of a number of companies.Bankman-Fried, the founder of the US’s largest crypto exchange, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2024.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesTechnology sectorSouth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Its shares fell more than a quarter in early trading, before recovering marginally, down 23%.The company said that its long-term strategy, including a productivity and efficiency programme to mitigate “ongoing high inflation”, continues to progress.“The well-documented impact on consumer spending pre-budget has hit store footfall and sales, with the trend continuing into December,” said Kate Calvert, an analyst at Investec. “[Card Factory] does not feel it can make up ‘lost’ sales in the remainder of the year.”The company is also facing pressure from the long-term shift in shopping habits away from buying and posting physical cards.Royal Mail delivers about 6.6bn letters annually, down from 20bn two decades ago, with the postal regulator, Ofcom, forecasting the number to drop to 4bn in the next few years.Meanwhile, the cost of stamps has risen sharply – the price of a first-class stamprose to £1.70p in April, the sixth increase in little more than three years. A second-class stamp costs 87p.In July, Ofcom gave Royal Mail permission to end second-class post on Saturdays and reduce the service to alternating weekdays from Monday to Friday.Card Factory said that the poor performance in its UK business was not reflected in its other operations, including those in North America and the Republic of Ireland, which “remain in line with our expectations”.The integration of Funky Pigeon, which it bought fromWH Smithin July for £24m to boost its web offering, remains “on track”.The company said: “The board remains confident in the group’s long-term strategy.”On Friday, WH Smith said it was delaying the publication of its annual results againamid the fallout from accounting failuresto give its auditor, PwC, more time to complete its procedures.The results were originally meant to be released on 12 November but were delayed to 16 December and have now been pushed back to 19 December.Last month, Carl Cowling, the WH Smith chief executive,stood downafter an investigation found accounting failures in its North American division.The accounting errors first emerged in August, and an independent investigation by Deloitte found “shortcomings” in the travel shop chain’s North American division that exaggerated supplier income, leading the group tooverstate profits at its US business by as much as £50m.The Financial Conduct Authority is in the process of assessing whether the company has breached UK disclosure rules for listed companies but has not launched a formal investigation.In March, WH Smithagreed a deal to sell its 480 high street storesto the Hobbycraft owner, Modella Capital, which has since rebranded the chain TG Jones.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryChristmasWH SmithnewsShareReuse this content"

Here it is tested when Christy Mahon walks into a pub to confess he has killed his father with a farming tool. It’s not quite the truth but he is, to his own surprise, turned into a local celebrity. Women flock to see him and men hail him a hero.John Millington Synge’s unromanticised comic portrayal of a farming community in the west of Ireland caused moral outrage at its 1907 premiere at Dublin’s Abbey theatre. This revival by the Abbey’s current artistic director, Caitríona McLaughlin, makes clear that it is something of a woman’s play, ahead of its time, with two female leads abjuring conservative Catholic morality to hope for something bigger than a small, scratching country existence.Nicola Coughlanplays spirited barmaid Pegeen, who is dazzled enough by Christy to abandon her suitor, Shawn (Marty Rea). Siobhán McSweeney, as Widow Quin, is more strategic and openly lascivious. Both tread a fine line between comic desire and serious inner yearnings. “It’s true all girls are fond of courage,” says Widow Quin, and Éanna Hardwicke, as Christy, manages the transformation from geek to hero to geek again in a way that shows how little he changes, but how much those around him are willing to believe.View image in fullscreenAn inebriated tilt … The Playboy of the Western World, designed by Katie Davenport.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe tragedy of the two central women lies just beneath the surface, sometimes rearing up, from the widow’s anguish that she is not Christy’s chosen woman, to Pegeen’s final howling words of regret after Christy has been exposed and ejected from the pub. Masked musicians in straw headdresses and skirts march ritualistically across the back of a drinking tavern open to the skies and with an inebriated tilt, designed by Katie Davenport.But there are bumpy transitions between the drama of the first half, with a subtly twisting tension and notes of anxiety, to the physical comedy and outright farce of the second. The stately pace speeds to a gallop as the plot rises into melodrama. Staged in its original, melodic Hiberno-English dialect, it is authentic but hard to follow at times, at least for this critic. Some may not catch the nuance of the dialogue although the beauty of the language is abundant enough to enjoy. A character’s “whole skin needs washing like a Wicklow sheep”, another hears the cows “breathing and sighing in the dark” before coming into the light of the pub.View image in fullscreenNaoise Dunbar (Jimmy Farrell), Siobhán McSweeney (Widow Quin) and Matthew Forrest (Philly Cullen).Photograph: Marc BrennerThe play’s influence is evident: Christy might be a blueprint for Jez Butterworth’s silver-tongued self-mythologising Roosterin Jerusalem. The tall tales told in the pub of Conor McPherson’sThe Weirmay contain the imprint of Michael James Flaherty’s public house here, in which the action takes place over two days. Synge could even have been the Tarantino of his time, glamorising Christy’s violence. But it seems old-fashioned in this faithfully period production.The central critique – of the hollow elevation of a pretender by a (desperate?) community in dire need of a hero – still holds, but it might have had greater resonance in our populist times.At the Lyttelton theatre,National Theatre, London, until 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsNational TheatreTheatreNicola CoughlanSiobhán McSweeneyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Modern couples’ dressing isn’t just about looking coordinated; it’s a semiotic performance.”For the fashion psychologist Dr Dion Terrelonge, “when a couple dress the same they may be consciously or subconsciously signalling the strength of their bond and togetherness … The question is, why a couple might feel the need to signal the status of their relationship to those outside of it.”View image in fullscreenBritney Spears and Justin Timberlake go double denim in 2001.Photograph: Mark J Terrill/APHis and hers matching outfits are not a new thing. Zoë Kravitz and Harry Styles haverecently been spotted wearing similar beige-on-taupe outfits. Arguably, though, couples dressing is most fun when it does go for gold, or purple: David and Victoria Beckham’s matching purple at their wedding is seared on the nation’s retinas. Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake famously did it via a wrangle of denim. Then there’s the bold tailoring of Elton John and David Furnish, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky, the suit-loving Gilbert & George.Looking further back, Sonny and Cher enjoyed matching their bell bottoms, fringing and fur. John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s fruitful creative partnership and aligned values at times found expression via military garb or head-to-toe white.“When couples engaged in joint ventures dress the same they are to some extent saying that not only are they internally connected and one, but that they are joint in their output also,” said Terrelonge.Phillips cited other historical examples of couples dressing alike. “During Hollywood’s golden age, iconic duos like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers or Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton used coordinated attire to … project an ideal of glamour and cohesion, effectively presenting themselves as a single public ‘brand’.”Couple dressing is not just for showbiz. In Hemingway’s posthumously published, half-finished novel The Garden of Eden, a couple’s style merges into a shared uniform of fisherman shirts and espadrilles. Hair is shorn to match; their aesthetics mirror one another as they toy with gender roles. F Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, were also photographed in matching outfits.“Across these eras, couples dressing consistently occupies the space between intimacy and performance, functioning as both a personal expression and a public narrative,” said Phillips.View image in fullscreenElton John and David Furnish at the Oscars in 2020.Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty ImagesFor celebrity couples dressing alike today, Phillips thinks the “impulses have shifted: in the early 2000s, the focus was on conspicuous cohesion … to assert power, status and public visibility”. Today’s approach, she says, “is conceptually driven and often social media conscious”. Branding is also a key driver.The UKCP relationship therapist Marianne Johnson makes a distinction between celebrity and non-celebrity couples dressing alike. “As a celebrity couple you might share a love of being in the spotlight … It’s creative and bonding for the couple.” Whereas “on a non-celebrity front, I think couples often seem to influence each other’s style”.When non-celebrity couples dress alike on purpose it tends togenerate attention– cringes or “awws”, at least in the west. But it is a common occurrence in some non-western cultures. In South Korea, for instance, it is called thekou-peullook, with couples dressing similarly to demonstrate their love or foster closeness.Couples who dress alike: ‘It looks like we’re from the same cult’Read more“Psychologically speaking, matching or echoing one another’s clothing can signal a sense of unity and be a non-verbal way of saying: we share a world together,” said Johnson. “We naturally mirror the people we feel close to, and clothing is one of the more visible ways mirroring can show up.”But even for non-celebrities, Phillips pointed out, “it often functions as personal branding, an image of the couple that they want the world to internalise”.She said it was “not all calculated marketing. There’s still an intimate dimension: the joy of synchronicity, playful coordination, or expressing relational identity visually. Branding and genuine expression coexist.”Whether you see this particular couple dressing in orange as a sweet expression of togetherness or a cynical marketing ploy might be nuanced. But there is a brilliant simplicity toone user’s take on X: “Both look like oranges.”Explore more on these topicsTimothée ChalametKylie JennerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s not very showbiz,” Cohen says.It’s the busiest time of year for Cohen and Luu, assistant directors who founded not-for-profit organisationEvery Day Actionduring the Covid pandemic. Designed to helpunhoused peopleand those facing food insecurity across the city, the idea was born when Cohen noticed the amount of food waste on film and TV sets, and looked into redistributing it to those in need. “I remember asking, ‘Why can’t we donate this food?’ I kept being told it was illegal and that people could sue us if they got sick.” It didn’t take Luu, who grew up working in a soup kitchen her father founded, long to establish this was not the case. “In the US, there’s the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act that’s been around since 1996,” she says. “It protects food donors from liability issues.”They’re not the only women trying to turn the big screen green. In 2009, trailblazer Shannon Bart foundedEcoSet, an environmental production resource based in Hollywood that introduced recycling and composting to sets and began donating creative materials to nearby artists, theatres and schools. In the UK,Albertis a nationwide initiative from Bafta that helps the film and TV industry be more sustainable. One of its biggest goals is to phase out fuel generators on sets, which has the ability to wipe out as much as 5% of all emissions created by the sector. April Sotomayor, Bafta’s head of industry sustainability, says: “We’re also trying to encourage talent not to use private jets. Even getting them into first class goes a long way to reducing the carbon footprint of a production.”View image in fullscreen‘I remember asking: “Why can’t we donate this food?”,’ Cohen says.Photograph: PixelCatchers/Getty Images/iStockphotoAt the production coalface,Green Rideris a collective that sets environmental guidelines for productions, including using grid power, introducing ride-sharing for cast and crew and using beef-free caterers. Their efforts have reduced pollution on productions, including Wolf Hall and Gangs of London, by up to 80%. Tilly Ashton, whom Sotomayor calls a “darling of the sustainability industry”, co-created Wales’s first sustainability coordinator training programme for aspiring creatives last year. AndPropUpis a London-based non-profit set up by ex-producers Emma Chaplin and Kate Allan to rehome and recycle props and sets from popular TV shows. Despite preconceptions, what they do is serious business. “One prop can be life-changing,” Allan says. “Whether that’s a belt that means someone can wear something comfortable to a job interview or a rucksack that can help a child escape domestic violence.”These eco initiatives across film and TV are thriving. Every Day Action now redistributes more than 80,000 meals a year. It also works with big studios including Warner Bros and Disney, the latter of which recently found itself in hot water whenit was revealed the production of its live-action Snow Whiteemitted 3,153 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. They are also needed more than ever in cities such as LA, where 25% of the populationface food insecurity.View image in fullscreenRachel Zegler in Snow White, the production of which emitted 3,153 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.Photograph: Disney/APEvery Day Action can also offer supplementary income to people starting out in the entertainment business through its industry driver programme. It works because they’re insiders who understand set protocols and timings and can easily read site maps. Most importantly, though, they don’t get starstruck. “We can send them on set and they’re OK with only seeing mashed potatoes,” says Cohen.As for PropUp, it has now rehomed more than 50,000 props and partnered with ITV ReLoved, meaning fans can buy merch and niche memorabilia from its online shop – such as a Free Marlon Dingle poster from Emmerdale or Frankie Bridge’s I’m a Celebrity T-shirt – the profits of which are funnelled back into charitable causes. “We recently sold the Fernando’s sign from Take Me Out,” Chaplin says. Every Day Action has a similar tale to tell. “We were once given a bag of 200 flavoured condoms and a bunch of butt plugs” from the set of a show which must remain anonymous, Luu says. They were rehomed by a local sex worker outreach programme before their landlords, religious order Daughters of Charity, caught wind, in case you were wondering.View image in fullscreenHer T-shirt could be yours … Frankie Bridge in I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! in 2021.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockWomen are dominating the space. A 2023reportfound that 58% of chief sustainability officer roles are held by women. The broadcasting world, especially, is leading the charge, with women such as Danielle Mulder and Sara Peacock heading up sustainable drives at the BBC and S4C respectively.The end goal for Every Day Action and PropUp is to inspire more grassroots action, with a few small tweaks to regular programming. The duo in LA have their eyes on an industrial fridge-freezer, while in the UK Chaplin and Allan hope to open a bricks and mortar shop. “We’re not sustainability experts, we’re just two women who saw a problem and wanted to do something about it,” Chaplain says. “It’s not rocket science.”Explore more on these topicsFilmWomen (Society)Women (Life and style)Film industryHomelessnessHousingPovertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was a perfectionist performer with huge talentActor and comedian Stanley Baxter dies aged 99Mark LawsonFri 12 Dec 2025 12.17 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 17.14 CETShareThe description “special” is overused in television schedules; Stanley Baxter’s programmes justify it. The comedian is one of the few stars whose reputation rests on a handful of astonishing one-offs – standalone comic extravaganzas screened in the 1970s and 1980s, first by ITV’s London WeekendTelevisionand then the BBC.In both cases, the networks ended their associations with Baxter not because of lack of audience interest – at their peak, the shows reached more than 20 million viewers – but due to the colossal costs demanded by the performer’s vast and perfectionist visual ambition. One of Baxter’s favourite conceits was to re-create, in witty pastiche, scenes from big-budget Hollywood movies that made it look as if his versions had also spent millions of dollars.Cashflow was further stretched by the fact that Baxter played multiple roles – 18 of them in one sketch. Recent digital technology has made such multiplications relatively easy, but at the time Baxter was sharing a screen with several selves, primitive image-mixing technology left a giveaway outline – like the chalk marks homicide cops put around a corpse on the sidewalk – when scenes recorded at different times were merged together.To avoid this, Baxter built up his multicharacter spectaculars moment by moment, often spending hours in costume and makeup between two lines of dialogue. Back views of doubles had to be carefully positioned in shot to produce the illusion that he was in conversation with others. Whereas most comedians – even the equally ambitious and meticulous Morecambe and Wise – routinely made a Christmas show in addition to a series of weekly episodes, Baxter would spend a year working on his.View image in fullscreenBaxter and Leslie Phillips in the 1964 film Father Came Too.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockBaxter’s performing fortune lay in two body parts: his ear and his legs. He was a precision mimic of celebrity and everyday voices, a skill that began, he told interviewers, when, as a child in Glasgow, he noticed the spectrum of Scottish accents, from a posh mock-Anglo to a patois so thick that it could sound initially to outsiders like Italian. The latter twang later inspired one of his most popular sketches, “Parliamo Glasgow”, a perfect showcase for his vocal virtuosity, in which a host with clipped BBC English “translated” densely Glaswegian sentences, such as the warning from a female to a male acquaintance that he was becoming overfamiliar by touching her buttocks: “Takyurhonaffmabum.”As well as his exceptional listening, Baxter was also lucky with his limbs. Not only could he do impressions with them as well – never having learned to tap-dance, he made it look as if he had by copying the trained – but they had the ideal dimensions for someone frequently required to play female characters.A surprise to those rewatching TV comedy from the 1960s to 1980s is the prevalence of drag acting. This was largely necessity. Because almost all star comedians were male but their material often involved marriage and/or misogyny, light entertainment resembled an all-boys school trying to put on a production ofThe Trojan Women. But, whereas frequent cross-dressers such as Les Dawson, Dick Emery and Terry Jones were built to play somewhat squat matriarchs, Baxter had calves and ankles of such unusual shapeliness for a man that he could plausibly portray superstar actresses of the Hollywood golden age. When he portrayed Fred Astaire, he could also play his dance partner, Ginger Rogers.In a 2019 Channel 5 profile in the Comedy National Treasures strand, the then 93-year-old Baxter explained that he did detailed impressions of Hollywood legends before knowing who they were. His mother, who had been prevented from becoming an actor by parents who believed that the profession was a euphemism for prostitution, trained Stanley from a very young age to entertain relatives and friends with versions of her favourite chanteuses, such as Marlene Dietrich and Gracie Fields. As her son had never seen nor heard the originals, she would do impersonations for him, from which he would create his own version. In retrospect, this was another key stage in the development of his exceptional ability to re-create cinematic scenes.View image in fullscreen‘A precision mimic’ … sending up Liberace on his ITV show.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockHe was a well-read man, his London flat filled with well-used books, and a notable feature of his shows was that they trusted the mass audience to enjoy collisions of high and low culture.

Another speciality was to mash two franchises, so that a Michael Crawford sitcom and a sub-aquatic nature show became Jacques Cousteau Presents Some Mammals Do Ave ’Em. There were also extended spoofs of Dallas and Upstairs, Downstairs, and a spoof of the Queen’s Christmas message, with Baxter in regal drag, which prompted outrage in parliament and middle-market papers.Born in 1926, Baxter came to showbiz partly through a narrow route specific to men of his age, serving in the Ensa (Entertainments National Service Association), which was set up in 1939 to provide entertainment for soldiers, sailors and airmen serving overseas, provided by colleagues with theatrical or musical ambitions. Its early recruits included three people who became significant in television: the comic magician Tommy Cooper and the writers Jimmy Perry and David Croft, whose greasepaint war service informed one of their sitcoms, It Ain’t Half Hot Mum (1974-81).A teenager in his native Glasgow during the second world war, Baxter joined the troops’ troupe during national service in postwar, pre-independence Burma and Singapore.Ensa’s acronym was mocked as Every Night Something Awful, but Baxter’s pack included others with a significant showbiz future: comedian Kenneth Williams, film director John Schlesinger and playwright Peter Nichols, who comically fictionalised their experiences in the play and film Privates on Parade. Two frequent styles for the uniformed performers, parody and cross-dressing, became Baxter’s signature strengths.However, while other broadcasting stars of his era had their first professional exposure in music hall theatre (including Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise, Ken Dodd, Clive Dunn, Bruce Forsyth, Max Bygraves), Baxter is relatively unusual in having been discovered when young by broadcasting, then in its own infancy. His mother having achieved her ambition of turning him into a child prodigy, he came, in the 1930s, to the attention of Children’s Hour, an early BBC radio series, the Scottish edition of which was presented by “Auntie Kathleen”.View image in fullscreenStanley in pantomime mode.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlaIn the early 1960s, Baxter appeared in a run of British movie comedies – Crooks Anonymous, The Fast Lady, and Father Came Too! – and briefly seemed destined to become a disguise-master movie actor, in the manner of Peter Sellers. However, cinematically, Baxter’s greater talent was for caricature, rather than whole-cloth creation, and he found his happiest outlet as the comedian who brought the big screen to the small screen at one remove.The titles of early specials, such as The Stanley Baxter Big Picture Show and The Stanley Baxter Moving Picture Show, acknowledged his cinematic inspiration though their use of “picture”, as cinema was called in his era. His most ambitious sketches included shot-by-shot re-creations of scenes from movies such as Gone With the Wind and Casablanca, with the twist that all the personnel were Baxter impersonations.It helped that the weekend schedules in which his breakthrough work appeared featured movies in peak time, in a way that would later be restricted to major religious or bank holidays. The first edition of The Stanley Baxter Picture Show (a series of 30-minute episodes), when it played on LWT at 9.30pm in 1972, immediately followed a Sunday night screening of the 1941 western Belle Starr, starring Randolph Scott. So, while many of the sketches drew on a cinematic literacy that Baxter had possessed since childhood, he could also assume that viewers would get the references.While classic movies were his initial fuel, parodies of TV drove the later shows, a shift recognised in the double-meaning titles of Stanley Baxter on Television, and Christmas Box.View image in fullscreenBaxter was awarded an outstanding contribution award at the 2020 Scottish Baftas.Photograph: Ian Skelly/Bafta Scotland/PABaxter was an intellectually inquisitive, well-read man, who spent his final years quietly and alone, described in profiles as a “widower” after the death, in 1997, of his wife, Moira. However, in November 2020, aged 94, he agreed to the publication ofThe Real Stanley Baxter, a biography by Brian Beacom that he had previously stipulated should only appear posthumously. The book disclosed that Baxter, who had always known he was homosexual, had wed Moira, against his instincts, following societal and showbiz fashion. The marriage had been a disaster, and the couple had lived separate lives, including, for Stanley, many gay relationships.This publication, from such a private man, felt like a brave final accounting, and had the effect of focusing attention – in his final years – on his work, rather than delayed private revelations.The people who never found Baxter’s TV shows funny were the accountants at LWT and the BBC, who, at both networks, ultimately declared the productions unjustifiable. Retired by TV, he returned – after a period of exile – to radio, which thus came to frame his career in a way Baxter found artistically satisfying but financially dismaying, joking that “Radio is all work and no pay.”First commissioned to mark his attaining octogenarian status, The Stanley Baxter Playhouse developed into a regular series, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 from 2006 to 2016, in which Baxter and another actor (including Richard Briers and Geoffrey Palmer) performed two-hander dramas. It was a perfect final platform for a performer so vocally adept.Although greatly admired by younger TV stars who had grown up watching him – such as the impressionist Rory Bremner – Stanley Baxter had, unlike most great performers, no later imitators. This was partly because no network could have found the budgets, but also because there has been nobody since with such impressive ears and legs. Each of his best shows was genuinely a special.Explore more on these topicsCultureTelevisionTV comedyShareReuse this content"

The2023 Eras Tour concert moviedidn’t show any of the inner workings of this three-and-a-half-hour behemoth, which ran for 149 dates from 2023-24. Fans put some bits together, such as how Swift arrived on stage being pushed inside a cleaning cart. Plus, given the two albums she wrote during and about the Eras tour – 2024’s The Tortured Poets Department and this year’s The Life of a Showgirl – it wouldn’t be Swiftian to overlook another lucrative IP extension.What fans could never have imagined was that Disney was set to start filming as the Eras tour was due to hit Vienna on 8 August 2023 – the first of three shows in the Austrian capital that were cancelled owing to anIslamic State terrorist plot. We learn this in episode one of the six-part docuseries The End of an Era, when Swift and her longtime friend Ed Sheeran are backstage at Wembley, hours before he guests at her first concert after the thwarted attack. “I didn’t even get to go,” Swift tells him of Vienna. “I was on the plane headed there. I just need to do this show and re-remember the joy of it because I’m a little bit just like …” She can’t find the words.These are the biggest revelations of the first two episodes. The series begins by reiterating the now very familiar storylines around the tour: it was motivated by Swift having her master recordings sold without being given the option to buy them outright – and the pandemic. There was the Ticketmaster frenzy, Swiftonomics, friendship bracelets,Swifties causing seismic wobbles from their jumping. “I thought this would be a tour I was very proud of,” Swift says. “It’s more than a tour, it’s a force to be reckoned with in global culture. So never did I think we would have a terrorist plot.”We see Swift in her London hotel room in mid-August – not just post-Vienna, but also just weeks after the Southport attack where three girls were murdered while attending aSwift-themed summer holiday dance class. Visibly distressed, she tries to explain the situation. “We dodged, like, a massacre situation? And so I’ve just been kind of all over the place. There was this horrible attack in Liverpool at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party, and it was little kids that …” She can’t stop herself crying. “I can’t even explain it,” she whispers.Before that night’s Wembley show, she says as she wipes her eyes, she’s going to meet the victims’ families backstage. “It’s gonna be fine because when I meet them I’m not gonna do this” – cry – “I swear to God. I’m gonna be smiley.”Taylor Swift: The End of an Era – trailerThat’s what it means to be a performer, she says. You get all your emotion out before going on stage, so that like a pilot, you can calmly steer the crowd through their night. “Keep your seatbelts fastened and welcome to the Eras tour,” she deadpans. You don’t see her meeting the families, of course, but afterwards, you see her sobbing, being consoled by her mother, Andrea, as Swift simultaneously dabs off the professionally applied mascara pooling under her eyes. It is impossible not to feel her pain, and the horror of these atrocities, particularly when, as this documentary reiterates, Eras was meant to be about working your nuts off to deliver joy to – in total – 10 million ecstatic fans. When she runs off stage that night at Wembley, she immediately asks: “Did anything bad happen that I don’t know about?”Since Swift releasedThe Life of a Showgirlin October, the critical tide has turned against her (though not the commercial one – it’s the year’s biggest album). Critics found her 12th album vengeful, insubstantial and thinly written; her public appearances have felt stage-managed and hollow. The End of an Era doesn’t provide a ton of revelations beyond Vienna. You spot that she has saved her fiance, Travis Kelce, in her phone with red heart emojis after his name – cute – and get an insight into how secretive the rehearsals were. Dancers had to learn the choreography to the new Tortured Poets section, debuted in Paris in spring 2024, to a click track, because she couldn’t risk the unreleased music getting leaked. (A new version of the concert film featuring this section, The Final Show, also debuts on Friday on Disney+.) We hear a lot about how impossible a feat Eras was to pull off. At this point, you’d be a fool to expect too much more from her. But getting to see Swift at work without her public face on is a well-timed reminder of why her fans connect with her so deeply.She is, endearingly, an absolute maniac about her craft: spilling over with ideas for staging in a way that reveals how she envisages a whole world when she writes, apparently genuinely concerned that fans might complain about the new Tortured Poets bit. Where that level of command could easily create a tyrant, she seems like a lovely boss: personally involved with her dancers, musicians and crew, bigging them up in heartfelt pre-show huddles, in awe of their commitment, deferring to them as the highest talents in their fields.“This is a team of experts and something about that keeps me in my element,” Swift says when they rehearse new, last-minute moves for a guest spot from Florence + the Machine for the final night in London. “That kind of pressure is a privilege ’cause they’re not messing up, so it better not be me!” Maybe you could be cynical about footage of her giving them all huge bonuses, but this is life-changing money and a good example for her peers. “Setting a precedent with the Eras tour is really important to me,” Swift says backstage as she seals each personally written note with wax.As for the final four episodes, we’ll probably get insight into her evolving romance with Kelce, perhaps skipping over the end of her six-year relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn just weeks into the tour’s first run – and almost definitely eliding the subsequent fling with the 1975’sMatty Healythat inspired Tortured Poets. It would be great to learn more about the mentality you need to run a show like this: “From a mental standpoint, I just do live in a reality that’s very unreal sometimes,” she says. Given that the tour was ongoing during the 2024 US election, when she endorsed Kamala Harris, you wonder if she’ll go into politics, a topic she largely avoids these days. But, call me sentimental, the footage of girls, especially those the age of the Southport victims, flinging themselves around without a shred of self-consciousness says as much about the point of all this as the Eras masterminds could ever spill.Taylor Swift: The End of an Era is on Disney+Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftTV reviewTelevisionPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

The star talks feeling inferior to Meera Syal, his life in the US and why he’s thrilled to be typecastZoe WilliamsFri 12 Dec 2025 06.00 CETShareWhile we embark on the inhumanly long wait for the new season ofLine of Duty, whichstarts shootingin January, you’ll seeMartin Compston– the show’s hero and true north – a number of times. Twice as you’ve never seen him before, and once, in Red Eye, in the form that you’ve come to know and love him: brisk and taciturn, brave and speedy, the man you’d trust to save the world while the dopes all around him can’t even see it needs saving.But first, The Revenge Club, in which he is a revelation. The setting is a support group for divorcees, a ragtag gang united by nothing but the fact that they’ve been summarily dismissed by their spouses. “There’s no other reason for these characters to be in each other’s lives,” Compston says from his home in Las Vegas (more on that later – much more). “They’re all desperate and lonely and in dire need of companionship. They’re all, in their own ways, broken, which makes for this explosive mix.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m very comfortable in my own skin and career’ … Compston.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty ImagesIf that sounds miserable, it is anything but – even the scenes in a beat-up community centre are heightened, exotic and alive with possibility. The acts of revenge, undertaken by the whole group against one ex at a time, start off pretty mild: rats down the chimney, remote messing with a Spotify playlist, that order of magnitude. When they get into spiking a drink, though, things turn darker and I think it’s fair to say, life-threateningly so. At first it reminds me of Netflix’s Russian Doll, largely due to the chaotic charisma of Aimee-Ffion Edwards, the heroine-divorcee to Compston’s hero; as it goes on, though, it ceases to resemble anything else. “It sits in its own space,” he says. “It goes from intense, emotional scenes into a sort of Ocean’s Eleven caper. You think you’re going down this path, then you’re not. But as long as a cast commits to that, the audience will go along with it.”This is something he learned from Ken Loach and has stayed with him his whole career, Compston says. “If you’ve got an excitement about what you’re doing and enthusiasm for what you’re doing, the audience will come with you.” This is a casual but lurching pull back to 2002, his first role, when he was discovered as a teenager in Greenock, to play a teenager in Greenock, for Loach’sSweet Sixteen. Looking at the stills from that movie, it’s hard to believe he was once that kid; he looks so unactorly, almost embodies the spirit of authentic, uncinematic adolescence.But back to the point. There are two surprising things about casting Compston in The Revenge Club. The first is that he’s playing for laughs, which he’s only done once before (in Sky’s Urban Myths – a magic-realist retelling of Band Aid, in which Compston was Midge Ure). This time round, the witty dialogue is the engine of the drama, and every actor is pin sharp, comically speaking. “It was outside my comfort zone,” says Compston. “One terrifying moment I had was such a tiny little scene with Meera Syal; we were improvising little bits, and I remember sitting there thinking: ‘She’s comedy royalty. What if she thinks I’m shit?’” He point blank refuses to put himself in Syal’s class: “The way Meera and Sharon [Rooney, who also stars – perhaps most memorable for her role as Lawyer Barbie in Greta Gerwig’s movie] can turn it on, I don’t have that in me, it’s an artform. But I can play the angry Scotsman and be quite funny.”View image in fullscreen‘It became a monkey on my back’ … Martin Compston with Gary McCormack in Ken Loach’s Sweet Sixteen.Photograph: Bbc/AllstarCompston is also the romantic lead in The Revenge Club, which is a major fork in the road – his fictional love life, definitely as a cop, always has disaster written all over it. He and Edwards have a delightful screwball energy, spiky and passionate, and there’s a maturity to the storytelling in so far as they’re both – you suspect – a bit of a nightmare, but you’re rooting for it to happen anyway. Although that, he says, is just because I haven’t seen how it ends. “That’s one of the things I love about the show: we’re not just good guys who have been wronged. Our exes might just be people who’ve moved on with their lives. We’ve all gone down this rabbit hole because we had nothing to cling on to, and all of a sudden we have this group, we’ve taken it too far and we don’t know how to stop.”Perhaps even more unexpected is the real-life Compston in the upcoming Living Las Vegas, a delightfully old-school travelogue about his life in the US. He married American actor Tianna Chanel Flynn “nearly 10 years ago and we still haven’t had a honeymoon”, and they split their time between Greenock and Las Vegas, prompting him to make this three-parter for Channel 4. He partly explains it, in the show, by the fact that he doesn’t know that many people in Vegas. So he bods about, making friends with the lady who runs the vintage shop and some people who teach him how to ride a horse. It’s incredibly cute – Chanel Flynn is adorable, and adoring, in the background – and quite strange, at this juncture, to not only describe the US by its epic landscapes and casinos, but to spend a morning with a drag queen, Lawrence (also from Greenock), without mentioning the political ambience, in which drag is a faultline and the house always wins.View image in fullscreen‘It’s brilliant fun’ … Martin Compston in Red Eye, alongside Jing Lusi.Photograph: Laurence Cendrowicz/Bad Wolf/Sony Pictures Television“A lot of people live their lives on social media,” he says, diplomatically. “I’m not unaware of the problems out there, but we live on a lovely street, we’ve got nice neighbours, politics aside; we’re all just getting on with our lives. My wife and her family are Democrats, that would be my leaning, but I’m just a guest here. It’s become such an angry space right now that I try to keep quiet. But I still believe the same things, and [when] the time comes, I’ll still vote the same way.”Hours before we speak, the BBC announced the return of Line of Duty, for its seventh series. Seventeen million people watched the finale of season six, in 2021, making Jed Mercurio’s the most-watched drama since records began at the start of the century. “That 9 o’clock slot, whether it be on a Sunday night or over the holidays, it’s gold dust,” he says. “You feel like you’ve got the country in the palm of your hand if you’ve got something good to show them, and there’s no feeling like it.” Compston thinks Britain has fallen forAdrian Dunbar, or Supt Ted Hastings to give him his proper name: “He’s become like the nation’s uncle. A guy who wants to do right. People want to root for the good guys, and know there are good guys out there, especially in times like these.”Between that and the endless fanfic speculation on social media, its popularity is so intense I’d forgotten that the first three seasons landed quite quietly. “It wasn’t until series five that things really blew up,” he remembers. “When Sweet Sixteen came out, I was 17. It did really well, but it became a monkey on my back because everyone thought: ‘That’s who you are.’ Now if I’m typecast, if they say ‘Line of Duty is the best thing you’ll ever do’, I’m happy. I’m very comfortable in my own skin and career.”View image in fullscreen‘People want to root for the good guys’ … Compston with Adrian Dunbar and Vicky McClure in Line of Duty.Photograph: BBC/World Productions/Steffan HillThe second season ofRed Eye, in which he plays the head of security at the American embassy in London in the grip of a terrorist attack, draws on many of the qualities he conjured as DI Arnott: a charismatic certitude, a seriousness of purpose, a lot of rushing around meaning business. He would have worked on anything from director Kieron Hawkes, who’s one of his best friends – they’re also working up a film together, which has just got funding. It’s just happy coincidence that Red Eye involves so much “running about, talking into your wrist, hand on the ear like you’ve got an earpiece, that’s just cops and robbers grown up. I love all that. I live for all that. Getting to play this kick-ass, ex-SAS agent, it’s brilliant fun.”Compston is starting to think about producing, because otherwise, when he’s not working he can’t relax: “You get that working-class guilt, you need to do something.” He’s started to love it, though, and the different bits of brain it requires. “You’re suddenly thinking, should we be filming this on a train or a ferry? What’s cheaper? When you’re reading a script as an actor, all you’re thinking is: ‘Why is the character doing that?’ You’re not thinking: ‘That’s going to cost us two days’.”He describes one project, a biopic of “Allan Pinkerton, a Scottish guy on the run who landed in America and became the most powerful law man in the US. He started the secret service, worked on the Underground Railroad, invented the first rogues gallery with mug shots, chased down Butch Cassidy, Jesse James – had an incredible life. This little guy from the Gorbals.” Just when you thought there was nothing more quintessentially Compston than DI Arnott, a period drama idea appears that does, you must admit, sound extremely him.The Revenge Club is out now on Paramount+; Red Eye is on ITV1 on New Year’s Day at 9pm.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionLine of DutyDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their looped bass lines and poet Iona Lee’s commanding, velvety voice conjure a sense of slow-burn hypnosis – and just like their music, Acolyte are glamorously unhurried. They’ve released only a handful of songs in the seven years since Lee and bassist Ruairidh Morrison first started experimenting with jazz, trip-hop and spoken word, but now the group (with Daniel Hill on percussion and Gloria Black on synth, also known for throwing fantastical, papier-mache-costumed club nights with her former band Maranta) are gathering pace.Working with Lost Map, the free-spirited indie label run by Pictish Trail from his caravan on the Isle of Eigg, Acolyte released two singles this year and are promising a long-awaited EP in early 2026. Warm Days in December, which dropped earlier this month, pairs drowsy, drunken synthesiser with a baile funk-inspired groove built from hand drumming and trumpeting bass. But Lee’s macabre lyrics about climate collapse cut through the heat: “I’ve been thinking about the seasons,” she pronounces, archly. “I’ve been thinking about how the young do not live long.”Like its predecessor The Blue Dark (a shivery campfire tale told with devilish strings and violent cymbals), Warm Days comes with a clubbier, beat-forward remix (this time from EHFM regular Ravelston) which plays straight into Acolyte’s chic, sinister world-building.Katie HawthorneThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenGanavya.Photograph: Carlos Cruz SolGanavya – Would Be Better (ft Sam Amidon)Folk-pop with 15-tog warmth as Indian-American singer Ganavya collaborates with US folkie Amidon – her unusual vocal lines, darting like a murmuration, perfectly suit this tale of restlessness.BBTDuendita – Uplifted OneLike a glint of sunlight through dark clouds, in just 84 seconds the New Yorker threads fizzing synths, clattering drums and surging bass into a hopeful, meditative gem: “I feel love again.”LS​Ruthven – Precognition“I’m the baddest man, motherfucker it’s true!” That boast is justified by the funk revivalist’s latest song, which has a touch of Daryl Hall to his vocals, delivered over a trotting triple-time groove.BBTModern Nature – Shasta“Turn right at the canyon / Take it slow,” advises this dappled, delicate indie-rock warmer with shades of Yo La Tengo, written while frontman Jack Cooper was driving through northern California.LSSamara Cyn – What Will They SayThe only woman in this year’s “freshman class” of new rap talent as chosen by hip-hop bible XXL, the LA MC rails against political apathy and the fear of speaking out, surrounded by twinkling classic soul.BBTPVA – SendWith Factory Floor reunited, it’s not as if we need dupes for their haunting industrial techno, but this south London trio’s ominoussprechgesangand intensifying fritz make them worthy of the comparison.LSVarials – Where the Light LeavesBlast beats don’t get any heavier and more finely produced than the ones powering the Philadelphia metalcore band here, shaking every atom of the air as frontman Skyler Conder steadfastly roars through them.BBTSubscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add to Playlist selections on Spotify – or transfer it toApple,Tidalor other servicesExplore more on these topicsMusicAdd to playlistfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a self-effacing remark but he has a point. Most rock stars of his vintage and stature (78 next year, somewhere between 200m and 300m albums sold with Led Zeppelin) would be out there underlining their status by touring the hits. But as anyone who has followed Plant’s serpentine post-Zeppelin career will tell you, the straightforward option doesn’t seem to hold great appeal for him.So Saving Grace are a band assembled from musicians local to his home in Shropshire – though it isn’t entirely clear if Plant is joking when he suggests he found multi-instrumentalist Matt Worley working in the local tourist information office. Their oeuvre is an intriguing stew of traditional folk songs (The Cuckoo, As I Roved Out); covers that pay testament to Plant’s famously catholic tastes (Everybody’s Song by Low rubs shoulders with It’s a Beautiful Day Today by 60s psych heroes Moby Grape); and a scattering of Led Zeppelin tracks that you could fairly describe as radically rearranged: both Ramble On and Four Sticks now heavily feature an accordion, with the low end provided not by a bass guitar but a cello. Moreover, this is an evening in which one of the most renowned frontmen in rock history – whose voice is in quite astonishing nick – seems happy to regularly cede the spotlight, and effectively act as a backing singer for Worley and vocalist Suzi Dian.View image in fullscreenA collective effort … Plant and Saving Grace.Photograph: Sonja Horsman/The GuardianIt would be quixotic if the results didn’t sound so good. At turns, the music is eerie – the vocals on their version of As I Roved Out are at a distinctly peculiar, slightly unsettling angle to the backing – as well as exploratory and, for all the unlikely instrumentation, muscular. Who knew a mandolin could sound so clangorous?Dian is a fantastic vocalist, so much so that Plant receding into the background never seems like an affectation. Instead, he and Saving Grace have succeeded in coming up with music that genuinely feels like a collective effort, with each member tugging the sound in different directions. You never get the impression you’re watching a superstar and a backing band. “Exploring the possibilities,” Plant nods happily, by way of explanation, a man making capital by doggedly following his nose.Robert Plant’s Saving Grace play Symphony Hall, Birmingham, 14 Dec;then touringUK until 23 DecemberExplore more on these topicsRobert PlantPop and rockFolk musicLed ZeppelinSouthbank Centrelive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

But his music is quite different: a slippery layer cake of samples, multitudinous keys and lo-fi pop production, with Brown singing of a world where “the ebb and flow isn’t ebbing right”, be it in love or civic life. There is still room for an instant-classic R&B ballad though, in Tossed Away.Ben Beaumont-Thomas49Rochelle Jordan – Through the WallEverything isjust soon the British Canadian producer’s sixth album: expensively plush deep house suggesting club lights low, gleaming mirrors, potent looks igniting across the dancefloor. As much as the cold beat and ballroom flow of Ladida or the slapping “body, body, body” incantations of On 2 Something suggest a steadfast commitment to abandon, Jordan maintains impeccable poise and control throughout, whether in diva mode on Words 2 Say, breaking hearts on Bite the Bait, standing up for her needs on Doing It Too (“I’m not too much / You just give too little”) or patiently waiting for a frustrated lover to see the light on Ladida. Commanding, wise and committed to atmospheric excellence, party hosts don’t come better.Laura Snapes48Jerskin Fendrix– Once Upon a Time … in ShropshireView image in fullscreenHarebrained prog cabaret … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttJerskin Fendrix’s high-profile scores for the last three Yorgos Lanthimos films can’t really help prime you for the Midlands composer’s eccentrically beautiful second album, which pairs pristine musical theatre with the harebrained prog cabaret of Faith No More and (particularly) the under-sung Morphine. At first, Once Upon a Time … casts the rural bliss of growing up in 00s Shropshire in a golden light, a haven of getting ratted on Baileys and listening to Kanye on a farm, then having a lovely hungover group breakfast in someone’s kitchen. But the unexpected deaths he has experienced in recent years intrude to spoil paradise, eliciting feverish, absurdist expressions of grief – Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle is a bravura wig-out – and fathomless devastation from his camp, craggy voice. It demands a full theatrical production.LS47Clipping– Dead Channel SkyClipping frontman Daveed Diggs is best known for being in the original cast of Hamilton, and for all that this album is filled with noisy industrial rap, you can easily imagine it being successfully adapted for the Broadway stage. Dead Channel Sky is set in a cyberpunk dystopia not dissimilar to the scorched-sun “real world” of the Matrix, humming with janky tech and populated with fascists and freaky hedonists. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes render it in acid squiggles and revving breakbeats, while Diggs delivers his mutoid poetry like a prophet jacked up on some amphetamine he’s synthesised in a backstreet lab.BBTTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more46The Tubs – Cotton CrownIn different hands,the Tubs’ second album might be a crushing listen, and understandably so. In 2014, frontman Owen Williams’ mother, the songwriter and author Charlotte Greig,died by suicide. Grief, as these songs detail, made him a rubbish boyfriend. But Cotton Crown is often funny and ardent, and especially self-aware about how new love might feel like a life raft to a depressed mind ill-equipped to reciprocate: “Know it’s all in my brain / Caught in the middle of loving you and being insane,” Williams sings on Fair Enough. His striking voice, somewhere between Richard Thompson and Bob Mould, bolts through the band’s joyful jangle-pop. Clear students of the form, they’re virtuosos with zero patience for perfection, their riffs hurtling and plundering like seagulls going at a spilled catch as they vigorously rough you up with profundity.LS45Smerz – Big City LifeView image in fullscreenAn album of stilted beauty … Smerz.Photograph: Alva Le FebvreCatharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt feel like the pop girlies of the incredibly prolific and off-kilterCopenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory scene, making music that’s more outward-facing and arch than some of their insular and traditional (and equally great) classmates. Their second album lurches between throwing yourself at life – “you’re a girl in the city and you shouldn’t think twice”, they chant in deadpan harmony on Roll the Dice – and actually thinking twice quite a lot in existential spirals about purpose and desire. The dissonance between confidence and anxiety comes through in the album’s stilted beauty: one minute, their whorls of prepared piano carry you along like clouds amid perfectly turned pop-R&B and balladry; then they stab and stutter, like cracks in the pavement destined to trap your heels. In 2023, K-pop’s brightest hopes NewJeans hired them as co-writers: more pop bearing their imprint can only be a good thing.LS44Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendReleased almost exactly a year after her superstar-minting breakthrough Short n’ Sweet, and using a palette of soft rock, 80s pop, light disco and yearning country melodies, Carpenter added rich colour to one of pop’s most distinctive self-portraits. Her blatant sexuality is offset by an ironising sense of camp and a deep streak of cynicism, as she wonders whether to wrap her little finger round a series of hot but useless men. But whether dialling her exes while hopped up on “go-go juice” or being toxic for the sport of it (“you think that I’m gonna fuck with your head / well, you’re absolutely right”), Carpenter knows she’s part of the problem. Her fake helplessness at her own worst impulses is just one part of a formidable screwball comedy arsenal – she’s a Rosalind Russell for the dating app era.BBT43Jennifer Walton – DaughtersView image in fullscreenBolt from the blue … Jennifer Walton.Photograph: Liam CosfordThis Sunderland producer’s previous work included one EP of power electronics, one of antic club tracks, collabs with Aya and 96 Back as Microplastics, gigging with Kero Kero Bonito and a smattering of other credits. So her staggering, fully formed songwriterly debut was a total bolt from the blue. A swarming orchestral epic with shades of Julia Holter and Phil Elverum, it addressed her grief for her late father in serenely surrealist images – hitting a deer with a car in the middle of the night – and the painfully mundane realism of sitting in hospital corridors together. The standout Miss America combined both to stunning effect, a numbed incantation of everything Walton had seen on the US trip where she learned of her father’s diagnosis, the familiar now remade horribly mythic.LS42Erika de Casier– LifetimeErika de Casier’s fourth album updates the Y2K R&B template that fought for body-to-body sensuality in the face of rising digital creep. The old-school dial tones that pierce Lifetime’s rapt, liquid atmosphere work both as Janet homage and ironic sigh at how good those forebears had it when emotional warfare could only be conducted via pager: “Took a screenshot so / I could look at your pretty face all the time now / Without a sign that I’m online,” de Casier sings on earworm Delusional, a low-slung anthem for contemporary dating anxiety. “Hit midnight / Not even a text to hold me warm,” she rues on The Chase. That’s one of the most inviting things about Lifetime: its seductively cool surfaces conceal de Casier frantically kicking her feet below the surface, just like the rest of us.LS41Danny Brown – StardustThe Detroit rapper’s first post-rehab record totally disprovedhis fearsthat sobriety makes artists boring. On Stardust, Brown is still hard-wired with cartoonish verve, coupled with a genuinely touching sense of gratitude: “Sleeping real good at night ’cos I’m proud of myself,” he raps on Book of Daniel. While you probably wouldn’t describe someone who ponders “going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” as a wise elder, his hunger for life, opportunity and unmediated sensation blares through in how evidently gagged he is to centre younger producers from the digicore and hyperpop undergrounds: his unruly kids 8485, Jane Remover, Underscores, Frost Children and more make Stardust trip with glitch, rave, squealing riffs and overdriven noise. The rare record that makes you want to riot and shed a smiling single tear emoji.LS40-3140YHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsView image in fullscreenChews you up … YHWH Nailgun.Photograph: Steve GullickIn 21 minutes, the New York band’s debut chews you up and spits you out the other side in a tentacular whirr of rototoms, guitars that shriek and whine like neglected machinery, erratic tempos and frontman Zack Borzone’s choked-out vocals. The way the record lurches and reels brings to mind the classic horror film scene in which a human undergoes a violent, magnificent transformation into some sort of beast: much like Gilla Band’s Most Normal, 45 Pounds is a font of mutant rock pleasures.LS39Sudan Archives – The BPMThe title refers to the beats per minute of dance music, but for an album that is so totally alive, it surely also refers to a pounding heart. Sudan Archives (AKA Angeleno producer-singer-songwriter-violinist Brittney Parks) announces that “life’s a game and I got VR goggles” as she revels in the epicurean joys of sex, dancing, travel and music itself with an almost superhuman appetite: “The rest are cowards / They choose to eat and we devour.” It’s all done with breezy good humour but there’s something inspiring, even quietly political about this mindful rejection of the straight life. Her backings – full of pop-R&B and ethereal electro – also dart away from obvious mainstream paths.BBT38Ethel Cain – Willoughby Tucker, I’ll Always Love YouView image in fullscreenRomantic slowcore … Ethel Cain.Photograph: Dollie KyarnIt’s easy to see why US singer-songwriter Cain has become so adored. This album further sketches out the kind of storytelling universe that attracts footnote-writing fandoms: it’s a prequel to the events of her debut album Preacher’s Daughter, deepening the tale of Ethel and a cast of young peers as they fumble towards connection and understanding. Her moody, romantic slowcore is also perfect music for listening to on headphones as you walk around boring suburban streets wishing you could leave for bigger things. It’s also great for road trips: songs between five and 15 minutes that seem to make a long, slow blur of the pell-mell world outside.BBT37Olivia Dean – The Art of LovingThe British breakthrough of the year, as Dean – already doing decent business with her pleasant but rather neat debut Messy – reached a completely new level of songcraft. Bossa nova, folk and soul (classic and neo) are warmed together with beautiful production, evaporating any sense of pastiche to make a sound that’s both easy on the ear but distinctly Dean’s. Every song has a superb top line, Dean stretching them into loose jazzy shapes (Let Alone the One You Love, Lady Lady) or tightening them into brisk pop (Man I Need, Something Inbetween). But it’s the lyrics that make these songs so red-blooded: every stage of love, from the first flutter of flirtation to the adrenal shock of rejection, is made so true to life.BBT36Anna von Hausswolff – IconoclastsView image in fullscreenSense of awe … Anna von Hausswolff.Photograph: Philip SvenssonAnna von Hausswolff is no stranger to a monumental statement: her primary instrument is the pipe organ,a towering edifice of tin and arsenicthat offers her an ever-renewing sense of awe. But the Swedish composer’s sixth album goes bigger than ever, grappling with mortality, transcendence and evil in a series of stormy epics that also lash a little pop structure to her prow. “Oh, I’m breaking up with language / Oh, in search of something bigger than this,” she screams on Stardust, an exhilarating co-pilot on the path to absolution.LS35Bon Iver – Sable, FableIf, as Justin Vernon recently suggested, this is the last ever Bon Iver album, it’s a beautiful redemption arc: a loving send-up of his anxious, myopic sad-sack self blossoms into a radiant appreciation of possibility, sensuality, risk. Everything Is Peaceful Love has one of the year’s best refrains: “Damn if I’m not climbing up a tree right now!”, giddy with thrill and absolutely no idea of what to do when you get up there other than enjoy the view. And while there are gorgeously passionate songs here, it’s the ones about gracefully letting go of an unviable love that really underscore the admirable humility in Vernon’s bowing out.LS34Snocaps – SnocapsKatie Crutchfield’s full-throated transformation into country doyenne on her last couple of albums as Waxahatchee almost makes it easy to forget her indie-rock origins. Fourteen years since she and twin sister Allison wound down their teen band PS Eliot, the DIY stalwarts got back together – with a little help from MJ Lenderman and producer Brad Cook – and went back to brass tacks for their surprise album as Snocaps. What a treat it was: full of punchy indignation – “I could never just …coast!” they exclaim on Coast – crunchy ruminations and sing-songy contemplations of what it means to depend on and grow alongside one another. You’d follow them anywhere.LS33Amaarae – Black StarView image in fullscreenIrrepressible … Amaarae.Photograph: Salomé Gomis-TreziseWe all need an Amaarae in our lives: the person who, when you weakly protest that you’re a bit tired to go out, will soon have you holding a bottle of decanted rum in the back of an Uber, while alongside you she looks quizzically at a series of resealable plastic bags. “Ketamine, coke and molly,” she chants on Starkilla; “I spiked this drink so please open your mouth,” she tells her lover on Fineshyt. And this club-ready album from the irrepressible Ghanaian-American pop star ends up being a sensual body high, as she chases sex and glamour into the ends of the night.BBT32Perfume Genius – GloryWith typical grace and humour Mike Hadreas sends up his self-defeating tendencies on his seventh album, and wonders how old you have to be to escape those lifelong patterns: like the contradiction of struggling to face the world while also fantasising about violence and romanticising “all the poems I’ll get out” of it. It feels apt that Glory starts with the western twang of It’s a Mirror, suggesting a fixed, brawny masculine archetype – then breaks it down over the course of the record, a gothic, celestial voyage into the interior, and the latest addition to a uniquely beautiful American songbook.LS31Horsegirl – Phonetics On and OnView image in fullscreenFinely tuned … Horsegirl.Photograph: Ruby FayeSpindly rock à la the Velvets and the Raincoats is as spartan in its constituent parts as it is high on reward, and Chicago trio Horsegirl demonstrated the inexhaustible pleasures of this 60-year-old form on their second album. With production from Cate Le Bon, they wove magic from just a few thrumming guitar and bass notes and Nora Cheng’s nonchalant, near-spoken vocals, as well as a knack for melodic hooks as finely turned as intricate woodwork: the bittersweet, skipping chorus of Information Content is an all-timer.LS30-2130Oklou – Choke EnoughTrance, medieval polyphony and Y2K pop may seem like odd bedfellows, but French singer-producer Oklou cast them all in a dawn-like haze on her gorgeous debut album, flowing these distinct disciplines together until they swooped and soared like a flock of starlings. Choke Enough was no academic exercise, either, with standout pop moments including Take Me By the Hand with Bladee – a winsome conjuring of how Alice Deejay might sound in collaboration with a piping minstrel.LS29Jacob Alon – In LimerenceView image in fullscreenRustling with life … Jacob Alon performing at the ZYN Rolling Stone UK Awards, in London’s Roundhouse.Photograph: Sue Moore/Hogan Media/ShutterstockOne of the star-making moments of the year was at the Mercury prize, as Scottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon reduced the arena audience to a hush with just a voice and an acoustic guitar (though there were delighted whoops when a call of “free Palestine” was folded into their rendition of Fairy in a Bottle). It hopefully brought a broader audience to their debut album In Limerence, which has shades of Adrianne Lenker, Jeff Buckley and even Paul McCartney’s cadences to its unguarded indie-folk. It would have been easy to make this music blandly beautiful, but Alon and producer Dan Carey keep it rustling with life, as they reach for a burbling synth, trumpet improvisation or dusty-sounding drum kit.BBT28KeiyaA – Hooke’s LawThe title of the Chicago producer’s second album references the law of physics that reflects how stretch is proportional to load, how a spring always bounces back when tested within its elastic limit. The whistlestop Hooke’s Law expands and contracts accordingly as KeiyaA’s trifles with loss and romantic disappointment find their embodiment in racing breakbeats and collagist chaos one minute, gorgeous, soul-weary stillness – as with the liquid Stupid Prizes – the next. Listening can feel like being pleasurably blitzed with sensation, with each repeat revealing new details: an invitation to submit to KeiyaA’s masterful grip.LS27Wet Leg – MoisturizerIn 2022 they released one of the 21st century’s biggest indie debuts, which scored a UK No 1 and Grammy and Brit awards. The pressure was there for the follow-up, but not only did it top the charts again and earn another couple of Grammy noms, it had even more swagger and heart. “You wanna fuck me, I know, most people do,” Rhian Teasdale shrugs on Mangetout, and she actively intimidates a lustful bloke on Catch These Fists – but much of the album is given over to her wonderment at falling in love. “I’ll be your Davina, I’m coming to get you … I’ll be your Shakira, whenever, wherever”, she sings: great new vows for millennial weddings.BBT26Wolf Alice – The ClearingView image in fullscreenSomething symphonic … Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice performing at Manchester Arena.Photograph: Andy Von Pip/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“English bands are so hesitant to ever admit ambition, but I am ambitious with this record,” Wolf Alice’s drummerJoel Amey saidas The Clearing was announced – and sure enough, this was a huge step up and out for a band who were already one of British indie’s biggest. There’s something symphonic about the heft of it and not just because of the string sections, thanks to superb production by Greg Kurstin: the bass and toms are heavy yet warm, the piano pounding yet not overbearing. Ellie Rowsell sings about suitably big themes, too, from universe-bending love on Leaning Against the Wall (“it really, really made the room sing, the way you said my name”), invaluable friendship on Just Two Girls, and The Sofa’s uplifting manifesto for being wild and indolent instead of toeing the line.BBT25Wednesday – BleedsThe North Carolina band’s sixth album is littered with endings, some violent – the title of Carolina Murder Suicide tells you all you need to know – some devastatingly mundane, as Karly Hartzman examined the cracks that led to a long relationship’s end. Her unique gaze unites both, noticing the details and dynamics that other songwriters might write off as inconsequential: like the “mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail” at a wake in Wound Up Here (By Holdin On). Full of screaming noise and riffs that evoke knee-sliding through the mud, as well as moments of unexpected sweetness, Bleeds shows the fullest picture of her band yet.LS24Titanic – HagenView image in fullscreenUncontainable euphoria … Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta of Titanic.Photograph: Janet ChauThere can be few faster-evolving ensembles than that of Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta, who in just two albums have leapt from sparkling cabaret jazz to … whatever the uncontainable euphoria of Hagen is. It’s a record that vaults from blast beats to choral beauty, eerie splendour to nervy cacophonies, like nothing else you’ve heard. Despite these bold stylistic clashes, it hangs together beautifully, thanks also to Fratti’s spectacular voice, as capable of cirrus-like delicacy as parched sharpness.LS23Cate Le Bon – Michelangelo DyingWhere two of this year’s most prominent breakup albums were savage (Lily Allen) or spectacular (Rosalía), Welsh innovator Cate Le Bon’s hypnotically murky seventh album reflected the circular sadness of love faltering – the catch-22 of wanting to escape heartbreak while knowing that letting go means relinquishing something that was once profound. Michelangelo Dying contains some of her very best choruses and melodies, powerful enough to penetrate the album’s billowing haze of guitar, sax and synths, like a hand reaching out in the dark.LS22Little Simz – LotusView image in fullscreenWider reckoning … Little Simz performing at the Co-op Live arena in Manchester.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianSimz’s sixth album came amid a dispute with the Sault producer Inflo – she has sued him for allegedly failing to repay a loan – and a couple of tracks target him in all but name (“You talk about God when you have a God complex / I think you’re the one that needs saving”). But Simz seems to be having a wider reckoning: she revels in how far she’s come from once just having “a dream and a pushbike”, and reflects on self-preservation, creative frustration and – in a gorgeous, naturalistic back-and-forth with Wretch 32 – push-pull family dynamics.BBT21John Glacier – Like a RibbonFor all that you can link her to trip-hop and cloud rap, what British MC has ever really sounded like this? It would be easy to call Glacier monotone, but in truth her careful, even flow holds so much musicality: her deliberately limited melodic and rhythmic range means that the subtle distinctions in her vocals are fascinating, as she goes from bored to wry to boastful to poignant within one-degree turns on the emotional thermostat. The grainy, faintly corrupted beats are superb, but it’s that delivery, and her lyrics themselves – stoic and even amused as life blows her from place to place – which make this album an all-timer in UK rap.BBT20-1120Aya – Hexed!A series of surreal vignettes confronting addiction, panic and the challenges of growing up queer, Aya Sinclair’s experimental electronic masterwork is a wind-whipped dash around the towns and moors of Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. From the rotor blade-whomp of Peach to the infernal pattering snares on Navel Gazer, her sound design hits you like a ton of feathers: a surreal, destabilising flurry of detail. And the lyrics, done as careful mutters or sarky sing-song, are world-class. Her poetry revels in multiple meanings – is she saying “Flemish” or “phlegmish”? – and in the plasticity of language, rhyme and even lived experience, whether retelling a toxic relationship (“Couple rows so we could pop our cysts / as though the pus’d bust right out of the tryst”) or evoking the feeling of being totally cut adrift: “Abseil away another day supine inside the bag.”BBT19Clipse – Let God Sort Em OutView image in fullscreenRich with wisdom … Malice and Pusha T of Clipse.Photograph: Cian MooreThey may have been outdone by Oasis as 2025’s most anticipated fraternal comeback, but there was still considerable excitement around the return of Gene and Terrence Thornton, AKA Clipse’s Malice and Pusha T. After making two of the best albums in 00s rap, Malice found God and left Pusha to it. But on returning, Malice’s mic tone – which always had a sort of ancient, oaken majesty to it – felt rich with wisdom, while Pusha, who in the interim had beefed Drake to hugely entertaining effect, still had his nose for a scrap, this time with Travis Scott. Together, they advocated for their own brilliance and for what they see as a better class of rap, sometimes at the same time: “They content-create, I despise that / I create content then they tries that.”BBT18Big Thief – Double InfinityAfter their bassist Max Oleartchik left the group, Big Thief pressed on as a trio but brought in a number of auxiliary musicians, resulting in an album that sounds like it could have been worked up around the campfire of a utopian off-grid commune. These are some of the American band’s best, biggest-hearted songs to date, with the type of easy facility with melody – and equally easy access to their emotions – that can’t be taught. Take Grandmother, in which frontperson Adrianne Lenker surveys our collapsing world and flawed humanity, and decides on the singalong chorus: “Gonna turn it all into rock’n’roll.” In many other hands this would be trite, but as with so much of Big Thief’s music, the purity of intention makes it life-affirming.BBT17Alex G – HeadlightsView image in fullscreenA new frontier … Alex G.Photograph: Chris MaggioWhat constitutes integrity? Working for love or money? Freedom or obligation to others? On his first album for a major label, standing at a new frontier of success, Alex G weighs these existential questions in appropriately vast, beautiful indie-rock epics, some breathless with anxiety (Spinning), others sardonic (Real Thing) or severe (Headlights). Despite the very contemporary, very Alex G touches – take the sprite-like voices and distortion of Bounce Boy – there’s a comforting solidity to this record that makes it feel as though it’s existed for ever, sharing the same spooked twilight as the best of Yo La Tengo and REM.LS16Pulp – MoreThe anticipation of a reunion album rarely measures up to the often dismal results. Perhaps the key is to spend a solid chunk of years playing together again, as Pulp did, before risking putting anything down on record. “I exist to do this / Shouting and pointing,” Jarvis Cocker sang on comeback single Spike Island; anyone who’s seen Pulp in recent years can attest that he has lost none of his calligraphic physical flair. Nor, as the magnificent More proves, has his gimlet eye for the grubby disappointments of middle age diminished. Life apparently feels no less of a charade at 62 than early adulthood did back in the 90s, a fact he sells as both anticlimax and a weird kind of comfort: if that’s the case, the unvarnished love songs and heartfelt stands against commodification suggested, you might as well stick it all on the line.LS15Turnstile – Never EnoughView image in fullscreenUncomplicated thrills … Turnstile in concert in Guadalajara, Mexico.Photograph: Medios y Media/Getty ImagesIs it hardcore punk or not? As this dull debate brewed on comment sections and Discord servers, the rest of the world got on with the business of just enjoying the uncomplicated thrills on Turnstile’s latest. Certainly, Seein’ Stars sounds like 90s Duran Duran, the epic title track could be played as NFL teams run on to the field and even the hardcore-paced Dull and Solo have a sheen to them. But for every frowning punk purist, you had 10 more lining up to pile into the pit with smiles a mile wide.BBT14Deftones – Private MusicThis was the US alt-metallers’ first album back after serendipitously getting a huge new following via TikTok, particularly for their sweeter, shoegazier material. But rather than court that audience by cynically remaking Sextape 11 times over, they instead created a balletic cyborg of a record. The riffs could put a dent in concrete masonry, but the groove-metal rhythms are light-footed and, as ever, vocalist Chino Moreno sets out even wider tonal possibilities. It’s as if waves of pain and relief pass across his spirit as he goes from dry croaks to thunderous denouncements to blissful clean singing.BBT13Suede – AntidepressantsThree decades since their debut and five albums into the second phase of their career, Suede sound as impassioned and vital as they ever have. Brett Anderson’s voice is a long way from the nasal sneer of Animal Nitrate all those years ago: it’s now rounder and deeper in colour, reminiscent of Echo and the Bunnymen’s Ian McCulloch, but the core Suede theme – humanity in all its reckless and sexy brokenness – is still there. Playing post-punk with a Britpop grandeur, Anderson and co reckon with the fleeting nature of existence (“Formless as a cloud / Weightless as a sound”) and the caprices of brain chemistry, but with a sense of optimism, even triumph.BBT12Jim Legxacy – Black British Music (2025)View image in fullscreenMore assured … Jim Legxacy.Photograph: Igoris TarranHis previous mixtape Homeless N*gga Pop Music was at No 42 in our 2023 albums list; rapper-producer Jim Legxacy jumps up the rankings as his place in British rap becomes more and more assured. Beats-wise, he defines the joyous anything-goes energy of the current UK underground, expertly applying chipmunk effects to samples, adding funny DJ-style vocal tags (“turn that mediocre bullshit off, we’re listening to Jim Legxacy right now!”) and even making a left turn into high-tempo pop-rock for ’06 Wayne Rooney. There’s more of a mournful cast to the lyrics though, as he works through grief for his late sister, and confronts the lingering effects of his impoverished, fatherless childhood.BBT11Jade – That’s Showbiz Baby!Pop’s trickiest manoeuvre is crossing the divide from successful group to solo career. After departing Little Mix, Jade Thirlwall didn’t so much jump it as pirouette across: her multi-part debut solo single Angel of My Dreams was completely nuts, impossible to ignore and spent 20 weeks on the UK chart. Could a whole album match up? From trashy ballroom house (It Girl) to disco-funk (Fantasy, Headache), Robyn-esque sad bangers (Plastic Box, Self Saboteur) and waltz-time ballads (Natural at Disaster), she certainly has the range, not to mention smart and sweary lyrics – rhyming Edward Enninful with experimental is a neat encapsulation of what moves her. It’s her voice that really sets it all apart, though: as you’d expect of a talent show graduate turned longtime pop star, it remains stunning on a technical level, but Thirlwall also brings a whole West End musical’s worth of emotion.BBT10-610Billy Woods – Golliwog“The English language is violence, I hot-wired it / I got a hold of the master’s tools and got dialled in,” Billy Woods announces at the outset of a rap masterpiece that works both as stunning poetry on the page and thrilling music out of loudspeakers. With intensely vivid lyrics, he picks his way through psychic wreckage wrought by racism, poverty, war and more, menaced by horrible dreams (“Didn’t want the doctor to turn, I knew it’d be something awful on the ultrasound”) and dispensing jaded wisdom: “Amputation how you survive / Can’t get away if you don’t leave something behind.” And then there’s Misery, a vivid romcom about a polyamorous and possibly vampiric lover. Frantz Fanon, Cecil Rhodes, Miles Davis and “Black Thanos” are among the other figures populating these strange, heat-sick tracks, helmed by a diverse and stellar range of production talent including the Alchemist, DJ Haram and Kenny Segal.BBT9Geese – Getting KilledView image in fullscreenOutrageously accomplished … Geese.Photograph: Lewis EvansThe ways that love unravels us and knits us back together are explored on the outrageously accomplished and wise fourth album from the New York garage rock band, who are still in their early 20s. They originally formed as kids at a Brooklyn music school which partly explains the depth of their connection, but there’s something bigger at work: how to explain the way a tiny chord change can carry so much emotional weight, or how these songs can groove so tightly at the waist while their arms flail this way and that. Cameron Winter’s lyrics and vocals are peerless, too, done in a reedy head voice that’s also somehow soulful. He’s trying to live his life on a higher frequency than the rest of us, but so often he’s having his heart broken, “getting killed by a pretty good life”, or hemmed in by his circumstances: “I was a sailor, and now I’m a boat / I was a car, and now I’m the road,” he glumly pouts on Bow Down.BBT8Bad Bunny – Debí Tirar Más FotosWith the absolute integrity that has become his trademark, Bad Bunny shone his inestimable spotlight back on his roots in Puerto Rico for his sixth album, singing of sacrifice, colonial oppression and the importance of preserving tradition. He’s an incredible conduit, synthesising the past – salsa, bolero, perreo – with the present, bringing local artists including RaiNao and Lorén Aldarondo along for the ride. As if it needed stressing, Debí … also underscored his own legacy, and his incredible range: heartbroken that life must one day end on Baile Inolvidable; lovelorn in the rave on Perfumito Nuevo; seemingly cast in moonlight on the heavy Bokete.LS7Lily Allen – West End GirlLily Allen’s divorce album is so lurid in its apparent disclosures (she has said she employed some poetic licence) that it felt as though there was a risk of the carcass being tossed aside once the tabloids had picked it clean for gossip. But the quality of the songwriting and silvery electronic production, as well as the tangibility of Allen’s hurt and her ability to mint viral bits in “who the fuck is Madeleine” and Nonmonogamummy, gave West End Girl not just staying power but a place in the pantheon of great breakup albums. Standout Pussy Palace turned the grottiest of reveals into a kind of cosmic reverie that seems to suggest the elemental rearrangement of life as she knew it; the guttingly powerful Relapse, about the sober musician’s fear of losing her grip after her relationship breakdown, highlighted the temptation of oblivion in numbed-out vocoder. It lands light as icing sugar but lingers deadly as toothache.LS6PinkPantheress – Fancy ThatView image in fullscreenBreathless … PinkPantheress.Photograph: Charlie EngmanTrue to her form for writing the shortest songs in the biz, in just 20 minutes and 34 seconds, PinkPantheress vaults from weed highs to romantic lows, obsessive crushes to gripping paranoia, seduction to confrontation. (“The status cheque is due / So do I still belong to you?” from Nice to Know You, is a classic bluff call.) The music of Fancy That is just as much of a slip’n’slide through British club culture at its most playful and dazzling, from jungle to UKG and the big-tent joys of Underworld, Basement Jaxx and even the hyper-cheesy Just Jack, samples she deploys expertly, and all threaded together by her pointedly sugary voice. It’s a breathless ride, and PinkPantheress’s best case yet for her micro melodramas: why dither when you can pack this much into so little?LSNo 5 coming soonCome back tomorrow for the next 10 albums in the countdown!

She was also a communist who volunteered for the Red Cross during the Spanish civil war and an LGBTQ+ pioneer, living with the poet Valentine Ackland for decades in a quiet Dorset village, in a partnership theydescribed as a marriage.In the 1930s, Warner was described as “famous in two continents for numerous and brilliant contributions to literature”, but thoughmany of her worksremain in print, her name has faded from widespread recognition, even in the county where she lived.View image in fullscreenThe statue of Warner includes a cat – a nod to the witch’s companion in her novel Lolly Willowes.That is due to change this weekend, when a statue of Warner will be unveiled in Dorchester. The sculpture by Denise Dutton shows Warner sitting on a bench accompanied by a cat, in a nod to the creatures she loved and the witch’s companion in her best-known novel.Anya Pearson, who led the campaign to erect the statue, said that by placing the lifesize figure in the town’s main shopping area, “we are saying very clearly that women’s stories and queer women’s stories belong in our public spaces”. “Sylvia pushed boundaries, wrote without fear and lived authentically. This statue finally allows us to celebrate her as her authentic self, proudly and openly, in the town she called home.”Pearson is a veteran of this kind of thing, having previously been the force behind astatue of the Victorian fossil hunter and palaeontologist Mary Anningin nearby Lyme Regis. After that statue was unveiled to great local enthusiasm in 2022, Pearson set her sights on her home town of Dorchester, where statues commemorate the writers Thomas Hardy and William Barnes – but until now, no non-royal women.View image in fullscreenAnya Pearson led the campaign to erect a statue of an overlooked woman in Dorchester.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThe campaign, which asked for nominations of overlooked women, received more than 50 names that were shortlisted then put to a vote. Warner “won by a landslide”, says Pearson, who works at Arts University Bournemouth. The £60,000 cost was raised through crowdsourcing and a number of significant international donations.In a digital age, though, what is the value of a statue? “It’s about what towns choose to remember and to celebrate,” Pearson says.Statuesmay be easy to overlook, “but they are incredibly important because of the subliminal message they leave. And if they’re all of men and men of war, we are telling our kids that those are the only things that are worthy of remembrance. Battles, wars and the men that fought in them.“For me, this is an antidote to that symbolic annihilation of women within our civic landscapes. It’s putting them back in the story,” she added.Pearson’s successes with Anning and Warner have led to appeals for her help from other female statue campaigns, some of which have joined a loose grouping calledVisible Women UK. Alongside statues toVirginia Woolf in Richmond, west London, andAphra Behn in Canterbury, which are already in place, other groups are working on memorials to thesuffragette Mary Clarkein Brighton, the campaigning factory workerAda Nield Chewin Crewe and others elsewhere.Sam Johnson became involved in a campaign to commemorate thematch girls of east Londonafter discovering by chance that her great-grandmother,Sarah Chapman, had been a leader of their influential 1888 strike in protest at poor pay and terrible working conditions.Though the factory site – now a private residential development – has anEnglish Heritage plaque, Johnson and Pearson are working together on the campaign’s ultimate goal of a statue in a nearby park.“I’ve got this vision in my mind of three or four figures at ground height,” says Johnson. “I don’t want anything on a plinth because they’ve got to be personable and approachable. I like the idea of school kids going to visit them … as a reminder that, actually, this thing happened just down the road from where you live. And you can be that brave and courageous and wonderful as well.”Explore more on these topicsBooksStatuesFeminismWomenDorsetEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I devoured the first 12 in the franchise.My favourite book growing upLike everybody else growing up in the 1970s, I had a copy ofWatership Downby Richard Adams on my bedroom shelves – it was the law. I did love it, though. Whatever fondness I have for the English countryside probably comes from that book. I remember my grandfather – a real country dweller – seeing me reading it and being outraged. “A book about rabbits?” he shouted. “They’re vermin!”The book that changed me as a teenagerMonty Python’s Flying Circus had given me a taste for comedy that deconstructed the conventions of television itself. It hadn’t occurred to me that a novel could be self-parodic in the same way until I chanced upon a copy of Flann O’Brien’sAt Swim-Two-Birdsin the school library. Multiple narratives nested inside each other? A group of aggrieved characters taking revenge on their own narrator? I was hooked.The writer who changed my mindWhen I arrived at Cambridge at the age of 19, just over a year after Margaret Thatcher had become PM, I may not have been a Thatcherite but I was still definitely a Tory. Conversations with new friends helped to change that, but so did the passion and lucidity of Tony Benn’s Arguments for Socialism.The book that made me want to be a writerI don’t know what made me want to be a writer, exactly (I started at the age of eight), but I don’t believe it was a book. Years later, one of the novels that showed me the kind of writer I might aspire to be was Joseph Heller’sSomething Happened, with its combination of mordant wisecracking and overwhelming melancholy.The author I came back toAs a student I discovered Pilgrimage by Dorothy Richardson in the four-volume Virago edition and decided she was the British feminist Proust and it was my duty to read her. Boy, it was heavy going. Years later, I realised she doesn’t have to be read in full or in sequence: it can make more sense to take random dips and scoops which mirror the narrator’s own floating, unanchored consciousness.The book I rereadI’ve lost much of my teenage enthusiasm for Hermann Hesse, but I still occasionally return to his first novel,Peter Camenzind. It’s a lyrical Bildungsroman that combines simplicity (and brevity) with profound moral and intellectual depths, and its evocation of Swiss, German and Italian landscapes is matchless.The book I could never read againIn my youthful quest for great comic fiction I remember reading and enjoying Kingsley Amis’sLucky Jim. Returning to it in middle age I found the comedy laboured and its hero’s attitudes – once considered a breath of fresh air – felt simply peevish and entitled.The book I discovered later in lifeAs a film snob in the 1980s, I looked down on the Merchant Ivory EM Forster adaptations. I now consider them perfect films. And a recent re-viewing ofHowards Endled me to the novel that turns out – who knew? – to be a masterpiece.The book I amcurrentlyreadingBorrowed Landby Kapka Kassabova (to be published in April). No other writer’s political acuity matches her responsiveness to the natural world, whose despair at the human propensity for greed and corruption is matched by her insistence on the moral necessity for hope. “Nature writing” doesn’t do justice to her range.The Proof of My Innocence by Jonathan Coe review – ingenious cosy crime spoofRead moreMy comfort readI do believe in the concept of comfort reading. Books can and should challenge us, but they don’t all have to do that. In anxious and depressing times, we all need a steaming bath of familiar certainties. For me, it comes in the form of Arthur Conan Doyle’sSherlock Holmescanon: warm celebrations of male friendship which also happen to be (sometimes perfunctory) detective stories.The Proof of My Innocence by Jonathan Coeis published byPenguinin paperback(£9.99).To support the Guardian, buy a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Yuri knows he died for the first time back in the 1960s, long before the technology existed to launch such sophisticated spaceships, but believes his remains were preserved and stored for future revival. Onboard life is modelled on classic crime noir from the 1940s: men in hats, cigarettes and whisky, with no futuristic tech beyond some clunky, glitching robots. As he doggedly pursues the truth about the seemingly unconnected deaths of two teenagers from the most powerful families on the ship, Yuri gradually learns about himself. There’s a conspiracy that goes back generations in this clever, entertaining blend of crime and space opera.View image in fullscreenParis Fantastique by Nicholas Royle (Confingo, £9.50)The third collection after London Gothic and Manchester Uncanny captures both the reality and the mysteries of contemporary life in Paris in 14 short stories, 11 published here for the first time. Royle is a genius at blending the ordinary with the eerie, and his stories range from displays of outright surrealism to sinister psychological mysteries that play out as suspensefully as Highsmith or Hitchcock. It’s a memorable, unsettling excursion through the streets, passages and banlieues of Paris, and a masterclass in writing evocative short fiction.View image in fullscreenAll Tomorrows: The Myriad Species and Mixed Fortunes of Manby CM Kosemen (Wilton Square, £18.99)Inspired by the art of SF/fantasy illustrator Wayne Barlowe, and by writers fromOlaf Stapledonto Larry Niven, this book began as a teenager’s project, as he worked out his ideas of various extreme ways humans could conceivably evolve over millions of years – whether by genetic manipulation, out of necessity to adapt or by slow, natural processes. An earlier version appeared online in 2006, but this is the first print edition in English, including new material and notes explaining the origins of imaginary species including Spacers, Asteromorphs, Swimmers, Symbiotes, Tool Breeders and Bug Facers. A fascinating, horrifying work of the imagination: beautiful, complex and surreal.View image in fullscreenThe Salt Oracleby Lorraine Wilson (Solaris, £18.99)Set in the same fantastical post-internet world as the author’s previous novel We Are All Ghosts in the Forest, this standalone takes place at sea. We are on the Bellwether, a ship that functions as a university outpost. Scholars study a strange girl known as the Oracle and record her cryptic utterances, which may provide information vital to marine traffic formerly reliant on weather satellites, GPS and other now-useless tech. But it is dangerous to spend too much time near the Oracle, as she attracts digital ghosts to the air around her. These appear as fragments of old films or snatches of audio broadcasts. Despite their insubstantial appearance, merely to brush against one can leave a person “ghost-infected”, a degenerative state worse than death. The story is told through three different viewpoints, one of them the traumatised Oracle. Involving murder, conspiracy, academic rivalries and a misunderstanding that keeps two yearning lovers apart, it is possibly a bit overcomplicated, but this is a weird, rich and ultimately rewarding journey.View image in fullscreenThe Witching Hourby various authors (Sphere, £18.99)Here, 13 original ghostly tales take as their starting point any sort of supernatural event that might occur in the hour after midnight. All but one are set in the past – from 1718 Massachusetts to 1770s Paris to the Antarctic in the 1920s – with most occurring somewhere in 19th-century Britain. They are old-fashioned narratives in the best sense, with the classic virtues of a shivery, satisfyingly surprising story. Standouts for me include entries by Elizabeth Macneal,Catriona WardandNatasha Pulley, but there’s not a dud in the lot. A superb anthology for these dark winter nights.Explore more on these topicsBooksScience fiction roundupScience fiction booksFantasy booksHorror booksFictionreviewsShareReuse this content"

I was with her, a radio producer trying to capture the sounds of paper creasing as Orlean attempted to keep pace with the “Da Vinci of origami”, wincing when her goldfish’s fins didn’t exactly flutter in hydrodynamic splendour.It was Orlean in her element: an adventurous student, inquisitive and exacting, fully alive to the mischief inherent to reporting – and primed to extract some higher truth. “When we first met you said something to me I’ve never forgotten,” Orlean told Lang. “That paper has a memory – that once you fold it, you can never entirely remove the fold.” Was that, she wondered, an insight about life, too?Over the course of four decades, seven books and countless exquisite magazine features, Orlean has profiled celebrities and nobodies, followed cults and choirs, turned her eye to supermarkets and surfers. “Writers fall into two categories: there are those who have something they want to say to the world, and there are those who believe the world has something to tell them,” she observes. Orlean falls squarely into the second camp. There are two kinds of story she likes best: “hiding in plain sight” and “who knew?”.A memoir is usually neither of these sorts of stories, but Orlean rises to the challenge of writing about her own life with grace. Joyridefollows another thread she has repeatedly returned to in her work: the nature of obsession. At the Willamette Week in Portland, where she got her start, the editor preached that “no matter how small or narrow its focus, every story was meaningful”. Orlean married a likeminded Weekstaffer and got her big break covering the Rajneesh cult for the Village Voice.The subjects of her pieces from this time – for the Voice, the Boston Globe, Rolling Stone, Vogue and the New Yorker – are a cultural time capsule. There’s a history of Lycra, profiles of Bon Jovi and the artist Christo, an investigation into the folding practices at Benetton. Assignments are elastic, and so are budgets. While negotiating the terms of a New Yorker feature about a Bronx cab driver who had found himself elected the king of the Ashanti people in the United States, she is merely told, “Sphinx-like” by editor Chip McGrath, that her expense budget will be enough to cover travel to Ghana if “necessary”. Her final payment? “It will be sufficient.” “I don’t need to tell you that magazines don’t work that way any more,” she writes.Joyride represents the liner notes to a career of hits. There’s the deliciously “heady, fun, surreal” experience of watching Spike Jonze’s movie Adaptation, based on her book The Orchid Thief, come to life – including being played by Meryl Streep. (Orlean’s account of flipping open Charlie Kaufman’s script for the first time to discover herself in it is laugh-out-loud funny.) A memorable Twitter thread from 2020 – the result of too much rosé on an empty stomach – that made her the “patron saint of pandemic drinking”, gets its moment, too. And harder episodes: a divorce, a cancer diagnosis, the sorrow of moving her mother into a nursing home.Orlean sees the writing life as one of constant highwire creative reinvention – “you never build equity”,  is how she puts it. Her father, who wanted to be writer but became a businessman instead, might have agreed: after she published The Orchid Thiefhe suggested she consider finally enrolling in law school. Thank goodness she didn’t. “I felt called, I really did, to describe ordinary life in a way that revealed its complexity and poetry – to show how rewarding it is to be open to and curious about the world, and how much joy can be found in letting yourself be surprised.”Joyride: A Memoir by Susan Orlean is published by Atlantic (£20).

Now – via a degree for developers and an incubator for startups – the tiny city is churning out world-famous video game hits. What is the secret of its success?Ralph JonesFri 12 Dec 2025 14.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 16.12 CETShareOn 26 March 2014, a trailer for a video game appeared on YouTube. The first thing the viewer sees is a closeup of a goat lying on the ground, its tongue out, its eyes open. Behind it is a man on fire, running backwards in slow motion towards a house. Interspersed with these images is footage of the goat being repeatedly run over by a car. In the main shot, the goat, now appearing backwards as well, flies up into the first-floor window of a house, repairing the glass it smashed on its way down. It hurtles through another window and back to an exploding petrol station, where we assume its journey must have started.This wordless, strangely moving video – a knowing parody of the trailer for a zombie survival game called Dead Island – was for a curious game called Goat Simulator. The game was, unsurprisingly, the first to ever put the player into the hooves of a goat, who must enact as much wanton destruction as possible. It was also the first massive hit to come out of a small city inSwedenby the name of Skövde.There’s a good chance you have never heard of Skövde. There’s an even better chance you don’t know how to pronounce it (“hwevde”). Historically, it which is nestled between the two largest lakes in the country, Vänern and Vättern, has relied on Volvo for much of its employment. But, for the last 25 years, there has been a shift. Skövde has managed to produce some of the biggest and most talked-about video games on the planet – not just Goat Simulator but titles like V Rising, Valheim, and RV There Yet?.In a city of 58,000, there are almost 1,000 people studying or making a living from video games there–by comparison the entire gaming sector in the UK amounts to 28,500 people. How can Skövde punch so far above its weight?I am sitting in an office in the university where a revolution took place. At the turn of the century, Skövde implemented something that would separate it from the surrounding cities of a nation already getting a head-start in the gaming world. In the late 1990s Ulf Wilhelmsson wanted to study for a PhD in video games in Sweden. Various universities, he says, told him: “You can’t study computer games, that’s just silly.” He went instead to the University of Copenhagen and had his work funded by the University of Skövde, whom he was working for at the time. In 2001, seeing a lack of students entering the university’s IT programmes, he proposed a video games development qualification. One of the things that made senior staff reluctant was that there were no game companies in Skövde. “I’m quite stubborn,” Wilhelmsson tells me at the university, “and I said: ‘If we build it, they will come.’”View image in fullscreenFangs very much … V Rising.Photograph: Stunlock StudiosIt was difficult at the outset, when the degree began in 2002. “Since we were among the first educational programmes that did this,” says Sanny Syberfeldt, the director of the design programme, “we had no guide or no model, so we have had to make them up as we went along.” The degree is now hugely popular, attracting multiple applicants per seat. “Our aim has never been to help students to fulfil the short-term needs of the games industry,” says Wilhelmsson. “It has always been to change the industry, create something that has not yet been done.”His colleague Lissa Holloway-Attaway, who wears a pink multicoloured jumper with tigers on it, tackles gaming’s hinterland, asking the students to reflect on how gaming can intersect with subjects such as gender, identity and grief. One project involves them creating the prototype for a game that revolves around a historical environment or object.When you’re in a town that is this small but has this amount of game developers, it’s easier to form a game-development communityScience Park Skövde, another crucial player in the city’s continued nurturing of game developers, is right next door to the university’s gaming department. Outwardly an unremarkable white building, inside it feels light and airy, with colourful chairs and jigsaw pieces dotted on the wall. The team at the Science Park run a three-year programme called Sweden Game Start-Up, which incubates teams looking to turn gaming into a viable career, helping them to find funding for their works-in-progress. One colleague says they “loan out self-confidence”. “The goal is for them to exit with a sustainable company that will hopefully live on after they leave the programme,” says Jennifer Granath, who works in communications at the Science Park.Over fika – the Swedish term for a coffee-and-cake break, which in this case involves cinnamon buns – I meet around 30 of the developers in the incubation programme. They range in age from 22 to 45 and are incredibly warm and articulate. With a great deal of pride they show me their games in a big open room. There’s Home Sweet Gnome, in which you are a gnome who runs a bed and breakfast for creatures from folklore; horror golf game Club House on Haunted Hill; and Muri: Wild Woods, in which you are a mouse who goes on a cleaning adventure. Some of these games have been funded and released; some are still in development.View image in fullscreenBilly no mates … Goat Simulator 3.Photograph: Coffee Stain StudiosIt’s invaluable to be here, say the developers, 99% of whom studied at the university. One says that in Stockholm the game companies don’t care about graduates because there are so many of them; in Skövde, a city with 1/20th of its population, everyone knows everyone and scratches one another’s backs. “The size of this city is really to the community’s advantage,” says Louise Perrson, the head of the university’s game-writing programme. “If you come here with the thought of getting into the industry, you also come here knowing – or at least finding out – that you’ll be part of one big community.”It’s significant that the three game studios that have helped to put Skövde on the map – Iron Gate, Coffee Stain and Stunlock – have all stayed in the city. Josefin Bertsson, a community manager at Iron Gate, says: “Without the incubator, the company most likely would not have existed.” Iron Gate’s premises have a sleek, lavish feel: lots of dark wood, plum-coloured sofas, a huge lighting fixture in the shape of antlers. Various swords are dotted about the place; and there is a large model of Sauron’s eye atop a black Lego tower.Sweden is lacking a national strategy for the games industry, even though we’re super-famous for our games all around the worldThe studio is most well known for making Valheim, a Viking survival game in which players are placed in a kind of purgatory and must attempt to ascend to Valhalla by proving themselves to Odin. Its preview version sold around 5m copies in its first five weeks. It may be Skövde’s most successful game. “I think that when you’re in a town that is this small but you have the amount of game developers that you have,” says Bertsson, “it’s easier to form a kind of game development community than in, say, Stockholm. It’s easier to congratulate your friends on something because they’re right next door.”Coffee Stain, whom we have to thank for Goat Simulator, work out of an extraordinary space that was once a bank. (Studio manager Robert Lazic calls it a “bank palace”.) Over several floors there are features like a gym, a massage room, a board game room, and a huge wood-panelled meeting room full of fake trees. Lazic was part of the university’s first cohort of students – “at the fumbling beginnings”, as he puts it. The studio is now focusing on Satisfactory, its latest game, which puts players on an alien planet and tasks them with building factories and increasingly complex infrastructure. Success in Skövde breeds success, he says. Satisfactory has sold 5.5m copies.View image in fullscreenNorse majeure … Valheim.Photograph: Coffee Stain StudiosAt Stunlock I meet Ulf Rickard Frisegård, the company’s CEO, and Tau Petersson, its PR and event manager. It’s shoes off at the door, as in many Swedish establishments. There are velvet teal curtains and board games in cabinets around the place. Stunlock created V Rising, a game in which the player embodies an awakened vampire and builds a castle for them, defeating bosses and swerving garlic along the way. V Rising sold more than 1m copies in its first week. Frisegård and Petersson were also students at the university and are in no doubt about the unique prestige of the city. When you are pitching yourself to people, “you jump through a lot of hoops telling them you’re from Skövde”, says Frisegård. Industry bigwigs make a beeline for it. Frisegård remembers an extremely powerful games industry figure, who he declines to name visiting their offices to take a look at V Rising: “He had a cab parked outside here all day – one person sitting and waiting for him – and then driving him, what is it, one kilometre to the train station.”Nationally, Sweden is a towering force in the video games arena. It is the home of multi-billion-pound giants such as Minecraft and Candy Crush. In 2023 the revenue from Swedish game companies was more than £2.5bn. The country was quick to install high-speed internet and it made subsidised computers available to its population – perfect conditions for games design. I arrived, therefore, under the impression that Sweden’s status in the gaming world meant the national government was very supportive of the industry. Marcus Toftedahl, business coach in game development at the Science Park, says: “Weeelll … that is not true.” It’s a sore point. While the municipality of Skövde has been proud and supportive, the national government has not: “Sweden is lacking a national strategy and lacking a national support system for the games industry, even though we’re super-famous for our games all around the world.” This summer the Science Park went from receiving around £240,000 a year to £80,000 a year from the national government. There is a lack of understanding about game development, Toftedahl says, and the government has shifted towards more research-heavy areas such as AI.Goat Simulator 3 review – a deranged, self-destructive caprine benderRead moreDespite these worries Skövde continues to rightly blow its own trumpet about its gaming successes. But one of the priorities for people in the industry is to ensure that its locals know about them. “It’s well known outside Skövde – maybe not as known in Skövde – that we have this huge international industry that is really successful,,” says Theres Sahlström, the chair of the Skövde Municipal Executive Committee.“So we’re trying to bring attention to it.” She’s talking to me as we’re standing by the Walk of Game on the city’s cobbled high street – a newly created series of reminders of Skövde’s achievements in the gaming world.When people ask Toftedahl if Skövde’s success is replicable in other places, he says that while the short answer is yes the long answer is less encouraging. “The smallness helps,” he says. But even other small Swedish cities haven’t been able to emulate Skövde. On the island of Gotland, for example, there have been university courses on gaming since 2002. But for Gotland, which has almost exactly the same population as Skövde, tourism is the main industry, so the region hasn’t directed as much support towards gaming. You could follow Skövde’s lead – ensure that your town taught video game development at its university; host events where game developers could showcase projects; organise networking events where people felt safe exchanging knowledge – and you would cultivate something special. But lightning simply might not strike twice.Explore more on these topicsGamesSwedenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

New titles were announced, celebrities appeared, and at one point, screaming people were suspended from the ceiling in an extravagant promotion for a new role-playing game.Acclaimed French adventureClair Obscur: Expedition 33began the night with 12 nominations – the most in the event’s history – and ended it with nine awards. The Gallic favourite took game of the year, as well as awards for best game direction, best art direction, best narrative and best performance (for actor Jennifer English).The Game Awards 2025: the full list of winnersRead moreElsewhere, Hades II took best action game, Hollow Knight: Silksong won in best action/adventure and Arc Raiders won best multiplayer. There was a decent showing for the new(ish) Nintendo Switch 2, with Donkey Kong Bananza taking best family game and Mario Kart World scorching across the line with best sports/racing game.It was also a night of big budget video game announcements. Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, a spiritual successor to the classic Xbox series Knights of the Old Republic, was revealed with the original game director Casey Hudson at the helm. Developed by Arcanaut Studios, it’s a single-player narrative adventure set on the brink of major change for the galaxy.Another returning classic was Tomb Raider, which is gettingtwo fresh instalments– a remake of the 1996 original named Legacy of Atlantis, and a new adventure, Tomb Raider: Catalyst.A newcomer to the Divinity series of role-playing adventures was unveiled witha frankly gross trailer. Created by Larian Studios, maker of Baldur’s Gate 3, the game was teased by Game Awards organiser Geoff Keighley who posted photos on social media showinga mysterious statuealong with its coordinates in the Mojave desert.An unexpected highlight was the lovely looking Coven of the Chicken Foot, a fantasy puzzle platformer from Wildflower Interactive, a new indie studio set up by Naughty Dog veteran Bruce Straley, who worked on both Uncharted and The Last of Us. You play an elderly witch called Gertie and a lumbering creature in what looks like an arthouse riff on The Last Guardian.There was anew trailerfor Capcom’s latest survival horror opus Resident Evil Requiem which showed the return of series favourite Leon S Kennedy, now sporting a floppy fringe and leather coat like some sort of emo super cop. He’ll be playable alongside FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft, the characters experiencing parallel adventures with different special abilities.Among dozens of other reveals was4:Loop, a new co-op shooter from the makers of Left 4 Dead and JJ Abrams’ Bad Robot Games, featuring eternally cloned and re-cloned warriors trying to reclaim the world from alien invasion.Ontosis a sci-fi mystery from Frictional, creator of Soma, set in a repurposed hotel on the moon. Remedy Entertainment unveiled the sequel to its acclaimed sci-fi adventure Control; namedControl Resonant, it takes place in a Manhattan reshaped by an invading cosmic force. Wildlight Entertainment, a new studio from members of the Apex Legends and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare teams showed offHighguard, a free-to-play raid shooter. And Wizards of the Coast materialised withWarlock, a dark single-player action-adventure set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe.The Game Awards isa controversial and imperfect beast. But this will be remembered as a night in which an ambitious debut game froma small French studio, with a budget of less than $10m, took all the major awards, beating vastly expensive sequels such as Death Stranding 2 and Ghost of Yōtei. In a modern games industry of billion dollar takeovers and mass redundancies, we must grasp such positives where we can.Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCEventsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They will be the first new games in the series since 2018, and both will be published by Amazon.Announced at the Game Awards in LA, Tomb Raider Catalyst stars the “charismatic, self-assured, formidable Lara Croft” from the original 1990s games, says game director Will Kerslake. It’s set in the markets, mountains, and naturally the ancient buildings of northern India, where Lara is racing with other treasure hunters to track down potentially cataclysmic artefacts. It will be out in 2027.Catalyst is in development at Crystal Dynamics, the Californian developer that has looked after Tomb Raider since 2003. Crystal Dynamics previously developed Tomb Raiders Legend, Anniversary and Underworld, as well as the reboot trilogy that featured a younger, more vulnerable Lara. Its most recent game in the series was 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider.Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, meanwhile, is being developed in collaboration with Flying Wild Hog in Poland. Featuring modernised combat and redesigned tomb-delving puzzles, the game is an “expanded” ground-up reimagining of Lara Croft’s very first 1996 adventure, which established her as one of gaming’s most recognisable characters. “Our goal was to respect the spirit of Core Design’s original game, while updating the experience for today’s gamers including building it with Unreal Engine 5,” Kerslake says. “We see this is a reimagining of the original game with a gameplay experience that wasn’t possible on the technology at the time.” Legacy of Atlantis will be out in 2026.In both games, Croft will be played by the British actor Alix Wilton Regan, who previously had significant roles in Dragon Age: Inquisition and Cyberpunk 2077. She was also due to star as Joanna Dark in the cancelled remake of 2000’s spy-shooter Perfect Dark.Despite the series’ recent hiatus, Tomb Raider still has immense brand recognition, built on its 1990s heyday. Amazon also has aTV series in the workswith Phoebe Waller-Bridge, which is to star Sophie Turner as Croft. Over 30 years, Croft has been everything from Playboy pin-up to rugged wilderness adventurer to gentlewoman action hero.“Across the series, our goal is to show that Lara is always evolving,” Kerslake says. “Her core DNA will remain, but we believe it’s important to show how each adventure shapes her character over time.”This article was amended on 12 December, 2025. An earlier version stated that developer Crystal Dynamics is based in Canada. It is based in California.Explore more on these topicsGamesTomb raiderAction gamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCShareReuse this content"

More than a decade later, he has established a mix of standardconcerto performanceswith idiosyncratic, smaller-scale projects: a choreographic collaboration,chamber-music partnershipsand imaginativelyoff-piste recital programming.For his latest Wigmore Hall appearance, bookending 18th-century French keyboard music withChopin, Kolesnikov sloped on to the stage largely hidden behind his own hair. He sat abruptly but caressed the opening of Chopin’s Waltz in C sharp minor Op 62 No 2 as if he’d been at the keyboard for hours, his touch cashmere-soft, the sound almost outrageously intimate. Movements from a suite by the long-forgotten French composer Jacques Duphly followed without a break. Kolesnikov emphasised the contrasts – between spare, crisply articulated contrapuntal meandering and flurries of liquid passagework, the harsh and the barely audible – as if the five movements were a single fantasia composed in Chopin’s era, not Duphly’s.There was more calculated harshness in Chopin’s Nocturne in E flat Op 55 No 2, finely balanced by rhapsodic legato passages and exquisite smudges of pedal. In Kolesnikov’s hands, Chopin’s tempi were ever-flexible, phrases woven into a constantly shifting musical fabric. His performance after the interval of Chopin’s Piano Sonata No 3 in B minor Op 58 was even more controlled. Kolesnikov focused intensely on the through-line as he pushed through glissandi rising, elemental, out of the bass, through quicksilver filigree in the second movement and the slow blossoming of the third into the hyper-Romantic wild ride of the finale.But it was his central selection of movements by Rameau (whose reputation was, ironically, at its historical nadir during Chopin’s lifetime) that ultimately showcased Kolesnikov’s virtuosity as a sculptor in sound. Once again, contrasts were high-definition: quiet passages tinkled like a music box, fast episodes remained impossibly limpid. Kolesnikov drew us through all of it with his unerring sense of a continuous musical line.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicWigmore HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

Designed by powerhouse Japanese architecture firm Sanaa, the complex is a collection of eight askew buildings, melding an art museum and municipal library, encased in silver mesh-like walls, with soaring ceilings and meandering pathways.Past the lobby – a breezy open space that is neither inside nor out – the visitor wanders around paths and ramps, finding themselves in the library one minute and a world-class art exhibition the next. A door might suddenly step through to a skybridge over a rooftop garden, with sweeping views across Taichung’s Central Park, or into a cosy teenage reading room. Staircases float on the outside of buildings, floor levels are disparate, complementing a particular space’s purpose and vibe rather than having an overall consistency.It is “easy to get lost in”, says Lan Yu-hua, an associate researcher at the museum, laughing. But she says that’s something to embrace: “We say that getting lost is good.”The Taichung Art Museum is a municipal government-led project, and the latest in a string of high profile,ambitiously designedmuseums andperformance spaceswhich have opened in Taiwan in the last two decades.View image in fullscreenEclectic mix … an installation view of Folds and Flows in the A Call of All Beings exhibition.Photograph: Anpis Wang/Bolton & QuinnLed by 2010 Pritzker prize laureates Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, Sanaaalso designedthe New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, andthe Sydney Modern gallery. They worked with Taiwanese firm Ricky Liu & Associates Architects+Planners on the six-year build commissioned by the Taichung city government, who had simply asked for an art museum and a library on the same site.The final product has dissolved the borders between the two, and there’s a sense that the complex is designed to slow you down. It’s easy to picture a day spent in the library reading or working, taking breaks with a walk through the halls of art.“We are so glad that we are with the library all together, because I think that can really open up another layer of audiences for us,” says Yi-Hsin Lai, the museum’s director.Their inaugural showing includes commissions by South Korean artistHaegue Yangand Taiwanese artist Michael Lin. Yang’s work is an abstract take on the banyan trees and fireflies ubiquitous to Taiwan and Korea. Dangling in the 27 metre-high central atrium, it blends her signature venetian blinds with lights and steel frames. At night, the light from her work glowing through the mesh can be seen a kilometre away.The larger opening exhibition, A Call of All Beings, is an eclectic but coherent mix of commissioned works and newly acquired pieces by artists from 20 countries. Curated by an international team from Taiwan, Romania, Korea and the US, it hangs Taiwanese master painters of the mid 20th century next to postmodern video works. In something of a coup, the curators also sourced original early sketches of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s book, The Little Prince, and archive photos of Helen Keller.View image in fullscreen‘Gamechanger’ … exterior view of Taichung Art Museum.Photograph: Iwan Baan/Image courtesy of Cultural Affairs Bureau, Taichung City Government. © Iwan BaanIt places an emphasis on Taiwanese artists, especially those from Taichung. And there is a particular focus on including artists with disabilities – a timely effort in the same week that Nnena Kalu became the first artist with a learning disability totake home the £25,000 Turner prize.The museum officially opens to the public on 13 December. They are expecting international press and visiting museum directors, but otherwise a mostly local crowd. At least for now.Taiwan’s international profile is often tied to geopolitics and threats of invasion, rather than its arts. But that’s slowly changing and events such as Art Taipei and Taipei Biennial are drawing bigger crowds every year. For at least half a decade, the scene has been described as “undergoing a vibrant transformation” and “gaining momentum on the global stage”.View image in fullscreen‘I think it can open up another layer of audiences for us’ … the reading area of Taichung Public Library.Photograph: Iwan Baan/Cultural Affairs Bureau, Taichung City GovernmentFor Taiwan’s art sector, this new museum is a chance toraise Taiwan’s presence in the global art sceneand further “decentralise” it from the capital Taipei. Taichung, the second biggest city, is a short and easy trip from Taipei on the high-speed rail, and already hosts a well-regarded Museum of Fine Arts and aburgeoning sector of private galleries. But it struggles to attract international art fans.“It’s quite dynamic and vibrant now. We hope that in a few years Taichung can be an artistic landmark Asian city,” says Lai.Claudia Chen, chair of the TaiwanArtGallery Association, says the new museum is a potential “gamechanger” for Taiwan, “shifting the focus from the north to south”.“While Taichung and southern Taiwan have had many arts and cultural events in the past, none have reached the scale and importance of Taipei,” says Chen.Jenny Yeh, executive director of the Winsing Arts Foundation, says Sanaa’s involvement with the project has drawn international attention and built on Taiwan’s artistic momentum. “This will encourage more international visitors to explore beyond Taipei and gain a fuller sense of Taiwan’s cultural landscape. Overall, it will be a major boost to Taiwan’s visibility on the global stage.”Additional reporting by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtTaiwanExhibitionsMuseumsArchitecturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The last time London’s Ambassadors theatre aimed to give audiences the shivers, with The Enfield Haunting, it led to somefrightfully poor reviews. But a couple of years later, this intimate West End playhouse is hosting Paranormal Activity, a new instalment in the franchise that was kickstarted by alow-budget supernatural movieabout a couple plagued by inexplicable nocturnal noises. “Hold your nerve” runs the play’s tagline – a directive you suspect applies not just to the audience.Arriving at the theatre on the day of the first preview, it’s not creepy bumps and thuds that echo through the building but whizzing drills, sound checks and the last-minute discussions of a crew with a deadline. Perched in the dress circle bar, US playwright Levi Holloway and director Felix Barrett (best known as the founder of immersive theatre specialists Punchdrunk) are discussing how rarely they have been frightened in the theatre.“I sawThe Woman in Black20 years ago,” says Barrett. “I so wanted it to be the most terrifying thing I’d ever seen. There were flourishes and moments but it just didn’t get me … I haven’t seen anything that has really scared me. We’re raising the bar on that ambition.”View image in fullscreenFrazzled states … Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat in the first Paranormal Activity film.Photograph: Paramount Pictures/AllstarHolloway’s CV includes Grey House, a hair-raising drama set in a cabin amid a blizzard, as well as a retelling of Pinocchio that amps up the fairytale’s fear factor. “I think horror in theatre is a burden and a privilege,” he says. “It’s pretty daunting. If the first question you ask is how you scare someone, you’re probably off on the wrong foot … Good theatre is usually about people being forced to change. And horror usually has people being forced to change in order to survive. So you just have to have a good, honest story. The weapons you deploy to unnerve or scare have to be in the narrative.”The pair make the case that horror brings audiences together like no other genre – more even than musicals or comedy. “It’s a bit of a sanity check with your neighbour, which seems kind of relevant right now,” says Holloway. “Like, does this scare you too? Yeah, stranger, this does scare me too!”Barrett says it provides catharsis “when the world itself is very scary” and the result is “bizarrely joyous”. Holloway adds: “Imagine if a rollercoaster only had one car. It’s a different thing. There’s something so thrilling about the camaraderie that happens in the lobby at the interval or after the show.” The pair enjoy eavesdropping on rattled audience members wrapping their heads around the show’s mystery.View image in fullscreen‘We wanted to get under your skin’ … Felix Barrett.Photograph: Stephen DobbieParanormal Activity premiered at Leeds Playhouse in the summer of 2024 (it has since been given a new ending) and a parallel production istouring the USto great acclaim. “What’s amazing about this, which is different from anything that I’ve done before, is that we did the illusions first,” says Barrett. Illusions designer Chris Fisher is more used to being summoned later in the process. “The clue’s in the title – we knew they needed to be baked in,” Barrett explains.Set designer Fly Davis has created a two-storey house for the play’s couple who have recently married in Chicago and moved to London for a fresh start. “They quickly encounter a truth that they can’t run from,” says Holloway. “So it’s about a marriage and it’s about the ghosts each person brings into that marriage.”The firstParanormal Activity film, written and directed byOren Peliand filmed in his own house over seven days, suggested that people can be as unfathomable as the occult – perhaps as malicious as any demon. The seven films in the franchise also explore the frazzled states that come with change and leave us vulnerable – such as moving to a new city or having a family. Starting work on the show, Barrett and Holloway were as sleep-deprived as the average doomed Paranormal Activity character. “Our sons were born back to back when we started this process,” says Holloway. “The original haunting!” laughs Barrett. Holloway says he hopes that audiences find the couple in the play familiar as his script “gives teeth to the mundane”. For Barrett, “it’s a portrait of a marriage and then there’s a third force coming in”. Holloway laughs: “A throuple!”What excited Barrett about the project was the memory of a trailer for the first film in 2009 featuring cinemagoers’ terrified responses. (It helped create a buzz that saw the $15,000 film make more than $100m within weeks at the US box office.) Barrett’s eyes flash as he savours the opportunity “to make an audience physically recoil in the theatre”. Seeing “the sweat and the fear in the eyes of the cast” will, he hopes, “bring it home all the more directly”.Grounding the story in realism has been key. The franchise followed the found-footage technique of The Blair Witch Project, with the first film featuring a series of timecoded nocturnal video recordings made by the couple who – like the audience – scrutinise each frame to help uncover the uncanny activity. It’s a “genius device” for a film, says Barrett. “But we made the decision on day one to not do that – let’s come up with a story that’s about liveness and about the threat and plausibility of what a live audience would be scared of.” He adds: “There’s a lot of cinematic trickery and camera work happening across theatre generally … we wanted to get under your skin and play with the idea of safety, what happens when that is under threat.”Horror theatre is all the rage.2: 22 – A Ghost Story, with its celebrity-led casts, had several West End seasons and ison tour. The macabre comedyInside No 9: Stage/Frightreturns for another London run in January. Rose Glass’s haunting film Saint Maud was brought spectacularly to the stagein Newcastlelast year. MeanwhileStranger Things: The First Shadowhas run for two years at the Phoenix theatre in London and is likely to get a boost from the fifth season of the Netflix show.What do the pair say to those who bemoan the dominance of plays based on such existing IP? “They’re in the service of bringing new audiences to the theatre,” says Holloway, who points out: “We’ve been lucky enough to do something original that is tied to a franchise, but it is about our fingerprint.”Barrett says that while theParanormal Activitybanner will attract new theatregoers, Holloway has written an emotionally affecting play that “could have a different title and be on at the Royal Court instead … There are touchstones that audiences are going to know if they’re into the franchise but we’ve striven to create something with substance.”View image in fullscreen‘The weapons you deploy to unnerve have to be in the narrative’ … Levi Holloway, centre, with the cast of Grey House on Broadway in 2023.Photograph: Bruce Glikas/WireImageOn the play’s previous outings, both have noticed an audience new to the world of theatre. “Like people shouting at the stage, ‘Don’t go in there!’ It’s so noisy,” says Holloway. “It took a minute, but then we just started embracing it because people are coming in and they’re like … is this what theatre can be?”Horror films and books fuelled the duo’s collaboration and burgeoning friendship. They rewatched Don’t Look Now, Jacob’s Ladder and When a Stranger Calls, turned to the stories ofArthur Machenand the novels ofJoe Hill. “We love creeping dread rather than schlocky gore,” adds Barrett. “The tendrils of a film wrapping around your neck.” As such, atmosphere is critical to Paranormal Activity, which has a sound design by Gareth Fry and lighting by Anna Watson.“The lights are as much a part of the narrative as the design, the illusion, the cast … You need an alchemy of ingredients to have the space in between,” says Barrett. “With a two-storey house you can’t watch everything simultaneously. There are corners and shadows where your imagination fills in the gaps. Anna’s lighting is amazing. You think you can just see to the back of the room but you can’t quite. As the claustrophobia builds, your imagination is starting to play tricks on you, like when you’re a kid in your bedroom.” In rehearsals, the company discussed their childhood fears and played games such as “grandmother’s footsteps”.Holloway: “The whole thing is kind of a dare.”Barrett: “It is! I yelped with fear and joy yesterday.”Holloway: “Yesterday! You’ve seen it a thousand times already …”Barrett: “It’s a visceral response. And it’s taken the journey from Leeds to here to get to that physicality.”The Ambassadors, with its proscenium arch, is a very un-Punchdrunk setting. “It’s like an amazing holiday,” Barrett laughs. “I’m getting a taste for it!” His company, founded in 2000, built a huge fanbase by taking over often unconventional spaces for site-specific spectaculars. More recently, their shows (including the gothicViola’s Room) have been put on at theirsprawling headquartersat Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, south-east London. But years offinding the right sitesfor their shows have given Barrett an astute understanding of a building’s feel.“The base job of any Punchdrunk show is to listen to the atmosphere of the space, work out where the threat is, the perceptible residue of something that’s gone before – the weight of time that can be felt keenly in a space.”But how much do they believe in the whole supernatural shebang? “I would love to believe,” says Holloway. “And I do believe people when they believe it. But I’ve never experienced the paranormal. I’m open to it.” Barrett adds: “I profoundly don’t believe but I’m obsessed with the history of spiritualism.”Several West End theatres are said to house ghosts, from “the Man in Grey” at Theatre Royal Drury Lane to an actor-manager at Theatre Royal Haymarket. But the Ambassadors is not famously haunted. “It will be after this show,” jokes Barrett. Holloway chuckles: “We’re working on it!”Paranormal Activity is at theAmbassadors theatre, London, until 28 March and on aUS touruntil 15 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreHorror booksHorror filmsParanormal ActivityPunchdrunkFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her early works, written under the pseudonym Caroline Harvey, were historical romances, but from the mid-1980s onward, she turned to contemporary fiction, a shift that would define her reputation.In a statement, her daughters said she died peacefully at home on Thursday.“It is with great sadness that we learn of the passing of Joanna Trollope, one of our most cherished, acclaimed and widely enjoyed novelists,” said the author’s literary agent, James Gill. “Joanna will be mourned by her children, grandchildren, family, her countless friends and – of course – her readers.”Trollope’s breakthrough came with novels including The Rector’s Wife, which in 1991knocked leading authorsoff the top of the charts, and later works including A Village Affair and Mum & Dad, which tackled issues ranging from infidelity, remarriage, parenthood and adoption to the strains on the so-called “sandwich generation” caring for both their children and their parents.Though sometimes dismissed by critics as “middlebrow” or “cosy” – Terence Blackerfamously labelledher novels “Aga sagas” – Trollope long rejected such categorisations. In a2006 interviewwith the Guardian, she said, “actually, the novels are quite subversive, quite bleak. It’s all rather patronising isn’t it?” Rather than fairytale versions of domestic life, her books were praised by critics for their honest reflections of ordinary people’s dilemmas, addressing themes of broken families, difficult relationships, love and betrayal.Born in 1943 in Gloucestershire, Trollope is a distant descendant of Anthony Trollope, the celebrated 19th-century novelist known for The Chronicles of Barsetshire and The Palliser novels. She studied English at St Hugh’s College, Oxford, before joining the Foreign Office. She subsequently turned to teaching. It was during this period, while balancing work with raising two daughters, that she began writing in earnest.Throughout the 1990s and 00s, she produced a succession of bestsellers, including A Village Affair, Next of Kin, Other People’s Children and Marrying the Mistress. Many were adapted for television, bringing her stories to an even wider audience. Explaining her success, she said in a 1993 interview: “I think my books are just the dear old traditional novel making a quiet comeback”.Trollope’s later novels demonstrated her awareness of social and economic change. In City of Friends she turned her attention to the pressures women faced in corporate life; in Mum & Dad, published when she was in her 70s, she explored the strains of elder care.The changing expectations of women were a central concern in Trollope’s work. “I was born at the very end of 1943, and for my generation there were almost no women who worked,” she said in a 2017 interview with Radio Times. “I knew I wanted to, and I did. Then you get my daughters’ generation – I’ve got one of 48 and one of 45, the same age roughly as the characters in City of Friends – and they all work. And by the time you get to the generation of my 18-year-old granddaughter, they wouldn’t think of not working.” In a 1994episode of Desert Island Discs, she again addressed criticisms from men who suggested her books were trivial, responding: “It is a grave mistake to think there is more significance in great things than in little things”.She has been praised for her ability to give voice to the hidden anxieties of everyday life in her work – fellow novelist Fay Weldon once said Trollope had “a gift for putting her finger on the problem of the times”. In a2020 interviewwith the Guardian, Trollope echoed the sentiment, speaking about her motivation as a writer: “What I’m trying to do in all these novels is mirror a contemporary preoccupation. I’m not providing any solutions. I’m simply saying: ‘Can we please get the conversation going?’” She argued that fiction has value precisely because it can allow readers to “admit to all kinds of things that you can’t otherwise”.Away from writing, Trollope served as a judge for several major literary prizes and was an advocate for literacy and public libraries. She was awarded an OBE in 1996 and later elevated to CBE for services to literature. Later in life, she also spent time volunteering in prisons and young offender institutions, and was a patron of numerous charities.Trollope married a city banker, David Roger William Potter, in 1966. The couple had two daughters, Louise and Antonia, divorcing in 1983. Two years later, she married the television dramatist Ian Curteis and became a stepmother to his two sons. The pair divorced in 2001.Of her legacy, Trollopetold the Guardianin 2015: “I’d like to be remembered for something more general: that my novels were an enormous comfort to a lot of people who felt despair or jealousy or whatever it was. I want my books to say: ‘It’s OK, we all feel like that.’”Trollope is survived by her two daughters and her grandchildren.Explore more on these topicsBooksJoanna TrollopenewsShareReuse this content"

The actors talk mourning, immortality and hospital vending machinesCatherine ShoardFri 12 Dec 2025 06.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 10.19 CETShareIn 2017, Sally Bridges-Winslet died of cancer. She was 71. It was, her youngest daughter said, “like the north star just dropped out of the sky”.It would have been even worse, saysKate Winslettoday, had the family not pulled together. “I do have tremendous amounts of peace and acceptance around what happened because of how we were able to make it for her.”Winslet’s eldest son, Joe, was then 13. “For him as a child, seeing that love poured into this moment was huge. And then he discovered through conversations with friends that that’s so rarely the case.”Six years later, in 2023, Joe decided to turn the experience into a screenplay. A few drafts and some heavy-duty casting later and it’s a movie, starring Helen Mirren as dying matriarch June, Timothy Spall as her blithe husband, Bernie, plus Toni Collette (flighty hippy),Andrea Riseborough(organic fascist) and Johnny Flynn (oversensitive) as three of their children. Winslet plays the fourth (stressed exec); the film is also her directorial debut.“However much I would try to separate my own personal experience from the experience we were having as this fictional family,” she says, “it was almost impossible. At times I almost felt like I was living out moments of my own mother’s passing that I never would have witnessed. So directing actors in a tender way without falling apart in the corner was definitely part of the challenge.”View image in fullscreen‘It all come flooding back’ … Helen Mirren as June and Kate Winslet as Julia in Goodbye June.Photograph: Kimberley French/NetflixThe challenge was exacerbated by another she set herself: to make it as authentic as possible. Overhead boom mics were banned and crew banished once the cameras were rolling, the easier for the actors to avoid distraction. “That certainly made it all come flooding back. It felt very present. Even just the shape of the hospital room; the noises – oh God, that beep. When you’ve been through it, it does get you. That sense of monotony. The corridors. That it’s C17 for a Snickers in the vending machine.”She smiles, clear-eyed and capable; friendly, professional and extremely keen the film (which she has also produced) not be misunderstood. Does cinema have a duty to be realistic about death? “It matters to me,” she says. “This is very much not the movie version of someone who is slipping away with cancer. And that was hard for Helen Mirren – not because she’s vain, but because it is emotionally difficult to be that broken-down and vulnerable.”There are no atheists in a foxhole. If you’re about to die, you’re praying to somethingTimothy SpallGoodbye June is a curious and winning mix of uplifting and unsparing: 60% Love Actually, 40% Michael Haneke’s Amour. Mirren does indeed look very ill, in bed and straining on the loo (the tumour has blocked her bowel). Spall has been issued with some strikingly horrible stunt legs, Bernie also not being in the best of health. Everyone looks like an actual flawed human being – unusual in a NetflixChristmasmovie.In one showdown with Riseborough, we watch as a blotch spreads across Winslet’s neck. “I really appreciate that you noticed that,” she says, “because when I get overwhelmed and stressy, my neck does go red.” The makeup artist flagged it; “Yeah, we’re totally leaving that in,” replied Winslet – just as she did when someonepointed out a bit of bumpy tumin her2023 Lee Miller biopic.“I’m infinitely more comfortable playing characters who don’t look perfect all the time, because I don’t understand that as a conceit. I want audiences to be able to see something of themselves, of their reality, in the stories playing out in front of them.”The complication is that Goodbye June could be held up as an example of palliative best practice. For all its scrupulous accuracy regarding June’s condition – medical experts combed the script; it all feels totally kosher – her decline unfolds in an impeccably unhurried and compassionate hospital, to which June is rushed after a fall and allowed to remain for as long as she likes. Her family – so devoted their visits are put on a rota – deck out her en suite room with plants, tinsel, furniture and a fridge. She has morphine on tap and a specialist healthcare worker, Nurse Angel (Fisayo Akinade), who goes above and beyond.I think the soul does live for ever and this is a transient experience. None of us know, and that’s why it’s  marvellousToni Collette“My initial thought was: could this be far-fetched?” says Akinade on the phone a few days later. But two palliative nurses – and his own mother, a carer – confirmed it wasn’t. “Not at all. One said: ‘The other week, we had a party in one room; I just put the family in there and closed the door.’”Setting the film in Cheltenham, rather than London, was strategic, says Winslet, so the drama wouldn’t be overshadowed by chaos or overcrowding. “Everyone’s experience is going to be very different. But I really did find the endless warmth and outpouring of support from the palliative care team overwhelming.”Later, Spall points out the film isn’t explicit about whether June’s care is fullyNHSor partially private – “whether it’s a mixture of them both, you don’t know” – though the absence of that conversation means that I, at least, assumed the former.View image in fullscreenJohnny Flynn as Connor, Andrea Riseborough as Molly, Timothy Spall as Bernie, Kate Winslet as Julia and Fisayo Akinade as Nurse Angel in Goodbye June.Photograph: Netflix/PAFor her own part,Winslet recently saidthat her mother’s condition necessitated moving her into a private ward at the very end of her life, about which the whole family were “horribly conflicted”. Spall uses both, he says: “It’s a bit of a lottery, which is the fault of the system. Some places are really organised and some are really struggling. If you’re lucky, you end up in a place like this one.”“It was important,” says Winslet firmly, “to maintain June’s dignity and sense of pride as a woman.” At one point, her children discover June has already drawn up a care plan. “She had made her choices. Sticking to that mattered enormously. It felt very necessary not to deviate from honouring the agency she had in her own decline.”There is some uncertainty among June’s children about when their mother realises she is never going home. Not for Winslet. “I think she knows exactly what’s happening. She knows that it’s coming and in those quiet moments when she’s alone, she is fearful.”If Winslet the director has a proxy in Goodbye June, it’s not the character she plays, but June herself: the woman in the middle, orchestrating everybody while trying not to look too worried. “I wanted to let everyone be free to make mistakes,” she says of being on set, “and never let on if I was feeling the pressure of the time-crunch. Because if you’ve only got 35 days, and Helen Mirren for 16 of those days, and seven children, you have to make your days.”She managed this by being “very, very good at being able to see everyone and assess what they need. I’d be talking to Tim one minute and then just revolving my body and engaging with Helen in a completely different way about the same exact scene. I found that really fascinating, knowing how to flip and adapt, and being open to how different and sometimes odd people can be in the greatest of ways.“I can count on the fingers of one hand – or less, frankly – the tricky experiences I’ve had with actors across 33 years. You have to be totally non-judgmental and embrace whatever that person brings into the room.”We’re not encouraged to ask questions in the face of death. It’s not in the interests of the powers that be that we really think about our purpose on the planetJohnny FlynnSpall backs this up. He first worked with Winslet in 1996 and says he always knew she would be a good director. Still, the atmosphere on Goodbye June was “exceptional, considering when you look at the lineup, you go: ‘OK, fucking hell, this could go either way.’ But instantly there was this warmth and kindness. She’s worked with some of the best directors in the world, had good and bad experiences, and is ultra-intelligent, ultra-open.”Especially with the children – whose scenes are notably unforced and charming. “You get so many directors who are afraid of kids and let the handler deal with their stuff,” says Spall. Winslet, however, would set up shots with a baby on one arm, a toddler at her side, playing with another one, chatting to actors all the while. “She’s a mum, you know; got three kids of her own. Knows what she’s doing.”It is too crass, I ask her, to suggest female directors do things differently? “No,” says Winslet. “Female directors do operate in a different way. I really think so, just because of our sensibility. Typically, female directors are mothers and the amount of mothering that we do in our own lives automatically transfers because you want to look after everyone. It’s just an instinct. This is not to say women are better than men. I would never ever say that. But it is different.”Ispeak to Winslet solo in a Soho hotel room. Shortly after she leaves, Riseborough and Collette come in to pay tribute to her and talk about death. Of all the cast, Collette seems happiest to engage with that tricky thing: the film’s potential place in theassisted dying debate.“I think society in general likes to manipulate and control,” she says, forthright and smiley. “And if you can’t give someone the privilege of letting go of their experience on Earth with any kind of grace and space, then that’s really fucking shit, isn’t it? To be able to do it in the way that they want.”View image in fullscreenToni Collette as Helen in Goodbye June.Photograph: Kimberley French/Netflix“I’m a Scorpio,” she continues. “I have a very active, passionate, spiritual life and I think the problem with humanity is that we feel so disconnected from everything else. Not just people, but from nature. We are nature. I think the soul does live for ever and this is a transient experience. None of us know, and that’s why it’s fucking marvellous.”Riseborough nods. The two women are on the same page; one just reads it out a bit more. “I used to be very, very angry,” says Collette, “about the fact that our very existence is a mystery. It took a lot of time to work through it. Now I just think it’s beautiful.”After a screening of the film the previous night, says Collette, she cried thinking about people spending Christmas alone: “It breaks my heart a little bit.” She trails off, then slaps her knee in mock cheer: “But if they’ve got Netflix, they’ve got us!”“It’s very healing to see people come together over death,” says Riseborough. “It may sound morbid …”“It’s not morbid!” says Collette. “It’s part of life. And it can be a celebration.”Ispeak to Spall in the same room, too, alongside tea andJohnny Flynn. Spall merrily reminds us he almost died, aged 39, of leukaemia, so he’s had “a peek over the precipice” and has a “vested interest” in demystifying the whole business.“Shitting and sex and death: all are taboo and all happen all the time, but we hardly ever talk about them properly,” he says. “When someone dies, there’s a ring on the bell and the milkman wants his money. That’s what happened when my dad died.”Both men happily bat back and forth what seem to be the film’s most overt nods to religion: scenes in a chapel; God’s-eye camerawork; the nurse called Angel; a nativity play just as things get really critical. Dying, they agree, makes such reflection inevitable.View image in fullscreenTimothy Spall, Toni Collette, Kate Winslet, Joe Anders, Andrea Riseborough, Fisayo Akinade and Johnny Flynn.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Guardian“There’s an old saying,” says Spall. “‘There are no atheists in a foxhole.’ If you’re at war and about to die, you’re praying to something.” For his part, he reads and thinks constantly about “eschatological matters”. Names like Meister Eckhart,Rumiand Richard Rohr tumble from him. In 2023, he mounted an exhibition of his canvases of angels in anguish.Flynn listens sympathetically. Spall paints; Flynn writes and records music – songs rooted in English folklore and rural mysticism. “In Christian liturgy there’s this service I love called compline,” he says, “which is basically about getting ready for bed. It’s really short, but it has a sense of like: right, I’ve got from here to there.”Female directors operate differently. The amount of mothering we do transfers automatically and you want to look after everyone. It’s an instinctKate WinsletContemplation is always helpful, however final the event it marks. “And it always boggles me, the absence of meaningful spiritual conversation around Christmas. So it is really nice to have a small sense of that energy and meditation. In society today, we’re not encouraged towards asking questions in the face of death, because it’s not in the interests of the powers that be that we really think about what’s going on in terms of our purpose on the planet.”June hopes to be reincarnated as snow, or to live on through the stories told by others. Flynn’s father died when he was 18; he now sings to his children a lullaby his father wrote. “So, in a way, my dad is still singing my kids to sleep, even though they never met him. And they have this really strong sense of him.”As a palliative care specialist, I’ve witnessed the human tragedy of our end-of-life care crisis | Rachel ClarkeRead moreSpall is moved – and heartened. “Whenever you are in a strain of memory, you are immortal, because you’re still living in other people.” And there’s more, he thinks; something deeper, something spookier: “Just at the moment my daughter was born, a tiny little thing, I saw everybody I knew in my family flash right past her face, like a kaleidoscope.”Goodbye June is a film born from a similar impulse: to keep alive those who have gone before by sharing their memory, and hoping it helps others. To encourage ghosts, not exorcise them.“You learn to live with the changing shape of grief,” says Winslet. “And whether you like it or not, you might see signs of that person in places and actually feel their physical presence. Particularly at times of year when you all would come together, like Christmas. In those moments, I certainly feel my mum is still very much around.”Goodbye June is in cinemas from 12 December and on Netflix from 24 DecemberExplore more on these topicsFilmKate WinsletDeath and dyingAssisted dyingHealthNHSHospitalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But success has stalled as acts face industry obstacles and rising homophobia. What now?Jeffrey IngoldFri 12 Dec 2025 07.00 CETShareAt the turn of the decade, gay male and non-binary pop stars seemed poised totake pop music by storm. Lil Nas X broke out with Old Town Road – which blew up on TikTok, sold about 18.5m copies and remains tied with Shaboozey’s A Bar Song (Tipsy) and Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas Is You as the longest-running No 1 single in US history – and artists such as Sam Smith, Troye Sivan and Olly Alexander from Years & Years were all singing about gay love and sex.But the initial promise has stalled. Lil Nas X’s attempts to build on his smash debut album have fizzled, and he is publicly dealing with mental health issues. In October, Khalid released his first album since being outed by his ex last year but only sold 10,000 copies in the first week in the US. A previous album, 2019’s Free Spirit, sold some 200,000 copies in the first week and led to him briefly dethroning Ariana Grande as the most listened to artist on Spotify.After chart-topping fame with Years & Years, Alexander’s debut solo album, this year’s Polari, could only peak at No 17 in the UK, with no charting singles apart from Dizzy, the UK’s 2024 Eurovision entry, which reached No 42. He tells me that being out in the “major label machine … felt like I was trying to pull off an impossible magic trick”. When it comes to selling gay music to the public, he says, “men explicitly loving men is so threatening to the status quo and patriarchy, which makes it harder to gain mainstream support”. Only Sivan has stayed culturally relevant, if not commercially dominant, thanks in part to savvy collaborations with two of pop’s biggest female stars, Charli xcx and Ariana Grande. How did gay male artists lose their place in the pop landscape?View image in fullscreenOlly Alexander.Photograph: Polydor Records/PAOne surprising reason might be that “there aren’t many male pop stars full stop”, explains Michael Cragg, a music critic and author of the Y2K pop oral historyReach for the Stars. At least, he says, not in the Madonna tradition of bombastic spectacle. “A lot of male artists got swept up in the beige world of Ed Sheeran and Lewis Capaldi,” says Cragg, where today “you can sell millions of albums” with a ballad-heavy repertoire. Cragg cites Calum Scott, best known for his stripped-down cover of Robyn’s Dancing on My Own, as an example of an out gay singer who has succeeded by falling into this “beige world”. Yet Scott’s last tour took him to venues such as the 2,300-capacity London Palladium, while Capaldi is headlining the 65,000-capacity BST Hyde Park next summer.For gay men in pop, says Jason King, dean of the University of Southern California’s Thornton School of Music, “there’s no question there is a glass ceiling. It’s not like we’ve always had hundreds of queer men in pop music hitting the top of the charts, and suddenly now we’re facing a drought”.You might argue: what about the 1980s? From here, the decade looks like a golden age of gay pop, thanks mostly to British men: Freddie Mercury (who was British Parsi), Elton John, George Michael, Pet Shop Boys, Dead or Alive’s Pete Burns. But at the time, few were out: pretty much just Bronski Beat and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although the straight public’s illiteracy about gay culture was proved when BBC Radio 1’s Mike Read yanked Frankie’s 1984 single Relax off air as he realised what it was actually about. To most people in the mid-80s, what are now unmistakable as queer codes – makeup, androgynous styling, elaborate hairstyles – just signalled “flamboyant pop stars”, which also created an indelible blueprint of how a pop star of any persuasion could look and sound.View image in fullscreenFreddie Mercury performing in 1980.Photograph: Fraser Gray/ShutterstockNonetheless, the Aids epidemic brought much of this progress to a screeching halt. Pet Shop Boys’ US career is thought to have stalled because their video for 1988’s Domino Dancing was seen as too gay. Mercury died in 1991. Elton John came out in 1992 when he was well past his pop peak, and George Michael wasn’t outed until 1998. Very rarely have gay pop stars been allowed to be honest about their sexuality in ways that are also commercially successful, as with Bronski Beat’s 1984 single Smalltown Boy or the Scissor Sisters in the early 00s. Lasting success is even more elusive.Hence why Lil Nas X’s breakthrough felt like a watershed moment, picking up the mantle of the gay men in pop who came before him. Here was an out Black gay man breaking chart records, winning awards and shaping pop culture, thanks to wittily provocative music videos such as Industry Baby, where naked men danced in prison showers. It looked as though true change had arrived. But within the industry, “record labels weren’t running to sign hundreds of gay men in pop, hip-hop and R&B”, says King. Or as Vincint, a gay non-binary singer, says: “Once the industry found one, that was enough.”In contrast, queer female pop stars have achieved full-beam mainstreaming, among them Chappell Roan, Billie Eilish and Janelle Monáe. Roan’s now familiar presence in the charts makes it easy to forget how extraordinary her meteoric success has been with sexually explicit songs about being a lesbian. Her mass appeal is not just due to the quality of her music, says Cragg, but also gendered dynamics of social stigma and homophobia: “If you’re a straight guy, you can blast Pink Pony Club because you’ve seen all the memes of tough, burly men loving the song. But if your most-played artist on Spotify is Troye Sivan or Sam Smith, you might worry your friends will think you’re gay or less of a man.”View image in fullscreenVincint at Outloud music festival at WeHo Pride in West Hollywood.Photograph: Amy Sussman/Getty ImagesFor queer women in pop, says King: “There’s a way in which their sexuality can easily be recuperated by the straight male gaze, so men don’t feel excluded by their queerness.” That same “logic” doesn’t apply to male queerness. Even if a male act finds a supportive label, manager, publicist and booking agent, being pigeonholed as a “gay pop star” can still limit his reach – especially if he’s singing about gay sex.“I was working with this well-known songwriter and was so close to this dream of a huge deal,” says Vincint. “Two days before, the writer said: ‘I don’t see a place for you. I don’t know how I can make this work.’” Now an independent artist, Vincint has about 102,000 monthly Spotify listeners: a pretty decent number, but one that pales next to an average major label star with a big marketing budget.Such are the opportunity costs and material consequences that come with being an out male pop star. This pushes some artists into behind-the-scenes roles as writers and producers, such as MNEK, who says: “Major labels aren’t searching for an openly gay pop star. They are searching for something that sells and is palatable for families and middle England.” He now “mostly works with women”, producing the kind of pop hits that gay male acts would struggle to sell.That’s the other obstacle that gay male singers face: appealing to pop’s biggest audience, straight women, who may not as easily relate to queer men as they do queer women. This is partly why Sam Smith (who later came out as non-binary) chose not to use gendered pronouns on their first album, “so that it could be about anything and everybody”, they said.‘They just wanted to silence her’: the dark side of gay stan cultureRead moreGay male artists also can’t rely on their own community to get behind them. While gay men come out in droves to support their favourite diva, they often reserve their harshest criticisms for queer male (and non-binary) singers, particularly anyone who doesn’t conform to punitive aesthetic ideals. Troye Sivan, Sam Smith, Khalid and MNEK have all experienced backlash: the criticism often boils down to the fact that they are either “too Black, too feminine, or too big”, says Vincint. By contrast, apparently straight acts such as Harry Styles and Benson Boone can push the boundaries of masculinity with queer-coded styling yet remain hugely popular.View image in fullscreenBenson Boone at the 2024 MTV Europe Music Awards at the Co-op Live in Manchester.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersAll of which puts gay male singers seeking pop superstardom in a difficult place – a situation likely to worsen as equality for LGBTQ+ people faces increasing threats worldwide.Recent polling foundthat only 54% of US citizens support same-sex marriage (down from 70% in 2021). Pride marches have downsized or disappeared entirely in the US and the UK, and companies such as Disney havecut transgender storylinesand beenaccused ofcensoring gay characters.“The tipping point of gayness, queerness and transness has happened and now we’re on the decline,” says a music publicist who wishes to remain anonymous. “I sit in meetings where execs are so dismissive and disrespectful towards queer artists. The music industry doesn’t want to invest in gay male pop stars because they can’t see them achieving mainstream commercial success.”Gay male musicians clearly haven’t disappeared altogether: many queer men (and those who shun labels) have, says King, “created alternative worlds that allow them to express themselves without having to strive for No 1 hits”. Frank Ocean came out as he released his culture-shifting album Channel Orange, and his refusal to embrace the limelight has made him one of pop’s most enigmatic figures. His Odd Future bandmate Tyler, the Creator used 213 anti-gay slurs on 2011’s Goblin, but later rapped about his relationships with men on 2017’s Flower Boy. The Texan singer-songwriter Conan Gray built his career using TikTok and YouTube, winning over a younger generation who areincreasingly eschewingtraditional labels of gender and sexuality. He now plays arena shows across North America. They may not have No 1 hits, but each of them is reshaping the boundaries of success in pop music for queer men.The great irony, however, is that gay men shaped so much of the history of mainstream pop music, one from which many of them are now excluded. Gay cultures such as drag and ballroom have seldom been so popular – albeit sanitised and co-opted by a mainstream more interested in catchphrases than the lived experiences that created them. This exclusion doesn’t just affect musicians, but also queer fans searching to hear their own lives reflected in music, and straight listeners whose worldviews might be expanded by hearing a counterpoint to the rise of rightwing “family values” fanaticism. The success of Old Town Road quashed perceptions that it was just a TikTok novelty hit. Seven years since its release, it represents a much more dispiriting kind of novelty.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockLGBTQ+ rightsSexualityGenderTransgenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He established a pioneering working community at 5 Dryden Street in Covent Garden in 1972, at a time when London’s famous fruit and vegetable market was in decline, and the wider area was resisting ambitions to terraform it into the West End equivalent of the Barbican. Characterful old buildings were available and ripe for conversion and Rock, in his role as an enterprising architect-developer, spotted an opportunity.At Dryden Street, a collective of more than 30 independent, design-related firms was billeted in a remodelled 19th-century warehouse, with fashionably exposed brick walls and timber roof trusses. Rock recognised that it was often small outfits that exuded the greatest energy, potential and creativity, and that a communal workspace could offer a different kind of socially and economically supportive environment. After Dryden Street came a similar initiative in Chiswick, west London, where a former Sanderson wallpaper factory was converted into theBarley Mow Centre, providing workspaces for craftspeople, designers and architects.In reimagining how people and businesses could work, Rock was a formidable force, channelling the power of collaboration to reinvigorate buildings and neighbourhoods. He also guided and supported others who recognised the value of the workspace concept and wanted to do something similar. He saw architects as more than just designers of buildings and encouraged them to be entrepreneurial and interventionist. This involved capitalising on new patterns of economic activity, and cultivating management, financial and other development-related skills. “It’s all to do with making things happen,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe Angel Square development in Upper Street, Islington, London, designed by the Rock Townsend practice, completed in 1991.Photograph: SC Urban/AlamyIn 1971 he set up his own practice, in partnership with John Townsend, whom he met when they both worked for the multidisciplinary firm Building Design Partnership (BDP) in the 60s.Rock Townsend’s output included housing, factories, offices and educational buildings such as the Bounds Green campus for Middlesex Polytechnic (now Middlesex University). Adding postmodernist pizazz to a speculative office development, Angel Square in Islington was a florid and fruity confection adorned with an Italianate campanile-style clock tower. Completed in 1991, it was recently demolished to make way for a more sober successor, thus initiating Rock intothe Rubble Club, limited to architects who have witnessed the destruction of one of their buildings during their lifetime.Rock was born in Sunderland, and his early life was dominated by the gloom of the depression era and the privations of the second world war. His father, Thomas, was a shipwright, and his mother, Muriel (nee Barton), was a former light opera singer. Educated at the city’s Bede grammar school, in 1947 Rock took up architecture at Newcastle University School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape (then part of Durham University), where his tutors included the town planner Lord Holford and the brutalist architectPeter Smithson.His talent was spotted by the leading modernistBasil Spence, for whom Rock worked for five years, moving from the north of England to London. He was then invited to set up the London office of BDP, becoming a partner in 1964 and, in 1969, a joint founder of the BDP Rome office, as the firm expanded internationally, growing to 500 strong. Over his 12 years with BDP he became interested in the many aspects of running a practice that impacted on the core function of designing buildings.Throughout his career he was also actively involved in how architecture was promoted, regulated and managed through the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). He served on its national council and was its president from 1997 to 1999, spearheading a long-term corporate strategy and overseeing the transfer of more than a million items from RIBA collections to the V&A, securing their preservation and making them publicly accessible.He also championed underrepresented and experimental architecture, nominating the radical 60s collaborative Archigram for the royal gold medal, the highest accolade for a lifetime’s work, which they wereawarded in 2002.Avuncular and bearded, in his later years Rock resembled Father Christmas, with a twinkle in his eye, spreading general good cheer. Following his departure from Rock Townsend in 1992 he launched Camp 5, a consultancy concerned with a range of projects, including advising on building and master planning. At Rock’s urging, the Commission forArchitectureand the Built Environment (CABE) established “town champions”, a group of architects and built environment professionals who pooled their knowledge to help revive rundown communities.He set up and headed the Arts Council’s Lottery Architecture Unit between 1995 and 2000, and was a joint founder of the Construction Industry Council, a representative forum for professional bodies, research organisations and specialist business associations within the UK construction industry. He was also twice president of the Architects Benevolent Society, a charity providing advice, support and financial assistance to architects and their families.Rock’s enduring penchant for drawing and painting saw his work regularly exhibited, both in solo shows and group exhibitions. The chairman of the Society of Architect Artists (now known as the Society of Artists in Architecture), from 1985 to 1995, he regarded hand drawing as critical to his – or indeed any architect’s – explorations of the built environment.Rock was married firstly in 1954 to Daphne Richards, with whom he had three sons and two daughters. The marriage ended in divorce in 1986 and he married Lesley Murray in 1989. She died in 2023.He is survived by four of his children, Felicity, Jacob, Mark and Alice, and eight grandchildren.David Annison Rock, architect, born 27 May 1929; died 15 November 2025Explore more on these topicsArchitectureobituariesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If you’re looking for a delicious dram to enjoy with your mince pie, a versatile bottle to have on standby this party season or the perfect gift, there’s a whisky out there with your name on it. It needn’t cost the earth either: I’ve found sustainable B Corp whiskies and pocket-friendly blends along with higher-end options to suit everyone’s budget.From whisky flights to English single malts, and American bourbon to organic scotch, I’ve tasted a huge range (neat, no ice) to bring you a list of great-tasting bottles to work your way through this Christmas.The best whisky in 2025Best aged single maltView image in fullscreenGlenmorangie 18-year-old, the Infinita, 70cl£119.95 at Master Of Malt£117.88 at AmazonIt’s easy to spend silly money on aged single malts, but this (almost) accessibly priced 18-year-old Glenmorangie is a safe bet for scotch fans. Its honeyed spice notes morph into burnt orange, jasmine and wood smoke for a deeply delicious dram for any whisky connoisseur. This tasted fantastic rounding off a special dinner as a celebratory digestif.Best sustainable whiskyView image in fullscreenNc’nean organic single malt, 70cl£51.75 at the Whisky Exchange£62 at Master of MaltMade from organic barley on the wild west coast of Scotland, Nc’nean is single malt scotch – but not as you know it. Female-founded, B Corp-certified and the first UK whisky distillery to achieve net zero emissions, it tastes good and does good. It’s also a Great Taste award winner. It’s fresh and lively with lemon and opens up to candied citrus sweets with a dash of tropicality. I found it divine in a highball with a sprig of fresh mint.Best unusual whiskyView image in fullscreenRampur double cask single malt whisky, 70cl£59.99 at Master of Malt£59.99 at AmazonIndia may not be the first place you think of for whisky – but think of India you should. Rampur distillery has been distilling for almost a century using Himalayan groundwater to add a uniquely Indian flavour. Extreme weather means the casked whisky matures rapidly, leading to deeper levels of flavour and complexity. Think heady cinnamon spice, salted caramel and all things nice in this must-try bottle.Best aged blended whiskyView image in fullscreenGlenAllachie White Heather 15-year-old, 70cl£56 at Master of Malt£57.50 at the Whisky ExchangeWhite heather is a rare variant of the ubiquitous purple plant with rich symbolism in Scottish folklore; stumbling across a patch is said to bring luck, and brides often include a sprig in their bouquet. Lucky you to be trying this wonderful blend from GlenAllachie’s master distiller, I say. Single malts from across Scotland combine to create a heather-honeyed balance of oranges, mocha and a faint wisp of smoke – I found it dangerously drinkable.Best peated whiskyView image in fullscreenTobermory Ledaig 10-year single malt, 70cl£40.75 at the Whiskey Exchange£33.56 at AmazonHailing from the Inner Hebridean Isle of Mull, this is a more approachable peated whisky than the famed neighbouring Islay styles. More freshness and minerality make for a more measured sip, yet it still retains that unmistakable smoky island character. Soft peat mingles with a medicinal nose that’s happily more peppery and vanilla-based on the palate, though the background of smoke persists. At this price, you can afford to try it even if you think island whiskies aren’t for you; you may just surprise yourself.Best Japanese whiskyView image in fullscreenNikkafrom the Barrel Extra Marriage, 50cl£49.95 at the Whisky ExchangeHarmony is the name of the game when it comes to Japanese whisky, and Japanese whiskies don’t get much more iconic than Nikka from the Barrel. This then, is the limited edition 40th anniversary bottling, taking the original liquid and doubling its time in cask – an Extra Marriage of grain and malt whiskies, if you will. Still in the famous square glass bottle, Nikka Extra Marriage is light and playful with honeyed pineapple and sweetie notes against a background of mineral and smoke flavours; even more balanced, even more harmonious and even more pleasing.Best small-batch whiskyView image in fullscreenHolyrood Distillery Ambir single malt, 70cl£58.25 at the Whisky Exchange£63.95 at Royal Mile WhiskiesFresh from winninggold in the small-batch categoryat the World Whiskies awards, Ambir is the third iteration of single malts from newcomer Holyrood distillery. Using four speciality malts chosen for their dessert-style textures and flavours, Ambir is perfect for enjoying as an after-dinner drink. The tempting tastes of Scottish tablet, buttery fudge and jammy cornflake tart abound, with a subtle leathery savouriness taking it back from the brink of being too simplistic. Enjoy with – or as – pudding.Best experimental whiskyView image in fullscreenCompass Box Nectarosity, 70cl£51.50 at the Whisky Exchange£43 at AmazonMany people fixate on single malt whiskies as the gold standard for quality, but that just isn’t the case. When made skilfully, blends deserve their place at the table and usually represent far more bang for your buck, too. Compass Box was founded by whisky heavyweight John Glaser to champion the skill of blended whisky-making from exceptional scotch, and the curiously delicious creations that come out of its Richmond blending room are testament to this. I’ve picked the Nectarosity here, which is like a breakfast buffet of fruit, honey, cinnamon swirls and Danish pastries wrapped up in an oaky haze, but honestly, you can’t go wrong with any Compass Box whisky.Best bourbonView image in fullscreenWoodford Reserve Kentucky bourbon, 70cl£37.50 at Morrisons£39 at the Whisky ShopThis universally popular smooth bourbon is as good as a gift as it is for drinking yourself. Kentucky’s favourite straight, Woodford Reserve is harmoniously balanced, with warming aromas, dried fruit and a creamy finish. Best enjoyed neat – although it’s also my go-to for a Don Draper-worthy old fashioned.Best Speyside whiskyView image in fullscreenBenromach Contrasts organic Speyside single malt, 70cl£51.75 at the Whisky Exchange£51.75 at Master of MaltThis is the whisky that first made me fall in love with whisky. Impossibly smooth, with unexpected-but-harmonious flavours of banana split, a hit of pepper and tons of malt, Benromach Contrasts organic is typically Speyside in terms of its sweetness and light, but with a cocoa richness, aged maturity and interest that its price suggests. It’s also theworld’s first Soil Association-accredited organic scotch. Drinks like a dream in a hip flask on a cold country walk.Best Islay whisky selectionView image in fullscreenSmokehead whisky skull gift tin, 3 x 5cl£24.95 at Royal Mile Whiskies£22.99 at AmazonFans of Islay scotch will enjoy making their way through this Smokehead selection flight. There are three single malts laden with seaweed, fiery peat and sweetness to be explored: original; High Voltage 58%; and Rum Rebel, which is matured in Caribbean rum casks for a tropical explosion alongside the signature sea spray and smoke.Best whisky gift setView image in fullscreenIsle of Raasay scotch gift set£69.99 at Selfridges£66.65 at AmazonThe rugged Hebridean island of Raasay (population 194) is home to the Raasay distillery, which produces this lightly peated single malt. Matured in rye, oak and bordeaux casks, this is a complex drop with flavours of wild dark fruit, toffee, spice and smoke. Take this smartly boxed set next time you need a dinner party gift for a whisky-drinking host: two beautifulGlencairntasting glasses are included alongside the decanter-style bottle for sharing.Best sherry-led whiskyView image in fullscreenThe Lakes Whiskymaker’s Reserve No 7, 70cl£83.75 at the Whisky Exchange£83.93 for 70cl at AmazonThe Lakes distillery has quickly made a name for itself in new world whisky, and with expressions like this one, I can see why. The Whiskymaker’s Reserve No 7 is a single malt made in the image of whiskies likeDalmore; sherry-led, matured in oloroso and pedro ximénez casks, plus a few red wine casks thrown in for good measure. The result is richly fruited with warming spices and layers of woodiness, complex, clever and evocative of long Lake District walks. While it’s not the most affordable whisky on this list, you won’t regret putting your hand in your pocket for a little treat this tempting.Best whiskey stocking fillerView image in fullscreenWriter’s Tears Irish whiskeybook set, 3 x 5cl£18.95 at Hard to Find Whisky£25.95 at AmazonA gift for your resident whiskey-drinking writer friend, this cute collection of three Irish whiskeys is inspired by Irish poets and playwrights. Writer’s Tears’ Copper Pot is a triumphant revival of a 19th-century style of whiskey popular with the literati of the time. As is characteristic of Irish whiskey, it’s gently sweet and smooth, with apples and honey; the Double Oak offers more in the way of sweetness but with added spice, while the Cask Strength is a more complex expression with persistent woody notes.Joanne Gould is afood, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

Gin forms the basis of many well-known cocktails, including the negroni, French 75, bramble, gimlet and – 2025’s favourite – the martini. Selecting a decent bottle – or two – will give your usual G&T an upgrade and ensure your Christmas drinks party will be one to remember.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But what is gin? Essentially, it’s a distilled alcohol made from a neutral spirit (usually derived from grain), flavoured with juniper berries and bottled at 37.5% ABV minimum. So, distillers have relative freedom to play around with ingredients, infusions and distillation methods – creating a huge range of gin styles but making it tricky to pick out the right bottle for you.As a long-term member of the mother’s ruin fanclub – and having written about drinks for almost a decade – I have collected and tried hundreds of different gins. Ahead of Christmas, I revisited my home-bar favourites as well as trying many new-to-me gins to bring you this selection of delicious and interesting gins for your drinking delectation. Overall, I considered 65 gins, testing each one for aroma, before sipping it straight and drinking it in a gin and tonic with ice and lemon. If the brand suggested a specific serve, I tried that too.From standout gins perfect for a (generous!) gift to award-winning classic brands and gin with a Christmassy twist, I’ve compiled this list of brilliant bottles to see you through the festive season.The best gins in 2025Best all-round ginView image in fullscreenEast London Liquor Cogin, 70cl£28.19 at Master of Malt£27.75 at the Whisky ExchangeThis is a gin I turn to time and time again – a good value classic but with a bit of an edge. It’s a London dry, but with more of all the flavours you expect: more sharp lemony citrus, more piney juniper, more cardamom and angelica root spice. This characterful gin works in any cocktail or G&T where you want to really be able to taste the gin; so less of the gin fizz, more a negroni.The vodka is great too.Best Indian ginView image in fullscreenTerai Indiadrygin, 75cl£37 at Maharaja DrinksIndian gin is an exciting category, and this gin, made in the London-dry style by a fourth-generation Indian distiller, is a solid pick. Made in Rajasthan using botanicals sourced from Delhi’s Khari Baoli – one of the largest spice markets in the world – this is a house-made rice grain spirit, so it has a softer, milder base than usual. The base spirit is infused with 11 botanicals, including tulsi (holy basil), fennel, coriander and – interestingly – almonds. The result is slightly sweet, creamy and still piney, green and aromatic, but tastes distinctly Indian. I’d go for a lush, limey gimlet with this one.Best coastal ginView image in fullscreenBullards Coastalgin, 70cl£45 at JarroldsFrom Norwich comes this clean, citrussy gin filled with the saline seaside flavours of the Norfolk coast. Infused with hand-foraged sea purslane, marsh samphire and Douglas fir, this is a bracing, salty joy to drink in a gin and tonic. Bullards suggests serving with blackberries and a twist of fresh lime, but a sprig of samphire is even better, in my opinion. This gin edged ahead thanks to its innovativeeco-pouch format: buy a bottle for life and top up with more affordable pouches of gin, made from sugarcane, to reduce its carbon footprint – why don’t more brands do this? The brand’sStrawberry & Black Pepper ginis also wonderful with only a touch of sweetness, a sensible 40% ABV and a hefty thwack of warming black pepper.Best pink ginView image in fullscreenThat Boutique-y Gin Company Proper Pinkgin, 50cl£26.95 at Master of Malt£31.89 at AmazonThe definition of pink gin has become a little muddled in recent years. Traditionally, it refers to a navy-strength gin with added Angostura bitters (which gives the pink hue), but it’s evolved to include any pink-coloured gin – whether that’s due to colouring, berry or rhubarb flavours, or spangly mermaids. Not in my book – or That Boutique-y Gin Company’s. Its Proper Pink gin is a throwback to the 18th century: a 46% concoction of gin, lemon and vacuum-distilled Angostura, finished with even more Angostura. This is sophisticated stuff, best enjoyed in a martini with a twist.Best Old Tom ginView image in fullscreenHernö Old Tomgin, 50cl£37.95 at the Whisky Exchange£34.50 at AmazonSweden’s award-winning gin distillery Hernö was named gin producer of the year in 2025 and 2024 at the prestigious International Spirits Challenge. Hernö’sJuniper Cask gin(the first gin to be matured in juniper wood) andSix Rivers gin(with an aroma of verdant Icelandic moss) are both standout – but the brand’s Old Tom gin is a shining example of this category. Old Tom gins are named after the black cat symbol that signalled an 18th-century illegal distillery, and are sweeter than London dry, with sugar traditionally added to offset the harsher base spirit used in bootleg gin. The style proved popular, and Hernö’s naturally sweet botanicals – including vanilla, honey, lingonberries and generous amounts of almondy meadowsweet – give it a fresh update. It’s sweet and smooth enough for sipping, or perfectly at home in a Tom Collins.Best London dry ginView image in fullscreenGordon’s Londondrygin, 1l£31 at Tesco£18.94 at AmazonWhen you want a classic gin and tonic with no surprises or messing around, it’s hard to beat the refreshing taste of Gordon’s and tonic. It’s deservedly the category leader in gin, and the one many top bartenders reach for when mixing a G&T (they also invariably recommendSchweppes tonic– and never slimline). Made since 1769, its juniper-forward recipe is crisp, citrussy and the quintessential example of a London dry gin, winning it a swathe of spirit industry medals and a Great Taste award too.Best Christmas ginView image in fullscreenEdinburgh Gin Christmas, 70cl£34 at Tesco£34.50 at Edinburgh GinThis Christmas twist on a London dry gin gives a pleasing nod to the season rather than all-out festive flavour, and personally, that’s the way I like it. Natural juniper already feels Christmassy, but the addition of warming nutmeg, cinnamon and clove, combined with winter citrus, gives your G&T a subtle seasonal glow-up. I particularly liked it with a clementine garnish instead of the usual lemon. The festively adorned box is jolly, making it good as a gift too.Best low-alcohol ginView image in fullscreenCotswold Dry Gin Essence, 100ml£17.52 at Master of Malt£18.50 at Cotswolds DistilleryI love the standard higher-alcoholCotswold Dry gin– a worthy Great Taste award winner with its natural woodiness, zingy grapefruit, lime and fresh floral flavours of Cotswold lavender – but I love the Cotswold Gin Essence version even more. Housed in a cute 100ml apothecary-style bottle with pipette, just five drops of this concentrated botanical essence in 200ml of tonic makes for a lighter but equally satisfying serve, with just 14 calories, 0.23 units of alcohol and all the natural flavour intact. If you like this approach,Hayman’s Small ginis also delicious – and comes with an adorable thimble for measuring out your gin.Best flavoured ginView image in fullscreenBathtub Gin Grapefruit & Rosemary, 70cl£34.95 at Master of Malt£34.45 at AmazonFlavoured gin has a well-deserved bad reputation. From bizarre juniper-jarring flavours to synthetic ingredients, there are plenty of bad examples to fall foul of. But not Bathtub’s Grapefruit & Rosemary: here, the natural botanical components of Bathtub Gin – which already has a punchy herbaceous citrus profile – are amplified by the extra infusion, so the bold grapefruit is extra zesty and the rosemary greener and more woodsy. This gin is creamy, vibrant and perfect for a G&T, with a sprig of rosemary and a dried grapefruit slice. (Agnes Arber’s Pineapple ginandSipsmith’s Chilli & Lime Ginwere close runners-up in this category.)Best gin for sippingView image in fullscreenStill GIN, 70cl£31.25 at the Whisky Exchange£38.99 at SelfridgesYou’re allowed to be sceptical about Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre making a gin – but brilliantly, it’s decent. Designed to be smooth enough to drink straight up (though surely they’d approve of some juice), this is a very gentle, harmonious gin, with a soft balance of orange citrus fruit, jasmine flower and angelica root, dialling down on the juniper. It’s copper pot-stilled, which distils more slowly and evenly – accounting for the extra smoothness. I genuinely enjoyed sipping it straight with plenty of ice (go for bigger ice cubes to avoid dilution) and a garnish of orange peel.Best unusual ginView image in fullscreenHendrick’sgin, 70cl£26.50 at Waitrose Cellar£26.44 at AmazonIs Hendrick’s unusual? Not so much these days, now craft gins are doing all sorts of things – but it was one of the first to do things a bit differently. The brand still occupies this space, and it does it well. Hendrick’s is made in an unusual way too: two base spirits are created in different stills – one rich, one delicate – before both are infused with classic gin botanicals, along with less classic ingredients such as chamomile, elderflower and cubeb berries (like allspice). The spirits are then blended and steeped in rose and cucumber, which provide the prominent top notes of the finished product. The original serve – with tonic and sliced cucumber – continues to hold up, and is still the most refreshing G&T for summer.Best luxury ginView image in fullscreenAureus Vita Fibonaccidrygin,70cl£150.11 at Master of Malt£169 at Fortnum & MasonChemist turned master distiller John Hall achieved the highest ever score for a gin from the IWSC for hisTrevethan Gin(98/100), but he was keen to better it. Using his background in science, he completely rethought the distillation process. Using the golden ratio of 1:1.618 throughout extraction, distillation and dilution, the spirit is designed to be perfectly balanced and harmonious. Distilled once every autumn, each year’s expression is unique, like vintage wine. Last year’s vintage is clean and cool with a juicy pine quality and zesty freshness. It makes a superlative mini martini – keep it on the small side, though, as the 61.8% ABV is punchy.Best sustainable ginView image in fullscreenRenais Harvest Edition, 70cl£65 at RenaisActor Emma Watson’s family have been winemaking in Burgundy for more than 30 years, and Renais is the creation of Emma and her brother. Pressed grape skins salvaged from winemaking create the base spirit that’s infused with botanicals from the estate, including its own acacia honey. On the menu at the Savoy, the Rosewood and Soho House, Renais tastes silky smooth, refreshing and has an easily discernible wine-like tang, setting it apart from juniper-heavy gins. The Harvest Edition sees a limited run of 600 beautiful bottles that feature London-based artist Frankie Penwill’s whimsical label and sleeve, plus a bespoke A4 print, making it a lovely gift for yourself or an arty gin-drinking pal.For more, read thebest whiskyand thebest Christmas drinksJoanne Gould is a food, drink and lifestyle writer with a decade of experience.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I spend most of the year wearing navy trousers and oversized shirts, but there’s something about a party dress that speaks to my inner J-Lo. Give me applique flowers, cowl necks, asymmetric hemlines and lace edging, perhaps with an oversized blazer or knee-high boots. The options are endless and, in my opinion, during the silly season, the usual rules don’t apply. Here are the best party dress picks for December and beyond.The best party dresses for 2025Velvet midi dress£41.50 at AsosThis green velvet off-the-shoulder dress from Asos looks super-luxe and is the very spirit of Christmas. It goes up to a UK30, too.Dress with bow neckline£79.99 at Mango£79.99 at John LewisThe mini dress is having a resurgence, and this one from Mango is sweet without being too saccharine. Style it with a pair of black mules and a faux-fur jacket for a fun, cool-girl party look.Sicily midi dress£112 at Monsoon£160 at M&SA fit-and-flare style is a failsafe: it will pretty much suit all figures. So go bold with leopard print, like this version from Monsoon, then add a red lip and a sparkly shoe.Asymmetric dress£119 at the White CompanyI love this White Company dress. It’s simple and chic but with a touch of directional difference. I’d dress it up with gold jewellery and some embellished court shoes. Style it with a black blazer and it will see you from the theatre, to dinner, to a party. Ideal.Crystal-necklace mini dress£240 at Reiss£240 at NextWhat screams “festive fun” more than a green satin mini dress, complete with a velvet trim and a crystal bow halter necktie? Wear with silver flat pumps for dancing.For more, read our guide to thebest party flatsLaverna dress£328 at ReformationSometimes I struggle to find a dress that ticks any of the party-style boxes, and sometimes a dress strides in and effortlessly ticks them all. The Laverna dress from Reformation has 3/4-length sleeves and the perfect square neckline, showing just the right amount of collarbone, and it’s a fitted, midi length without being too milkmaidy. You will wear it all season.Embellished A-line dress£54.99 at H&MWinter whites always make an impact at a party, and you’ll stand out among the black and jewel tones. I’d wear this H&M shift with chunky silver jewellery and a pair of platform heels.Green velvet midi dress£89 at Asos£95 at Nobody’s ChildNod to the 90s and opt for a fitted cowl-neck dress. Add gold chunky jewellery and gold sandals.Silk-blend velvet dress£350 at Me+EmThis burgundy lace and velvet shift from Me+Em might be an investment, but the style is timeless and you’ll be able to wear it for years to come. Wear your hair up to show off the beautiful high neckline.Black velvet lace insert dress£89 at Never Fully Dressed£129 at AsosIf you haven’t heard about Never Fully Dressed, I’d suggest having a look at its website now. Specialising in fun, colourful, flirty and embellished styles, it’s my first stop for party wear. I’m a huge fan of this black lace dress, which is just the right amount of naked for me. The prices won’t break the bank either.Jacquard lace mini dress£99 at M&SThere’s something quite chintzy 60s about this dress, which I love. Wear it as it is, or style it with a sheer polo neck underneath for a throwback look.Selene dress£159 at AYM StudioMade in small batches in London, AYM Studio’s gorgeous, weighty jersey dresses really flatter all shapes. Chocolate brown is such a sophisticated colour choice for a party look – warmer than black, but still very chic.Gold metallic shift dress£139 at Boden£139 at John LewisHead to Boden for the most timeless festive looks this season. This dress is my absolute favourite: find me by the drinks trolley in this gold brocade shift, which comes with a black velvet belt.Red corsage mini dress£56 at River IslandSometimes you want your party dress to really step up and exude fun, glamour, power and affordability all in one go – and that’s exactly what this dress from River Island does.Satin midi dress£295 at RixoMidnight blue can be overlooked as a party wear colour, but it looks great with gold accessories and dark burgundy nails. This satin dress from Rixo will work as an evening look all year round.Diamante trim midi dress£220 at Mint Velvet£220 at John LewisWith perfectly placed keyhole cutouts so that you can still wear a bra underneath, this Mint Velvet dress will be your most hard-working look during party season. Keep it simple with black sandals and a black clutch bag.Satin party dress£109.99 at AligneA drop waist dress isn’t for everyone, but it does speak to a certain kind of laidback glamour that’s very much up my street. This silver dress from Aligne looks great with black knee-high boots.Claudia maxidress£330 at Queens of ArchiveQueens of Archive is really establishing itself as the place to go for dresses with drama, and this floral-print 1970s-inspired style is no exception.

A romantic style like this calls for harder accessories, so wear with chunky silver hoop earrings and black boots or mules.Velvet halter dress£45.99 at ZaraI always think an ochre velvet style is the ideal alternative to a glitzy gold dress: it’s warmer, suits all skin tones and looks opulent with a deep red lip.Velvet bell-sleeve mini dress£76 at AnthropologieWhen all else fails, a tunic-style dress is a forever winner. Not so form-fitting that you feel restricted, but fun enough for any party. I love the scallop trim and embroidery on this version from Anthropologie.Printed slip£88 at Free PeopleI really like the ultra-feminine detailing on this dress from Free People. To make it look modern, I’d offset it with an oversized tuxedo blazer and black ribbon tie heels.Printed dress with knot detail£129 at Massimo DuttiMassimo Dutti always offers luxe-style dresses with beautifully draped fabric, which aren’t always easy to find on the high street. I love this subtle print.Asymmetric midi slip dress£48 at Topshop£48 at AsosOpt for a twist on the LBD and try an asymmetric hemline – wear it with heels or with knee-high boots.For more, read Jess Cartner-Morley on therules of Christmas dressingandsequin-free party looksMelanie Wilkinson is the Guardian’s styling editorExplore more on these topicsDressesThe FilterWomen's dressesChristmasbest ofShareReuse this content"

He lunged for the door handle, screamingGareth RubinFri 12 Dec 2025 06.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 16.12 CETShareIwrite thrillers: mostly ­historical mysteries. In September 2024, I was returning from a ­literary festival in Italy, where I had been talking about my ­latest book. It was a Ryanair flight, and as we came in to land at London Stansted, I heard people behind me shouting. I looked back to see some of them were standing up. A moment later a big man – I would guess he was 6ft 4in, and powerfully built – burst through them. He headed towards an emergency exit and lunged for the door handle, screaming. Behind him, a smaller guy was clambering over the tops of the seats, shouting: “It’s not terrorism. It’s not terrorism. Mental health!”While exit doors can’t be opened when a plane is at full altitude because the air pressure inside is too great, levels dip during descent, and it is possible to open them. I feared that if he opened the exit, the plane would be hard to control and we might hit the ground about 300mph faster than we were meant to.The guy was struggling hard. I resorted to pinning him down with my shinA woman in the exit aisle was struggling with him, but she couldn’t stop him. I sprinted down and barged my shoulder into his chest, knocking him over. As he collapsed, the smaller man got hold of his shoulder and we dragged him to the floor. The smaller guy – who turned out to be a friend of his – was still yelling “It’s not terrorism” but everyone around us was screaming.With a third man, we managed to hold the big guy down. His eyes were roving all around and he was breathing as if he was sprinting. He was clearly having a panic attack. I wasn’t worried about his intentions: I thought that if he had wanted to kill us all, he would have gone about it a lot more methodically. But I did check over my shoulder towards the flight deck, just in case it was a diversion tactic so someone could try to get into the cockpit. The aisle was clear, though.Experience: I found a stranger under my hotel bedRead moreThe guy was struggling hard, and it’s difficult to hold a strong man down. I resorted to pinning him down with my shin on his testicles. He quietened down after that, and after a minute he politely asked me to move my leg. I did, just enough – I didn’t want him springing back up.All the time, his friend was threatening to kick his head in if he didn’t calm down. With hindsight, that probably didn’t help. As this was going on, we could feel the plane descending. A flight attendant was in tears, talking on an internal phone to the captain. She was completely freaked out and trying to explain what was happening. When she managed to get the words out, the plane suddenly pulled back up hard; it felt almost vertical. The captain had said it wasn’t safe to land with so many people out of their seats and the plane would have to circle and try again. By this point the other passengers were quiet: they were strapped into their seats, watching us.Ten minutes later – it felt like 30 seconds to us – we made another attempt to land, and the people in the seats around us held on to our shirts to brace us. It wasn’t really necessary, because we weren’t actually crashing – but people want to get involved. The wheels touched the tarmac and we were down safely. The big guy was breathing more normally by then. We held him until the police came.People ask me what I felt. Honestly? I didn’t mind it one bit. I’ve taken many flights and they’re usually quite boring. This really livened things up. Mostly, though, I felt sorry for a man having a mental health episode, even if he could have killed us all.It was weirdly normal afterwards, getting my bag out of the overhead locker, waiting in the queue of people to amble along the aisle. When we got to the terminal, the ground crew told us that the man had been arrested and would be put on a no-fly list for life. I went home. Afterwards, I thought Ryanair might have said thank you to us, considering that we might have saved the lives of 130 of their passengers and an £85m aeroplane. I’m still waiting for that.Do you have an experience to share? Emailexperience@theguardian.comMurder at Christmas: You Solve the Crime by GB Rubin is available now (Simon & Schuster, £16.99).

Philip Khoury’s recipe for pistachio yule logThis rich and moreish (and plant-based) yule log is a Lebanese Christmas favourite that harks back to the country’s French colonial pastPhilip KhouryFri 12 Dec 2025 14.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 14.01 CETShareIlove a yule log, also known as abûche de Noël. It’s a remnant from the time when Lebanon was a French colony, which lingers to the modern day, and is popular in Lebanese bakeries and patisseries over the Christmas period, often decorated with small figurines, plastic holly leaves and festive messages. Those decorations, and the trompe-l’oeil nature of this treat, enchanted me as a child, and I wanted to bring back some of that enchantment with this take on a woodland yule log.Pistachio yule logPrep10 minCook3 hr 15 minChill7 hrServes8–10For the chocolate chantilly mousse190ml plant-based milk,100ml of it well chilled120g dark chocolate(at least 65% cocoa solids), choppedFor the chocolate ganache200ml plant-based milk,100ml of it well chilled50g muscovado sugar, or dark brown sugar150gdark chocolate(at least 65% cocoa solids), choppedFor the pistachio praline200g shelled pistachios100g icingsugar¼ tsp fine sea saltFor the aquafaba meringue mushrooms75ml aquafaba¼ tsp cream of tartar150g castersugarUnsweetened cocoapowder, for dustingMelted dark chocolate, for dippingFor the pistachio sponge60g shelled pistachiosVegetable oil, for greasing105g plainflour100g castersugar¾ tsp baking powder¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda¼ tsp fine sea salt135ml soya milk¾ tsp vanilla extract1½ tsp apple cider vinegarTo decorate350g amarena cherries, or tinned cherries in syrup1 sprig dillIcingsugar, for dustingFor the mousse, heat 90ml milk in a saucepan on a medium heat until it reaches a gentle simmer. Meanwhile, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl, pour in the hot milk and blend with a handheld blender until completely smooth.Add the 100ml chilled milk and blend again until the mousse is glossy and smooth, with no visible streaks. If streaks appear, blend further, scraping down the sides to ensure a proper emulsion. Pour it into a shallow dish, place a sheet of clingfilm on the surface to prevent a skin forming, then refrigerate for at least two hours.Once chilled, transfer to the chilled bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk. Whip until light and fluffy with stable peaks (chilling the bowl before whipping helps speed up the process), then refrigerate until needed.For the ganache, combine 100ml milk and the sugar in a saucepan on a medium heat and heat until just simmering. Meanwhile, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Pour the hot milk over the chocolate and blend with a handheld blender until completely smooth.Add the chilled milk and blend again until completely emulsified. Pour it into a shallow dish, lay a sheet of clingfilm on the surface to prevent a skin forming, then refrigerate for at least four hours.Next, make the pistachio praline. Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)375F/gas 5. Spread the pistachios on a baking tray, lightly roast for eight minutes, then remove and leave to cool completely.Pulse the roasted pistachios, icing sugar and salt in a food processor or high-powered blender – they’ll turn into a fine powder and then a thick paste as the oils from the nuts are released. Stop blending and scrape down the sides whenever the paste starts catching. Continue blending until completely smooth, then set aside until needed. Any leftover praline can be stored in a sealed jar at room temperature for up to two weeks.For the aquafaba meringue mushrooms, heat the oven to 100C/210F/gas very low and line a baking tray with baking paper. For the meringues, it is best to use the static oven setting rather than fan. Pour the aquafaba into a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat to soft peaks. Add the cream of tartar and whisk again, then continue whisking while gradually adding the sugar. Beat until the meringue forms stiff, glossy peaks.Transfer the meringue mixture to a piping bag, then pipe small domes for the mushroom caps and thin cylinders for the stems on to the lined tray. Dust the caps lightly with cocoa powder. Bake for an hour, then turn off the oven and leave the meringues to cool inside with the door slightly ajar.Once cooled, attach the stems to the caps by dipping the top of the stem in a little melted dark chocolate and attaching it to the top. Leave to set.For the pistachio sponge, heat the oven to 170C (150C fan)/340F/gas 3½. Spread the pistachios on a baking tray, lightly roast for 15 minutes, then remove and leave to cool completely.Turn up the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9. Spray a large baking sheet with oil, then line with baking paper. Blend the pistachios, flour, sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt in a food processor until finely ground, then transfer to a large bowl.Warm the soya milk in a saucepan until it reaches 40C (104F) on a thermometer. Whisk together the warm soya milk, vanilla extract and vinegar in a bowl. Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. Spread the batter evenly over the lined baking sheet and bake for six minutes – the sponge should spring back when lightly touched. Remove from the oven and immediately place a sheet of baking paper on top, weighing it down with a dish towel to keep it flexible for rolling.To assemble, flip the sponge over and gently peel away the baking paper. Put on a clean sheet of baking paper. Spread 150g of the pistachio praline evenly over the sponge, leaving a 1cm border all around the edge. Spread a thin layer of chocolate chantilly mousse over the praline, then arrange the drained cherries in two rows along the long edge.Using the paper to help you, roll the sponge into a tight log, keeping tension as you go. Secure with more paper and chill in the refrigerator for an hour.Once chilled, trim one end diagonally, cut off a third of the log at a 45-degree angle, then reattach both pieces to look like branches. Spread the chocolate ganache in streaks over the log to mimic bark. Dust with icing sugar, then decorate with glacé cherries, dill fronds and meringue mushrooms. Refrigerate for up to two days. Leave to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving.This is an edited extract from Beyond Baking, by Philip Khoury, published by Quadrille at £30.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It is sometimes, amusingly, known as “bacon neck”, and it is the bane of my life: the loss of elasticity that results in a crinkly, ill-fitting collar. This undulating menace commonly befalls the classic crew-neck T-shirt or sweatshirt, but scoop, polo and V-necks can also be afflicted. Too often, science conspires to transform a smooth neckline into something resembling a failed polygraph test.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The term “bacon neck” (not to be confused with “turkey neck”, the disparaging phrase for sagging skin that is almost uniformly levelled at women) was coined, or at least popularised, ina 2010 Hanes commercialfeaturing the basketball star Michael Jordan. In the clip, Jordan’s seat-mate points out a fellow plane passenger’s worn-out collar: “See how it’s all curled up like bacon in a pan? See how bad this guy looks?”View image in fullscreenThe very early stages of bacon neck, as modelled by Marlon Brando.Photograph: Hollywood Photo Archive/Mediapunch/ShutterstockBut this sartorially debilitating condition has been around for much longer. Marlon Brando wasnot immune.Diana, Princess of Wales couldn’t fight it. And neither could T-shirt king James Dean (although that is possibly becausehe kept doing thisin photoshoots). And can we be absolutely certain thatMary Poppins’s Gibson girl blousewasn’t, in fact, just an H&M number gone to seed?Like Meryl Streep at the Oscars, bacon neck is a perennial threat. Put simply, a collar becomes warped when the fabric’s elastic fibres break down. Heat, moisture and chucking them in the washing machine are all to blame.“The knitted structures of the neckline are not perfectly elastic,” says textile expert Ningtao Mao at the University of Leeds. “Unrecoverable stretch deformations occur with each repeated stretch – and the accumulated elongation of the neckline makes it much longer than the edge of the T-shirt body, creating a wavy effect.”View image in fullscreenNever tug at your shirt like a character in The Simpsons.Photograph: YouTubeThis kind of mechanical stress includes the act of pulling a shirt over one’s head, which is unavoidable. But there are ameliorating techniques. For instance, Mao says not to pull a T-shirt off by the neck. Instead, when disrobing, cross your forearms and lift from the bottom hem, like Jeremy Allen White inthat Calvin Klein advert. Here isHarry Styles pulling off a T-shirt the wrong way, practically asking for a giant portion of bacon neck.And here is Harry Styles after he read this article. Oh, and never pull at the collar of your shirt likean anxious cartoon character.Mao also cautions against an “aggressive washing process”, in which garments are tossed and twisted on high-spin cycles. Machines that use an impeller – a low-profile cone or disc that rotates – are gentler than traditional agitator models, while putting clothing in mesh laundry bags can also reduce friction. And try not to overload the drum.Temperature is also a key factor. Mao suggest washing T-shirts below 40C or, even better: hand wash in cold water. If ironing, do it on a low heat but leave a T-shirt to air-dry on a flat surface. “Don’t hang wet collars by the neckline,” he says. And don’t wring them out, either.As for storage, folding is the best bet, and hanging isn’t ideal but is sometimes preferable. As stylist and consultant Rachael Bundu, who works in luxury fashion, astutely points out: “Folding is better, but it also means you have to iron or steam [T-shirts] and I don’t have time for that; I hang mine.”If you opt for Bundu’s method, use sturdy wooden or padded hangers, rather than wire. Most importantly, she says: “Put the hanger through the bottom of the tee,neverthe neck.”View image in fullscreenDetail from the artwork Bella in Her Pluto T-shirt, by Lucian Freud.Photograph: The Lucian Freud Archive/Bridgeman Images; National Portrait Gallery/PAMaterial also makes a difference in the durability of your shirts. Often, people assume that 100% cotton, with a high GSM count (grams per square metre) is the definition of a luxury tee. But while thicker, high-GSM count cotton is best for the shirt body, a bit of elastane (AKA spandex) will give collars a bit of snap.“Collars frequently are made of elastic yarns, which usually contain 2-5% of elastane filaments. This delays and reduces the occurrence of bacon neck significantly,” says Mao. So although expensive shirts and sweaters made from premium natural fabrics might seem less susceptible to ruching, a little synthetic fibre can help with shape retention and recovery.As for brands, I recommend Uniqlo for shirtsheavyweight box tees. And a limited but chic sample (my girlfriend’s closet) revealsVarley’s Leighton Tee– a modal, cotton and elastane blend – to be the stiffest among its competition. A vote forCos’ oversized rangecomes from Bundu, the stylist. Sunspel, Arket and Carhartt also have necklines that are less likely to pucker like Donald Trump’s mouth.View image in fullscreenHang or fold … T-shirts that end up in the wardrobe will need a steam.Photograph: Aaron Amat/AlamyAnd while prevention is better than cure, how does one deal with a bacon-necked vintage number not ready to be demoted to nightwear? Well, there are plenty of subreddits, Tik-Tok videos and YouTube tutorials purporting to help. Onepopular methodseems to consist of dipping the shirt neck into boiling water, which I would not recommend because: a) physics and chemistry (see above); b) my fear of being sued. The fibres – andonlyif they are natural ones – might shrink in shock, which could further damage the fabric.Instead, Mao recommends steaming the neckline on a low heat. Others recommend folding the already oscillated neckline into pleats, thensoaking it in ice waterand manipulating the shape by hand while it is still damp. The dextrous among us might open the back seam of the collar andthread through a fresh piece of elastic. Or, to go full DIY, you couldremove the collar completelyby cutting the stitches, trimming the excess material, and resewing.As a last resort, there is always the carefully positioned scarf, or a roll-neck tank top.

My son arrived and we walked to the top of the ski run and then ascended a giant spiral wooden viewing platform (the Slotwiny lookout tower) that gave magnificent views over fresh green pastures and woodland stretching far into the distance. In these Beskid mountains live Lemkos – a Carpathian upland people persecuted before the last war and dispersed afterwards. We found rustic wooden benches covered in animal skins, enthusiastic folk music and robust cuisine at the excellentKarczma Łemkowskarestaurant. A whole museum is devoted to prolific Lemko “naive” artistNikifor, and the verdant central spa centre has several mineral and medicinal waters on tap – try Zuber or Słotwinka.

I’d never heard of it. The town has three wonderful white sand beaches, and its vibrant centre was thronged every night with generations of locals eating and socialising. The world famous (and rammed) Costa Smeralda is an hour’s drive north, but San Teodoro offered a more authentic experience at a quarter of the price. Our hotel, the genteelHotel L’Esagono, led directly to the beach and had a chic but friendly atmosphere.Ciaran KearneyA classic mountain railway in FranceView image in fullscreenThe viaducts of Morez in the Jura mountains.Photograph: Arnaud Martinez/AlamyThe Swallows’ Line (La Ligne des Hirondelles) is a little-known rural railway of the SNCF (French railways) tucked away in the Jura mountains, close to the Swiss border. It makes for a great day trip from Besançon, butmay soon become a thing of the past, as the line fromDole(where the old town is worth a wander) toSaint-Claude(famous for hiking routes, diamonds and artisan pipe-making) is threatened with closure. The viaducts around Morez are photographic gems. Go before it’s too late.MartinA Baltic battleground in FinlandView image in fullscreenThe Finnish coast near Mariehamn.Photograph: Robert Harding/AlamyThe Åland islands, in the Baltic, are part of Finland but culturally Swedish. The capital, Mariehamn, has a goodmaritime museumand some nice restaurants and it’s quite easy to get there thanks to ferries from Sweden, mainland Finland and Estonia. I found the countryside really attractive, with rocky inlets, woods and farms. At Bomarsund the ruling Russians set out rather half-heartedly to build a huge naval base in the first half of the 19th century. It was destroyed by the British and the French at the start of the Crimean war in 1854 during a naval action in which the first Victoria Cross was awarded – to a 20-year-old Irishman called Charles Davis Lucas. It’s free to explore the fort ruins but there’s a charge to enter the visitor centre.Martin LunnonThe only way is EssexView image in fullscreenSt Peter-on-the-Wall dates from the 7th century.Photograph: Wirestock/AlamyIn July, we walked for five hours along an English coastline without seeing a soul or passing any habitation. Where were we? Essex. The Dengie peninsula is a secret world with expansive views, seals bobbing off shore, and clouds of butterflies serenaded by piping oystercatchers. TheKing Charles III England Coast Pathmeanders along the salt marsh flanking the Crouch estuary, where the skeletons of stricken vessels lie submerged.

Romania’s second-highest paved mountain road (after the Transalpina) is inaccessible in winter and only opened five days before our journey in early June. Constant turns are required to conquer the steep southern section of the Carpathian mountains, but these provide excellent views, and we were able to reach the still snowy Bâlea Lake by car instead of cable car. Our journey may have been less exhilarating than Jeremy’s in his Aston Martin, but at least we took in the sights along the way including, to my great delight, five brown bears at the roadside.Helen JacksonMansions and cats on an island near IstanbulView image in fullscreenCats at a historic wooden house in Büyükada.Photograph: Ayhan Altun/Getty ImagesAs the sun lowered in the soft July sky, two friends and I took a cheap ferry from Istanbul to the island of Büyükada. Cutting across the Sea of Marmara, urban combustion was replaced by an oceanic calm. Upon arrival, we walked in awe along mansion-lined, car-free streets, regularly stalling our meanderings to stroke one of the island’s many cats, and to gaze across the sea, back through the haze towards the distant city of 16 million people. On the ferry back at night, in high spirits, we plotted future expeditions to return to this most incredible of islands.Will BrownWinning tip: medieval manuscripts in FranceView image in fullscreenThe Dominican library has medieval maps and manuscripts.Photograph: Colmar TourismeOur Interrail trip took us to the French Alsatian town of Colmar – a history-packed, medieval, half-timbered melange of French and German culture, food and wine. Hidden in the town, behind the 14th-centuryDominican churchis theDominican library. It’s free to visit and breathtaking. There are thousands of magnificent books, of which the 1,200 illuminated manuscripts are the highlight. Glorious 16th-century maps and translations of letters from Christopher Columbus are set alongside 13th-century books of psalms, Bibles and musical scores. Some documents date to the 8th century. Many are sumptuously decorated by hand in gold and brilliant ultramarine. It’s wonderful.Wendy HoldenView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsTravelReaders' travel tipsTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A potter in the garden is the ideal antidoteEscape from the Christmas mayhem to spruce up pots and outdoor furniture, sow sweet peas, or even paint a fenceAlice VincentFri 12 Dec 2025 12.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 12.05 CETShareIsuspect you’re not thinking about the garden much this month. After all, we’re 12 days away from Christmas. Perhaps you’re wrapping presents or running school fairs, or maybe you’ve stumbled upon this while having a little scroll in the queue for a grotto somewhere. It’s difficult to even be outside and at a loose end during daylight hours at the moment.In case you’re feeling a little overwhelmed, what if you went out into your green space or garden, and started having a bit of a potter? Nothing fancy; goodness knows, I don’t put my garden “to bed” as tradition would dictate – chopping down perennial growth and sweeping up leaves and laying a thick black blanket of mulch over neatly edged beds. But rather a gentle ramble, picking up the plastic flowerpots that have blown about the place and finally emptying that sad pot of desiccated summer annuals into the compost bin. You’ll probably feel a bit less chaotic, possibly even a little festive, afterwards.I always feel as if this time of year is like a tidal wave that I can see looming on the horizon until it teeters over everything. Present-buying; matching pyjamas; the general pressure to “scape” my mantel or banister or table or cistern; that stupid elf on its stupid shelf. We force ourselves to do more when, really, the depth of winter is a time when we should be hibernating.Twixmas is a great time to give the garden furniture a wipe, clean your tools, or sort out the shed before springI love the quietude and reflection that can arrive in December if you create the space to look for it. Inside the house, I like to undertake the equivalent of a winter clean – donating things I no longer need. And when growth is slowing into dormancy outside it’s a good time to tackle jobs in the garden, too. It could be as simple as a bit of a spruce; I’m thinking of the errant plastic square flap from the bottom of my compost bin that has been lying on the lawn for weeks and the wheelbarrow full of leaf-strewn rainwater. Or you could step it up and fix that fence panel. You’ll be grateful you did when the winds arrive in the new year.I am a firm believer that Twixmas is a great timeto paint a fence, but why stop there? Give the garden furniture you use in summer a wipe down and a freshen up too; you won’t get around to it when everything is growing in May. Dust down the cold frame if it’s lingering unloved; you could sow sweet peas in there on Boxing Day.Prune the roses if you’re feeling keen, or simply give your tools a good clean. Sort out the shed before it becomes filled up in spring. Turn the compost heaps. Remind yourself that life continues out here without all the glitter, and then head inside, pink-cheeked, for a well-deserved cup of tea.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We were planning to do some ice-skating,’ said Leila Cader (left).Photograph: Chris Warde-JonesThe billboard says thebullometrorates “the hateful comments” leftwing opponents have directed at Meloni’s government, with the contenders receiving one for “originality” and 10 for “spite”.Critics includeMaurizio Landini, a trade union boss and thorn in the government’s side who caused controversy recently after referring to Meloni as “Trump’s courtesan”, and thePlacebo frontman Brian Molko, who was charged with defaming the prime minister after appearing to call her a “piece of shit, fascist, racist” in Italian while performing at a festival in Turin in 2023.How the EU’s far right has seized on Charlie Kirk’s killingRead moreBut the image that caught Cader’s eye was an upside-down picture of Charlie Kirk, the US far-right activist and ally of Donald Trump who was assassinated in September, whichdrew Meloni’s wrathwhen it was posted online by an Italian student movement in the wake of his killing. The image, captioned “one less, today is less dark”, echoes the death of the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, who was killed by partisans before being hung by his feet from scaffolding at a Milan gas station.By contrast, Kirk was celebrated by Brothers ofItalyon “the pantheon”, a billboard on the opposite side of the gardens representing historical figures whom the party considers strong and powerful.“What is going on here?” asked Cader. “We had no idea it was political. We were planning to do some ice-skating but don’t want to give our money to this event.”View image in fullscreenCharlie Kirk was celebrated in a panel of images representing a ‘hegemony of courage and duty’, among other topics.Photograph: Chris Warde-JonesAtreju, named after the heroic character in the fantasy novel The NeverEnding Story, began in 1998 as a platform for debate among the youth wing of the National Alliance, the neo-fascist party that later morphed into Brothers of Italy. The festival has since evolved, especially in the three years since Meloni came to power, to embrace an unusual mix of politicians of all stripes, Catholic priests, nuns, magistrates and celebrities.In the past it has hosted Steve Bannon, Elon Muskand Rishi Sunak, while this year’s lineup includes European far-right politicians such as France’sMarion Maréchaland Romania’sGeorge Simion.At the opposite end of the political spectrum are the former Italian prime ministers Matteo Renzi and Giuseppe Conte, and Roberto Fico, the recently elected president of the Campania region. “Even if we have political differences, it’s important to debate,” Fico told the Guardian while perusing the Christmas stalls.But more than a talking shop, Atreju – which this year goes by the slogan “you became strong … Italy with its head held high” – is an opportunity for Meloni to flaunt her power.A video reel close to the entrance aimed at boasting Meloni’s credentials on the international stage shows her shaking hands with Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Ursula von der Leyen, and meeting Trump at the White House.View image in fullscreenPino and his wife, from Rome, credited Meloni with boosting their pensions and ‘getting things done’.Photograph: Chris Warde-Jones“Meloni is strong, determined and elegant,” said Pina, who was at the festival with her husband, Pino, who in turn chipped in: “She’s out of this league.” The couple, who did not want to give their surname, are from Rome and said they voted for the left “many years ago”. But, they said, it was something they now regretted. They credited Meloni for boosting their pensions and generally “getting things done”, citing a scheme to repatriate migrantsvia centres in Albania, even though it has so far failed.Gettingtough on crimewas also a key Meloni pledge. Enrica Ciardo, a chef, was invited to the event and was managing a stall selling traditional Italian produce. She said she was apolitical, but appreciated the support Italy’s leadership showed when her restaurant in Puglia was the target of bomb threats by the mafia, adding that Meloni’s sister Arianna – a central figure within the management of Brothers of Italy – had visited her. “We’re here to represent legality and make people realise that you need to report criminal incidents and be on the side of the state and not the mafia,” said Ciardo.View image in fullscreenEnrica Ciardo said she was apolitical but was at the event ‘to represent legality’.Photograph: Chris Warde-JonesAtreju, which ends with a speech by Meloni on Sunday, is taking place during the same week Italy’s civic health rating was downgraded to “obstructed” by Civicus, a non-profit that monitors civic freedoms in 198 countries. The downgrade was provoked by factors including the government’s security bill, which ramped up penalties for non-violent protest and expanded police powers, and the allegedstate-sanctioned spying of critics. France and Germany were also downgraded amid a global trend in the erosion of civil rights.View image in fullscreenAnna Maria Bernini, the university and research minister, was heckled by students protesting against a reform during her speech.Photograph: Chris Warde-JonesWith the Christmas hit It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year playing on the Brothers of Italy radio, a discussion about education in a small marquee tent became heated when Anna Maria Bernini, the minister for university and research, was heckled by a group of students protesting against a reform. She invited them to debate “for a few minutes” before berating them as “poor communists”. Security then removed the students and called the police.View image in fullscreenThe student hecklers – ‘poor communists’, said Bernini – were removed by security.Photograph: Chris Warde-JonesStaff from the Brothers of Italy press office have also kept a close watch over journalists visiting Atreju.Sofia Ventura, a politics professor at the University of Bologna, said the festival was “there to remind us that Meloni always returns to her roots”, while Francesco Galietti, the founder of Policy Sonar, a political consultancy in Rome, described it as “Meloni’s own Woodstock”, adding that it provided a useful platform to show herself as “the great convener”.“Her party has long been accused of being into faction wars, and that’s still the case, of course,” Galietti added. “But she wants to show that despite all differences, some sort of dialogue can take place, at least once a year.”Close to a huge Christmas tree decorated in the colours of the Italian flag was a cut-out of Meloni mocking her “communist” opponents.Explore more on these topicsBrothers of ItalyGiorgia MeloniThe far rightItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The leader of a Threshold Choir reveals what they do – and the personal tragedies that convinced her we need to get better at dealing with deathFiona SturgesFri 12 Dec 2025 12.53 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 13.37 CETShareIt’s a brisk November afternoon in the village of South Brent in Devon and, in a daffodil yellow cottage, two women are singing me lullabies. But these aren’t the sort of lullabies that parents sing to their children. They are songs written and sung for terminally ill people, to ease them towards what will hopefully be a peaceful and painless death.We are at the home of Nickie Aven, singer and leader of a Threshold Choir. Aven and her friend are giving me a glimpse of what happens when they sing for people receiving end-of-life care. These patients are usually in hospices or in their own homes being supported by relatives, which is why 67-year-old Aven – who is softly spoken and radiates warmth and kindness – has asked me to lie down on the sofa under a rug while they sing. She says I can look at them, or I can close my eyes and allow my mind to drift. In fact, my eyes settle on Lennon, Aven’s large black labrador retriever who squeezes himself between the singers and is as gentle and well-mannered as his owner. The pair sing a cappella and in harmony. Distinct from elegies or laments, the songs are gently meditative, written to provide human connection and foster feelings of love and safety. They are not just for the benefit of the dying but for friends and relatives caring for them or holding vigil. Their singing is simple, intimate and beautiful. It is also utterly calming.Aven’s choir, who call themselvesMoorHeart(a nod to their proximity to Dartmoor), has 10 members. As she explains over tea and biscuits, they are all volunteers, no payment is taken and tips are politely declined. As well as bedsides, the choir sings at funerals, memorial services and sometimes at baby blessings – because birth, like death, is a threshold. Theirs is one in a growing network of choirs founded by an American named Kate Munger. In the early 90s, Munger had sat at the bedside of a friend who was dying of Aids and begun singing to him. The experience was transformative, inspiring her to establish a series of singing groups which she called chapters. There are now about 200 official chapters around the world, most in America and a handful in the UK – in Devon, Cornwall, Sheffield, Scarborough and London . There are further Threshold Choirs not affiliated with the US organisation, though exactly how many is unclear.I want to keep naming it and saying it out loud, so that fewer of us have the experience of not knowing what to sayWhat Aven and her choir do is different from the work of death doulas, who often take on more practical tasks such as setting up food rotas or taking turns with family members to keep vigil. Her choir tends to sing in groups of two, three or at most four, as “it would be overwhelming for somebody who’s very poorly to have 10 of us turn up at their bedside”. The volunteers don’t have to be trained musicians or singers – even though Aven’s choir just happens to include a former member of the Hallé, the celebrated Manchester symphony orchestra. Each choir has its own way of working, but to join this one, candidates must be able to hold a tune and sing in harmony. They also need to be comfortable with death and dying. This isn’t something that comes easily for people but, in Aven’s case, a series of devastating personal losses means she has more experience of death than most.We are, as a nation, not good at death. Death and grief exist “in the shadows”, Aven says, with many finding it hard to talk about and plan for. I tell her that when my father died 25 years ago, he spent his final weeks in a hospice drifting in and out of consciousness. As I was young and he wasn’t given to displays of emotion, I had no idea what to say near the end. “I think that’s a really common experience and is one of the reasons I do what I do,” Aven says. “I want to get a conversation going. Recently, my beautiful neighbour died at home and there was a sort of open house while she was dying. Many of us would pop round for 10 minutes and be with her and talk with her. She, her husband and family were so generous and gracious. So I want to keep naming it and saying it out loud, so that fewer of us have the experience of not knowing what to say.”View image in fullscreenMembers of the MoorHeart choir, including Nickie Aven (centre, holding candle) and Lindsey Stewart (on right), who has herself died since this photograph was taken.Photograph: Emma Stoner/The GuardianLast month, one of the choir’s own members died: Lindsey Stewart had been diagnosed with breast cancer over a decade ago and had recently been having chemotherapy. Her death was unexpected, meaning Aven and the rest of the choir never got to sing for her when she was alive. So instead they got together in the week after her death, during which they shared memories of her and sang songs.Though she is officially retired, Aven spends anything between 20 and 30 hours a week working with people who are dying or grieving, whether through singing, spiritual counselling, meditation or what she calls “accompanying”, which can just mean sitting quietly or chatting over a cup of tea. Grief, she says, “isn’t pretty and it isn’t solid. It can be lots of things. It can be trauma, or fury, or self-pity. It can be wanting to die, and that is all right, as that feeling won’t stay for ever.” Aven also runs groups where she helps people manage their grief. Last weekend, she co-hosted one called Clay Stories “where we use clay and creative writing to help them voice what’s going on”. Some people can struggle to talk about how they’re feeling, but she has found “creativity is brilliant at bypassing the brain and our inner critic”. Which, of course, is where music and singing comes in.She is clear that when the Threshold Choirs gather around a bedside, what they are doing is not a performance. Once, a nurse at a hospice asked if they would sing Christmas songs: “We said no, we’re not up for that.” The songs are slow in tempo, in the same way that lullabies are, and they are all original, with many composed by choir members. This is important, Aven says, because music is bound up with memory and anything familiar runs the risk of “pulling you back into your life. At the threshold of life, you’re wanting to disentangle yourself.” There are an estimated 600 songs in the repertoire, some recorded versions of which are for sale on the officialThreshold Choir’s Bandcamp pageas not everyone lives near a choir that can sing to them in person. Song titles include You Are Not Alone, Rest Easy and Sweet, Sweet Dreams. Aven encourages her members to write songs and bring them to practice sessions. This is partly so they don’t get bored singing the same material but also because it makes them “more invested in the choir. It’s not mine, it’s ours, and I much prefer it when we work collaboratively.”‘They were all talking about dying, but they were telling us how to live’Read moreWhile the choir sings, patients may listen silently or sleep or cry. Once, when they were singing to a patient and her family, the patient “started to cry, and her son started to cry, and the other brother came in and he started to cry. And when we left, they were all hand in hand and I would bet they hadn’t had an intimate moment like that before, because they were usually all chat, chat, chat. It allowed them to weep and be real.” When a new singer joins the choir, Aven suggests they don’t sing at the bedside at first; instead, they practise with volunteers who lie on a couch, much like I am doing. They also do developmental exercises and workshops to get them as relaxed and clear-headed around death as possible. This is because the last thing a dying person needs is a singer bursting into tears.Aven’s work around death and dying goes back to 2000 when she was living in Bristol and joined a multidisciplinary team at the Rainbow Centre, a non-profit organisation helping people and families dealing with life-threatening illness and bereavement. “It was kids who had cancer, mothers and fathers who had lost children, or children who had lost their mummies.” A month into the job, Aven’s mother, Joan, died. Joan had endured multiple losses as a child. “She was five when her father died in 1933,” Aven says. “Then her grandad caught a cold at the funeral and died a few weeks later. They went to live with her grandmother and found her dead on the kitchen floor from a heart attack.” Joan was never able to properly deal with those losses “because in the 1930s, who’s going to manage grief?”View image in fullscreen‘I want to get a conversation going’: Nickie Aven.Photograph: Emma Stoner/The GuardianAnd so, at the Rainbow Centre, Aven had a revelation. “I realised, oh my God, I am doing this for my mother. This is the exact help she needed as a child.” When Aven’s father died, he was in the middle of having his hair cut. “He had a heart attack in the barber’s chair. The barber had just told him a joke, turned around for his scissors, turned back and he was dead.” That sounds like an excellent way to go, I say. “Yes,” Aven says, adding with a grin, “Shocking for the barber, though. I mean, it’s not good for business, is it?”In the late 2000s, Aven starting training in interfaith ministry and celebrancy, and began holding funerals; it was while mentoring interfaith students that she met her husband, Neil. In 2012, she moved to Findhorn in Scotland, a spiritual community where she ran a lodge. There, a woman named Chloe Greenwood came to stay. She had been to America and learned about Threshold Choirs, and was founding one in Scotland. Aven immediately joined up. “What I loved was the sense of love, of kindness. I use the word carefully as it has hippy-dippy connotations, but it felt like a sisterhood.”In late 2017, Aven and Neil decided to move to Devon, as he had family in the West Country. Keen to keep singing, Aven set up a Threshold Choir in the village. Two weeks later, Neil was diagnosed with a brain tumour. It was a grade four glioblastoma and it was terminal. A year later, Neil’s health declined and he began having seizures. One, which lasted three hours, left him bedbound “and his memory shot”. Throughout, Aven never stopped singing. In Neil’s final months, the choir would come and sing for him in their front room where he was installed in a hospital bed. Then, one Saturday morning in May 2019, Aven “woke up at half past five and heard him struggling with his breath. I hadn’t realised he was dying but after an hour or two I noticed he was going grey. And then he was gone.” Aven cleaned him, and did some meditation. “And then I sat beside him and I sang.”During Neil’s illness, another crisis was unfolding for Aven and her family. Sam, her son from a previous relationship (she also has a daughter), had been struggling with heroin addiction for some years, but before Neil’s diagnosis, had seemed to get clean. “To all intents and purposes, he was doing OK,” Aven says. But the last time she saw him, she had a bad feeling. Sam and his sister were visiting for her 60th birthday and, though she didn’t know why, she thought something wasn’t right. Dropping him off at the station, “I gave him a hug and thought: I don’t want to let you go. When I walked away, I very nearly ran back but instead I carried on walking. I didn’t see him again.”Very often we die in our time and order, and it isn’t a tragedy or a catastrophe. This is what happens: we are born and we dieSam had been living in a dry house in Bristol, was attending meetings atNarcotics Anonymousand was in contact with his sponsor. Aven doesn’t believe he was regularly using again, but she later learned from his journals that he was taking spice, a form of synthetic cannabis that is often called the “zombie drug”. Aven can’t be sure what happened, but she thinks he may have had a drink, then bought some heroin. It was a Saturday when he was last heard in his room by other residents. “It was a hot summer, he was in the room at the top of the house with no window open,” she says. “When he was found on the Monday, his body was already black. I was told, ‘You cannot see him’ which I think was the right call, but it was hard.” Aven is certain he didn’t take his own life, and that it was an accidental overdose. “The way I think of it is that he stood on the edge of the cliff, putting himself in the way of the wind, and one day it was going to blow the other way – and it did.” Sam was 33 when he died.View image in fullscreenMembers of the choir gather to practise.Photograph: Emma Stoner/The GuardianAven has witnessed only one death – that of her husband – though she has met scores of people who are close to the end. I ask her what preoccupies them most. “They worry about what their death will look like and about being out of control,” she replies. “They also worry about how their families will manage without them.” Aven has helped people write letters, some of which have addressed regrets in their lives. Shame can be a big thing, she says. “There is such an opportunity, when you know you’re dying, to heal any shame. There’s a real grace in that.”A good death, Aven notes, comes from “looking it full in the face. To think, ‘Oh, you’re coming, OK’ and working with that. Not thinking death is a bogeyman, or a baddie.” She adds that there are times when death is “a dreadful calamity such as when it’s children, and I’m not belittling it. But very often we die in our time and in our order, and it isn’t a tragedy or a catastrophe. This is what happens: we are born and we die.” Does she think she will be able to maintain a Zen approach when faced with her own death? “What I expect is that first I’ll be in a panic, then I’ll probably ask someone to help me make sure everything I need to do or say is done, even though I try to do that in my life anyway. My daughter knows how much I love her and we talk about death, including my death. It’s not a taboo subject.”Aven senses I am building up to ask about assisted dying, and heads me off at the pass. “I won’t go there. I have my own views, but they might not be popular and I don’t want to offend people.” Instead, I ask her about the word “threshold”, as it seems to suppose a dying patient is going from one place to another. I wonder if this means those involved in the movement believe there is something else after death? “No, absolutely not,” she replies. “I think, if nothing else, it’s a threshold out of life. It’s not clear to us what’s next, if anything. And I would never dream of asking anybody in the choir, or anyone we sing for, about their beliefs.” Aven declines to say what she thinks happens after death. She will say that after Neil died, she wrote to him every day. Whether he knew that or not wasn’t the point. What mattered was she found comfort in it.Given all she has endured, Aven’s openness and ability to articulate her feelings around death and dying are remarkable. Much of her work is galvanised by not wanting others to feel alone and disconnected with their fear and grief, and understanding that the more we talk about death – what it looks like, what it’s like for those left behind – the less traumatic and frightening it will be. I had wondered whether our afternoon together would feel heavy and sad, but it turns out conversation with Aven is life-affirming and full of laughter. “When I get to the end of my life,” she says, “I just want to be able to say, ‘Thank you, that was brilliant!’”Nickie Aven and her Threshold Choir form the subject ofa 20-minute Guardian documentary called Threshold.Explore more on these topicsDeath and dyingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.The program was created in 1991, and underDonald Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, it wasextendedto cover about 600,000 Venezuelans and 521,000 Haitians.

There were also concerns among diplomats that rivalries between the UAE and Saudi Arabia,on display in the south of Yemen, could lead to a deepening of the conflict in Sudan.The UK estimates there are as many as 26 possible arms supply routes into Sudan with 10 countries of origin. Saudi Arabia and Egypt have broadly supported the army, while the RSF has been backed by the UAE, a position the Gulf state denies despiteevidence compiledby the UN, independent experts and reporters. In south Yemen, the UAE is backing a separatist movement, the Southern Transitional Council, which is opposed by Saudi Arabia.View image in fullscreenYemeni supporters of the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council wave the old South Yemen flag as they rally in the port city of Aden on 8 December.Photograph: Saleh Al-Obeidi/AFP/GettyThe war between the army and the RSF, which erupted in April 2023, has caused what the UN has described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Communities in the Darfur region are facing famine and malnutrition afteran 18-month RSF siege around El Fasher,which fell to the group on 26 October.Those targeted with sanctions include Abdul Rahim Hamdan Dagalo, the RSF’s deputy leader and brother of Hemedti, as well as three other commanders, all of whom now face asset freezes and travel bans. Officials indicated the threshold of evidence needed to place sanctions had been met partly because some of the commanders posted videos glorifying the killings on social media.The four individuals under UK sanctions faced the same punishment by the EU last week, and the measures underline the extent to which sanctions are as much a statement of diplomatic leverage and disapproval as an objective assessment of those most responsible for the conflict.Map of Sudan and surrounding area showing conflictThe other RSF leaders placedunder sanctionsare: Gedo Hamdan Ahmed, the RSF’s commander for North Darfur; Al-Fateh Abdullah Idris, brigadier general of the RSF; and Tijani Ibrahim Moussa Mohamed, an RSF field commander.The UK hinted strongly that it may take further action against the RSF in the near future, but this may depend on how the RSF seeks to use its current military advantage.An existential battle of interests: what the Sudanese war is actually aboutRead moreIn a statement, the UK Foreign Office said the individuals were “suspected of atrocities including mass killings, sexual violence and deliberate attacks on civilians in El Fasher, Sudan”.Although there is no official figure for how many people were killed after the RSF’s seizure of El Fasher, British MPs have beenbriefedthat at least 60,000 may have been murdered.The Foreign Office said an extra £20m in funding would empower aid organisations to reach 150,000 people with essentials such as food, medical care and emergency shelter, as well as to keep hospitals running and reconnect families. UK aid commitments to Sudan this year have risen to £146m.The foreign secretary,Yvette Cooper, said: “The atrocities taking place in Sudan are so horrific they scar the conscience of the world. The overwhelming evidence of heinous crimes – mass executions, starvation and the systematic and calculated use of rape as a weapon of war – cannot and will not go unpunished. The UK will not look away, and we will always stand with the people of Sudan.”View image in fullscreenWomen displaced from El-Fasher stand in line to receive food aid at the El-Afadh camp in al-Dabbah, in Sudan’s Northern State, on 16 November.Photograph: Marwan Ali/APThe UK is resisting efforts to join the group of four countries – the US,Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt – that are leading efforts to find a diplomatic solution, fearing to do so would lead to pressure to join diplomatically one side or the other in the conflict.‘His role is to recruit’: the Sheffield-based propagandist for Sudan’s RSF militiaRead moreThe sanctions were welcomed by the UK’sDarfurdiaspora – thousands of whom have had family members killed by the RSF during the conflict – but there was also disappointment that the UAE had escaped censure.Abdallah Abu Garda, the chair of the UK-based Darfur Diaspora Association, which has more than 30,000 members, said: “The UK’s sanctions on senior RSF commanders are a vital step toward justice. But ending atrocity crimes in Sudan and the genocide in Darfur requires more. All supply lines that fuel these atrocities, including those enabled by the UAE, must be cut.“True justice demands that every party, whether a direct perpetrator or an external sponsor, faces real consequences.”The UN Human Rights Council last week adopted a UK-led resolution condemning the atrocities and securing international consensus to mandate an urgent inquiry into atrocities in El Fasher.Explore more on these topicsSudanWar crimesDarfurConflict and armsUnited Arab EmiratesSaudi ArabiaYemennewsShareReuse this content"

His wife Viviane Barci de Moraes – who was added the sanctions list in September – was also removed from the register on Friday.The move had been repeatedly requested by Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in negotiations withDonald Trumpto roll back the 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports.The decision is a major setback for Bolsonaro and his congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who left his post inBrazilto lobby in Washington for punitive measures over what he called a “persecution” of his father.Trump imposed the punishment shortly after imposing tariffs on Brazil, justifying it as a response to what he claimed was a “witch-hunt” against Bolsonaro. Eduardo Bolsonaro has alleged that he influenced Trump’s decision.Moraes presided over the trial hearing in September when Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting to overturn Brazil’s 2022 election. Days later, the Magnitsky sanctions were extended to the justice’s wife.Bolsonaro’s supporters had hoped for further retaliation against Brazil, but what followed wasan unexpected rapprochement between Trump and Lula.The US president first praised his Brazilian counterpart during the UN general assembly; the two then exchanged calls, held their first in-person meeting, and, in November, Trump removed most of the tariffs.With the sanctions lifted from Moraes and his wife, Eduardo Bolsonaropostedon social media that he “received with regret” the news, while thanking Trump “for the support demonstrated throughout this process and for the attention he gave to the serious crisis of freedoms affecting Brazil”.He added that he will continue “working firmly and resolutely to find a path that allows for the liberation of our country, for as long as necessary and despite adverse circumstances. May God bless America, and may He have mercy on the Brazilian people.”Bolsonaro is already serving his sentence in a special cell at the Federal Police headquarters in Brasília.This week, the lower house approved a law that could reduce his time in a closed regime to just over two years.The bill – which still falls short of the full amnesty sought by the far-right leader and his sons – must still pass the senate, where there is also apparent support, before going to Lula; any veto by him would likely be overturned.Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroDonald TrumpAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

So long as Maduro remains in power, the favored position that the ELN enjoys in Venezuela seems likely to continue. Similarly, the Maduro regime now has its survival, in part, linked to the growing strength of the ELN,” the report said.The ELN has taken part in failed peace negotiations with Colombia’s last five governments.Two years of peace talks with the government of incumbent Gustavo Petro – Colombia’s first ever leftist president – were suspended after the rebels intensified armed attacks in parts of the country.While professing to be driven by leftist, nationalist ideology, the ELN is deeply involved in the drug trade and has become one of the region’s most powerful organized crime groups.It vies for territory and control of lucrative coca plantations and trafficking routes with dissident fighters that refused to lay down arms when the FARC guerrilla army disarmed under a 2016 peace deal.Colombia is the world’s top cocaine producer, according to the UN.Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasUS foreign policyDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

This is a time for unity and decisive action for Canada’s future.”Ma made the announcement the day after attending the Conservative Christmas party and posing for a photo with Tory leaderPierre Poilievre. He then attended a party hosted by the Liberals the next evening, appearing on stage with Carney to raucous applause.The Liberals now have 171 seats in parliament: one short of a majority.In a statement on social media, Poilievere said Ma “chose to endorse the very policies he was elected to oppose” and would join a party that was increasing the cost of living. “The people he let down the most are the ones who elected him to fight for an affordable future. He will have to answer to them.”The crossing will sting theConservatives, who have now lost three lawmakers. One crossed to the Liberals in November and another said he would resign in the coming months.On Friday, government house leader Stephen MacKinnon said he believed there were more frustrated opposition members who might be tempted to defect to the Liberals.Canada minister resigns from cabinet over Carney’s controversial oil pipeline dealRead more“All of my colleagues here have the same experience of speaking to Conservative members, unfortunately a group which is in the minority in their group, who are extremely frustrated with the leadership of their party,” he said during a press conference, adding members were forced to participate in a “charade of obstruction” in order to oppose the Liberals that is “soul-destroying experience for many Conservative[s]”.While the addition of a new member to caucus has buoyed Liberals, Carney has faced discontent within his own party.Earlier this month, a prominent cabinet minister, Steven Guilbeault,resigned from his post, protesting Carney’s decision to support a controversial oil pipeline from Alberta to the Pacific Ocean.Guilbeault, a longtime environmental advocate, warned the pipeline to the west coast “would have major environmental impacts … contribute to a significant increase in climate pollution, and move Canada further away from its greenhouse gas reduction targets”. Guibeault warned that lifting the moratorium on oil tanker traffic would significantly increase the risk of accidents in the region.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasConservativesMark CarneynewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities have closed dozens of roads in response to the emergency and issued evacuation warnings for 100,000 people. More rain is expected over the weekend and through next week.Bob Ferguson, the governor of Washington, on Friday morning warned that flooding “remains extremely unpredictable” and rivers were expected to continue to rise. He declared a statewide emergency on Wednesday in response to the weather, and Donald Trump on Friday approved the state’s request for an emergency declaration, Ferguson said.The Washington national guard has been deployed to affected areas and helped to rescue residents trapped by floodwaters. Meanwhile, California announced it would send 150 emergency personnel, including search-and-rescue teams, to the state to assist with the response.The intense rain began earlier in the week with a storm system meteorologists call anatmospheric river, a vast airborne current of dense moisture funneled inland from the Pacific Ocean, that inundated the region with water.What are atmospheric rivers?Read moreWesternWashington statebore the brunt of the storm, with flood watches posted for the Cascade and Olympic mountains and Puget Sound, as well as for a northern slice of Oregon, home to some 5.8 million people, according to the US National Weather Service. In recent days, authorities have rescued people from rooftops and submerged vehicles. The Associated Press reported that in Snoqualmie, a herd of elk could be seen swimming through neck-high water on a flooded football field.The same storm system has also brought heavy showers and flooding to westernMontanaand an edge of northern Idaho.View image in fullscreenA sign partially covered by floodwater from the Snohomish River on 11 December.Photograph: David Ryder/ReutersEarly on Friday morning, all the residents of the small city of Burlington, in western Washington, roughly halfway between Seattle and Bellingham, a total of around 10,000 people, were told by the authorities to evacuate. National Guard were going door to door and shelters were being prepared, local mediaoutlets reported.In addition, roughly 100,000 residents across wider western Washington on Friday were under level 3 evacuation orders urging them to immediately move to higher ground, the bulk of them in rural Skagit county north of Seattle, said Karina Shagren, a spokesperson for the state emergency management division.Powerful storms dump heavy rain and swell rivers across US Pacific north-westRead moreAbout 3,800 evacuees were believed to be in need of temporary shelter, Skagit county emergency chief Julie de Losada said.First responders have rescued several people, includingby helicopterin King andWhatcomcounties in recent days.The worst flooding was reported along the Skagit, Snohomish and Puyallup rivers. More than 30 highways and dozens of smaller roads were closed due to flooding across the region, state officials said. In some communities, residents have been urged to boil water to ensure it is safe to consume.Several lengthy segments of the BNSF Railway, a major freight line serving the Pacific north-west, were washed out or closed due to flooding, the company said, citing reported rainfall of 10 to 17in or more in many areas.Some rivers have been cresting several feet above record levels and on Friday morning had not receded. The forecast is for lighter rain on Friday and a mostly dry Saturday but meteorologists predict more heavy rain on Sunday for the region.View image in fullscreenScott Uderitz and Tod Uderitz watch the rising floodwaters of the Snohomish River from the offices of the Snohomish United soccer club in Snohomish, Washington, on Thursday.Photograph: David Ryder/ReutersIn British Columbia, five of the sixCanadianhighways leading to the Pacific port city of Vancouver were shut down due to floods, falling rocks and the risk of avalanches, local authorities said on Thursday.“This situation is evolving and very dynamic,” said the transport ministry of British Columbia.Access to Vancouver relies largely on a limited highway and railway network that crosses the Rocky Mountains.While such storms are not uncommon on the US Pacific coast, meteorologists say they are likely to become more frequent and extreme over the next century if global heating from the human-inducedclimate crisiscontinues at current rates.Explore more on these topicsUS weatherWashington stateWest CoastFloodingOregonIdahoMontananewsShareReuse this content"

A further hazard was the ever present risk of an inadvertent airstrike by US warplanes hunting alleged cocaine smugglers.After three hours drifting in the darkness, the flimsy boat finally made contact with a larger vessel sent to take Machado to Curaçao, a former Dutch colony that remains part of the kingdom of the Netherlands. From there, the 58-year-old politician would travel by private jet, via the US, to Oslo, where the Nobel prize was due to be awarded to her within hours. The relief was intense.“There was a moment when I felt like there was real risk to my life,” Machado told the Guardian in Oslo on Friday. “But it was a very spiritual moment because in the end I felt like I was in God’s hands and it would be in his hands. He decided for me to be here and able to hug my family and other families of political prisoners.”The clandestine 5,500-mile (8,850km) journey fromVenezuelato Norway was organised by Bryan Stern, a US special forces veteran who heads the Grey Bull Rescue Foundation, a Florida-based NGO specialising in the “rescue [of] Americans and allies from conflict and disaster zones”, according to its website.View image in fullscreenMachado in Oslo on Friday.Photograph: Ole Berg-Rusten/APSterndescribed on Wednesdaythe challenges of organising the escape of Machado. “She has a very large target on her back,” Stern told CBS News. “This is not a random shopkeeper who doesn’t want to be in Venezuela any more. This is moving around a rock star.”SinceNicolás Madurotook power in 2013, Venezuela has been in economic mayhem, subjected to hyperinflation, hunger and increasingly authoritarian rule. Last year, Maduro was accused of stealing the presidential election and launched a wave of repression, forcing Machado into hiding. Independently verified data shows the poll was won by Machado’s ally Edmundo González.The Wall Street Journal reported that Machadowore a wig and a disguiseto flee a safehouse in a suburb of Caracas, the Venezuelan capital. She then crossed 10 roadblocks before arriving in a remote fishing port where helpers had prepared a small fishing skiff.The battered boat had been chosen primarily because it was so different in appearance from the powerful and fast vessels favoured by cocaine smugglers.‘Follow the path of exiles’: María Corina Machado’s US-aided escape from VenezuelaRead moreBut still, the fear lurked that US forces could mistake the high-seas rendezvous for a contraband handover and inadvertently launch an airstrike on the conservative leader who dedicated her Nobel win to Donald Trump.Since August, the US president has ramped uppressureon Maduro, putting a $50m bounty on his head and ordering a massive military buildup in the Caribbean – as well as a series of deadly airstrikes on alleged narco vessels,killing more than 80 people. On Wednesday, the USseized a “dark fleet” oil tankernear Venezuela, which Caracas denounced as “blatant theft”.In order to reduce the risk of an airstrike, Stern told US defence officials some of his planned route. But many perils remained.He said: “It was dangerous. It was scary. The sea conditions were ideal for us, but certainly not water that you would want to be on … The higher the waves, the harder it is for radar to see. That’s how it works.”A technical fault delayed the skiff, while its primary GPS system was swept away by waves and a backup navigation device failed, the WSJ reported. “The seas are very rough. It’s pitch black. We’re using flashlights to communicate. This is very scary, lots of things can go wrong,” Sterntold the BBC.Amid growing fears they could miss the rendezvous, the two boats finally met and the politician reached Curaçao by mid-afternoon on Tuesday.On Wednesday mornin,g a private jet carrying Machado departed for Norway, via a stop on the US east coast.She arrived in Oslo too late for the Wednesday eveningprize-giving ceremonybut appeared on a balcony of the Grand Hotel in the Norwegian capital early on Thursday, waving and blowing kisses to cheering supporters chanting “freedom”. The last time she had appeared in public was in Caracas in January, when sheprotested over Maduro’s inauguration for his third term.0:57Crowds cheer as Venezuelan Nobel laureate María Corina Machado appears in Norway – videoTheNobel peace prizewas awarded to Machado for “her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy”.Stern said the operation to get her to Oslo was financed by “a few generous donors” and that the US government “did not contribute a single penny”. The decision to leave Venezuela and join the Nobel events in Oslo would have come at both personal and political risk to Machado, say analysts.Benedicte Bull, a professor specialising in Latin America at the University of Oslo, said: “She risks being arrested if she returns even if the authorities have shown more restraint with her than with many others, because arresting her would have a very strong symbolic value.”In her acceptance speech on Wednesday, read by one of her daughters, Machado denounced kidnappings and torture under Maduro, calling them crimes against humanity and “state terrorism, deployed to bury the will of the people”.She added: “Of course, the risk of going back, perhaps it’s higher, but it’s always worthwhile. And I’ll be back in Venezuela, I have no doubt.”Explore more on these topicsMaría Corina MachadoVenezuelaNobel peace prizeCBSWall Street JournalAmericasUS press and publishingnewsShareReuse this content"

Fewer than 800 Tapanulis were left in the wild before the flooding, and the entire population dwells solely in this tract of forest already threatened by mining, palm oil plantations and a large hydropower project.“It’s a total disaster,” said biological anthropologist Erik Meijaard, one of the first experts to describe the species. “The path to extinction is now a lot steeper.”In a photo reviewed by the Guardian, a dead orangutan was hoisted out of a mud pit in the Central Tapanuli region.View image in fullscreenA Tapanuli orangutan in the Batang Toru forests.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/Alamy“One of the rescue team members who was in search of human casualties had shown me a body believed to be an orangutan that was found in the logs and mud,” said Panut Hadisiswoyo, founding director of the Orangutan Information Centre in Indonesia. “After seeing the photos, I am confident that the decayed body, reddish hair and the size of the skull was a Tapanuli orangutan.”It’s the world’s rarest ape. Now a billion-dollar dig for gold threatens its futureRead moreThere are few modern precedents for such a sudden shock to a great ape population, Meijaard said, apart from the 2000s Ebola outbreaks that devastatedwestern gorillaand chimpanzee populations in central Africa.Biologists have said that even a loss of just 1% of the Tapanuli population each year would be sufficient to drive the Tapanulis to extinction, as the animals only reproduce every six to nine years.Meijaard’s preliminary findings on the toll of the Sumatra floods, to be published this week, estimate a loss of between 6.2% and 10.5% of the Tapanuli orangutan population in just a few days – a critical demographic shock. The draft paper warns that it represents an “extinction-level disturbance” for the species.Assessing the affected zone from satellite imagery, Meijaard and his colleagues found that nearly 4,000 hectares (9,900 acres) of previously intact forest were swept away by landslides and floods, and estimating another 2,500 hectares (6,200 acres) was probably affected though unobserved due to cloud cover.Satellite imagery shows huge gashes in the mountainous landscape, some of which extend for more than a kilometre and are nearly 100 metres wide, Meijaard said. The tide of mud, trees and water toppling down hillsides would have carried away everything in its path, including other wildlife such as elephants.View image in fullscreenAn aerial photograph shows the extent of the devastation caused by the flooding in Indonesia.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesDavid Gaveau, a remote-sensing expert and founder of the conservation startup the Tree Map, said he was flabbergasted by the before and after comparison of the region.“I have never seen anything like this before during my 20 years of monitoring deforestation in Indonesia with satellites,” he said.The devastation means remaining Tapanulis will be even more vulnerable, with sources of food and shelter now washed away.View image in fullscreenA Tapanuli orangutan skeleton found in mud in North Sumatra – between 33 and 54 of the critically endangered apes are thought to have perished.Photograph: Decky Chandra“The rainfall was intense. If you lose your fruit, you lose your flowers, there will be a significant reduction in habitat quality,” Meijaard said.Scientists and environmental advocates have fought for years to protect the endangered apes from mining, hydropower projects and palm oil plantations. The Guardian recently reported that in the weeks before the flooding, PT Agincourt’s Martabe Gold Mine had begun operationsto expandinto a second open pit near Tapanuli orangutan habitat.While human-caused climate breakdown is estimated to have increased rainfall intensity by between 28% and 160% in the affected region, according to a rapid analysis by World Weather Attribution, deforestation and associated land degradation has played a significant role, the government said.In response to the floods, Indonesia’s environment ministry has halted all private-sector activity in the Batang Toru area for an undetermined period.The orangutan experts urged an immediate halt to development that will damage the remaining Tapanuli habitat, and an immediate survey of the region.They also back the expansion of protected areas and work to restore lowland forests.Hadisiswoyo said the region had become eerily quiet after the landslides.“This fragile and sensitive habitat in West Block must be fully protected by halting all habitat-damaging development,” he said.AFP contributed to this reportFind moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsIndonesiaThe age of extinctionEndangered speciesConservationAsia PacificAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

One singled out for criticism asked them to assess the political philosophers Immanuel Kant and Thomas Hobbes and analyse their views on the rule of law. Another asked them to consider the nature of time and clocks, while a third questioned how the idea of existence might apply to video game avatars.These questions prompted a significant backlash in a country where the exam is taken so seriously that flights are grounded nationwide for 35 minutes during the English listening test to eliminate any potential noise.In response, Oh Seung-keol, the chief of Korea’s Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation, stepped down. He said he felt “a heavy sense of responsibility for the English section of the test, which did not align with the principles of absolute evaluation”, the institution said.He also apologised for “causing concern to test-takers and their parents, and for causing confusion in the college entrance exam process”.The agency issued a separate apology, saying it “takes seriously the criticism that the test failed to meet the appropriate level of difficulty and the goal of reducing students’ academic burden”.The use of the portmanteau “culturtainment” in the test was also a source of confusion – even from the academic behind the phrase.Stuart Moss, a senior lecturer at Leeds Beckett University in the UK, said he was “very surprised” to see the phrase included. “I am also of the opinion that this word should never have featured in the exam due it not being in common English usage,” he said in an email reply to a South Korean test-taker, reported by the local daily Munhwa Ilbo.Enormous pressure on students in South Korea’s ultra-competitive education system has been partly blamed for teenage depression and suicide rates that are among the highest in the world.This month, South Korea’s national assembly approved an amended law banning private English-language educational institutes from administering entrance tests to preschoolers.Test scores have long been a highly sensitive and closely scrutinised issue. This week, the nephew of the Samsung Electronics chief, Lee Jae-yong – a member of one of South Korea’s most powerful and wealthy families – made headlines after he reportedly failed a single question on the exam, still earning him admission to the country’s top Seoul National University.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaAsia PacificUniversitiesHigher educationExamsnewsShareReuse this content"

The blame should be pointed at me for everyone’s suffering.“I have spent almost every waking moment of the last few years thinking of what I could have done different and what I can do now to make things right.”Kwon’s lawyers had argued that he should be sentenced to no more than five years in prison, arguing that his actions were motivated by a desire to prop up Terraform’s TerraUSD stablecoin, not personal gain.The judge called the request “wildly unreasonable”.Kwon has been in US custody since his extradition from Montenegro last year, where he was imprisoned for using a fake passport.As part of his guilty plea, Kwon agreed to forfeit $19.3m and some properties that prosecutors claimed he gained from the fraud.Prosecutors said they would support Kwon serving the second half of his sentence in South Korea, where he still faces charges, if he abides by the terms of his plea deal.Prosecutors said they would not seek restitution for the investors who lost a total of $40bn, saying the prospect of determining each of their losses would be too complex.The judge said that some of Kwon’s investors still believed in him, even after his guilty plea, and that reading some of their letters was like “reading the words of cult followers”.Engelmayer said he had received letters from 315 victims all over the world, many reporting they had lost their homes, retirement savings, money for medical expenses and college funds to Kwon’s fraud.A graduate of Stanford University, Kwon returned to South Korea and launched the startup that would become Terraform Labs in 2017 with the co-founder Daniel Shin.Prosecutors alleged that when TerraUSD slipped below its $1 peg in May 2021, Kwon told investors a computer algorithm known as “Terra Protocol” had restored the coin’s value.Instead, they said, he arranged for a high-frequency trading company to buy millions of dollars of the token secretly to artificially prop up its price.Prosecutors said that false claim, and others, drove retail and institutional investors to buy Terraform products and boost the value of Luna – a more traditional token that fluctuated in value but was closely linked to TerraUSD – to $50bn by the spring of 2022.Kwon is one of several cryptocurrency moguls to face federal charges after a slump in digital token prices in 2022 prompted the collapse of a number of companies.Bankman-Fried, the founder of the US’s largest crypto exchange, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2024.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesTechnology sectorSouth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The party put forward a number of demands, including a referendum on constitutional amendments, as part of a deal to support him.“When the People’s party couldn’t get what they want, they said they will submit a no-confidence motion and asked the PM to dissolve parliament immediately,” Siripong said.Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, leader of the People’s party, told reporters late on Thursday that the Bhumjaithai party did not follow the terms of their agreement. “We have tried to use the voice of the opposition to push forward amending the constitution,” he said.Explore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Australia is meant to be on a path transitioning away from fossil fuels, not opening the door to brand new gas,” Cadman said.King said the five new areas – all in commonwealth waters – had buffer zones to protect marine park boundaries.Public consultation on the five zones is open until 6 February, with applications for exploration permits closing on 30 June.The announcement comes as the Albanese government prepares to release the findings of a six-month review of the east coast gas market, which is widely expected to recommend establishing anew schemeto force producers to reserve supplies for domestic use.Cabinet ministers are alsoreportedlyconsidering bulk-buying gas and selling it to businesses at discounted rates to prevent the closure of struggling manufacturers.Ahead of the review’s release, a coalition of environmentalists, inequality advocates and clean energy groups issued a statement opposing new taxpayer subsidises for gas companies, which they said have been “allowed to plunder Australia’s public resources without accountability for too long”.The nine organisations backed a 25% tax on gas exports, an Australian Council of Trade Unions’ policy that has been championed by the Greens.“Australia’s focus on gas exports has tripled domestic gas and electricity prices driving up inflation and household bills,” said Australian Council of Social Service climate and energy program director Kellie Caught, whose organisation was among the nine groups.“The government must implement gas export market controls and avoid options that effectively subsidise gas companies or incentivise new polluting gas production. It’s time for this government to prioritise people over rich gas companies.”Explore more on these topicsEnergyGasAustralian politicsAustralian GreensVictoriaFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

The organisation, once a little-known part of international financial plumbing that is now in the spotlight, has no say on how the frozen funds are used.EU has a plan to use frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine – how will it work?Read moreThe lawsuit, being filed in a Moscow court, claims Euroclear’s “illegal actions” had caused “damage” to the central bank’s ability to manage funds and securities.Euroclear declined to comment, but a spokesperson said it was “currently fighting more than 100 legal claims in Russia”.Last week,the European Commission proposed a €90bn (£79bn) loanfor Ukraine, secured against Russian assets immobilised in the EU since its full-scale invasion. But the plan has been blocked by Belgium, which fears a cascade of lawsuits from Moscow and the seizure of Belgian assets in the country.Belgium’s prime ministerBart De Wever met Keir Starmer in Downing Streeton Friday for long-planned talks on the EU-UK reset, migration and the Russian assets.De Wever’s spokesperson said they had discussed “the possible use of the value of immobilised Russian sovereign assets” and “agreed to continue to work closely to make progress on this complex issue”.A Downing Street spokesperson issued a near-identical statement, saying: “It was clear, they agreed, that keeping up the economic pressure on Russia and putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position would remain the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace.”View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer held talks with his Belgian counterpart on Friday.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesThe meeting comes ahead of an EU summit next week, when leaders have promised decisions on funding Ukraine in 2026-27, amid warnings that Kyiv will run out of money next spring to fund its defence and pay doctors and teachers.EU officials believe the proposed €90bn loan will meet two-thirds of Ukraine’s financial needs for the next two years, and expect Kyiv’s other “international partners” to provide the rest.The Belgian government says it must have guarantees from EU partners that it will not be on the hook for a multibillion-euro bill if it is sued by Russia.De Wever has previously described the proposal as “fundamentally wrong” and argued it would violate international law and endanger the stability of the euro currency.In a sign of tensions around the plan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Malta and Italy said only EU leaders should decide on use of the immobilised assets. In a statement announcing support for the emergency powers clause to freeze the funds indefinitely on Friday, they urged EU countries “to continue exploring and discussing alternative options in line with EU and international law”.Belgium argues the EU should borrow money on capital markets to fund Ukraine, secured against unallocated funds (headroom) in the EU budget. But many member states are loath to take out more common debt.Germany, usually a champion of economic orthodoxy, sees the frozen assets plan as the best option and has pledged to provide one-quarter (€50bn) of needed guarantees for Belgium.EU officials argue that the legal risk to Euroclear, and therefore Belgium, would be limited.Under the complex scheme, the EU would borrow cash from Euroclear, then loan the funds to Ukraine, while Russia remains the legal owner of the assets. Ukraine would only repay the money if and when it received reparations from Moscow for colossal damage inflicted during the war.The UK, which hosts €27bn (£23bn) of frozen Russian assets, supports the idea and expects some, but not all, G7 countries to move forward with a similar plan, following a decision on the Euroclear-held assets. US participation in the scheme is less certain, although it holds only a modest €4bn (£3.5bn) in immobilised assets.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionRussiaUkraineEuropeEuropean CommissionnewsShareReuse this content"

We were planning to do some ice-skating,’ said Leila Cader (left).Photograph: Chris Warde-JonesThe billboard says thebullometrorates “the hateful comments” leftwing opponents have directed at Meloni’s government, with the contenders receiving one for “originality” and 10 for “spite”.Critics includeMaurizio Landini, a trade union boss and thorn in the government’s side who caused controversy recently after referring to Meloni as “Trump’s courtesan”, and thePlacebo frontman Brian Molko, who was charged with defaming the prime minister after appearing to call her a “piece of shit, fascist, racist” in Italian while performing at a festival in Turin in 2023.How the EU’s far right has seized on Charlie Kirk’s killingRead moreBut the image that caught Cader’s eye was an upside-down picture of Charlie Kirk, the US far-right activist and ally of Donald Trump who was assassinated in September, whichdrew Meloni’s wrathwhen it was posted online by an Italian student movement in the wake of his killing. The image, captioned “one less, today is less dark”, echoes the death of the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, who was killed by partisans before being hung by his feet from scaffolding at a Milan gas station.By contrast, Kirk was celebrated by Brothers ofItalyon “the pantheon”, a billboard on the opposite side of the gardens representing historical figures whom the party considers strong and powerful.“What is going on here?” asked Cader. “We had no idea it was political. We were planning to do some ice-skating but don’t want to give our money to this event.”View image in fullscreenCharlie Kirk was celebrated in a panel of images representing a ‘hegemony of courage and duty’, among other topics.Photograph: Chris Warde-JonesAtreju, named after the heroic character in the fantasy novel The NeverEnding Story, began in 1998 as a platform for debate among the youth wing of the National Alliance, the neo-fascist party that later morphed into Brothers of Italy. The festival has since evolved, especially in the three years since Meloni came to power, to embrace an unusual mix of politicians of all stripes, Catholic priests, nuns, magistrates and celebrities.In the past it has hosted Steve Bannon, Elon Muskand Rishi Sunak, while this year’s lineup includes European far-right politicians such as France’sMarion Maréchaland Romania’sGeorge Simion.At the opposite end of the political spectrum are the former Italian prime ministers Matteo Renzi and Giuseppe Conte, and Roberto Fico, the recently elected president of the Campania region. “Even if we have political differences, it’s important to debate,” Fico told the Guardian while perusing the Christmas stalls.But more than a talking shop, Atreju – which this year goes by the slogan “you became strong … Italy with its head held high” – is an opportunity for Meloni to flaunt her power.A video reel close to the entrance aimed at boasting Meloni’s credentials on the international stage shows her shaking hands with Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Ursula von der Leyen, and meeting Trump at the White House.View image in fullscreenPino and his wife, from Rome, credited Meloni with boosting their pensions and ‘getting things done’.Photograph: Chris Warde-Jones“Meloni is strong, determined and elegant,” said Pina, who was at the festival with her husband, Pino, who in turn chipped in: “She’s out of this league.” The couple, who did not want to give their surname, are from Rome and said they voted for the left “many years ago”. But, they said, it was something they now regretted. They credited Meloni for boosting their pensions and generally “getting things done”, citing a scheme to repatriate migrantsvia centres in Albania, even though it has so far failed.Gettingtough on crimewas also a key Meloni pledge. Enrica Ciardo, a chef, was invited to the event and was managing a stall selling traditional Italian produce. She said she was apolitical, but appreciated the support Italy’s leadership showed when her restaurant in Puglia was the target of bomb threats by the mafia, adding that Meloni’s sister Arianna – a central figure within the management of Brothers of Italy – had visited her. “We’re here to represent legality and make people realise that you need to report criminal incidents and be on the side of the state and not the mafia,” said Ciardo.View image in fullscreenEnrica Ciardo said she was apolitical but was at the event ‘to represent legality’.Photograph: Chris Warde-JonesAtreju, which ends with a speech by Meloni on Sunday, is taking place during the same week Italy’s civic health rating was downgraded to “obstructed” by Civicus, a non-profit that monitors civic freedoms in 198 countries. The downgrade was provoked by factors including the government’s security bill, which ramped up penalties for non-violent protest and expanded police powers, and the allegedstate-sanctioned spying of critics. France and Germany were also downgraded amid a global trend in the erosion of civil rights.View image in fullscreenAnna Maria Bernini, the university and research minister, was heckled by students protesting against a reform during her speech.Photograph: Chris Warde-JonesWith the Christmas hit It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year playing on the Brothers of Italy radio, a discussion about education in a small marquee tent became heated when Anna Maria Bernini, the minister for university and research, was heckled by a group of students protesting against a reform. She invited them to debate “for a few minutes” before berating them as “poor communists”. Security then removed the students and called the police.View image in fullscreenThe student hecklers – ‘poor communists’, said Bernini – were removed by security.Photograph: Chris Warde-JonesStaff from the Brothers of Italy press office have also kept a close watch over journalists visiting Atreju.Sofia Ventura, a politics professor at the University of Bologna, said the festival was “there to remind us that Meloni always returns to her roots”, while Francesco Galietti, the founder of Policy Sonar, a political consultancy in Rome, described it as “Meloni’s own Woodstock”, adding that it provided a useful platform to show herself as “the great convener”.“Her party has long been accused of being into faction wars, and that’s still the case, of course,” Galietti added. “But she wants to show that despite all differences, some sort of dialogue can take place, at least once a year.”Close to a huge Christmas tree decorated in the colours of the Italian flag was a cut-out of Meloni mocking her “communist” opponents.Explore more on these topicsBrothers of ItalyGiorgia MeloniThe far rightItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said if the changes are confirmed next week, it would “keep millions of European families stuck driving dirtier and more expensive petrol cars for longer”. Having hybrid cars as a continued option would merely delay the switch to electric vehicles (EVs), he added.Somecar manufacturers, including Volvo and Polestar, have attacked those calling for a softening of the 2035 cutoff for traditional combustion engines, arguing it would just give further advantage to Chinese rivals.Weber said the rule change would be an important signal “to the entire automotive industry and secures tens of thousands of industrial jobs”, reflecting concerns over the future of one of Europe’s most important industries.He suggested the EU would pave the way for the continued sale of plug-in hybrid cars, including a future generation of powerful hybrids with long ranges, but with backup combustion engines for long journeys, for example, more than 373 miles (600km).“For new registrations from 2035 onwards, a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions will now be mandatory for car manufacturers’ fleet targets, instead of 100%,” Weber told Bild.A European Commission spokesperson, Paula Pinho, said on Friday that the 2035 deadline was “still being discussed”. She added that the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, had already said several times that that there was a clear demand for “more flexibility on the CO2 targets”.Volkswagen, Stellantis, Renault, Mercedes-Benz and BMW have argued in favour of dropping the ban, arguing that consumers are not taking up EVs in the numbers anticipated when the 2035 date was approved in 2022.According to reports, the EU will also propose a package of measures to incentivise Europeans to make and buy small EVs as part of a new push to dent the growing presence of Chinese electric cars in the bloc.Incentives for a “made in Europe” small EV would take inspiration from Japan, which offers significant breaks including lower insurance and car tax for those who own electric kei cars, a category of small, lightweight vehicles notable for their boxy appearance.Norway, which has the highest take-up of electric vehicles in Europe, drove adoption of the zero-emission cars with VAT and purchase tax exemptions along with 50% road toll fees.It has meant more than90% of all new cars sold in 2025 were electric, in extraordinary contrast to southern Europe where a lack of infrastructure and incentives has led to a slow take-up of EVs.In Norway almost 30% of all cars are now electric, compared with Italy where numbers are growing, but still account for only 12% of the market, according to figures for November.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryEuropean UnionGermanyEuropeManufacturing sectornewsShareReuse this content"

At his memorial, human rights activists gathered to protest against what they view as a suspicious and potentially state-linked killing.”Officials in Iran’s Razavi Khorasan province said Alikordi suffered a heart attack, but a tightening security crackdown that coincided with his death has raised questions about its circumstances. More than 80 lawyers have signed a statement demanding more information.“Alikordi was a prominent figure among Iran’s community of human rights defenders,” the New York-basedCenter for Human Rights in Iransaid on Thursday. “Over the past several years, he had been repeatedly arrested, harassed and threatened by security and judicial forces.”Mohammadi’s family members said security and police forces used teargas and violence to disperse people who had gathered for Alikordi’s memorial. Speaking from Paris, Mohammadi’s husband, Taghi Rahmani, told the Guardian he was worried not only for his wife but also for the other rights activists arrested at the same time.Rahmani described the arrest as part of an escalating strategy by the Iranian authorities to suppress dissent. “This is a targeted attack on democracy and the right to freedom of expression,” he said.Mohammadi’s children, Ali and Kiana, said they were also worried for their mother and the other activists. “She had a surgery just a year ago and many others arrested have also been fighting medical conditions,” Ali told the Guardian. “She was arrested two hours ago and we still don’t know where my mother is.“These people don’t belong in the prison.”Footage from the memorial ceremony showed Mohammadi at a microphone, calling out to the crowd and starting a chant in the name ofMajidreza Rahnavard, who was publicly hangedby the Iranian authorities in 2022.There was no immediate comment from Iran over its detention of Mohammadi and it was not clear whether authorities would return her to prison to serve the rest of her term. Supporters had cautioned for months she was at risk of being put back in jail.Hasan Hosseini, the city governor of Mashhad, said prosecutors ordered security officials to temporarily detain some participants at the ceremony over the chanting of “norm-breaking” slogans, Iranian state television reported. Hosseini described the detentions as preventive to protect those there from others in the crowd.Before her release last December, Mohammadi had been imprisoned since November 2021 for convictions relating to her campaign against capital punishment andthe obligation for women in Iran to wear the hijab.Her supporters say she suffered multiple heart attacks in prison before undergoing emergency surgery in 2022. Late last year, her lawyer said doctors had found a bone lesion they feared could be cancerous and which was later removed.“Her health could deteriorate very quickly under these conditions,” Rahmani said. “The repression inside the mosque today was carried out with extreme brutality. Teargas was fired, and Narges and other activists were beaten even though they have serious health issues.”Mohammadi’s sentence was supposed to be suspended for three weeks when she was released last year, but her time out of prison lengthened, possibly because of pressure from activists and western powers. She remained free even during the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.She kept up her activism with public protests and international media appearances, including demonstrating at one point in front of Evin prison, the notorious facility in Tehran where she was held.Chirinne Ardakani, Mohammadi’s Paris-based lawyer, said: “I am calling for the immediate release of my client, as well as of all the human rights activists who have been arbitrarily detained alongside her. I also reiterate my client’s demand that truth and justice be established regarding the suspicious circumstances surrounding Alikordi’s death, for which we have reason to believe the state bears responsibility.”Mohammadi’s family said they did not know in whose custody she was being held, with Ali adding: “My mother could be in the custody of the Revolutionary Guards or the security forces or police. We don’t know anything.”Rahmani said: “We urge the western media to continue following events in Iran and to please keep reporting.”Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIranHuman rightsNobel peace prizeActivismMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Minutes later, the asylum seeker fromAfghanistanwas cuffed and driven to a detention center.In New York, another Afghan asylum seeker was detained after complying with a request from immigration authorities to report to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office. In northern California –hometo one of the largest Afghan immigrant communities in the US – attorneys said nearly two dozen Afghan asylum seekers had been arrested – either out in the community, or at check-ins over the past two weeks.Most of the Afghan asylum seekers who’ve been detained had requested asylum at the US-Mexico border over the last two years, attorneys said. Others have entered underOperation Allies Welcome– a Biden-era program to help resettle Afghans fleeing the Taliban following the US’s withdrawal of the US from their country in 2021. Many had been granted humanitarian parole – a temporary legal status that allowed them to live and work in the US while their asylum claims were processed.The recent arrests “have created a huge chilling effect,” said Shala Gafary, managing director of the Afghan Legal Assistance program at Human Rights First. “People just don’t feel safe to leave their home. People are asking all the time what the process is for going to Canada, or going to another country.”In the two weeks after an Afghan man was accused of shooting two national guard members, theTrump administrationannounced major policy changes – radically restricting legal pathways to immigration by pausing asylum decisions for nearly 1.5m people, and halting the processing of applications for green cards, citizenship, or asylum from immigrants from 19 countries.Despite these policy changes, asylum seekers with removal orders making a case to remain in the US in the justice department immigration courts are still entitled to hearings.But, in recent weeks, ICE appears to be increasingly arresting Afghans awaiting hearings – forcing them to remain detained until their cases are decided.Many of those arrested had been complying with requirements to check in with ICE regularly, or wear electronic monitoring devices, attorneys said, and did not have any criminal histories, their attorneys said.“Clients have expressed to me that they’re feeling deeply unsettled and very fearful of what may happen to them next,” said Elora Mukherjee, director of Columbia Law School’s Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, whose Afghan client – an Afghan asylum seeker – was detained after complying with a request to report to ICE offices in New York City.“Without any notice or warning, he was cuffed. He was completely shocked and didn’t understand what was happening. And then for some period of time, we didn’t know where he was. His family didn’t know where he was.”Eventually, Mukherjee said, she was able to figure out he’d been transferred to a detention facility in New Jersey. Neither she nor her client have received any explanation as to why he was arrested, she said.The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.Amir, who was arrested in Bloomington, hasn’t been told why he was arrested either, his brother-in-law Shamsullah said. “The big question for our family is: for what reason was he arrested? He didn’t have a speeding ticket, anything.” The Guardian is not using their full names in order to protect their privacy and safety.Rearview camera footage from Amir’s car, reviewed by the Guardian, captured three agents wearing FBI vests approaching his vehicle from behind. “You don’t have lawful status to be here. Your visa expired,” an agent told him.Amir, who was in the car with his mother-in-law, repeatedly asked the agents if he could call his lawyer. “I’m going to let you call them,” one agent told him, before they cuffed his hands behind his back. He wasn’t allowed to call his lawyer on the way, nor was he able to speak with his wife. An agent took his mother-in-law, who couldn’t drive, back to her home.Amir, who had spoken with the Guardian last week prior to his detention, had fled Afghanistan – where he had been detained by the Taliban due to his family ties to the former government – a year and a half ago. He entered the US via the southern border, using the now defunctCBP One appto schedule an appointment with an immigration officer, and was granted humanitarian parole. He applied for asylum in December last year.After receiving his work permits in the US, the former electrical engineer had been working in a cafeteria by day and as ride-share driver in the evenings. He had been wearing an ankle monitor as required by ICE.His detention came as a shock to his family and for the broader Afghan community in Bloomington. “People call me and they ask me: what should we do, what happened?” Shamsullah said. “I tell them I don’t know. I don’t know what we should do.” Amir’s wife, who is pregnant, has been especially struggling, he added.If he were to return to Afghanistan, the family fears, Amir would be immediately detained. The family is also part of the Hazara Shia minority in Afghanistan, a group that has faced escalating violence and persecution since 2021. “There is no safe place for us in Afghanistan,” Amir told the Guardian last week. “The Taliban without any reason, they arrest people and they kill people.”Attorneys said they were often at a loss for what to tell clients, many who have fled political prosecution, torture and threats on their lives in Afghanistan after the Taliban retook the country in 2021. “They are afraid, even though they have complied with every provision of US law, even though they have extremely strong cases and we have extensive documentation of their past persecution, whether through medical evaluations or mental health evaluations or photographs of their scars and their burns and other harms that they’ve experienced.”Attorneys told the Guardian they are still unclear on how various policy changes will play out, if the administration will try to terminate the legal status for Afghans with humanitarian parole, or how long the pause on processing various immigration petitions will last.“The honest answer is, I do not know, and the administration has not indicated what’s going to happen to those cases,” said Gregory Chen is Senior Director of Government Relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA). “The administration has used terms such as indefinite pause, which is, of course, a contradictory oxymoron.”The arrests and other policy changes have sparked panic, said Wahida Noorzad, an immigration attorney in the Bay Area who has seen two clients arrested and detained at theCalifornia City detention center, in the high desert east of Los Angeles. A third Afghan client was detained four weeks ago, prior to the shooting on 26 November.Noorzad – who herself is Afghan American – said she has started receiving calls from across the region and the US, because she is one of the few immigration attorneys who speaks Dari. “I have many clients that are Afghan in the court system. I don’t know if they’re all going to be picked up,” she said.Already, she added, it is proving challenging for her to help detained clients who have been transferred to the major ICE detention facility in California city, more than 5 hours drive away from her offices in the Bay Area. It’s also unclear when her detained clients will receive court dates to challenge their detention, and assess their asylum claims, given that about 90 immigration judges have been fired this year and a ballooning immigration courtbacklong.For individual attorneys like Noorzad, filing federal habeas corpus petitions to challenge clients’ detention is also logistically challenging and prohibitively expensive.“I still try to give my clients hope that they’ll hopefully win their cases eventually,” she said. “Because they are really in danger. Nobody leaves home unless they are really fearful.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Also there are 68 wounded and will be more and more.”The hospital in Rakhine’s Mrauk U township was struck late on Wednesday by bombs dropped by a military aircraft, said Khine Thu Kha, a spokesperson for the Arakan Army, which is battling the ruling junta along parts of the coastal state.“The Mrauk U General Hospital was completely destroyed,” Khine Thu Kha told Reuters news agency. “The high number of casualties occurred because the hospital took a direct hit.”A junta spokesperson did not respond to calls for comment.View image in fullscreenA mourner reacts as bodies are laid out at a cemetery before their burial following a Myanmar military air strike in Mrauk U in western Rakhine state on 11 December 2025.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesUN human rights chief Volker Turk said such attacks may amount to a war crime and called for an investigation. A spokesperson for the US state department called the reports “disturbing” and said the military government should cease violence against civilians.Local media reports said dozens had been killed in the hospital strike, with photographs from the scene showing the shattered remains of the health facility, and shrouded bodies visible on the ground outside the facility after the attack. The Guardian could not immediately verify the images.Soon after he heard the sound of explosions on Wednesday night, a 23-year-old resident of Mrauk U said he rushed to the scene.“When I arrived, the hospital was on fire,” he told Reuters, asking not to be named because of security concerns. “I saw many bodies lying around and many injured people.”The 300-bed hospital was overflowing with patients at the time of the strike, said aid worker Wai Hun Aung, as most healthcare services across swathes of Rakhine state have been suspended amid the ongoing fighting.View image in fullscreenIn this aerial photo provided by Wai Hun Aung, damaged buildings are seen at the hospital that was allegedly hit by a military air strike in Mrauk-U township in Rakhine state, Myanmar, Thursday, 11 Dec., 2025.Photograph: Wai Hun Aung/APThe junta has increased airstrikes year-on-year since the start of Myanmar’s civil war, conflict monitors say, after seizing power in a 2021 coup that ended a decade-long democratic experiment.The military hasset polls starting 28 December– touting the vote as an off-ramp to fighting – but rebels have vowed to block it from territory they control, which the junta is battling to claw back.Rakhine state is controlled almost in its entirety by the Arakan Army (AA) – an ethnic minority separatist force active long before the military staged a coup toppling the civilian government of democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Myanmar civil war: a quick guide to the conflictRead moreThe AA has emerged as one of the most powerful opposition groups in the civil war ravaging Myanmar, alongside other ethnic minority fighters and pro-democracy partisans who took up arms after the coup.Scattered rebels initially struggled to make headway before a trio of groups led a joint offensive starting in 2023, back-footing the military and prompting it to bolster its ranks with conscripted troops.The AA was a key participant in the so-called “Three Brotherhood Alliance” but its two other factions this year agreed to Chinese-brokered truces, leaving it as the last one standing.While the military-run election has been widely criticised by monitors including the United Nations, Beijing has emerged as a key backer saying it should “restore social stability” to its neighbour.The AA has proven a powerful adversary for the junta and now controls all but three of Rakhine’s 17 townships, according to conflict monitors.But the group’s ambitions are largely limited to their Rakhine homeland, hemmed in by the coast of the Bay of Bengal and jungle-clad mountains to the north.The group has also been accused of atrocities including against the mostly MuslimRohingya ethnic minorityfrom the region.With Agence France-Presse and ReutersExplore more on these topicsMyanmarSouth and central AsiaRohingyanewsShareReuse this content"

His medical team will assess how much longer he will require treatment to protect and prioritise his continued recovery.In a prerecorded video message on Friday for Channel 4’s Stand Up toCancernight, Charles spoke of how early detection had transformed his own journey and how early diagnosis could give “invaluable time to medical teams – and, to their patients, the precious gift of hope”.Without disclosing what type of cancer he has, Charles said: “Today, I am able to share with you the good news that thanks to early diagnosis, effective intervention and adherence to ‘doctors’ orders’, my own schedule of cancer treatment can be reduced in the new year.“This milestone is both a personal blessing and a testimony to the remarkable advances that have been made in cancer care in recent years; testimony that I hope may give encouragement to the 50% of us who will be diagnosed with the illness at some point in our lives.”Speaking of the importance of early diagnosis, he said: “I know, too, what a difference it has made in my own case, enabling me to continue leading a full and active life, even while undergoing treatment.”But he expressed concern that at least 9 million people in the UK were not up to date with the cancer screenings available to them.He was therefore “encouraged” to learn about a newnational screening checker, launched earlier this month, which shows who is eligible for existing breast, bowel and cervical cancer screening programmes.A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: “His majesty has responded exceptionally well to treatment and his doctors advise that ongoing measures will now move into a precautionary phase. This position will be continuously monitored and reviewed to protect and prioritise his continued recovery.“As the king has said, this milestone on his recovery journey is ‘a great personal blessing’.”Charles is said to remain profoundly grateful to all those involved in caring for patients, in particular to his own medical team. “He sends his particular good wishes to all those affected by cancer and will continue to hold them and their loved ones in his thoughts and prayers,” said the spokesperson.The king was approached to lend support to the online screening tool and thought it a “fitting moment to provide a brief update on the positive trajectory of his own continued recovery”.The spokesperson said: “The king has taken great comfort and encouragement from being able to continue leading a full and active life throughout his treatment, while always heeding the advice of his medical team. His ability to uphold all of his state duties, and to continue with public engagements and overseas tours, has helped greatly with the positive mindset that, as many families will know, is such a vital part of the recovery journey.“The advice from cancer experts is that, in his determination to support the whole cancer community, it is preferable that his majesty does not address his own specific condition but rather speaks to those affected by all forms of the disease.”The king’s cancer diagnosis was announced in February 2024 as he was treated for benign prostate enlargement, though the palace has confirmed he does not have prostate cancer. His message should not be interpreted as a view on therecent debate over a national screening programmefor prostate cancer, it is understood, and the palace consulted the government before issuing the message.The prime minister said he was “glad” the king’s cancer treatment was to be reduced.In a post on social media, Keir Starmer said: “A powerful message from His Majesty The King. I know I speak for the entire country when I say how glad I am that his cancer treatment will be reduced in the new year. Early cancer screening saves lives.”The screening checker has been developed by Cancer Research UK and Channel 4 for the Stand Up to Cancer campaign to help people understand which NHS cancer screening programmes they are eligible for.Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, of which Charles is patron, said: “We know that when public figures speak openly about their cancer diagnosis, it can prompt others to check in on their health and speak to a GP if something is worrying them. We wish his majesty well with his continued recovery.”Explore more on these topicsKing Charles IIICancerHealthMonarchyCancer researchnewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, we were so much better off under the Tories, you could get a meeting, they engaged with you. This whole process has been incredibly haphazard.”Another figure in the sector noted that after the murder of Sarah Everard, the Conservative government reopened a public consultation. “We saw more senior ministers and had more contact with the secretary of state under the last government,” they said. “Ministers like Alex Davies-Jones andJess Phillipshave clearly worked hard on this, but it feels the machine has worked against them.”The Guardian view on policing: the lesson of Sarah Everard’s murder is that a culture of impunity must be stamped out | EditorialRead moreFurther concern is that the publication of the strategy, which is expected just before parliament closes for the Christmas recess, will be lost. “They’ve had 18 months and now they’re scrabbling around in the last week of parliament. It just feels like an afterthought,” said one source. “It hasn’t felt like it’s been a properly considered process where they’ve really sought the expertise in a considered way. It’s been slightly haphazard.”On Tuesday Karen Bradley, the chair of the home affairs committee,wrote to Phillips and Davies-Jonesto complain that “there has been poor engagement and transparency with VAWG stakeholders throughout the development of the VAWG strategy”. She noted that the VAWG advisory board – which contained experts to guide policy – had met only twice in person and once online and its role had been limited.Andrea Simon, the director of the End Violence Against Women and Girls coalition, said there had been positive moves from the government, including£550m of funding for victim support, and proposed law changes toimprove the fair treatment of victims in rape trialsand bandepictions of strangulation in pornography. She called on the government to commit to a monitoring and evaluation structure for the strategy, to ensure accountability.“Without that, the government will potentially fall foul of the lack of oversight we’ve seen in previous, underresourced strategies,” she said. “There has been a lot of rhetoric about commitment to halving VAWG through a cross-government approach, but that won’t stand up unless they are willing to be open, transparent, and bring in external scrutiny.”While stories were emerging about the strategy in the press, a different figure said a full document had not been shared with even a small number of trusted parties. “You have to ask how a cross-governmental, strong strategy is being built if none of the experts are at the table,” they said.Karen Ingala Smith, a co-founder of the Femicide Census, said it was “disappointed” not to have been invited to join the VAWG advisory board, adding that the two wider meetings she or her co-founder, Clarrie O’Callaghan, had attended felt like “box-ticking” exercises.“It felt like it wouldn’t have mattered what we said, it wasn’t going to make any difference to what was written,” she said. “It felt perfunctory and tokenistic.”For the past decade the Femicide Census has provided Phillips with the names of all women killed by men over a year for her toread out in parliament near International Women’s Day. The VAWG minister told the Guardian last year thatending the “scourge of femicide”would be a “fundamental part” of the government’s promise to drastically reduce violence against women and girls. “But it has been quiet since then, and we are concerned that promise will be watered down,” said Ingala Smith.A government spokesperson said: “It is our mission to halve violence against women and girls within the next decade. This requires a total transformation across government.“Our violence against women and girls strategy does exactly that. It is targeted at preventing these awful crimes, tackling perpetrators so they can’t offend again, and helping victims to get justice.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsViolence against women and girlsJess PhillipsLabourConservativesnewsShareReuse this content"

Every child has the right to grow up safe from harm but for these girls their childhood was snatched from them in the cruellest of ways.”A judge on Friday sentenced the four Romanian men and one Albanian man to jail terms of between 18 months and 14 years.The men are:Bogdan Gugiuman, 44, of Gateshead, who was found guilty of three counts of rape, and supplying a class A drug. He was jailed for 14 years.Codrin Dura, 27, of Gateshead, who was found guilty of four counts of rape, four counts of sexual activity with a child, blackmail, attempted rape, serious sexual assault, supplying a class A drug, and arranging or facilitating commission of a child sex offence. He was jailed for 13 years.Klaudio Aleksiu, 28, of Windsor, who was found guilty of rape. He was jailed for six years.Leonard Paun, 23, of Gateshead, who was found guilty of five counts of rape, two counts of arranging or facilitating commission of a child sex offence, sexual activity with a child, sexual assault, supplying a class A drug, distributing photos of a child. He was jailed for five years and one month.Stefan Ciuraru, 22, of Gateshead, who was found guilty of four counts of sexual assault, sexual activity with a child, and causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. He was jailed for 18 months, given his youth at the time of the offending.Barr said police began investigating after receiving complaints in April and May 2019 from two girls who did not know each other.He said a complex abuse inquiry was launched in July that year as it became apparent that there was “a group of males known to each other” who were offending against several victims.A significant effort was made to gain the confidence of victims, Barr said. “The offending ranged from sexual assaults, like touching, through to the most serious offences of rape, including rapes by multiple people against the same victim,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCrimeRape and sexual assaultNorth of EnglandNewcastlenewsShareReuse this content"

The age of two-party politics is dead.”Meanwhile, the Times reported that, according to internal figures, the Labour party’s paid-up membership had fallen below 250,000.Mainstream, the centre-left group backed by Andy Burnham, said the Labour’s “plummeting membership” showed that its “top-down model has failed”.Its interim council said in a statement: “To transform Britain and defeat the far-right, Labour needs a grassroots movement in every community. The answer is to democratise, open up, and empower members. A vibrant, member-powered Labour party is the only way to win – for our party and the country.”Labour does not publish a running tally of its membership figures, disclosing them only once a year as part of its annual reporting.Party accounts published in August showed in the year ending December 2024 it had 333,235 members, down from 370,450 at the end of 2023.The numbers have fallen over consecutive years from a high of more than 500,000 under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.A Labour party spokesperson said: “Our membership figures are published in our annual report. We do not give a running commentary on them throughout the year.”The apparent increasing number of membership contributions to Reform will boost its electoral war chest alongside a recent spate of donations.The party received a £9m donation in August from the Thailand-based businessman Christopher Harborne, Electoral Commission records recently revealed. The sum was the biggest single donation in modern history to a political party from a living person.Farage insisted Harborne wanted “nothing in return” for the donation and said he was “very, very comfortable and confident” in the source of the cash.The Greens haveseen their membership swell fromabout 70,000 to more than 180,000 since the party’s new leader, Zack Polanski, was elected in September.This suggests the Greens have overtaken theConservatives, whose membership numbers have dwindled in recent years and now stand at about 123,000.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsReform UKNigel FarageKemi BadenochKeir StarmerGreen partyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

It had already been reissued once before, in 2016, as the Snow Queen Edition. Nevertheless, the Fully Wrapped version counts as a new album in chart terms, and so continues a non-consecutive run of No 1s that began in 1988, when Minogue’s self-titled debut spent six weeks at the top.Overtaking Abba, Coldplay, Michael Jackson, Elton John and Queen in the chart-topper list, she also draws level with Rod Stewart and U2, but is still some way off joint leaders the Beatles and Robbie Williams, who both have 15 No 1 albums to their names. Williams will be hoping to become the all-time leader in February with the release of his forthcoming studio album, Britpop.Minogue is also in the singles chart this week with Xmas, one of the retailer Amazon’s now yearly exclusive Christmas songs. Xmas is at No 16, though will undoubtedly rise during next week’s race for the Christmas No 1 as CD and vinyl editions are released today, sales of which contribute greatly to chart positions in the streaming era.Taking an early lead in the race is Wham!’s Last Christmas, which is this week’s No 1 single, displacing Taylor Swift’s The Fate of Ophelia, which spent seven non-consecutive weeks at the top. Last Christmas never made it to No 1 when it was first released in 1984, but finally reached the top in January 2021, and has topped the chart each year since, becoming the Christmas No 1 for the past two years.Its biggest annual rival in the nation’s festive affections, Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas Is You, is at No 3 this week, while Brenda Lee’s Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree is at No 4. Kelly Clarkson’s Underneath the Tree underlines its status as the most popular new-school Christmas song, getting its first Top 5 placing since its 2013 release. There are 20 Christmas songs overall in the Top 40.But these classics will have new rivals for the Christmas No 1 next week, as a number of charity and novelty singles enter the race. Together for Palestine, the humanitarian aid projecthelmed by Brian Enoand others, has released Lullaby, featuring Palestinian artists alongside British stars including Celeste and Neneh Cherry.Line of Duty actor Vicky McClure has teamed with jacket potato brand SpudBros for Brighter Than the Night, to raise money for her charity Our Dementia Choir, while Bob the Drag Queen has recorded Giant Armadillo to support conservation efforts for the armoured mammal, and home care service Visiting Angels has overseen a cover of Robbie Williams’ Angels to benefit care workers.Less profoundly, Denise Welch has released Slayyy Bells, a tie-in with confectionary brand Celebrations, in which the Loose Women star and “hun” icon is paired with a Charli xcx-esque trashy dance track.But British pop singer Raye could cause an upset with her un-Christmassy tale of singleton frustration Where Is My Husband?, which is at No 2 this week. If so, it would be the first non-festive or charity song to be Christmas No 1 since Ed Sheeran’s Perfect in 2017.The UK Christmas No 1 will be announced at 4pm on Friday 19 December.Explore more on these topicsKylie MinogueUK chartsPop and rockChristmasnewsShareReuse this content"

According toCNN, the criminal charges involve 54 specifications of “indecent visual recording” and other related offenses concerning 44 identified victims.While the military’s case centers on the alleged recordings, the updated civil suit goes further, accusing McGraw of assault, sexual assault and battery underTexaslaw. The filing claims he “intentionally and knowingly made harmful and offensive physical contact” during gynecological exams. McGraw treated patients at Fort Hood beginning in 2023.One active-duty soldier described an encounter during a rape-kit examination in which she suspects McGraw took photos of her.“During that deeply vulnerable procedure, he was constantly on his phone while between her legs,” the lawsuit states. The woman now believes he used his phone to photograph her during the exam.The complaint also says that McGraw “failed to document in her medical records that a rape kit had ever been performed”. Prosecutors who subsequently pressed her case in criminal court “lacked clear forensic documentation, and her assailant was ultimately acquitted”, the complaint contends.“McGraw’s misconduct in this setting did not merely fail to protect a victim of sexual violence,” the filing adds. “It actively undermined her access to justice and allowed her perpetrator to escape accountability.”Legal experts and advocacy groups told theWashington Postthe case may test whether recent Pentagon reforms to address sexual misconduct and support survivors are working as intended.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryUS crimeTexasWomennewsShareReuse this content"

The batch also includes more photographs of the yellow dentist’s office that was featured in a similar release of images and videos by the committee on 3 December, as well as a bathroom, a “Trumpkin” (a pumpkin decorated as Donald Trump), and Epstein in a bathtub.As Epstein files release looms, questions abound on what happens next: ‘Possibilities are endless’Read moreThree of the images feature Trump’s former political adviserSteve Bannon– two of them with Epstein, and one with Allen in a social setting.The photographs were released without context or captions, but according to Robert Garcia, the California Democrat and ranking member of the oversight committee, they raise more questions about Epstein’s connections to wealthy individuals.“It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors ofJeffrey Epsteinand his powerful friends,” he said in a statement.“These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth.”The White House responded to the release in a statement accusing Democrats of selectively “cherry-picking” the photographs for political purposes and “to try and create a false narrative”.“The Democrat hoax against President Trump has been repeatedly debunked,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said, insisting that “the Trump administration has done more for Epstein’s victims than Democrats ever have by repeatedly calling for transparency, releasing thousands of pages of documents, and calling for further investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends.”A bill to release all files held by the government in relation to Epsteinpassed the House and Senate last monthdespite strong opposition from Trump. The justice department has until 19 December to comply. Hundreds of thousands of documents are expected to be released. A federal judge alsoruled on Tuesdaythat the department can publicly release investigative materials from a sex-trafficking case againstGhislaine Maxwell,Epstein’s longtime confidante, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence over the charges.Trump features in three of the 19 images initially released on Friday. In one, he is photographed with six women, some in Hawaii dress, and whose faces are blacked out. In the second, he is seen alongside Epstein listening to a woman with blond hair who appears to be sharing a joke. In the third, apparently taken aboard an aircraft, he is sitting alongside another woman with longer blond hair, and whose face is also blacked out.View image in fullscreenJeffrey Epstein and Woody Allen in a partially redacted photo released by House oversight Democrats.Photograph: House oversight DemocratsThe president’s face in cartoon form, and the words “I’m huuuuge”, appear in another image on square packets with a sign advertising a “Trump condom” for $4.50. The novelty items wereon saleprior to Trump’s first election win in 2016, and earned a place in the Smithsonian Institute’spolitical satire collection.Trump wasclose friends with Epstein for 15 years, and called him “a terrific guy”, before insisting he fell out with him and booted him as a member of his private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.The new photograph of the former Prince Andrew, meanwhile, shows him in a business suit alongside Gates. Cropped from the picture released Friday is King Charles III, then the Prince of Wales, who was in the original news wire photograph taken at a business summit in London in 2018. Mountbatten-Windsor wasstripped of his royal status and titlesin October over his dealings with Epstein.Epstein does not appear in the original or cropped versions, and there is no explanation why the photograph was part of the Epstein estate.The image of Clinton, which the former president looks to have autographed, shows him posing next to Epstein and Maxwell, whowas convictedin part for procuring teenage girls for Epstein and his associates to abuse.A collection of sex toys, including restraints, a catalog and a guide to the Japanese art of shibari (a form of bondage), appear in three more. Epstein was accused of hosting sex parties for clients at his homes in New York, Florida and at his private Caribbean island retreat, Little Saint James in the US Virgin Islands.The former treasury secretary Larry Summers and Epstein’s former lawyer Alan Dershowitz, appear in two other images, the latter in a previously published news wire photograph from 2004.The photograph of British billionaire Branson on a beach with Epstein also features Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway, according to the Boston Globe, which said Kamen did not return a request for comment.An inquiry to Branson’s office was not immediately returned.NBC Newsreported no immediate response from any of the unidentifiable individuals in the photographs, all of whom have denied wrongdoing, the outlet said.In a statement, the Democratic members of the House oversight and government reform committee promised that more photographs would be released in the coming days from the batch it had just received from the Epstein estate.“This latest production contains over 95,000 photos, including images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein,” it said.“Images also include thousands of photographs of women and Epstein properties. Committee Democrats are reviewing the full set of photos and will continue to release photos to the public in the days and weeks ahead. Committee Democrats are committed to protecting the identities of the survivors.”A statement from the committee’s Republican majority replicated the accusations in the White House statement of “cherry-picking” and selectively censoring the photographs.“Democrats’ hoax against President Trump has been completely debunked. Nothing in the documents we’ve received shows any wrongdoing. Ranking Member Robert Garcia and Oversight Democrats should be ashamed of this disgusting behavior of putting politics above justice for the survivors,” it said.Friday’s release is the latest of a number of similar recent events. Last week several still images and videos were publishedof Epstein’s Caribbean island, including bedrooms, a living room, what appeared to be a dentist’s office, an office or library, and a chalkboard on which several unexplained words were written, such as “fin”, “intellectual”, “deception” and “power”.The New York Timesreportedthat Epstein’s last girlfriend was a dentist who shared an office with one of his shell companies.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

He has repeatedly defied Trump’s demands for drastic cuts to interest rates, prompting the president to launch a string of public attacks.Fed cuts interest rates by a quarter point amid apparent split over US economyRead moreTrump is also considering his adviser Kevin Hassett, who leads the National Economic Council, as a potential chair of the Fed.“I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They’re both – I think the two Kevins are great,” the presidenttold the Wall Street Journalon Friday. “I think there are a couple of other people that are great.”He is expected to soon nominate a candidate to lead the Fed, having lambasted the central bank’s policymakers for their cautious approach to cutting rates since return to office in January – and has eventried to fire a member of the central bank’s rate-setting policy committee.Warsh “thinks you have to lower interest rates,” Trump claimed in the interview, in line with the views he has expressed himself for months. “And so does everybody else that I’ve talked to.”Trump argued that the next Fed chair should listen to him on the future direction of rates. “Typically, that’s not done anymore,” he acknowledged to the Wall Street Journal. “It should be done.”“It doesn’t mean – I don’t think he should do exactly what we say,” Trump added. “But certainly we’re – I’m a smart voice and should be listened to.”Earlier this week, the Fedcut rates by a quarter pointfor the third time this year. But policymakers signaled their reluctance to cut more than once next year, amid heightened uncertainty around the direction of the economy.In a press conference on Wednesday, Powell said the Fed was trying to balance “significant downside risks” in the jobs market with inflationary pressures from Trump’s tariffs that are “pretty clear to see”.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveDonald TrumpTrump administrationJerome PowellUS economyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The basin is the lowest point in North America, according to theNational Park Service.Repeated storms from September through November filled the flat with runoff, forming a thin layer of water. This year’s version is smaller and shallower than the one seen two years prior, when remnants of Hurricane Hilary drenched the area – and briefly even made it possible to kayak there.The park received in just two monthsmore precipitationthan it usually does in an entire year. From September to November, 2.41in of rain fell in Death Valley, according to the National Weather Service. November alone brought 1.76in, surpassing the 1923 record of 1.7in.Between 128,000 and 186,000 years ago, glaciers blanketed the Sierra Nevada. Meltwater from those ice sheets fed rivers that drained into a massive valley lake, the original Lake Manly, which once stretched nearly 100 miles (160km) long.Today, the basin is ordinarily bone-dry, its surface cracked by sun and wind. But the recent deluge transformed it once again, offering visitors a glimpse of how the desert might have looked millennia ago.Rock star: Sasha DiGiulian on making history with a ‘crazy, audacious’ climb of El CapitánRead moreExperts have also warned of the broader environmental shifts taking place in Death Valley. When temperatures in recent years climbed near 130F (54.4C), so-calledheat touristsflocked to experience the extreme conditions first-hand. The rising heat has prompted concerns about the risks posed to native plants, birds and wildlife.In August 2023, more than 2in of rain fell in asingle dayin Death Valley, breaking previous records for rainfall. The flooding washed away trails, causing the park to close until mid-October. In July of that same year, the valley brokeheat recordsby reaching temperatures of 128F (53.3C). The hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth is 134F (56.7C) in July 1913 in the same section of the park.In 2016, a series of storms with heavy rainfall brought a raresuperbloomof millions of wildflowers to Death Valley. The National Park Service says it is still too early to predict whether current conditions could lead to another flourish of yellow flowers.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaNational parksWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

City economists had predicted a 0.1% rise in October.After a fourth consecutive month without growth, economists said the latest snapshot would probably cement aBank of Englandinterest rate cut next week amid fading inflationary pressures, fears over the sluggish outlook, and rising unemployment.The Bank is widely expected to cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.75% when it announces its latest decision on 18 December.“The UK economy has faltered more dramatically than we expected,” said Andrew Wishart, a senior UK economist at Berenberg. “This loss of momentum will bring inflation down more swiftly than we previously anticipated, allowing the BoE to act.”Highlighting caution among businesses and households in the run-up to the chancellor’s tax-raising budget, the ONS said a sharp 0.3% decline in output in Britain’s dominant service sector contributed most to the fall.Much of the decline was driven by a weakness in car sales and broader retail spending, alongside a slump in computer programming and consultancy activities. Construction output fell by 0.6%, while the production sector – which includes manufacturing – rose by 1.1% amid a recovery from the JLR attack that was weaker than hoped for.GDP graphicThe ONS said businesses across all three main sectors of the economy – services, production and construction – reported that they, or their customers, were “waiting for the outcomes of the budget”. The biggest impact was felt by manufacturers, construction companies, wholesalers, computer programmers, real estate firms and employment agencies.Scott Gardner, an investment strategist at JP Morgan Personal Investing, said the chancellor’s budget had a “numbing effect” on the economy. He said: “Budget speculation and uncertainty around potential tax changes dampened the mood among businesses and consumers, leading some to delay key decisions until the budget had been delivered.“With growth now firmly in the slow lane, there is a clear feeling that the economy this year has taken two steps forward and one step back.”Financial markets widely expect the Bank to cut interest rates for a sixth time since last summer at its next policy meeting on Thursday. Threadneedle Street has said Reeves’s policies – including relief on energy bills, prescription charges and fuel duty – could cut headline inflation byas much as half a percentage point next year.Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said the government’s “economic mismanagement” had directly contributed to the weakness in economic growth.A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are determined to defy the forecasts on growth and create good jobs, so everyone is better off, while also helping us invest in better public services.”Over the three months to the end of October, GDP also fell by 0.1%, below City estimates for zero growth over the period.Economic output fell in September afterhackers breaching JLR’s systemsresulted in the country’s second-largest carmaker halting its UK production lines for several weeks.In an incident estimated to have cost the economy at large up to £1.9bn, the halt crippled hundreds of smaller companies in the manufacturer’s supply chain, causing monthly output in the car industry tocollapse by a third.However, the ONS warned there had only been a “small recovery” in output in October as activity rebounded by 9.5%, leaving the industry still 21.8% below the levels seen in August. Overall manufacturing output rose by 0.5%, falling short of City estimates for a 1% recovery from the JLR attack.Sanjay Raja, the chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said the latest monthly fall in overall GDP increased the chances of a drop in fourth-quarter output. “The road to the new year will be bumpy,” he said. “Budget uncertainty combined with weak hiring and rising unemployment fear will likely see spending and investment more subdued to end the year.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsRachel ReevesBudget 2025Bank of EnglandInterest ratesOffice for National StatisticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said if the changes are confirmed next week, it would “keep millions of European families stuck driving dirtier and more expensive petrol cars for longer”. Having hybrid cars as a continued option would merely delay the switch to electric vehicles (EVs), he added.Somecar manufacturers, including Volvo and Polestar, have attacked those calling for a softening of the 2035 cutoff for traditional combustion engines, arguing it would just give further advantage to Chinese rivals.Weber said the rule change would be an important signal “to the entire automotive industry and secures tens of thousands of industrial jobs”, reflecting concerns over the future of one of Europe’s most important industries.He suggested the EU would pave the way for the continued sale of plug-in hybrid cars, including a future generation of powerful hybrids with long ranges, but with backup combustion engines for long journeys, for example, more than 373 miles (600km).“For new registrations from 2035 onwards, a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions will now be mandatory for car manufacturers’ fleet targets, instead of 100%,” Weber told Bild.A European Commission spokesperson, Paula Pinho, said on Friday that the 2035 deadline was “still being discussed”. She added that the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, had already said several times that that there was a clear demand for “more flexibility on the CO2 targets”.Volkswagen, Stellantis, Renault, Mercedes-Benz and BMW have argued in favour of dropping the ban, arguing that consumers are not taking up EVs in the numbers anticipated when the 2035 date was approved in 2022.According to reports, the EU will also propose a package of measures to incentivise Europeans to make and buy small EVs as part of a new push to dent the growing presence of Chinese electric cars in the bloc.Incentives for a “made in Europe” small EV would take inspiration from Japan, which offers significant breaks including lower insurance and car tax for those who own electric kei cars, a category of small, lightweight vehicles notable for their boxy appearance.Norway, which has the highest take-up of electric vehicles in Europe, drove adoption of the zero-emission cars with VAT and purchase tax exemptions along with 50% road toll fees.It has meant more than90% of all new cars sold in 2025 were electric, in extraordinary contrast to southern Europe where a lack of infrastructure and incentives has led to a slow take-up of EVs.In Norway almost 30% of all cars are now electric, compared with Italy where numbers are growing, but still account for only 12% of the market, according to figures for November.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryEuropean UnionGermanyEuropeManufacturing sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Four years after selling Leon, the fast food chain named after his father and founded in 2004 with two friends, he has bought it back with hopes of reviving its fortunes.“In a crisis you need a pilot in full control,” the martial arts fan says, speaking to the Guardian from Leon’s headquarters near London Bridge.He is getting his metaphorical trainers on to “outrun the lion” as he ploughs his efforts and his own money into reviving the troubled chain.The former management consultant bought back Leon for a rumoured £30m-£50m – significantly less than the £100m he sold it for – from the supermarket chain Asda in October, 21 years after the first restaurant opened in Camden. It was a self-funded, debt-free deal that he hopes will turnaround the company he co-founded with his friends Henry Dimbleby, who later became a government food tsar, and the chef Allegra McEvedy. Their original mission was to make seasonal, high-quality fast food available to everyone.Vincent says he now wants to run Leon “as a family business, almost like running your own corner shop”. He says the business will be fuelled by a “founder’s mentality”, pondering problems from the early hours of the morning to late at night.The first step is to renegotiate leases and shrink the group. The plan includes the possible closure of two outlets by the end of January, taking the total number to 50. Leon had 68 outlets at the time of the buyout including 43 directly owned and operated.View image in fullscreenJohn Vincent says he wants to run Leon ‘as a family business’.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianUndera turnaround plan, Leon is shifting out of unprofitable locations and cities such as Brighton and Manchester to concentrate on its owned stores – of which there are now 29 – in London. Franchisees will continue to operate locations in, for example, motorway service stations around the country. Once that shake-up has been achieved, Vincent expects to be back on the expansion trail with plans for as many as 100 UK outlets, mostly in the capital, over the next four years. Overseas franchises and joint ventures in selected overseas cities are also on the cards, he says.Vincent is also rapidly ditching some menu items he feels are not right, such as sandwiches, improving quality with better smoked salmon and thicker slices of halloumi, while inspiring managers to ensure their restaurants are spotlessly clean with rapid service.View image in fullscreenVincent wants to improving quality with thicker slices of halloumi.Photograph: LeonThe team is also developing a new menu to be relaunched in the spring, which aims to bring back old favourites such as the fish finger wrap and new dishes aimed at reviving its healthy and tasty credentials at an affordable price.Vincent has also signed up staff to training in wing tsun, his favoured martial art, to improve coffee-making times “while lowering heart rates”.All of this is daunting in a very tough market for hospitality businesses as cautious consumers cut back on dining out while business costs – from ingredients to business rates, national insurance and labour – are on the rise.Vincent, who at more than six feet tall is built like a rugby player and speaks a mix of new age hippy and Thatcher-era free marketeer, says Leon must stand out from the crowd and ramp up sales if it wants to continue to exist.“The average player in this market is going to go bankrupt,” he says. “The only winners in this space, ultimately will outstrip everyone else on revenue.”He accused Labour of “taxing businesses to extinction” and “creating the opposite of growth.”The survival plan for Leon is to be “massively differentiated”.Leon has to be niche: it can’t be on every high street“Leon has to be niche: it can’t be on every high street. We want to be the best food company in the world but don’t want to be the biggest,” he says.“Every Leon should be magical. I want to be a beacon of what’s possible.”Seemingly the business has been waiting on his return. A side office still contains a dusty framed photo of him and the boardroom still contains its mid-century-meets industrial furnishings as if preserved in aspic.His “glimpses of brilliance” notebook has remained in a cupboard – but unused. Now Vincent and his team are back scribbling positivity missives to each other in the book.View image in fullscreenA Leon restaurant in London’s Spitalfields. Vincent says the chain must stand out from the crowd.Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian“It’s like one of those dreams where you are in your house but it is not your house,” he says. ‘It’s like someone stepped on a butterfly and here we are.”A fan of aphorisms, management theories and self-help book advice, Vincent says some may dismiss such as techniques as “woo woo” but the numbers speak for themselves.He says that until the business was hit by the Covid pandemic it was doing well, with underlying profits on the rise and new outlets opening each year.Since then it has been a different story.It has made a pre-tax loss every year since 2016 – first linked to spending on rapid expansion. Since 2019 it has struggled with a string of problems from rising costs and interest rates to increased competition, Brexit and the Covid pandemic. Sales plummeted to £38m in 2020 from £76.3m in 2019 as high street lockdowns and the shift to working from home took their toll.“It was like knock after knock in a boxing ring,” says co-founder McEvedy, who is no longer formally involved in the business but recently joined a brainstorming session on the new menu.For McEvedy, the biggest blow was Leon’s move away from its original concept of “naturally fast food” that was tasty and healthy.She says it was originally “dial changing about what was possible” led by “three friends that really cared and were really focused on everything from what the loos look like to branding, aprons and the menu”.View image in fullscreenAllegra McEvedy is no longer formally involved with Leon but recently joined a brainstorming session on the new menu.Photograph: Circe Hamilton/Allegra McEvedyMcEvedy says that under Asda “all the points of difference slowly got shaved away”.Sales had recovered to £52.2m by 2022 but that was partly down to continued store openings with the group reaching a peak of 85 stores that year.Leon then got caught up in the difficulties of the owners of Asda – the billionaire Issa brothers and their private equity partner TDR Capital.The brothers’ EG Group, a petrol forecourts operator,bought Leon in 2021, probably with the intention of expanding it across their portfolio.The deal came just months after they invested in Asda in a £6.8bn debt-fuelled deal. After interest rates soared and an apparent falling-out between the brothers Mohsin and Zuber, their investments were restructured.Asdabought out most of the UK division of EG, including Leonand it was then part of a retail group struggling with multiple problems from high debts and falling sales, rising costs, intense IT disruption and heavy competition.Last year Leon’s sales fell almost 4% to £62.5m when it made a pre-tax loss of £8m and store numbers declined to 79, according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House.But Vincent suggests there are no hard feelings.“I can’t blame Asda,” he says. The problem was, he adds, “I didn’t imbue enough understanding in the company of how to sustain itself without me. My job now is to come back and embed a culture of what good looks like.”Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryRestaurantsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It said the lender had been aware that some customers were using personal accounts for business activity, in a breach of its own terms.Nationwide did not offer business accounts at that point and so did not have the right processes in place to monitor potential financial crime risks, the FCA said.This resulted in a case where Nationwide failed to catch a customer using personal current accounts to receive 24 fraudulent Covid furlough payments, totalling £27.3m over 13 months. About £26m of that sum was deposited in only eight days.While HM Revenue and Customs has managed to claw back £26.5m from the fraudster, approximately £800,000 remains unrecovered, leaving taxpayers out of pocket because of Nationwide’s failures.Therese Chambers, a joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: “Nationwide failed to get a proper grip of the financial crime risks lurking within its customer base. It took too long to address its flawed systems and weak controls, meaning red flags were missed with serious consequences.“Building societies and banks have a key role in the fight against financial crime. Firms must remain vigilant in this fight.”The wider failures at Nationwide related to October 2016 to July 2021, when the chief executive was Joe Garner. While Nationwide tried to make improvements, the FCA said it “failed to adequately address those weaknesses in a timely manner”. It was later forced to undertake a large-scale financial crime transformation programme, in July 2021.That transformation continued until summer 2024, during which it launched a £2.9bn takeover of its rival Virgin Money under Garner’s successor, the current Nationwide CEO, Debbie Crosbie.Crosbie has since faced her own controversies, including over a 43% increase in her maximum annual pay to £7m, which board members said reflected her new demands after the takeover. Members of the mutual have labelled the payout an“obscenity”and hypocritical.Crosbie was made a dame in the king’s birthday honours this summer and was appointed the new Women in Finance champion by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, this week.In the case of the customer who took £27.3m in furlough payments, the FCA said Nationwide had failed to block the account despite a number of red flags, including in 2014, when the application listed an office as the customer’s residential address. The customer tried to make changes to their address 11 times; one of the addresses given was also the registered address of 59,666 other companies.The customer tried to apply for 20 current accounts, savings accounts and credit cards, many of which were abandoned or denied. That included in 2019 and 2020, when the name and address was flagged on a fraud network match alert.The same customer went on to fraudulently apply for a number of Covid furlough payments during the pandemic. By the time the tax authorities identified the fraud and secured orders to freeze the account, more than £800,000 had been transferred out and was never recovered.The FCA fine came days after the independent Covid counter-fraud commissioner, Tom Hayhoe,released a final reportshowing that fraud and errors had caused a £10.9bn loss to UK taxpayers during the pandemic.Nationwide said in a statement: “We are sorry that our controls during the period fell below the high standards we expect.” A spokesperson said the building society had identified the issues through its own reviews, voluntarily brought it to the attention to the FCA and “cooperated fully” with the regulator’s investigation.“Since 2021, Nationwide has invested significantly in all aspects of its economic crime control framework in order to ensure our systems are robust,” they added.“We do not believe that these controls issues caused financial loss to any of our customers and remain committed to preventing economic crime and protecting our customers and the wider UK economy from fraud.”Explore more on these topicsNationwideFinancial Conduct AuthorityBankingBanks and building societiesCoronavirusRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

A survey of franchisees during September 2020 resulted in 78 out of 119 respondents leavingoverwhelmingly critical comments about the effects Vodafone’s actionshad had on their mental health.In response to the Guardian’s investigation, a Vodafone UK spokesperson said: “While we are sorry if any partners have had a difficult experience, we reject any suggestion that our franchisees were put under undue pressure.“We continue to run a successful franchise operation, and many of our existing franchisees have expanded their business with us by taking on additional stores. We encourage everyone to raise issues, and we will always seek to resolve them, and we remain open to further discussions with claimants to resolve the commercial dispute.”The company said it “wholly rejects” any suggestion that it “knowingly or recklessly or negligently” put anybody involved with its franchise stores under unreasonable pressure.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Its shares fell more than a quarter in early trading, before recovering marginally, down 23%.The company said that its long-term strategy, including a productivity and efficiency programme to mitigate “ongoing high inflation”, continues to progress.“The well-documented impact on consumer spending pre-budget has hit store footfall and sales, with the trend continuing into December,” said Kate Calvert, an analyst at Investec. “[Card Factory] does not feel it can make up ‘lost’ sales in the remainder of the year.”The company is also facing pressure from the long-term shift in shopping habits away from buying and posting physical cards.Royal Mail delivers about 6.6bn letters annually, down from 20bn two decades ago, with the postal regulator, Ofcom, forecasting the number to drop to 4bn in the next few years.Meanwhile, the cost of stamps has risen sharply – the price of a first-class stamprose to £1.70p in April, the sixth increase in little more than three years. A second-class stamp costs 87p.In July, Ofcom gave Royal Mail permission to end second-class post on Saturdays and reduce the service to alternating weekdays from Monday to Friday.Card Factory said that the poor performance in its UK business was not reflected in its other operations, including those in North America and the Republic of Ireland, which “remain in line with our expectations”.The integration of Funky Pigeon, which it bought fromWH Smithin July for £24m to boost its web offering, remains “on track”.The company said: “The board remains confident in the group’s long-term strategy.”On Friday, WH Smith said it was delaying the publication of its annual results againamid the fallout from accounting failuresto give its auditor, PwC, more time to complete its procedures.The results were originally meant to be released on 12 November but were delayed to 16 December and have now been pushed back to 19 December.Last month, Carl Cowling, the WH Smith chief executive,stood downafter an investigation found accounting failures in its North American division.The accounting errors first emerged in August, and an independent investigation by Deloitte found “shortcomings” in the travel shop chain’s North American division that exaggerated supplier income, leading the group tooverstate profits at its US business by as much as £50m.The Financial Conduct Authority is in the process of assessing whether the company has breached UK disclosure rules for listed companies but has not launched a formal investigation.In March, WH Smithagreed a deal to sell its 480 high street storesto the Hobbycraft owner, Modella Capital, which has since rebranded the chain TG Jones.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryChristmasWH SmithnewsShareReuse this content"

But it is often castigated by frustrated economists who feel they should be in charge because they shout the loudest. And we need only remember Liz Truss’s mini-budget to remind ourselves of what happens when the OBR is sidelined.“This inquiry is not a stick to beat the OBR with. What my committee intends to do is have an honest conversation about what the watchdog does well and where it needs to do better. I hope this will provide a useful foundation for the new chair when they are appointed.”Evidence must be submitted to the committee by 30 January. It will be followed by public evidence sessions.Explore more on these topicsOffice for Budget ResponsibilityRachel ReevesBudget 2025newsShareReuse this content"

On 14 December a revamped railway timetable goes live across Great Britain, with the biggest fanfare and radical changes for the east coast mainline, where passengers are promised more train services, faster journeys and a new era of reliability.But the spectre of a previous,disastrous timetable change from May 2018still looms over the railway. So will Sunday’s revamp be a great gift for passengers that the industry expects – or usher in a bleak midwinter ahead?LNER, the leading intercity operator on the line from London to Scotland, will have 60,000 extra seats a week in total, and cut the fastest journey times from the UK capital to Edinburgh to shortly over four hours, and to Leeds to a little over two, with six instead of five trains an hour out of Kings Cross most of the day.More TransPennine Express trains will run north of Newcastle upon Tyne and there will be more East Midlands services between Nottingham and Lincoln. Northern will start a new hourly fast service between Leeds and Sheffield, and more trains from Middlesbrough. At the southern end of the line, Greater Anglia and Thameslink are tweaking routes and adding extra seats.With more than £4bn invested in track and trains over the last decade on the east coast mainline, the Treasury expected to see results sooner. A major revamp for the timetable initially was planned for 2021, before the pandemic upended assumptions. A full overhaul was then lined up in 2024, but concerns over the readiness led to plans being postponed for another year.Timetables change every six months, but rarely to this degree. The railway still bears the scars of seven years ago, when no one pulled the alarm cord before a similarly sweeping timetable change, despite what became retrospectively evident: just how unprepared and ill-equipped the railway was to deliver the new services.Overrunning track works in the north eventually led to hastily redrawn timetables, finalised just weeks rather than months in advance – while train operators, struggling already to provide drivers, belatedly admitted to not having trained enough people for all the new services.Tony Miles, a rail writer and industry expert, remembers being with the then chief executive ofNetwork Rail, Mark Carne, just before the fateful change. “Carne wasn’t anxious. He told me: ‘Everything will run perfectly on a good day,’ which is what he had been assured by his minions. But when I spoke to train planners, they said they didn’t have diaries that went far back enough to find the last good day,” says Miles.View image in fullscreenThe last major timetable revamp was in 2018. Widespread cancellations and delays led to a full review of the whole industry.Photograph: Mike Kemp/In Pictures/Getty ImagesIt was grim for rail and worse for passengers:widespread cancellations and delaysover a calamitous few weeks led to a full review of the whole industry and ultimately to the fundamental changes that the government is bringing in, for a single “directing mind” to run an integrated Great British Railways.So can the public be confident in the new timetable this time? It comes when rail punctuality is already erratic in many areas: the recent debacle of the 7am Avanti Manchester-London express service, which wasdue to run as an empty “ghost train”under the revamped timetable but wasreinstated after a backlash, highlights nervousness over a capacity crunch.With new open-access operations starting on the west coast mainline – First Group’s Lumo running from London to Stirling – the Office of Rail and Road had wanted a firebreak, or room in the timetable to minimise the fallout when things, inevitably, go wrong. Several more open access services will also use the east coast mainline in the new timetable.There are, as one industry insider puts it, some “heroic assumptions about performance”. But with the timetable so long in the planning, and the key operators under direct state control, anxiety owes more to lingering trauma from 2018 than any of the danger signals that presaged that fiasco.The rail minister Peter Hendy, who was chair of Network Rail in 2018, has signed this one off – and makes clear it is time for the railway to deliver on the investment, given the huge spend and scant reward for HS2, and Treasury scepticism surrounding other projects. As the government drags its feet over the funding of the Northern Powerhouse Rail programme, the railway needs to show money is well spent.“The £4bn that has been put in was designed to increase the level of service, to create economic growth and better connect jobs and homes,” Lord Hendy says. “It’s taken several years to get any sort of agreement within the railway industry about putting this timetable in and we’ve finally done it. There’s been a lot of preparation.”The major works enabling the changes, over the course of a decade, include: the remodelling of tracks at King’s Cross station and reopening a disused tunnel to reduce congestion; building a “dive-under” tunnel at Werrington in Cambridgeshire for freight trains to reach east England’s ports without crossing the main line; and new platforms at Stevenage and Doncaster stations to aid the swift passage of trains.View image in fullscreenAn LNER Azuma train at King’s Cross station, London.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PAAlongside that, the government splashed out on Hitachi Azuma trains thatstarted running for LNER in 2019. A separate, ongoing multibillion-pound programme to “digitise” the line – replacing the line side signalling with direct communications to the train’s cab, to bolster reliability and capacity – will not be finished until 2030.Hendy says he is not taking anything for granted, heading to York this week to see the gold control in the regional operating centre “to make sure that I’m satisfied that everything’s been done. I’ll be watching on Sunday and for the days afterwards, but we’re pretty confident that it will work well because a lot of effort’s been put into doing it.”LNER says it has used “cutting-edge technology to work through numerous simulations of the timetable” to refine its plans, with staff in the control room at York preparing for several years, working directly alongside teams from other operators and Network Rail.A Network Rail spokesperson says: “The new timetable has been developed through a whole railway approach, setting us on the right path to provide further journey improvements in the future for the passengers and communities we serve.”The timetable, Hendy says, “represents possibly the maximum amount of service for the moment that you can run … but the prize is really significant”.Fundamentally, that prize is a better railway; but the east coast intercity service in its various guises has also long been a significant contributor to Treasury coffers, and annual revenues to the state-owned operator are expected to go up by tens of millions of pounds.“It’s squeaky bum time,” says Miles. “This timetable’s pushing everything to the limits of perfection. It may be brilliant but a lot of people in the industry are saying the government pushed it through rather than the operators. The concern is, is this over-optimism again?”The headline and text of this article were amended on 12 December 2025 to refer to Great Britain rather than Britain.Explore more on these topicsRail industryRail transportTransport policyTransportNetwork RailfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The blame should be pointed at me for everyone’s suffering.“I have spent almost every waking moment of the last few years thinking of what I could have done different and what I can do now to make things right.”Kwon’s lawyers had argued that he should be sentenced to no more than five years in prison, arguing that his actions were motivated by a desire to prop up Terraform’s TerraUSD stablecoin, not personal gain.The judge called the request “wildly unreasonable”.Kwon has been in US custody since his extradition from Montenegro last year, where he was imprisoned for using a fake passport.As part of his guilty plea, Kwon agreed to forfeit $19.3m and some properties that prosecutors claimed he gained from the fraud.Prosecutors said they would support Kwon serving the second half of his sentence in South Korea, where he still faces charges, if he abides by the terms of his plea deal.Prosecutors said they would not seek restitution for the investors who lost a total of $40bn, saying the prospect of determining each of their losses would be too complex.The judge said that some of Kwon’s investors still believed in him, even after his guilty plea, and that reading some of their letters was like “reading the words of cult followers”.Engelmayer said he had received letters from 315 victims all over the world, many reporting they had lost their homes, retirement savings, money for medical expenses and college funds to Kwon’s fraud.A graduate of Stanford University, Kwon returned to South Korea and launched the startup that would become Terraform Labs in 2017 with the co-founder Daniel Shin.Prosecutors alleged that when TerraUSD slipped below its $1 peg in May 2021, Kwon told investors a computer algorithm known as “Terra Protocol” had restored the coin’s value.Instead, they said, he arranged for a high-frequency trading company to buy millions of dollars of the token secretly to artificially prop up its price.Prosecutors said that false claim, and others, drove retail and institutional investors to buy Terraform products and boost the value of Luna – a more traditional token that fluctuated in value but was closely linked to TerraUSD – to $50bn by the spring of 2022.Kwon is one of several cryptocurrency moguls to face federal charges after a slump in digital token prices in 2022 prompted the collapse of a number of companies.Bankman-Fried, the founder of the US’s largest crypto exchange, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2024.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesTechnology sectorSouth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

What they fear is mass layoffsSteven GreenhouseArtificial intelligence could make income inequality even worse and create a new underclass. Governments and society must take actionFri 12 Dec 2025 14.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 16.34 CETShareNowadays there seems to be nonstop discussion about AI, with much of the conversation focused on whether there’s a speculative bubble or whether the chipmaker Nvidia is really worth $5tn or whether OpenAI will beat its rivals in developing new generations of artificial intelligence. But the vast majority of Americans – just like the vast majority of Europeans and Asians – couldn’t care less about those things.Their big concern is whether AI is going to cause huge layoffs and create a disastrous job market, especially for younger workers. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, a leading AI company, fed those fears when he said that AI couldwipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobsin the next one to five years and increase unemployment in the US to 10% to 20%. In October, Bernie Sanders, the top Democrat on the Senate education and labor committee, issued a report saying AI and automation couldreplace up to 97m jobsin the US over the next decade.Such predictions fuel worries that AI will make today’s enormous income inequality even worse as the already wealthy investors in AI grow even wealthier while millions of workers lose their jobs and perhaps form a new underclass struggling to make ends meet.When a chatbot’s advice is a matter of life or death, how can we leave AI to the free market wild west? | Gaby HinsliffRead moreIn arecent panel discussionI moderated, Daron Acemoglu, an MIT economist and winner of the 2024 Nobel prize in economic sciences, said there were essentially two routes for developing AI: an anti-worker route and a pro-worker route. He voiced dismay that tech companies were focused on the anti-worker route – a route that aims to develop AI in ways that maximize automation and maximize job reductions.In thatpanel discussionat the City University Graduate Center in New York, Acemoglu said AI could take “very different directions, and which direction we choose is going to have great consequences in terms of its labor market impact”. He said that today’s AI “craze is really an automation agenda” which “is going to eliminate more and more jobs”.Acemoglu called for “a different future” with “pro-worker AI”. In his view, it would be far better if society and government could get tech companies to develop AI in ways that, instead of maximizing layoffs, increase workers’ skills so that workers become more capable and valuable and employers are eager to keep them. That way AI would result in far fewer job losses.Acemoglu said pro-worker AI would be far better for productivity, social cohesion and holding down income inequality. He acknowledged, however, that pro-worker AI is “not so good for the business models of the big tech companies” – their models seek to maximize profits and automation.To get AI companies to embrace a pro-worker approach will undoubtedly take considerable pressure from government and society. The Biden White House helddiscussions with labor leadersabout how to make AI less harmful to workers. The Biden administration and various Biden-era agencies adoptedseveral pro-worker AI policies(for instance, tolimit harmful AI surveillance), but his administration never issued recommendations or regulations to steer AI’s future in a way that would minimize layoffs. Perhaps that would have happened in a second Biden term.Three days after returning to the White House, Donald Trump – with tech billionaires having helped finance his campaign and inauguration –rescinded Biden’s modest effortsto make AI less harmful. Trump essentially gave the green light to AI companies to pursue whatever strategies they wanted, workers and the public be damned. On Thursday, he issued an executive order aiming to block any state laws restricting AI.“TheTrump administrationhas really changed the trajectory of the conversation about AI,” said Amanda Ballantyne, until recently the director of the AFL-CIO’s Technology Institute. (The AFL-CIO is the main US labor federation.) “I wouldn’t say we’re seeing a great trajectory right now for what AI will mean for workers. We’re living through a live-action experiment as tech companies and employers try to figure out how to use this new technology, with many people concerned that it will be destabilizing and bad for workers.”It would be great if the path forward for AI could follow Germany and Scandinavia’s model of having industry, labor and government work together to develop policies that help business and workers alike. “We’re in new territory with AI technology,” said Ballantyne, now a senior fellow at New America, a progressive thinktank. “We should take lessons from deindustrialization in the United States, where our anemic policy response to the negative effects of free trade left many working people behind. We can, and absolutely should, use the government to incentivize the development of pro-worker AI and smart regulations, as we’ve done previous times in history.” Ballantyne pointed to Franklin Roosevelt’s program that led to the electrification of hundreds of backwards rural communities, helping to improve living conditions and spur economic development.“The Democrats,” Ballantyne said, “should make this a core part of their platform, that it’s possible to use government to create the kind of economy we want” – in this case, to incentivize tech companies to develop AI in more pro-worker, less destructive ways.Four decades ago, Wassily Leontief, an NYU economics professor who won a Nobel prize for economics, hypothesized, somewhat playfully, about a future with so much automation that justone factory worker would be left, and that worker would turn a switch, and all the world’s manufacturing would get done. Leontief worried that the factory owners would get all the benefits and workers would get pauperized.Heasked two crucial questions: “Who will get the benefit? How will the income be distributed?” Those questions are arguably more relevant today.With this in mind, the US and other wealthy nations should move quickly to adopt targeted policies that protect workers from the anticipated negative effects of AI, especially massive layoffs.The government should arrange for greatly expanded efforts to retrain laid-off workers and get them back into the workforce – one option would be to make community colleges free. It would be terrible for those workers – and society – if AI results in millions of workers becoming unemployed for years.If AI causes massive layoffs, that could mean that millions of workers and families lose a vital necessity: health coverage. With all the job churn AI is likely to cause, we should jettison our system in which workers receive health coverage through their job. We should instead embrace a system with guaranteed health coverage for everyone, perhaps in the form of Medicare for All.As AI takes over more and more of workers’ tasks, employers should move to a four-day workweek – with workers continuing to receive the same salaries – as a way to spread the work, reduce layoffs and give workers some of the gains from AI.Some tech executiveshave called for universal basic income (of perhaps $1,000 a month) so that everyone receives a minimum income in case there are huge layoffs. Unfortunately, most UBI proposals would give an inadequate amount, perhaps $12,000 a year, to those most in need, while giving that same amount to tens of millions who are working and don’t need it. To my mind, a more generous unemployment insurance system, with higher weekly benefits and more weeks of benefits, would be better and fairer than UBI.All this will require higher taxes. As AI makes the very rich even richer – giving them even more money that they don’t need and don’t know what to do with – lawmakers shouldn’t hesitate to increase taxes on the ultra-rich to finance an improved safety net that includes universal health coverage, beefed-up retraining and expanded unemployment insurance.Last but not least, we should ensure that workers have a voice in developing AI so it isn’t focused exclusively on helping tech companies maximize profits, automation and layoffs. Biden was dead serious about giving workers a voice in shaping AI, but Trump seems to have little interest in that idea. The billionaires and tech bros who have his ear (and are helping finance his gilded ballroom) despise labor unions and aren’t keen on giving workers an effective voice.Bottom line, once again, is there needs to be a bottom-up movement, this time to pressure lawmakers and tech companies to give workers a say in developing AI and to create a stronger safety net.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionTrump administrationComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

The US declares itself our enemy. Europeemerges as its main adversaryin theUS national security strategy. Russia is its friend, not us. Everything that looked solid since the second world war is turned upside down; the land of the free becomes the destroyer of democratic values. Appeasement fails.He may ramble, but Donald Trump speaks plainly. He means what he says, and he hates everything European. Except its emerging“patriotic” parties, which he wants to support. His strategy warns of “civilizational erasure”, claiming Europe will soon “become majority non-European” and parroting the racist conspiracy known as the great replacement theory. Describing Europeans as “weak”, “decaying” and “destroying their countries”, with “real stupid” leaders, Trump responded to the question of whether they would still be allies, ina Politico interview, with a hint of threat: “It depends.”Note this: the official US strategy says that “the growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism”. He is what he is, in plain sight. No more pretending his fickle ways can be reversed. He appears to back the EU’s nativists, which his strategy suggests are “political allies”. Why wouldn’t he? British politics is already under threat from Russian and Chinese hacking and interference, as in the case of Reform’sformer Welsh leader– who has been jailed for taking Russian bribes. Expect electoral threats from the US from now on. Trump regards Europe’s vain struggle to protect itself – via itsDigital Services Act– from the worst excesses of US tech giants as an act of treachery.Britain looks singularly vulnerable to danger from this US friend turned enemy. But at least here’s one simple political defence that needs immediate action. Next month, the government is expected to publish its elections bill, but so far it has only weak suggestions for protecting our democracy from gross interference by hostile actors. Unlike many countries, we have no cap on political donations. Elon Musk wasreportedly going to back Reformwith £100m, a sum that buys a party – although he denied that specific figure. Though foreign, he can do it legally by paying out of his companies’ UK profits. He fell out with Farage, but might swerve back, and other plutocrats may support the hard right wherever the door is left open to their malign influence.This week, the government published itsanti-corruption strategy, drawn up by Margaret Hodge, its anti-corruption champion, together with David Lammy, and designed to arrest a steep decline: this year the UKfell from 11th to 20thin Transparency International’s corruption perceptions index.This new strategy on tax evasion, money laundering and the professional enablers of corruption – lawyers, accountants, PR companies – was welcomed by campaigners. More than £100bn islaundered a yearin Britain, according to the National Crime Agency, not just through the seedy world of fake barber, vape and sweet shops but reaching to the very top. Kleptocrats launder their reputations as well as their money using philanthropy, cultural institutions,private schools, universitiesand football teams, all over-eager for funds with too few questions asked.But one section of the strategy concerns political influence:Home Office pollingshows 73% of people are concerned about corrupt actors in the political system, and they are right to be. Today the FT revealed that a German private bankgave £300,000 to the Toriesbefore the last election: as it came from an illegal foreign source, it was given back. But it shows how many interests want to sway our elections. A£75,000 donationto Robert Jenrick was revealed to arrive from a UK-based company that took significant loans from a business registered in the British Virgin Islands. Jenrick said the donation was “perfectly legal and valid”, which is what’s wrong with the law.This month, the Electoral Commission has reported that a £9m donation to Reform UK isthe single largest everfrom a living person. Of all donations to Reform, 75% have come from justthree wealthy men. That £9m from one of them, a crypto investor, was not in cryptocurrency, but future donations could be. The government is weighing up whether to ban crypto donations, a shady sector that should be kept well away from political donations.On lobbying rules and onrestoring the independenceof the Electoral Commission, as called for by campaigners, we wait to see if the bill will be tougher than suggested so far. (For another day is the lack of proportional representation, which Labour will regret eternally.) As it stands, cleaning up political donations is a clear win for a distrusted party. Hodge has managed to drag them as far as at least reviewing it. Now they need to do it. As Full Fact, the Electoral Commission and a coalition of democracy and anti-corruption organisations propose, multiple reforms are needed: an annual cap on spending on election campaigns, instead of just restricting it in the pre-election period, would stop vast sums spent on preparing data and social media ahead of time. They want a £15,000 maximum single-person donation, but any cap would be a start.It will take unflinching action to restore public trust, but Labour could wash away public suspicion after the cabinet’s minor but painful moral embarrassment in taking gifts and tickets. Cash for honours is illegal, but a Conservative benefactor donatingmore than £3m to the partycan find a seat in the Lords. Stop donations from companies and unions when these eyewatering sums swashing about in our politics disgust the public. Brave public wrath by explaining that public subsidy to politics is a lesser evil than private corruption.The Labour manifesto says: “We will protect democracy by strengthening the rules around donations to political parties.” Will it, really? The democratic threat is terrifying. The time for timidity is over, for appeasing the US, for pretending Brexit can ever work – and for allowing big money into politics. For a government so low in the polls, boldness is the only way up.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsParty fundingOpinionDonald TrumpThe far rightEuropean UnionEuropeCorruption index and barometerReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

The European Commission published it in March. It’s a chart oftotal fertility rate: the average number of children born per woman. After a minor bump over the past 20 years, the EU rate appears to be declining once more, and now stands at 1.38. The UK’s is1.44. A population’s replacement rate is 2.1. You may or may not see this as a disaster, but the maths doesn’t care what you think. We are gliding, as if by gravitational force, towards the ground.Civilisational erasure is the term the Trump administration used in its newnational security strategy, published last week. It claimed that immigration, among other factors, will result in the destruction of European civilisation. In reality, without immigration there will be no Europe, no civilisation and no one left to argue about it.Of course, we’re talking about different things. The Trump administration appears to see “civilisation” as a white and western property, threatened by Black and Brown people, regardless of whether they were born here or have recently arrived. This week, Donald Trump claimed that, with the exception of Poland and Hungary, European nations “will not be viable countries any longer”, as a result of immigration. Well, Poland has atotal fertility rate of 1.2, which means a rapid slide to inviability unless it allows more immigration. “Civilisation”, as it has often been over the past two centuries, is in Trump’s case a racist and white supremacist concept. The erasure the Trump government appears to fear is of “white” culture.There is and was no such thing. Our language, science,mathematics, music, cuisine, literature, art and – thanks to the legacy of colonial and post-colonial looting – much of our wealth, originated elsewhere. Italian cooking might be unimaginable without tomatoes but, originating in South America, they were not widely useduntil the 19th century. The balti might have a greater claim to be the UK’s national dish than fish and chips (aPortuguese import), as itoriginated here. The roast beef of Old England, from an animal domesticated in the Middle East, was enjoyed by the elite: the rest derived much of their protein from dal (pease pottage, pease pudding, pea soup). This changed only when the means were found ofpreserving and shippingmeat from animals raised in the colonies. Widespread beef consumption in Britain required the civilisational erasure of Indigenous peoples in the Americas, Australia and New Zealand, and the eradication of their ecosystems.Some rulers once understood the power of pluralism. King Stephen I of Hungary, who reigned from 1001 to 1038, noted that the cultures and knowledge of foreignersenriched the realm, while “a country unified in language and customs is fragile and weak”. A thousand years later, Trump appears to have forgotten this obvious truth.What I’m talking about, by contrast, is actual erasure: the literal disappearance of society. Once the fertility rate falls below 2.1, it keeps falling, and the slide towards zero looks inexorable. This doesn’t mean I’ve become a “pronatalist” (wanting to see rising birthrates). I’m neither pronatalist nor antinatalist, as both positions are equally futile. As David Runciman points out in his excellentsummary of the sciencein the London Review of Books, the opportunity costs of having children rise with prosperity, leading inexorably to falling birthrates. In some parts of the world, this process began in the 16th and 17th centuries. No government constraint or incentive, it seems, can significantly alter the trajectory.For years I’ve been arguing with peoplewho want to reducethe human population for environmental reasons. I’ve pointed out that the growth rate today was established before most of us were born: as aUN reportexplains, “Considerable population growth continues today because of the high numbers of births in the 1950s and 1960s, which have resulted in larger base populations with millions of young people reaching their reproductive years over succeeding generations.” In other words, those who obsess about too many people are fighting a mathematical function. Global (and, in the UK, national) population will continue to rise for a while, beforesweeping dramatically downwards, largely as a matter of demographic momentum.The only thing the obsessives could do to change the peaking point by more than a couple of years would be mass murder on an unprecedented scale: slaughtering hundreds of millions of people. This is because the issue is not rising birthrates (the global rate hasbeen in declinesince the year of my birth, 1963), but a risingchild survival rateand greatlyincreased longevity. Ironically, the person who might have caused the greatest depopulation is the self-professed pronatalist Elon Musk, whose dismantling of USAID could, according to an estimate in the Lancet, cause14 million deaths. He wants to see more children born, but appears to care little about whether they survive.It’s Elon Musk’s ‘pronatalist’ bonanza – so many families, so little time | Marina HydeRead moreOtherwise, if the “population control” advocates have any significant impact, it will – because of the long and compounding time lags involved – be to hasten the plunge on the other side of the curve. People have devoted their lives to this fatuity.Why do they cling to the idea long after the evidence has departed? Partly, I believe, because population growth is a highly convenient scapegoat for, and distraction from, the impacts of consumption: wealthy people in the global north canblame much poorerBlack and Brown people in the global south for the environmental crises they themselves have caused. Switching to a plant-based diet or from fossil fuels to renewables, by contrast to altering the size of the human population, are things we can do immediately, humanely and effectively. But blaming other people requires no change, and no confrontation with power.Without immigration, there will, within a number of generations, be no Europe and no United Kingdom. Today’s racist obsessions will look incomprehensible to our ageing descendants, desperate for young people to look after them and keep their countries running. Before long, we’ll be fighting to attract people from overseas. But, as Runciman remarks, “There soon won’t be enough immigrants to go around.”Perhaps this is why, in the new novel by the always prescient Ian McEwan,What We Can Know, set 100 years hence, the dominant global power is Nigeria, one of the few countries that today still has a fertility ratewell above replacement, though it’s also falling fast.Trump’s security strategy, like all far-right politics, is simultaneously preposterous and sinister. But above all, it is wrong.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He also bought two mattresses for about $638,000 and spent another $295,000 on luxury bedding and linens. In addition, he used some of the money to pay off about $1.8m in credit card bills, prosecutors said.Rinsch, 48, never finished the show. His sentencing date is set for April.Netflix declined to comment.US attorney Jay Clayton, in a statement, said Rinsch “took $11m meant for a TV show and gambled it on speculative stock options and crypto transactions”.“Today’s conviction shows that when someone steals from investors, we will follow the money and hold them accountable,” Clayton said.Explore more on these topicsUS televisionNetflixTelevisionUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

I obviously spend a lot of time thinking about this in relation to the work that we’re doing in developing the road safety strategy, and some of it is about trying to create that culture of mutual respect between everyone using our roads.“And I think it’s really damaging to that. We want to create a system that works for everybody. It’s really frustrating to see and it speaks to the mixed messages from the previous government.”Asked ifLabourbelieved there was a war against the motorist, Greenwood replied: “I think the opposition want to create some sense of that. But people are not one thing or another. A lot of people who cycle, also drive; a lot of people who drive, also walk or sometimes take public transport.“So that’s not how we want our roads to be thought of at all. We want to build a system that makes journeys safer, easier and affordable for everyone, and that should be our starting point.”While the Labour government haspromised“unprecedented” levels of funding for walking, wheeling and cycling, there has been some criticism about a perceived lack of ambition on the issue.Earlier this week, more than 50 groups connected to transport and public healthurged the DfTto set specific targets for levels of walking and cycling in the upcoming third cycling and walking investment strategy, saying the current plans were too vague.Greenwood, while not saying whether the eventual plan would include targets, said the consultation taking place on the strategy was a genuine chance to listen, and that she welcomed the groups’ input. “What campaigners want is for us to take active travel really seriously. It’s about long-term funding certainty so you can properly plan,” she said.Greenwood, who chaired the transport select committee from 2017 to 2020, said putting in place a proper strategy for improved safety on the roads was “probably top of my list” in terms of priorities.“Last year, roughly 1,600 people were killed on our roads, and 29,500 seriously injured, and that has been flatlining pretty much for the last decade,” she said. “That is unacceptable.“We in the department don’t talk about road traffic accidents. We talk about collisions or crashes because 90% of those feature someone making a bad decision or a wrong choice. They’re preventable, and it requires determination, leadership and action to make a big difference to that.“It’s quite shameful that the last government did so little to tackle that and didn’t have a proper road safety strategy.”Explore more on these topicsTransport policyConservativesRoad transportLabourTransportRoad safetynewsShareReuse this content"

During the summer heatwave the rubbish caught fire and burned for nine days, forcing the school to close and residents to stay indoors.Josh Simons, the MP for Makerfield, said: “This decision throws mud in the face of my working-class constituents in Bickershaw, Wigan, but also of people across the country suffering from toxic, illegal dumps that don’t have the privilege of living in middle classOxfordshire. I am so angry about it.”View image in fullscreenThe illegal waste site in Bickershaw.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images“My constituents will feel this is unfair, unjust, and once again like a public body is ignoring working-class communities in the north.”The EA’s policy is to refuse to clear up illegal waste dumps across the country, instead pursuing the perpetrators and landowners. But officials said on Thursday they had taken the exceptional decision to clear up the waste outside Kidlington, which is next to the River Cherwell, because the scale of the fire risk set it apart from other illegal waste dumps in England and presented an overriding public imperative.The agency has been given no extra money to clear the waste, the cost of which is likely to run into several millions of pounds. The EA said this would come from “making efficiencies in its operations”. Thecost to the taxpayer will also includethe payment of the landfill tax on the waste to the Treasury.Environment Agency faces landfill tax bill worth millions to clear illegal wasteRead moreSimons said. “What is not ‘exceptional’ about a toxic waste dump on fire right next to a primary school and bunch of local businesses? Could it be because the kids and businesses are not in Oxfordshire? I will fight tooth and nail for the Environment Agency to treat my towns equally and clear the Bickershaw site – and treat us like the good people of Oxfordshire.”This week ministers rejected all recommendations of an inquiry into waste crime by the House of Lords environment and climate change committee.Lords highlighted how organised criminals were making millions every year from illegally dumping rubbish. Peers called for the government to carry out a “root and branch review” of responses to waste crime. The report said 38m tonnes of waste – enough to fill Wembley Stadium 35 times – was being illegally dumped every year, mainly by established organised crime groups often with links to other criminal activity such as money laundering and modern slavery.But the environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, rejected the call for a review and all other suggestions in the report. She said the government wouldbe announcing policiesin the New Year that would drive criminality away from the waste sector, informed by previous reviews, investigations and intelligence.Thedumping in Kidlingtontook place under the noses of the EA, which was monitoring the site after being alerted to suspicious activity. Similarly in Wigan, Simons alerted the EA in January to dumping taking place on Bolton House Road, and was told it would monitor the site. Over the course of several months, lorryloads of waste were dumped in the residential street. Part of the illegal waste has been tipped into a field where the primary school children played sport.The EA said: “In both Kidlington and Wigan, we are laser-focused on finding the offenders and bringing them to justice.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironment AgencyWastePollutionOxfordshireGreater ManchesterLabourLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

Most likely – here’s why | Luke BeckRead more“As the Australian Human Rights Commission put it, ‘There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights.’”Reddit argued it was a forum primarily for adults without the traditional social media features the government has “taken issue with”.Reddit was challenging the law on the grounds it infringed on the implied freedom of political communication. It was also seeking to challenge whether Reddit could be considered an age-restricted social media platform under the legislation.It said it was not seeking to challenge the law to avoid compliance, and had implemented age-assurance measures since Wednesday.The company said the vast majority of Redditors were adults, and advertising wasn’t targeted to children under 18. The Apple app store age rating for Reddit is 17+.“Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark on actually protecting young people online,” Reddit said. “So, while we will comply with this law, we have a responsibility to share our perspective and see that it is reviewed by the courts.”Reddit’s challenge is separate from one filed by New South Wales Libertarian MP John Ruddick’sDigital Freedom Project group. The next court appearance for Digital Freedom Project group is late February, and Reddit expects it will be heard sometime next year, if the high court takes up the case.Prof Sarah Joseph, from Griffith university’s law school, said she believes there was a strong case against the ban.“I do believe the legislation has cut off the main source of political information for people under the age of 16, in terms of their receiving and giving information. Whilst that is not the intention of the legislation, that is one of its many effects,” she said.“Whilst other sources remain open, they operate in very different ways and do not provide the same means to communicate one’s opinions, and the same variety of opinions.”But Joseph said she believed the high court case was more likely to fail, as with most challenges to legislation on implied freedom of communications grounds.“The freedom is engaged in most cases, but the high court goes on to find the law to be proportionate. In reality, the constitutional freedom is quite weak due to the way that it has been interpreted and applied.”A law that has the effect of reducing the overall volume of political communication in Australia will be invalid unless it is proportionate to a legitimate purpose, constitutional law professor Luke Beckwrote in the Guardian on Thursday.“[But] the social media account ban only slightly reduces the overall volume of political communication in Australia,” the Monash University academic said.“The law does not ban teenagers from using the internet or having online group chats. It’s likely that in the [Ruddick] social media account case … the government will succeed.”The Guardian revealed on Tuesday thatReddit had argued to the eSafety commissioner in Septemberthat it should be excluded from the ban.“The sole or significant purpose of our platform is to provide knowledge-sharing in timely, context-rich conversations; interaction between end-users is simply an incidental step to enabling this primary purpose,” Reddit said in the letter obtained under freedom of information laws.‘Already had a profound effect’: parents react to Australia’s social media banRead more“It is not in keeping with Reddit norms for users to use their real names or identities on Reddit, as communities are not centred around real-time social networking among young people.”Reddit does not promote real-time presence, friend requests or activity feeds that drive ongoing engagement, the company said. It said it was committed to collecting minimal personal information from users to preserve pseudonymity on the platform.Reddit was a “pseudonymous platform organised around sharing information in topic-based communities rather than personal profiles or social networks,” the platform said.The 10 platforms the government announced were covered by the ban – Twitch, Kick, YouTube, Threads, Facebook, Instagram, Snap, X, TikTok and Reddit – had all implemented measures to comply by Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsSocial media banRedditSocial mediaAustralian lawnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not very showbiz,” Cohen says.It’s the busiest time of year for Cohen and Luu, assistant directors who founded not-for-profit organisationEvery Day Actionduring the Covid pandemic. Designed to helpunhoused peopleand those facing food insecurity across the city, the idea was born when Cohen noticed the amount of food waste on film and TV sets, and looked into redistributing it to those in need. “I remember asking, ‘Why can’t we donate this food?’ I kept being told it was illegal and that people could sue us if they got sick.” It didn’t take Luu, who grew up working in a soup kitchen her father founded, long to establish this was not the case. “In the US, there’s the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act that’s been around since 1996,” she says. “It protects food donors from liability issues.”They’re not the only women trying to turn the big screen green. In 2009, trailblazer Shannon Bart foundedEcoSet, an environmental production resource based in Hollywood that introduced recycling and composting to sets and began donating creative materials to nearby artists, theatres and schools. In the UK,Albertis a nationwide initiative from Bafta that helps the film and TV industry be more sustainable. One of its biggest goals is to phase out fuel generators on sets, which has the ability to wipe out as much as 5% of all emissions created by the sector. April Sotomayor, Bafta’s head of industry sustainability, says: “We’re also trying to encourage talent not to use private jets. Even getting them into first class goes a long way to reducing the carbon footprint of a production.”View image in fullscreen‘I remember asking: “Why can’t we donate this food?”,’ Cohen says.Photograph: PixelCatchers/Getty Images/iStockphotoAt the production coalface,Green Rideris a collective that sets environmental guidelines for productions, including using grid power, introducing ride-sharing for cast and crew and using beef-free caterers. Their efforts have reduced pollution on productions, including Wolf Hall and Gangs of London, by up to 80%. Tilly Ashton, whom Sotomayor calls a “darling of the sustainability industry”, co-created Wales’s first sustainability coordinator training programme for aspiring creatives last year. AndPropUpis a London-based non-profit set up by ex-producers Emma Chaplin and Kate Allan to rehome and recycle props and sets from popular TV shows. Despite preconceptions, what they do is serious business. “One prop can be life-changing,” Allan says. “Whether that’s a belt that means someone can wear something comfortable to a job interview or a rucksack that can help a child escape domestic violence.”These eco initiatives across film and TV are thriving. Every Day Action now redistributes more than 80,000 meals a year. It also works with big studios including Warner Bros and Disney, the latter of which recently found itself in hot water whenit was revealed the production of its live-action Snow Whiteemitted 3,153 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. They are also needed more than ever in cities such as LA, where 25% of the populationface food insecurity.View image in fullscreenRachel Zegler in Snow White, the production of which emitted 3,153 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.Photograph: Disney/APEvery Day Action can also offer supplementary income to people starting out in the entertainment business through its industry driver programme. It works because they’re insiders who understand set protocols and timings and can easily read site maps. Most importantly, though, they don’t get starstruck. “We can send them on set and they’re OK with only seeing mashed potatoes,” says Cohen.As for PropUp, it has now rehomed more than 50,000 props and partnered with ITV ReLoved, meaning fans can buy merch and niche memorabilia from its online shop – such as a Free Marlon Dingle poster from Emmerdale or Frankie Bridge’s I’m a Celebrity T-shirt – the profits of which are funnelled back into charitable causes. “We recently sold the Fernando’s sign from Take Me Out,” Chaplin says. Every Day Action has a similar tale to tell. “We were once given a bag of 200 flavoured condoms and a bunch of butt plugs” from the set of a show which must remain anonymous, Luu says. They were rehomed by a local sex worker outreach programme before their landlords, religious order Daughters of Charity, caught wind, in case you were wondering.View image in fullscreenHer T-shirt could be yours … Frankie Bridge in I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! in 2021.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockWomen are dominating the space. A 2023reportfound that 58% of chief sustainability officer roles are held by women. The broadcasting world, especially, is leading the charge, with women such as Danielle Mulder and Sara Peacock heading up sustainable drives at the BBC and S4C respectively.The end goal for Every Day Action and PropUp is to inspire more grassroots action, with a few small tweaks to regular programming. The duo in LA have their eyes on an industrial fridge-freezer, while in the UK Chaplin and Allan hope to open a bricks and mortar shop. “We’re not sustainability experts, we’re just two women who saw a problem and wanted to do something about it,” Chaplain says. “It’s not rocket science.”Explore more on these topicsFilmWomen (Society)Women (Life and style)Film industryHomelessnessHousingPovertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A paradise of sun, sea and sand. But to step off the cruise ship or away from the all-inclusive resort is to see a more complex picture: a history of colonialism and a future of climate devastation. Newresearch from the Common Wealth thinktankmaps how, over the 400 years since the first English ships arrived in Barbados, empire engineered a system of wealth extraction that shapes the tourism economies of today.SirHilary Beckles, Barbadian historian and chair of theCaricom Reparations Commission, describes Barbados as the birthplace of British slave society. Between 1640 and 1807, Britain transported about 387,000 enslaved west Africans to the island. Extraordinary violence, from whippings to amputations and executions, were a regular feature of their lives. On theCodrington Plantationin the mid-18th century, 43% of the enslaved died within three years of their arrival. Life expectancy at birth for an enslaved person on the island was29 years old. This was the incalculable human cost of the transatlantic slave economy.On the back of this suffering was built extraordinary wealth for European colonial powers. Historian Joseph E Inikori has estimated that in the 18th century, 80% of the value of export commodities in the Americas was generated by enslaved Africans’ labour. Although plantation owners in the Caribbean did grow rich – the Drax family, ancestors of former Tory MPRichard Drax, made about£600,000 a year in today’s moneyfrom their Barbados plantation in the mid-19th Century – British imperial policy was designed to ensure most of the wealth flew away from the colonies. Two-thirds of the economic value of the sugar industry went to Britain, via the merchants who shipped unrefined sugar across the Atlantic, the businesses such asLloyd’s of Londonthat insured them, and the sugar refineries that created the final product.These geographies of production left a lasting mark on the Caribbean, long after the collapse of the sugar industry. Islands such as Barbados now have a “rebranded plantation economy built for leisure instead of sugar”, says Fiona Compton, a St Lucian artist, historian and founder of theKnow Your Caribbeanplatform. She highlights how most of the region’s hotel chains, cruise lines, airlines and booking platforms aren’t owned locally. For every dollar spent in the Caribbean,80 cents will end up overseas, thanks to large foreign firms repatriating their profits.Hoteliers were wooed with the prospect of generous tax breaks, while large cruise lines have been able to negotiate extremely low port charges because if a government tries to charge them more, they can just weigh anchor and dock elsewhere.Segregated inside all-inclusive resorts, tourists often have little interaction with the local economy. On cruise ships, the onboard spas, restaurants and casinos may entice passengers away from even venturing to port. If they do, they typically go ashore through “approved” vendors that have paid to be featured in promotions or, in a growing trend, they set foot on theprivate beaches and clubs owned or leased by the cruises themselves.Like the plantations before it, tourism also wreaks havoc on local ecosystems. In one day,a typical cruise ship produces21,000 gallons of sewage, a tonne of rubbish, 170,000 gallons of wastewater, more than 25 pounds of batteries, fluorescent lights and other chemical and medical waste, and up to 6,400 gallons of oily bilge-water from its engines. Meanwhile, on land, hotelsguzzle water and pollute additional supplies, something the water-distressed countries of the region can ill afford, and also consume huge amounts of energy. “Their lights are on all night, they’re burning energy 24/7,” says Rodney Grant, a Barbados government adviser. “Governments alone can’t carry the burden of the social and environmental fallout.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Common Wealth thinktankSo why, despite these costs, is tourism so prevalent in the region? “This is the only industry, at least in the current configuration of the global economy, that can generate significant foreign exchange earnings for small Caribbean countries,” notes Matthew Bishop from the University of Sheffield, whose research looks at the political economy of development in the region. In the 1970s and 1980s, some newly independent Caribbean countries experimented with more socialist development models and government ownership of key industries. These were abandoned or violently overthrown under pressure from the US, which even brieflyinvaded socialist Grenada in 1983. With the only available pathway one of attracting foreign investment to transition away from sugar agriculture, tourism emerged for the Caribbean as the “last resort”.Although Black resistance – from slave rebellions in the 19th century to worker uprisings in the 20th – forced formal concessions from Britain, catalysing the process for the abolition of slavery and the granting of political independence, the hard truth about the history of empire is that these processes were never accompanied by the kind of transfers of wealth necessary to support real economic freedom. Instead,compensation was paid to slave-ownersin 1837 to the tune of 40% of the Treasury’s annual income, while Black workers, especially in smaller islands such as Barbados, were denied access to land that might have freed them from having to keep working in the sugar industry.Today, across the region, tourism continues to lock local people out of control and access to land. “It’s cultural and economic dispossession continuing in real time,” says Compton. “So many of our childhood spaces where we enjoyed total freedom have been taken over by beach chairs and security guards, who, if they don’t tell you to leave, hover around you to make you feel unwelcome.” She argues that the same land stolen from Indigenous people and systematically kept from Black people during colonisation is now “packaged and sold back to the world as ‘paradise’”.Threatening the “paradise” image is the climate crisis. Despite being responsible for only 0.3% of historic global emissions, the Caribbean is the second most-hazard prone region in the world, suffering floods and increasinglydevastating hurricanes such as Melissa. Between 2000 and 2023, climactic events caused more than $200bn worth of damage. This is an existential risk not just for the tourist industry, but the entire fabric of local people’s lives.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Common Wealth thinktank“You’ve got this sense that they’re suffering twice,” says Bishop of the countries being battered by extreme weather. “They’re suffering from the original historical injustices of slavery and the period after it, and then they’re also suffering from climactic shocks today. And they’ve received no recompense for either of those two things.” Indeed, rather than money flowing into the region to help with the climate crisis, it flows out to creditors.Many Caribbean countries are heavily indebted, having borrowed in the 20th century to tackle problems of colonial underdevelopment such as poor public health and education and to build new tourism infrastructure such as airports and harbours deep enough for massive cruise ships. Recent analysis from theClimate and Community Institutefound that the region loses roughly the same amount annually in debt service payments as the UN predicts it needs to fund climate adaptation and resilience. Jamaica, which played by the neoliberal rules to reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio from 140% in 2013 to 62%, stockpiling some of its surplus for future disasters, found that the $500m it managed to save could barely touch the sides of the more than $8bn of damage done byHurricane Melissa.Rather than continuing to lean on the uncertain and volatile returns of luxury tourism,Caribbeanleaders and civil society activists are vocal about the need for reparations. This is about more than mere apologies or token sums of money; real repair would mean a rethink of the entire economic structure that has continued to marginalise the Caribbean.Compton, for example, wants to see a less extractive model of tourism based around community ownership of hotels, eco-lodges and heritage tour companies. She has created theCaribbean Green Bookas a resource for travellers looking for locally owned businesses. Grant also emphasises that Caribbean governments can and should do more. “Tourism doesn’t function in a vacuum, it’s been supported by legislation that we put in place,” he says. He wants to see policy changes to encourage companies to pay more tax and buy food and other goods locally. But while individual travellers can certainly try to make more ethical choices, and Caribbean governments can nudge tourism in a more sustainable direction, deeper structural changes around debt and compensation for climate loss and damages, and funding for adaptation such as new flood defences will require more organised political efforts.However much luxury resorts try to scrub clean the Caribbean’s past, raking the white sand beaches clean every morning of thesargassum seaweedthatblooms more than ever thanks to warming oceans, we all live in a world forged by empire. The question for all of us is – how do we remake it?Explore more on these topicsSlaveryCotton Capital: ongoing seriesReparations and reparative justiceCaribbeanColonialismClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Jason Alexander/The Land InstituteScientists in Kansas believe Kernza could cut emissions, restore degraded soils and reshape the future of agricultureByBen Martynogain KansasSupported byAbout this contentFri 12 Dec 2025 13.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 13.01 CETShareOn the concrete floor of a greenhouse in rural Kansas stands a neat grid of 100 plastic plant pots, each holding a straggly crown of strappy, grass-like leaves. These plants are perennials – they keep growing, year after year. That single characteristic separates them from soya beans, wheat, maize, rice and every other major grain crop, all of which are annuals: plants that live and die within a single growing season.“These plants are the winners, the ones that get to pass their genes on [to future generations],” says Lee DeHaan ofthe Land Institute, an agricultural non-profit based in Salina, Kansas. If DeHaan’s breeding programme maintains its current progress, the descendant of these young perennial crop plants could one day usher in a wholesale revolution in agriculture.The plants are intermediate wheatgrass. Since 2010, DeHaan has been transforming this small-seeded, wild species into a high-yielding, domesticated grain crop called Kernza. He believes it will eventually be a viable – and far more sustainable – alternative to annual wheat, the world’smost widely grown cropand the source ofone in fiveof all calories consumed by humanity.View image in fullscreenElite Kernza plants selected from 4,000 seedlings in the Land Institute’s perennial grain breeding programme.Photograph: Ben MartynogaAnnual plants thrive in bare ground. Growing them requires fields to be prepared, usually by ploughing or intensive herbicide treatment, and new seeds planted each year. For this reason, Tim Crews, chief scientist at the Land Institute, describes existing agricultural systems as “the greatest disturbance on the planet”. “There’s nothing like it,” he says.The damage inflicted by today’s food system is clear:one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions; ocean dead zones coveringthousands of square miles; and25bn-40bn tonnesof fertile topsoil lost each year.Replacing annual plants with perennial varieties would massively reduce agriculture’s environmental impact. Soil erosion would drop; perennials would instead build soil health, limiting runoff of nutrients and toxic farm chemicals, cutting fertiliser and pesticide use, and storing climate-heating carbon within farm soils.There is just one problem. Reliable, high-yielding perennial grain crops barely exist.The inspiration for the Land Institute’s push to develop perennial grains came from its founder, Wes Jackson, 89. For Jackson, the health of soils that generate95% of human caloriesshould be a primary concern for all civilisations. “Soil is more important than oil,” he says ina recent documentary. “Soil is as much of a non-renewable resource as oil. Start there, and ask: ‘What does that require of us?’”View image in fullscreenLee DeHaan at the Land Institute in Salina, Kansas.Photograph: Ben MartynogaJackson hit upon an answer during a visit to a native prairie reserve in Kansas in the late 1970s. Prairies are highly productive and biodiverse perennial grassland ecosystems. They don’t erode soils; they build them. Indeed, the rich soils that make much of the US midwest and Great Plains such prime agricultural lands were formed, over thousands of years, by prairie plants working with underground microbes.Why is it that we cannot have perennial grains that grow like prairie plants, Jackson wondered. “That was the epiphany that set me off,” he said in arecent interview.DeHaan, 52, learned about Jackson’s mission while he was a teenager in the early 1990s. Having grown up on a Minnesota farm, he was immediately inspired. “I would love to try to create the first perennial grain crop,” he resolved. “That became my dream.”Though still under development, Kernza is already a viable crop, grown at modest scale in15 US states. Kernza seeds and flour are used in a range of products, from beers to breakfast cereals.The key challenge is yields. In Kansas, the best Kernza yields are about one-quarter those of annual wheat. But DeHaan says this is changing rapidly. “My best current extrapolation is that some Kernza plants could have wheat-like yields within about 15 years.”“We have to go fast,” he says. To hit this target, his breeding scheme deploys DNA profiling, computer modelling and far-red LED lighting to push the experimental plants through two full breeding cycles each year.But yields are just one metric of success. Whereas annual wheat roots are about half a metre long and temporary, Kernza’s roots are permanent and can plunge 3 metres deep. Such roots unlock a whole suite of environmental and agricultural benefits: stabilising and enriching soils, gathering nutrients and providing water, even during droughts.View image in fullscreenA comparison of wheatgrass (left) and wheat roots at the Land Institute.Photograph: Ben Martynoga/The Land InstitutePerennial plants also tend to have far strongerin-built resistanceto pests, diseases and weeds than annual plants, especially when grown in mixed plant polycultures.The Land Institute is working with collaborators across 30 countries to develop many new perennial crops: oil seeds, wheat, pulses, quinoa and several other grains.The potential applications are diverse. In Uganda, researchers are developingperennial sorghumfor drought tolerance. In war-torn Ukraine, where supply chains are disrupted and rich soils are degrading,Kernza is being testedas a low-input crop. As DeHaan, Crews and colleagues write in arecent scientific paper, perennial grains represent “a farmer’s dream … a cultivar that is planted once and then harvested every season for several years with a minimum of land management.”Success is far from guaranteed. But perennial rice, grown in China since 2018, provides crucial proof of concept. Led by Yunnan University with Land Institute support, the work took just 20 years.Perennial rice now matches the yieldsof elite annual varieties, with research demonstrating significantgreenhouse gas reductions.View image in fullscreenPerennial rice grown in a research trial in Yunnan.Photograph: Ben Martynoga/The Land InstituteDeHaan believes perennial grains are uniquely capable of rebalancing what he calls the “three-legged stool” of agricultural sustainability, whereby productivity, farm economics and environmental impact must be in balance.This metaphor is not abstract for DeHaan – he has lived it. During the 1980s, his family’s Minnesota farm produced plenty of grain butthe economics failed. Spiking interest rates forced them to sell, along with thousands of other midwest farms. The environmental costs – eroding soil, contaminated water – did not appear on any ledger, but they were visible in the landscape.Current agriculture, DeHaan argues, is supported by$600bn in annual subsidiesworldwide, which too often prop up production, while farming communities struggle and ecological damage mounts.Perennial grains could eventually deliver on all three fronts simultaneously. But formidable challenges must still be solved to achieve that.View image in fullscreenKernza growing on the Land Institute’s research fields. Lee DeHaan estimates the crop’s yields could match wheat within 15 years.Photograph: Ben MartynogaYields must improve substantially. The problem of harvests tapering off, year-by-year, must also be solved. Farmers will have to develop new methods for growing and harvesting these crops. Markets present another hurdle. Current supply chains are optimised for a narrow range of staple crops, grown in monoculture, making processing costs prohibitive for new crops with different properties.View image in fullscreenKernza grain – smaller than wheat – ready for milling.Photograph: The Land InstituteFor all these reasons, DeHaan firmly rejects the idea that perennials are a “silver bullet”. “The reason is that it’s difficult,” he says. “The trade-off is time and investment. That’s why they don’t exist yet. It’s going to take decades of work and millions of dollars.”Remarkably, DeHaan does not paint the current agricultural-industrial complex as the enemy. “Every disruptive technology is always opposed by those being disrupted,” he says. “But if the companies [that make up] the current system can adjust to the disruption, they can play in that new world just the same.”The Land Institute’s strategy is redirection rather than replacement. “Our trajectory is to eventually get the resources that are currently dedicated to annual grain crops directed to developing varieties of perennials,” says DeHaan. “That’s our [route to] success.”There are signs that this is already working, with the food firm General Mills nowincorporating Kernzainto its breakfast cereals.Back in the Kansas greenhouse, DeHaan strikes a reflective note. “When I started working here in 2001, these ideas were regarded as very radical. It was embarrassing to even bring up the ideas we were working on. It was laughable.”That, he says, is no longer true. Major research institutions, businesses and an expanding network of global partners are now engaging with perennial grain development.DeHaan points to his “winners” – the 100 young Kernza plants before us. Within a human generation, their descendants could be feeding millions while repairing soils that took millennia to form. “We don’t just have our head in the clouds,” he says. “We’re not just dreaming of this impossible future.”Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesFarmingFoodFood scienceFood securitySustainable food supplyPlantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She felt recognition.The product she was seeing was being sold for A$5 by a discount variety chain more than 15,000kms from her studio in England’s south-west, where she first created her own ceramic egg-cup flamingo, which sells for $62.Until that moment, Turner had no idea that Australian retailer The Reject Shop was selling such a product, as part of its Jungle Animal Egg Cup Assorted range. Shock gave way to anger, before she wrote to the retailer, accusing it of selling something that copied her design.“It’s crafts versus capitalism, really,” Turner told Guardian Australia.“If you want good designers out there designing things you need to support them … and understand why it costs a little bit more.”View image in fullscreenCeramics artist Hannah Turner in her studio in 2016 with the flamingo egg cup on her desk.‘Small artists just don’t have the budget’Turner said other ceramics artists had experienced instances of large retailers selling imitations of their products, and she wanted consumers to understand how this affected small businesses.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailShe had raised the egg cups with The Reject Shop last week, after a customer let her know she had seen the similar product in the stores – which are known for their array of cheap homewares, cleaning products and craft supplies.The company reported $471.7m of sales in the second half of 2024, with a gross profit of $196.3m.Labor rules out giving tech giants free rein to mine copyright content to train AIRead moreIn her email, seen by the Guardian, Turner asked the company to “please remove and destroy all of these goods and show us proof, and also please provide us with details of who you purchased them from so we can take legal action”.In response, The Reject Shop told Turner that her email “does not identify any legal rights you may have in Australia to justify the requests”.But the company also said that “as a gesture of good faith and without any admission of liability” – it would not import any further units of the egg cup.“TRS currently has approximately 1,350 units of the Flamingo Product remaining, which it estimates will be sold through by the end of January 2026,” The Reject Shop said in its email to Turner, which the Guardian has seen.“We trust this resolves the matter.”Turner, who is based in Bradford on Avon, said she designed all of her products herself. The prototypes were created at her studio, and the goods then manufactured in small batches by a company in Sri Lanka.View image in fullscreenCeramics artist Hannah Turner in her studio.  She has accused The Reject Shop of copying her design for a flamingo-shaped egg cup.She said she wanted financial compensation from The Reject Shop, but was unsure about taking legal action against the company.“It makes me really angry because small artists just don’t have the budget to pursue these companies,” she said.A Reject Shop spokesperson said ensuring product compliance was a priority.“We also take stakeholder feedback into consideration in the ongoing review of our product offering and merchandising practices,” they said.“After reviewing Ms Turner’s request, as a gesture of good faith and in acknowledgment of her concerns, we undertook to not re-order the product.”Copyright infringementIn Australia, original creative works are automatically protected by copyright law, which applies to artists in the UK because both countries are signatories of the international Berne Convention for copyright protection.Sydney woman who sold a cartoon cat T-shirt told to pay US$100,000 in Grumpy Cat copyright caseRead moreAn artist can claim copyright infringement in Australia as long as a “substantial part” of an original work has been used without their permission and without a relevant defence. A claimant also needs to establish the person actually copied their work.But making a claim could be “tricky” because the “substantial part” threshold was subjective and not defined by the law, according to the Arts Law Centre’s chief executive, Dr Louise Buckingham.She said the centre received inquiries every day from artists navigating copyright infringement – many of which involve cases of large retailers imitating their designs.“It’s really difficult to take action because it’s expensive and time consuming,” Buckingham said.Prof Andrew Christie, an intellectual property expert at the University of Melbourne’s law school, said Turner could potentially make a copyright infringement claim over the images printed on the egg cups as long as she could prove she was the creator.But experts say AI’s ability to trawl the web for designs is making it harder for artists to protect their original work.Speaking generally, Dr Sarah Hook, a senior lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney’s law school, said AI can be used to identify things that can be easily reproduced.“But just because something was made by AI doesn’t absolve them of any copyright liability,” Hook said.Dr Daniela Simone, from Macquarie University’s law school, said while there “seems to be a close similarity” between Turner’s egg cup and the one sold by The Reject Shop, it was “certainly not a clearcut situation”.“What makes this really difficult is ideas are not protected by copyright, only the expression of ideas,” she said.“There’s only so many ways in which you can represent a flamingo.”Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsIntellectual propertyCeramicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This is world-leading. This is Australia showing enough is enough,” he said as the country’sunder-16s social media bancame into effect on Wednesday.‘Already had a profound effect’: parents react to Australia’s social media banRead moreAlbanese pointed to gathered media including those from the BBC, CNN and from Japan. He said the world was watching.“But Australia is leading.”The news has indeedturned heads globally.Some countries have already announced an intention to follow suit, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Denmark and Norway.Others have been watching with keen interest to answer the question, as Albanese put it: “If Australia can do it, why can’t we?”Reddit launches high court challenge to Australia’s under-16s social media banRead moreThe policy to cut off the social media access of more than 2 million under-16s hasremained popularwith Australians in the 12 months since the legislation was passed, with almost two-thirds of voters in favour of the ban. It has also enjoyed support among the major political parties.View image in fullscreenThe momentum was pushed along by a News Corp campaign titled ‘Let Them Be Kids’.Photograph: Brendon Thorne/Getty ImagesThe government was so eager to sell the policy to the world that it spent A$100,000 (£75,000 or $67,000) of public money to send the minister responsible, Anika Wells, to the United Nations in September, a cost that hassparked more than a week of questions in domestic politics.The momentum was pushed along by a News Corp campaign titled “Let Them Be Kids”, which Albanese called “the most powerful use of print media I have seen for a very long period of time”.News Corp was handsomely rewarded for its uncritical coverage, with a speaking slot at the launch event, and the slogan beamed onto the pylons of the Sydney Harbour Bridge on Wednesday night, as the landmark shone in green and gold.Support for the ban may be strong, but whether it works will remain a test for the government.Facebook, Instagram, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Snapchat, Kick, Reddit and Twitch were thefirst 10 platformsto be asked to comply with the ban. Others have adopted similar measures or are planning to, including Bluesky.The tech companies were opposed from the outset – YouTube threatened a lawsuit, while Elon Musk’s X did not confirm its participation until the day the ban came into effect. But by Wednesday they all said they were complying.Although Reddit had agreed to enforce the new restrictions, on Friday itwent to the high court seeking to challenge the lawon the grounds of freedom of political communication, and the government’s decision that Reddit is covered by the ban.Companies were left to determine how they would verify ages. The majority opted for a mix of methods, such asfacial age estimation, behavioural signals and an option to upload government-issued ID.Google searches for the ban were up 700% in Australia in the first two days after it came into effectBut for the vast majority of Australians, the ban came and went with barely a blip – Meta, TikTok,Snapchatand X used signals such as an early account registration date to wave them through.Even so, when the prime minister posted about the ban on social media on Wednesday his replies were filled with comments from teens who said they had escaped the ban. At a Canberra school visit on Friday, students told him their friends had dodged it.“They’ll get found out too,” Albanese replied.Google searches for the ban were up 700% in Australia in the first two days after it came into effect, while searches for VPNs and how to avoid age verification also spiked, though at a fraction of the volume.TheeSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said on Wednesday there would be stories of children escaping the ban but it would not deter the government.“These isolated cases of teenage creativity, circumvention … and other ingenious ways that people will push boundaries will continue to fill newspaper pages, but we won’t be deterred, we’re playing the long game,” she said.‘Grand social experiment’: Australia’s social media ban turns heads globally, with mixed resultsRead moreAlthough it appears it has been a mostly smooth launch, the real test will be in the years ahead.On Thursday, Inman Grant issued notices to the 10 platforms, requesting user numbers as of 9 December and 11 December. The government will release that data to confirm under-16s accounts have been removed – and those users prevented from registering new ones.Meanwhile, the online safety regulatorwill be tracking other datafor signs of mental health improvements in teens, and any changes in school test scores. A review of the law is penciled in for 2027.Legal challenges to the ban loom next year. As well as theRedditcase, adigital rights groupare separately seeking to have the high court rule on whether banning teens from social media infringes on their implied freedom of political communication.Guardian readers have expressedmixed feelingsabout the ban.“It’s nice to have the [children] present in the house again,” one parent said.But another made a point that has been echoed by many others over the past week: “There are young people out there, isolated both physically and literally, living in small towns or regional communities, who potentially will miss out on online support.”Wayne Holdsworth – a Melbourne father who campaigned for the law after his son, Mac, took his life after being bullied online – said the ban, with education, would equip teens to be able to handle social media when they join at 16.“Our kids will be looking down with pride, with the work that we’ve done, we have only just started,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSocial media banAnthony AlbaneseLabor partyDigital mediaAlphabetMetaRedditfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was therefore entirely predictable that theforward’s commentsafter Liverpool’s3-3 draw at Leeds– where he was relegated to the bench for a third consecutive game – would become the singular, all-consuming topic across his homeland’s sports media.“Egyptian media was always going to stand by Salah,” says the Egyptian journalist and co-founder of the sports website KingFut, Adam Moustafa. “When you look at the content over the last five years or so of Egyptian football, 60-70% has been based around him. He’s a nique status that we’ve never had, for someone abroad to be so successful. He’s the golden child of Egypt.”‘Mo has misjudged the mood’: five Liverpool fans on the Salah sagaRead moreThe true measure of Salah’s cultural weight became clear in the breadth of national conversation, as talk around his interview spilled beyond the confines of football punditry. One of Egypt’s most known news presenters, Amr Adib, whose loud, brash political and economic opinions often go viral for all the wrong reasons, staunchly came to Salah’s defence. Political commentators dissected Salah’s words through the lens of negotiation tactics. Even YouTube film critics and foodie TikTokers felt compelled to offer their analysis. “It feels as if every public voice has an opinion to air,” says the president of one of Liverpool’s oldest fanclubs in Egypt, Ahmed Fahmy. “The dramatics of it all proves that a crisis involving Salah is a crisis for the nation.”Unlike in the UK, the consensus in Egypt was overwhelmingly supportive of Salah, with an almost uniform agreement he was justified in his public interview. “We’re getting two ends of the spectrum,” says Moustafa.While British media were quick to describe Salah as disrespectful and selfish, in Egypt the main view was that his character and past form should be enough credit in the bank to give him the right to air grievances. “The conversation about how Salah broke the sacred dressing-room code, that doesn’t really exist here,” says Fahmy. “Our football culture has always revered its stars – over managers, over clubs – and sees little benefit in keeping things quiet.”View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah has drawn sympathy in part thanks to his homeland’s culture of revering star players over managers or clubs.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesThe finger of blame was quickly pointed at everyone but Salah. Online analyses on football websites blamed Arne Slot, with FilGoal labelling the Liverpool manager a “coward” and Salah an “opportunist” in the headline of a piece that said: “[Salah] is like a boxer who appears calm, dodging blows, then pounces and delivers his knockout punch, thus deciding the fight in his favour.” At Kooora, Slot was accused of “double standards” as Virgil van Dijk’s mistakes this season left the author wondering why the captain had not been dropped. Television pundits theorised that Michael Edwards, the chief executive of football at Liverpool’s owner, Fenway Sports Group, and the club’s sporting director, Richard Hughes, would have been unhappy with Salah’s public contract pleas last season and pondered whether they were who the Egyptian was referring to when he said “someone doesn’t want me at the club”.Jamie Carragher fanned the flames. On Sky Sports, he described Salah as a “Chelsea failure” who threw Trent Alexander-Arnold “under the bus for eight years” and questioned his lack of a trophy with Egypt. The former Egypt forward Mido, known in the UK for stints with Spurs and Middlesbrough, said Carragher “exploit[s] any situation to always be in the spotlight”.Slot reveals plan for Salah talks and insists he has ‘no reason’ for wanting him to leaveRead more“He was a very average player … and tries to compensate for this by criticising star players,” Mido said. “But this style of media has proven, throughout history, to be very short-lived. He would not be able to say those comments about an English player. I lived in England for years. English people are very kind but, unfortunately, in certain situations, they are harsh [on foreign players].”Fahmy says: “Pundits have a responsibility to get their facts right. Especially if they go on live television to criticise a player. Carragher may think Salah was a Chelsea reject but Liverpool did not save Salah’s career. He was one of the best players in Serie A when he signed. Likewise, Jürgen Klopp would not have put up with him if he ‘threw his right-back’ under the bus for seven seasons.”A myriad of former Egypt players came to Salah’s defence alongside Mido, including Hazem Emam and Mohamed Aboutrika, the latter widely regarded as one of Africa’s greatest players. Both emphasised Carragher’s lack of context regarding Salah’s failure to win an Africa Cup of Nations.View image in fullscreenEgypt players pose with the Africa Cup of Nations trophy after winning the 2006 edition.Photograph: Karim Jaafar/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter Egypt won their most recent of sevenAfcon titles in 2010, the country experienced extreme political turmoil. Seventy-four people died in the2012 Port Said stadium riot– including afan who passed in Aboutrika’s arms. A two-year suspension of the Egyptian Premier League followed which was detrimental to the team’s heavy reliance on domestic players. With most of the squad retiring and a lack of funding and resources, Egypt failed to qualify for the 2012, 2013 and 2015 editions. Salah is widely agreed to be the catalyst for Egypt’s return to prominence, guiding them to two Afcon finals andqualifying for two World Cups, an achievement that eluded the previous golden generation.“Even if I were to assume [Carragher’s] point was Salah needs a team to win titles,” says Fahmy, “his proof – what he was using to back up said point – was factually incorrect. If it is all false, does your argument hold merit?”After Liverpool host Brighton on Saturday, Salah will join Egypt for his fifth Afcon campaign. “I think this is going to spur Salah to prove his point,” says Moustafa. “He’s going to want to redirect that anger and motivation on to the pitch.“I don’t want to believe he wasn’t trying in past editions but I think he always had an eye on returning to Liverpool, and [now], maybe he’s not sure where he ends up. I think you’re going to see a man whose back is against the wall.”The Pharaohs, drawn in Group B alongside Angola, South Africa and Zimbabwe, are expected to advance to the knockout stages. But there are persistent questions about whether Hossam Hassan, Egypt’s all-time top scorer and head coach since February 2024, can guide an ageing and uneven squad to the title with the lacklustre support of a failing federation.A more certain fact remains: Egyptians will defend their captain vehemently until the end. In their eyes, Salah has long since earned their loyalty and respect and there is little that could make their commitment to him waver.Explore more on these topicsMohamed SalahLiverpoolEgypt football teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, despite the growing outrage, it is understood none of the international federations expect world football’s governing body to change its policy.Anger among supporter groups continued on Friday after it emerged that the cheapest tickets will cost 10 times the price promised in the original bid for the United States, Canada and Mexico to host the tournament. ForEnglandfans it will mean having to pay at least $220 (£165) for group games – when the bid document’s ticket model stated the cheapest seats should be $21 (£15.70).Fifa urged to halt World Cup ticket sales after ‘monumental betrayal’ of fansRead moreThe cheapest tickets for the World Cup final will cost $4,185 (£3,120), more than 30 times higher than originally planned. And that is before travel costs and accommodation are factored in.The Football Supporters’ Association (FSA) described the prices being proposed to the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) as “scandalous” and said they were “a step too far for many supporters who passionately and loyally follow their national sides at home and abroad”. “Everything we feared about the direction in whichFifawants to take the game was confirmed – Gianni Infantino only sees supporter loyalty as something to be exploited for profit,” the FSA added.England fans also expressed their outrage on the private Facebook page of the ESTC, which has 11,200 members, with many saying they would go to fewer games in the tournament or consider boycotting it all together. Another member voiced his frustration that wheelchair users would have to pay the same price as able-bodied match-goers, and their companions would have to pay, too.The FA is yet to comment publicly on Fifa’s ramped-up prices for the tournament. However, like other football associations, it is understood that it only found out on Thursday about Fifa’s plans. The organisation is also aware of the strong feelings of England fans and the FSA, and it is understood that it will pass those concerns to Fifa.Scotland fans also face paying prices almost as high as England, having qualified for their first finals since 1998. John MacLean, of the Scottish Football Supporters Association (SFSA), called on national associations to “hold Fifa to account” over the ticket prices. MacLean also expressed what he called “the widespread disappointment of Scottish fans and indeed fans all around the world at ticket prices that are, in some cases, five times the cost in Qatar”.Meanwhile, the German football association (DFB) has admitted that it would have “preferred more affordable tickets” but had no control over them. Andreas Rettig, the managing director of the DFB, said: “From Germany’s perspective, the World Cup is a long way away, and a visit already involves considerable effort and high travel costs.“That’s another reason why we would have preferred more affordable tickets for our fans. Fifa alone sets the ticket prices; the DFB has no influence over that. We were only informed of the prices a few hours before the application period opened.”Keir Starmer’s spokesperson has confirmed that the government would not be getting involved in the dispute: “That’s clearly a matter for Fifa to speak to. The prime minister would always hope that any major sporting event was accessible to as many people as possible, but it’s for Fifa to speak to their ticketing policies, not for me.”Fifa has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026Football ticket pricesFifaThe FAEnglandWorld CupFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This is just another project, as it always wasFri 12 Dec 2025 21.12 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 21.13 CETShareTea and cake. Cobble-close streets. Collectivism. Sugar rush. Hollywood fairytales. And also, as of this week, a minority owner with historical links to celebrity paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Wait! Welsh cakes! Welsh tea! Aggregated tourism benefits. The sloeblack, slow, black, crowblack, fishingboat-bobbing sea. And also, at one remove, historical links to deceased celebrity paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.Two important things have happened toheartwarming Disney TV vehicleWrexham AFC in the past fortnight. First it was announced that a grant of £18m would be provided by the Welsh Labour government to help renovate the Racecourse Ground, which is unusual, public money to a private entity, but justified as part of a wider regeneration.Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney sell Wrexham stake to US private equity groupRead moreAnd second, Wrexham’s co-owners, the TV guys, Rob and Ryan, announced the sale this week of aminority stake to Apollo Sports Capital, which is owned by Apollo, a US hedge fund.Now. It is important to state that the new minority owner of Wrexham has no current links to Epstein. Those links were severed in March 2021, which is a whole four and a half years ago, when one of the cofounders of Apollo, Leon Black, resigned from the board after it emergedhe had paid Epstein $148min return for some kind of personal financial advice, and had also – hard to get past this one – written a mildly salacious poem in Epstein’s 50th birthday card.So, zero connection. You could be of the view, if you wanted to be pedantic here, that the financial muscle of Apollo was built in part through the expertise of a guy who wrote: “Blond, red or brunette, spread out geographically” in a paedophile people trafficker’s birthday card, which is middling verse, but top-of-the-range creepiness.But Apollo Sports is a legit fund, provides a necessary service, and has purged itself of its seemingly dodge-pot founder. We know how this world works. All hedge funds seem dirty at one remove, because money is dirty. And all football clubs at this level are owned by people who have money.The most obvious point of dissonance is the grant of public funds. Why is the Welsh administration giving money to an entity now part-owned by US financiers? Why are they doing this at a time when the NHS is ailing and infrastructure in decline?The new minority owners have limitless finance available to them. They can build a stand and fix some floodlights. If the world were run on morality and fairness this money would now be returned to the public purse. It isn’t and it can’t, so it won’t.But let us be fair toWrexhamhere. There are plenty of whatabouts. Who built the Etihad Stadium? Who built West Ham’s Olympic-scale temple of sadness? In the end, it was you and me. And let me please introduce you to Sir Big Sir Jim Ratcliffe, also seeking public money to boost his rebuild of Old Trafford’s surrounds.This can be addressed. When the state regulator gets to work, its role should involve scrutinising exactly this kind of situation. For now it will continue to happen, because things need to be built, the UK has so little spare capacity, and the cap must always be out there upturned on the pavement.It may be depressing that this is our notion of growth now. Could the public money have been used to generate jobs in a way that doesn’t rely on a US TV show being recommissioned for another series? But there is also the hard reality of jobs and economic activity. The creation of a tourist hub in a town notable previously for possessing the biggest slag heap in the Western hemisphere may be one of the strangest things that has ever happened in British football. But it has also worked, at least for now.View image in fullscreenWrexham co-owner Ryan Reynolds (right) and Ollie Palmer with the League One trophy in April 2025.Photograph: Jon Super/APThe real point here is the people around the table now. This is information. Wrexham is telling us what it is, and what football is. This has always been a TV product, to some extent a useful lie, investment disguised as a buddy-tale underdog story.They’re not even buddies! Wrexham’s owners met for the first time filming the show. But it’s also great casting. They work on screen, wandering around Wrexham like handsome alien royalty, entirely believable as regular-dude fairy godmothers refinding their own blue collar blah‑di‑blah, like Reese Witherspoon in Sweet Home Alabama, but with middle-aged gym muscles and teeth that look as if they were made in Dubai by a robot.But wait! They do have a fish-out-of-water everyman-type figure as club director, Humphrey Ker, who looks like someone created if you asked AI to make an image of an agreeable man from the 1990s who likes pesto and the music of Shed Seven. But Ker is also a construct, an actor, comedian, TV impresario and scion of the fourth earl of Cheese-Flaps or similar, the kind of Englishman who in another life would be striding around in massive starched shorts being Governor General of Bechuanaland.Humphrey found the right club, did the work, recognised that if you’re going to monetise grit and heritage then selling warm, underdog Welshness gives you bang for your buck.Strip this stuff out, front-load it, present it to America. And with the arrival, finally, of the hedge funders, there is no pretence now. This is just another project, as it always was, albeit an interesting one. Even the financial doping element, often mentioned by fans of rival clubs, is nuanced. Wrexham have powered their way up the leagues not with magic or story-telling but with hard speculative cash, £40m or so over five seasons, the biggest net spend of anyChampionshipclub this summer according to Transfermarkt, a transfer net outlay bigger than any club in the Bundesliga.But this is also just what you have to do. You can’t make the journey without constantly regearing your squad. Most importantly, it is also sustainable, because Wrexham make a huge amount of commercial revenue. It is in its own way a model of financial probity, of eat-what-you-kill good sense capitalism.This may involve a televisual illusion. But it’s workable. It won’t fail the profitability and sustainability rules. This is also a historically powerful club with the reserves and interest to function on this scale. It provides social benefits, has made the town pulse with life, made people happier.It is also far from an anomaly. Rather, Wrexham is part of the same process that is happening everywhere, the new model of US sports capitalism that views this industry as an under-leveraged global entertainment product ripe for the streaming age.Premier League owners will talk openly about the dream of piggy-backing football for its unique quality of cut-through, creating a new global platform around it, making real Zuckerberg billions, Google billions, leveraging the endless hunger for content.Wrexham are a part of the same process that means Mo Salah not playing football is the biggest story of the season so far for eyeballs and dramatic energy. It’s part of the same dynamic that means the Word Cup is unaffordable, because capitalism says you will pay what we can make you pay and that is good and right and just a functioning market.Good art, good TV, good dramatic writing always tells you about the world around it. Wrexham have done this in the guise of a rootsy fairytale. But they will also take your public funds, will do what they must to grow their footprint. As the project heads towards the overclass tier, driven on now by that mix of schmaltz, theatre and sharp-toothed finance, it is at least doing it right out in the open.Explore more on these topicsWrexhamChampionshipFootball politicsCLScommentShareReuse this content"

But a missed penalty from Billy Searle at the start of the second half and a soft try for Jamison Gibson-Park shifted the momentum and ultimately – despite being far from their best – the Irish province were deserved winners. Gibson-Park and Dan Sheehan scored Leinster’s tries, with Harry Byrne kicking three penalties and a conversion. Sam Prendergast also added a conversion.Radwan and his fellow wing Ollie Hassell-Collins crossed over for Leicester’s tries as Searle added a penalty and a conversion.“I’m incredibly proud of the effort as our defence was outstanding, the best performance of the season in that area, but I’m frustrated as the game was there for us,” Parling said.“A lot of people had written us off before the game and it would have been an incredible day had we won as Leinster haven’t lost a European pool game for four years. Going toe to toe with them gives our fans hope and belief for the future but we need to double down on our accuracy.The way the competition is set up, we are still in with a chance of progressing.”View image in fullscreenJamison Gibson-Park touches down in the corner for Leinster’s first try.Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/ShutterstockIt was a different story in the Irish camp as they now have nine points from their opening two fixtures and that should already be enough for them to progress to the next round of the competition.Leinster had to cope with the loss before kick-off of prop Tadhg Furlong, and head coach Leo Cullen said: “I’m very pleased how we stuck at it, although if we had taken our opportunities, we would have made it easier for ourselves. It’s an incredibly tough place to come and although we played with great intensity, they were very dogged and made life difficult for us.“We had a lot of early disruption with Tadhg feeling unwell on leaving the hotel and then losing two players [to injury] in the first 11 minutes. We then had a try harshly ruled out but we showed great composure even though we were trailing 15-6 at half-time.”Explore more on these topicsChampions CupLeicesterLeinsterRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

She didn’t get back to me’: cult darts hero Stephen Bunting on his viral walk-onJonathan LiewThe world No 4’s entrance to the song Titanium has become a quasi-religious moment in darts, but while he loves the attention what he really wants is the world titleFri 12 Dec 2025 15.40 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 22.48 CETShare“There’s a lot of people playing darts who haven’t got no character,” Stephen Bunting says in a matter-of-fact tone, his voice still a little croaky from the cold that has been laying waste to him for the last week. “They’re boring to watch. And that’s probably why they’ll never be in the Premier League. You need to have a personality as well as being at the top of your game. You need to balance both.”And frankly, has anyone in the sport made a better fist of it than Bunting himself? A few years ago, the man they call the Bullet was little more than a capable journeyman on the fringes of the elite, as well-known for his resemblance to Peter Griffin from Family Guy as for his darts. Now he is the world No 4 and a multiple tournament winner, with a loyal and passionate following that – in its most spine-tingling moments – seems to transcend sport itself.Littler lights up Ally Pally opening night as prize money raises stakesRead moreThe interesting part is the way these two narratives have unfolded in harmony with each other. The rise of Bunting the dart player, and the rise of Bunting the snackable social media phenomenon who can bring a stadium to its feet, are really a single development with a single root: the story of how an ordinary lad from St Helens learned to embrace his authentic self. Learned to be happy again.“I always wanted to be a dart player,” he says. “Sixth form, we used to wag off school and go down to the pub, a game of snooker, a game of darts and a few pints. But I also want to be remembered as one of the nice guys. For being a bit stupid and having a laugh.”To watch Bunting take the stage these days is to witness a quasi-religious experience. He walks on to the song Titanium by Sia and David Guetta, chosen for no other reason than that his son liked it. As the music swells, the crowd rises, belting out the top notes in a kind of mass ecstasy. Bunting stands atop the platform, cajoling and conducting them like a preacher, the entire room in his grip. Eventually the music dies and the crowd launch into a chorus of “Let’s Go Bunting Mental”. It is a stirring, albeit deeply strange spectacle.There is no artifice to this, no masterplan. An infinity of marketing geniuses locked in a room for infinity could never concoct a campaign this catchy. Nobody even really noticed when Bunting changed his walk-on music to Titanium from Bird is the Word – a Family Guy in-joke – around the time of the pandemic. Even now Bunting isn’t sure how or why it went quite so viral.View image in fullscreenStephen Bunting tasted success in the 2024 Masters that he credits in part to undergoing hypnotherapy.Photograph: Rob Newell/CameraSport/Getty Images“I never really thought too much about it,” he says now. “But the song is brilliant, and the lyrics – ‘bulletproof, nothing to lose, fire away’ – all relate. When I get on stage and the fans are all singing it back, you feel like you’re orchestrating something special. And then it gives you the power to go and produce performances.”Any feedback from either of the artists themselves? “I messaged Sia on Instagram. She didn’t get back to me.”Of course darts has never been short of novelty acts and outsized characters. The difference with Bunting is that he backs it up with brilliance. Above all, it so clearly comes from an authentic place. “It’s 100% me,” he says. “I don’t hide behind fakeness. My dad taught me that from an early age. No matter how much money you’ve got in your bank, you’re still the same person.” The problem, for much of his early career, was that Bunting himself was still trying to work out who that person was. Right from his earliest years growing up in St Helens he had been a daft lad and a very decent player, good enough to be Lakeside world champion in 2014, but still never quite comfortable in his own skin. “Then you start losing,” he says. “You start doubting. It took a few years to rebuild myself.”Bunting got help. Racked with depression and starting to take every defeat like the end of the world,he visited a hypnotherapistcalled Chris O’Connor to “get my mind in the right place”, as he puts it. “He taught me, no matter how hard things were, to try to take my mind away from darts. Don’t look at negatives, look for positives. That helped alleviate the demons.”There were technical improvements as well. Bunting had always thrown a light dart, but over the years, through sweat and abrasion his copper-tungsten arrows had whittled away to around 12g. (The average pro throws around 20-25g.) “If I didn’t change my darts, soon I was going to be throwing with bookie pens,” he jokes.“Moving up six grams gives me so much more control of the dart. It’s paid dividends.”Slowly, the wins and the consistency began to come: a first major title at the Masters in early 2024, an invitation to the Premier League in 2025. Meanwhile, away from the oche his legend was building: late-night TikTok livestreams, YouTube tutorials, viral Instagram moments. In an intensely psychological sport where character and talent are often two sides of the same coin, Bunting was learning to master not just the craft but the business of darts.View image in fullscreenStephen Bunting is feeling good about his chances at the PDC world championship as he beat Luke Littler in an exhibition recently.Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PA“We do exhibitions, and a lot of the other players like to lock themselves away in a private room,” Bunting says. “They don’t really see the fans, unless it’s a meet-and-greet. Whereas I like to be the centre of attention, easily accessible. And listen, these fans are paying our wages.”The burning question is whether Bunting can give his fans what they truly want. He’s never reached a world championship final. His Premier League campaign was a crushing disappointment. His recent record in the majors hasn’t been great. Even so, he reckons he’s in good shape. He beat Luke Littler in a recent exhibition in Portsmouth. “Hundred point three average,” he says. “Hitting lots of 180s, and my big finishing seems to be back.”I ask again about the kid growing up in Liverpool, chucking darts in the pub while skiving off school. Did he ever, in his wildest imagination, think it might ever turn out like this? Bunting pauses for a moment.“Maybe not thought,” he says after a while. “Maybe dreamed. I always dreamed of becoming this darts player that everyone looked up to. To play on the biggest stages and win the world championship. Half my dream’s been met. Now let’s try to make the other half happen.”Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipsDartsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

We have great education programmes which help but they don’t impact the intentional rule-breakers in elite sport.“Our ineffectiveness in dealing with those who are beating the rules is hurting the anti-doping movement’s credibility, with the resulting risk that our clean-sport message falls on deaf ears.”Ironically the AIU is widely seen as the gold standard when it comes to catching cheats, having sanctioned 427 elite athletes for doping offences since 2017.However, Howman said the AIU could do more, despite its successes, adding that “it was not catching enough of them and significant improvements are necessary”.Howman, who spent 13 years as Wada’s director general, also urged the anti-doping community to “move beyond compliance to a system that supports effective, ambitious anti-doping efforts”.Focusing on compliance-based testing, Howman warned, would not catch what he called the “sophisticated dopers” and he urged Wada to be more proactive in “promoting the pursuit of anti-doping excellence” and for greater transparency on anti-doping data.“We must all do better to support our clean athletes by catching the dirty ones, especially those at the pinnacle of sport,” he added. “Let’s resolve to strengthen our anti-doping system as we strive for cleaner, fairer and more credible sport.”Explore more on these topicsDrugs in sportWadaAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

We know that historically it was said that 100,000 people would be at Epsom Downs on Derby Day, but while we want to aim high over the next five years, a realistic yet ambitious target would be to achieve that number over the course of the two-day festival by 2030.”Sixmilebridge shines at CheltenhamAt Cheltenham on Friday, Fergal O’Brien’s Sixmilebridge was a convincing winner of the card’s two-and-a-half mile novice chase and is now likely to step up to Grade One company in the Scilly Isles Novice Chase on 31 January.Just a trio of runners went to post but all three had already shown useful form over fences and Sixmilebridge was conceding weight to both rivals. He accelerated clear in the straight, however, and flew the last before crossing the line with a 13-length advantage.Elsewhere on the card, the novice Fortune De Mer took another step towards a possible run in the County Handicap Hurdle in March as he was delivered with a perfectly timed run by Harry Skelton to take the two-mile handicap hurdle by a very cosy half-length.It was Fortune De Mer’s fourth start over hurdles and he needs one more outing to qualify for the County.“I told everyone at the start of the year that was what we would do and we’re just trying to do it,” Dan Skelton, Fortune De Mer’s trainer, said. “We’ll feel a lot of satisfaction if it comes off, but we won’t be disappointed if it doesn’t as it’s a hard thing to do and we’re getting a lot of pleasure running him.”View image in fullscreenSixmilebridgeleads on the first lap before going on to win at Cheltenham on Friday.Photograph: David Davies/PABank on Vincenzo to lift the CupJagwar, the Plate winner at last season’s festival meeting, is the likely favourite for the Support the Hunt Family Fund December Gold Cup at Cheltenham on Saturday, and the six-year-old could well be a serious competitor in Graded company before the winter campaign is out.The immediate question for punters on Saturday, though, is whether Jagwar will be ready to fend off some classy, race-fit rivals off a career-high mark after 275 days away from the track.In Jagwar’s favour, he has won off a significant break in the past, but the feature race of Cheltenham’s December meeting is a much tougher assignment than last season’s pipe-opener in a 0-140 at Wetherby, and 7-2 feels like a thin price in such a competitive event.Kim Roque, a recent recruit to Joseph O’Brien’s yard who was a fine second on his stable debut at Cheltenham’s November meeting, is an interesting runner at the other end of the handicap, but he is 3lb wrong at the weights and it could pay to focus instead on the strong form of the Paddy Power Gold Cup at the same meeting.Panic Attack, the winner, went on to complete a rare double in the Coral Gold Cup at Newbury, and Vincenzoand Hoe Joly Smoke, second and third in the Paddy Power, are looking to further frank the form.Hoe Joly Smoke is 2lb better off withVincenzo(1.50)on Saturday but Sam Thomas’s seven-year-old was making his seasonal debut last time and should find more for the outing. He is also less exposed over fences – this will be only his sixth chase start – and he is a fair price at around 9-2 to make the most of his edge in fitness against the favourite.Cheltenham 1.15Realta Liathmay be the pick of several last-time winners in a highly competitive mares’ handicap chase.Doncaster 2.05First-time cheeckpieces did the trick forAlcedolast time and he can continue Venetia Williams’s recent upturn in form.Cheltenham 2.25Having picked up where he left off last season at Haydock in November, the progressiveDavid’s Wellcan extend his unbeaten record over fences to four races.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowLingfield11.42 Hansard 12.17 Getaway King 12.47 Cinquenta 1.22 Masked Man 1.57 Getaway With You 2.32 Drayton Flyer 3.10 Bobbi’s BeautyDoncaster11.55 Real Quartz 12.25 Zurich 12.55 Spadestep 1.30 Bridge North 2.05 Alcedo 2.40 World Of Fortunes 3.17 BowmoreCheltenham12.10 Minella Study 12.40 The Jukebox Kid 1.15 Realta Liath 1.50 Vincenzo (nap) 2.25 David’s Well (nb) 3.00 Conman John 3.35 Siog GealNewcastle3.05 Blue Sky Boy 3.40 Brave Traveller 4.15 Alba Gu Brath 4.45 True Promise 5.15 Pocklington 5.45 Dandy Magic 6.15 The Green Man 6.45 Lessay 7.15 WyvernWolverhampton5.00 Sir Benedict 5.30 Cool Molly 6.00 Hashtagnotions 6.30 Brasil Power 7.00 Squiffy 7.30 Romanovich 8.00 King Of Speed 8.30 Amber HoneyWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Doncaster 2.40The Irish-trainedWorld Of Fortuneshas little to find with odds-on Kateira on ratings and looks overpriced at around 4-1.Cheltenham 3.00Conman Johnlooked a staying novice to follow when successful at the October meeting and should build on that win here.Doncaster 3.17Daire McConville’s 7lb claim could help offset a 10lb hike forBowmoreafter a cosy win last time.Cheltenham 3.35Fergal O’Brien’sSiog Gealmade a solid start to the season in open company last month and has obvious prospects back in a mares’ event.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingThe DerbyHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

The win ­establishes her as one of the ­favourites for the downhill in February’s Winter ­Olympics in Milan-Cortina, the event she won her only gold medal in, back in Vancouver in 2010.“It was an amazing day, I couldn’t be happier, pretty emotional,” Vonn said. “I felt good this summer but I wasn’t sure how fast I was. I guess I know now how fast I am.”Vonn led by 1.16sec after a ­storming first run and she consolidated her advantage in the second to secure her 44th career win in World Cup downhills – and the 83rd World Cup victory of her career – with Austria’s Magdalena Egger in second place, 0.98sec back.After her victory was confirmed, Vonn collapsed into the snow before thrusting her ski poles in the air to celebrate. It was the perfect start to her Olympic season and a first World Cup win since March 2018 at Are, Sweden.“Obviously my goal is Cortina but if this is the way we start I think I’m in a good spot,” she said.View image in fullscreenLindsey Vonn on her way to victory in San Moritz.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesThe American has another ­downhill followed by a ­Super-G – and the ominous news for her rivals is that she thinks there is still room for improvement.“I still didn’t ski the best I could have on the compression on the ­bottom but I just tried to be dynamic, tried to be clean, the way I’ve been skiing in training and it was pretty solid,” she said.“I’m really excited for Super-G because I’m ­skiing better in Super-G than I am in downhill.”The previous oldest World Cup race winner was Switzerland’s ­Didier Cuche at 37 in a men’s Super-G in 2012.

Suffice to say the plot thickens when Smith goes to the Lakers’ film room to speak to the team in 2022.Six months had passed since Smith had slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars. Now Smith was participating in a series of celebrity talks to the Lakers, an innovation brought in by general manager Rob Pelinka. According to the book, James asked Smith question after question until a scheduled half-hour visit had ballooned to nearly twice that amount, with fellow Laker Russell Westbrook growing visibly frustrated, frowning in a team photo with Smith.“You get to see the personal, intra-office dynamics that impact the game that you don’t always think about,” Weitzman says of the scene.He notes that those who’ve read the excerpt “seem to be cheering on Westbrook” and “latching on to the idea that it was LeBron’s fault, LeBron was a phony.” He points out that Westbrook has played for multipleNBAteams, and in LA, he was “awful on the court, hardheaded, no willingness to adjust his game.”As for James: “He is the defining, not just basketball player … but athlete of my generation,” says the 37-year-old Weitzman. And, the author adds, “It seemed like the ‘merger’ between LeBron and the Lakers was fertile ground for the sort of reporting and storytelling” that’s fueled by what Weitzman calls behind the scenes drama.Weitzman is no stranger to dissecting NBA franchises. It’s what he did in his previous book, about the Philadelphia 76ers, Tanking to the Top. With the Lakers, though, the spotlight was more intense. There was the team’s location in America’s entertainment epicenter. There was a legacy of championships won by stars from Magic Johnson to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to Kobe Bryant to Shaquille O’Neal, the last two coached by the legendary Phil Jackson. (Last season brought another addition to the pantheon – Luka Dončić – but we’ll get to him later.) There was the role of the Buss family, especially the late longtime team owner Jerry Buss and his daughter, Jeanie, who succeeded him in the executive office. Then there was what Weitzman called the “merger” between the Lakers and James, who brought a star power all his own – as well as the increasingly powerful agency that represented him: Klutch Sports Group, run by James’ friend Rich Paul.The Luka Era begins: inside the transformation powering the post-LeBron LakersRead moreHow rare is James’s status in the NBA? The book notes his estimated billion-dollar-plus worth while still on an NBA roster, and his dream of someday owning a franchise. Weitzman tracks the impact of James’ comments to the media – including some much-scrutinized remarks at a press conference after the Lakers’ 2023 playoff exit: “I’ve got a lot to think about, to be honest. Just for me personally going forward with the game of basketball, I’ve got a lot to think about.”Neither James nor team ownership would talk with Weitzman for the book. He filled in the gaps by reading the news coverage from as far back as 15 years ago, supplementing this by watching documentaries, listening to podcasts and speaking with whoever would talk to him, a list that grew to almost 300. Keep an eye out for the footnotes while reading the book. Weitzman describes them as “like someone winking at the reader.”On page 54, you’ll find not one but two footnotes relating to Daenerys Targaryen. Why? Bryant is quoted urging Jeanie Buss to emulate the Game of Thrones character in early 2017. That’s when, according to the book, she won a George RR Martin-esque power struggle for control of the team. The next year, James came to LA for four years and $154m.“The Lakers were in a dark period,” Weitzman says. “They certainly needed LeBron. LeBron saved Jeanie Buss’ legacy by coming there.” He adds that unlike past stars such as Magic, Kobe or Shaq, LeBron came to the Lakers as “a fully formed icon, which they had not had before.”There were significant if not immediate benefits: A championship in James’ second season with the Lakers, 2019-20 – a season that ended amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests. It was also a season that saw the death of Bryant and his daughter Gianna in a helicopter crash. Coach Frank Vogel kept the team focused as it played before empty stands in the NBA bubble. It was title No 17 for the Lakers, tying them with the Boston Celtics for the all-time league mark.Would there be an encore? Pelinka tried to add more talent around James, and in 2021 he brought in Westbrook. Yet the 2021-22 team couldn’t even qualify for the playoffs to defend its title, and Vogel lost his job.Darvin Ham succeeded Vogel as coach. James continued to dazzle on the court, yet the team struggled around him. The book finds a perfect microcosm: On 7 February 2023,James broke the all-time NBA scoring record, surpassing Abdul-Jabbar, in a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. There were cheers for James after he set the mark late in the third quarter, and a salute from commissioner Adam Silver. However, as the book points out, it was the Thunder who won the game. The Lakers stood at 25-30, in danger of missing the playoffs once more.Cue more plot twists. The Lakers traded away Westbrook, and saw their fortunes surge. They made the playoffs, going all the way to the West finals, which Denver swept. It was an encouraging first season for Ham, yet the following season the Nuggets ousted the Lakers again, this time in the first round of the playoffs. The hated Celtics won the title that season, moving them ahead of LA for that record 18th banner.Parting ways with Ham, the Lakers flirted with UConn coach Dan Hurley before he ultimately turned LA down. The Lakers hired player-turned-podcaster JJ Redick and made a unique decision in the draft: They selected James’ son Bronny at No 54, setting upa rare father-son pairing in the lineup. Then, earlier this year, Pelinka made a league-shattering move, dealing Anthony Davis for Mavericks superstar Dončić, who is already one his way toreplacing James as the face of the Lakers.By that point, Weitzman thought he was finished with the manuscript, which initially ended with Bronny joining James on the Lakers. As they say in Hollywood, get me a rewrite.“I live in New York. The Lakers were playing the Knicks that night at Madison Square Garden,” Weitzman recalls of the Dončić trade. “I was at the game, then I was driving my way home, saw the tweet – oh my God.”The book wraps up in where-are-they-now style, giving readers updates on the cast. Among them: The Buss family has sold its majority stake to Mark Walter, the owner of the cross-town LA Dodgers, with Jeanie Buss remaining as governor and keeping 15% ownership.“I’m curious to see where this goes,” Weitzman says. “Is she going to stay or go? I’m dubious whether she actually can stay … Usually, people who pay the money want to be in charge.”As for James?“Playing into his 40s, it’s something unparalleled,” Weitzman marvels. “In the major professional American sports, the four major sports, Tom Brady is the only comparison. I’ve never seen anything like it.”Explore more on these topicsLeBron JamesNBALos Angeles LakersBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He may be big – 6ft 4in tall and about 130kg (20st 6lb) – but as far as the internet is concerned he arrived some time ago. Video footage of the youngGloucesterprop waving off the more experienced Ellis Genge after edging a scrummaging duel at Kingsholm last year went viral almost before Genge had reached the touchline.Should the 21-year-old make a strong impact off the bench against Munster in Cork on Saturday evening, however, he could soon be vying for even greater recognition. England are suddenly lighter in the tighthead department after Will Stuart’s unfortunate achilles injury, with Asher Opoku-Fordjour also out of action. If Leicester’s Joe Heyes so much as breaks a fingernail, alarm bells will start ringing at Twickenham.Northampton’s Trevor Davison could plug a short-term gap but, at some point, the power-packed Fasogbon will inevitably enter the conversation. Last month in the gym he set a new weight-training personal best – three back squat reps of 225kg – and he is not short on personality either. “My mates would say I’m pretty wired. I love a laugh, I love a bit of banter,” he says. “They’d also say I’m quite chilled off the pitch – until it’s time to go to work.” Anything else? “They’d say I’m pretty loud as well.”He is certainly the kind of guy whose character is transformed on a rugby field. “You do have to be a different person when you step across that white line. On game day it is just different, isn’t it?” Being pitched into tough environments with England Under-20s has also helped to shape his competitive edge. “Both our World Cups were in South Africa and our warm-ups were in Georgia. Growing up, I didn’t play many games at home. You’ve got to perform when your back’s against the wall and no one’s rooting for you. You’ve got make your own atmosphere.”By now a couple of things should be pretty evident. If Fasogbon goes on to enjoy a lengthy Test career it will be good news for the Biro-chewing media. He is a cracking interviewee: chatty, engaging, honest and fun. Ask him, for example, if his meals merely consist of two lettuce leaves and a slice of cucumber and he roars with laughter. “Ha-ha! Definitely not, no. I’m big on my proteins. I do love my meat. And maybe tuna. But unfortunately Archie, my housemate, doesn’t like the smell of tuna …”View image in fullscreenAfo Fasogbon has gained more experience playing for England’s Under-20s and England A.Photograph: Bob Bradford/CameraSport/Getty ImagesPerhaps more pertinently English rugby may just have found a role model capable of inspiring big city kids from outside the RFU’s usual catchment areas. Fasogbon grew up in a football-loving community in Colindale, north London and, until he was 13, barely knew what rugby was. “Quite a lot of people had a negative view of rugby … where I was from, it was all football. We’d say: ‘We think football is the better sport, we’d never play rugby.’ And here I am eight years later doing it as a job that I love. Interesting, isn’t it?”Having made the leap to Gloucester, via London Irish’s academy, it is his firm belief rugby is missing out on a load of raw potential in the state school sector. “Thinking back to it, I grew up with some absolute physical specimens. Maybe with a bit of coaching and the necessary desire, I reckon there could have been a bit of talent there. Maybe if rugby was presented more in schools … we only did it for half a term, I think.”As a consequence he is still learning his demanding trade. Touring with England in Argentina and the United States this year and representing England A have helped his development but, with only 15 career Prem starts to date, consistency is his next goal. “Afo wouldn’t mind me saying there’s a few bits of his game he needs to tighten up on,” says George Skivington, Gloucester’s director of rugby.“When he gets it right there’s not many people better; he just needs to get some behaviours right consistently. And then he’ll get to where he wants to be. Like any young man you arrive on the scene but the real challenge is getting the nuts and bolts right. Then you can see where you’re ceiling is and what’s possible. He knows that if he wants to get to the top level the ability to back it up is key.”View image in fullscreen‘I do understand I’m at the start of my journey. But even if it’s only by 0.5%, the aim is to get better every week.’ Afo Fasogbon has 15 career Prem starts to date.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesFasogbon does not dispute this assessment, which may be shared by England’s head coach, Steve Borthwick. “I agree 100%. I don’t think I’m anywhere near where I want to be. I do understand I’m at the start of my journey. But even if it’s only by 0.5%, the aim is to get better every week.”This weekend will form part of that learning curve, with Skivington predicting an “intense” experience. Not only are Munster stinging from their 40-14 defeat in Bath last Saturday but staging the fixture at Páirc Uí Chaoimh, normally a Gaelic games stadium, will further up the ante.Should he prosper and subsequently feature in the Six Nations, though, it would be massive for him and his extended family. His father, Bobby, owns a carpeting and furniture company while his mum, Olubunmi, looks after the mental wellbeing of hospital doctors and nurses. Both were raised in Nigeria and would be the proudest parents in the stadium – “I think they’d be super excited” – if their boy starts at Twickenham.So will social media if he makes his Six Nations debut alongside the aforementioned Genge in the spring. “It would be class. I think he’sthemodern-day prop so it would be sick. I’ve always said he’s someone I’ve looked up to.” Has that Kingsholm wave been forgiven? “It was good fun but it’s a thing of the past now. I don’t think there are any hurt feelings. Like we said at the start of this interview everyone’s a bit different on the field to what they are off it.”And if a first senior cap does materialise in 2026 the big man insists he will be ready. “It is definitely something I’ve dreamed about since I first started playing this sport. And even more since I decided this is what I want to do as a career. My younger self would be over the moon, which is what keeps me motivated sometimes. It would mean so much to me.” Good luck to the affable Afo – and to all his future opponents.Explore more on these topicsGloucesterChampions CupRugby unioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Then you realise it’s not accurate because a rollercoaster has to offer some ups as well as downs. Still, perhaps the players can find inspiration in some of the stories of the past that took place at this very ground.The Adelaide rollercoasterThese days walking through the pleasant gardens or across the curving footbridge on the way to Adelaide Oval, it’s difficult to picture a 140-metre carnival ride spanning the whole width of the ground on one side. Known as a switchback railway at the time, the first in the world had opened at Coney Island, New York, only five years earlier. Adelaide went next, building two lines of vast wooden scaffolding to support parallel railway tracks, with an elevated station at one end.View image in fullscreenLooking down the switchback rollercoaster at Adelaide Oval.Photograph: From Adelaide Yesterday and TodayWith no source of power but gravity, the ride had to work using the weight of its carriages and passengers: down a steep drop to get it going, up a following rise thanks to the momentum, then continuing that pattern towards a lower finish at the far end. Then the carriage had to be hauled up on to the higher starting point of the opposite track and reloaded to make its way back. The slope was “very steep and the cars shoot down at a terrific rate”, the Evening Journal reported. “When everything is finished and the railway is in thorough working order, it will, no doubt, become very popular, as the sensation is pleasant and the pastime free from danger, if passengers hold to the seats as they should do.”That prognosis was right: after the railway was formally opened by Lord Mayor James Shaw on 18 January 1889, the South AustralianCricketAssociation claimed that 10,000 people rode it in the next 30 hours. Free sessions for ladies and children were put on in following days, and the rollercoaster, always intended to be temporary, lasted a couple of decades instead. Its end came with the outbreak of the first world war, when it was pulled apart and set ablaze in a fundraising spectacle for the war. But they say that on a still and moonlit night, you can still hear the voices of people having a very nice time.View image in fullscreenEngland can only hope their current Ashes tour might match the rollercoaster’s ups and downs.Photograph: The History of Port Adelaide Football ClubA record for 118 years and countingWhen you scan the list of Australian record partnerships for each wicket, predictable surnames are there: three Bradmans, a Ponting, Walters, Lawry. The least known to a contemporary eye might be Roger Hartigan, real name Michael, who still holds a record from 1908: the eighth-wicket partnership with the great Clem Hill.Even Bazball’s implosion can’t shake Barmy Army’s crew of Ashes veterans | Emma JohnRead moreThe context makes it extraordinary. Hartigan was on debut, and had to get extra leave approved by his boss via telegram. Hill was desperately ill with the flu, to the point dropping down to No 9 in the order and throwing up mid-innings. Australia needed a miracle. In the third Test of an Ashes series tied 1-1, a glittering batting order that named Trumper, Noble, Macartney, Armstrong and Ransford was not enough to avoid trailing the first innings by 78 runs, then falling to 180 for 7 second time around. In a timeless match, Australia led by only 102 with three wickets in hand.Queensland was regarded as a minor cricketing state, which might be why Hartigan was listed at No 8, but he was regarded as the best bat in his stage. He had to withstand the precipitous situation, two bowling geniuses in SF Barnes and Wilfred Rhodes, and extreme heat: reports at the time of 150 degrees in the old money are a stretch given that means 65 degrees Celsius, but you get the picture.And yet, from that score of 180 when they started, Hartigan and Hill took Australia to 397 by stumps, and 423 when Hartigan fell the next day for 116: the fifth Australian to make a ton on debut. Hill carried on to 160, Australia to 506, and bowled out England to win in a canter. The partnership was 243, and with the way that teams are structured nowadays, it will take something remarkable down the order for it ever to fall. Hartigan played only two Tests but deserves his spot in the canon.View image in fullscreenIn the 1940’s the Adelaide Oval was the site for one great Australian cricketer’s comeuppance.Photograph: Mark Brake/Getty ImagesClarrie’s roundabout revengeYou may have heard that Don Bradman didn’t always get along with his teammates, and the relationship with leg-spinner Clarrie Grimmett was one that became frosty. Before that, the pair played and won together plenty for Australia and for South Australia, after both moved to Adelaide, but after Clarrie’s record-setting 44 wickets in a series for Australia in South Africa in 1936, Don punted him from the team for a little-known competitor who didn’t do much with the spot.‘Having a Bazball at Noosa’: Australian media goes to town over England’s mid-Ashes beach breakRead moreClarrie carried on domestically for a few more years, setting an Australian first-class season record of 73 wickets, and still holds the overall wicket record for the Sheffield Shield. But between seasons in 1938, bored and annoyed that the Australian team was touring England without him, he took up an invitation to visit India and coach a royal cricket enthusiast named the Raja of Jath. Grimmett was a master of spin bowling, but also fancied himself a source of knowledge about batting. In the prince’s employ was a talented youngster named Vijay Hazare, and Grimmett set about correcting Hazare’s defensive technique.In the summer of 1947/48, when cricket was resuming after the war and India visited Australia for the first time, in the middle order was one VS Hazare. His returns were modest until he arrived in Adelaide. On what was home ground for both of them, Bradman was captaining Australia and Grimmett watching from the stands. While Bradman made big runs and forced India to follow on, the Australians were held up across three days by Vijay Hazare.A century in both innings, the first Indian to achieve the feat, against the fast bowling of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, was an all-time effort, and Grimmett celebrated from the seats with both hands clasped above his head. Afterwards he invited Hazare to his home in Adelaide and toasted him at dinner, while Bradman was impressed enough to remark on the grace and tenacity of Hazare’s play. Grimmett’s student couldn’t beat Australia on his own, but he made them work hard for their reward, and nobody could have been more satisfied at sticking one up the Don than Clarrie Grimmett.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26SportblogThe AshesCricketAustralia cricket teamEngland cricket teamAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Patriots will be seeking their 11th straight victory, a streak that includes a 23-20 triumph in October. Buffalo (9-4) has won the past five AFC East crowns but the Patriots (11-2) have improved in Mike Vrabel’s first season as coach and the quarterback Drake Maye’s second with the club.With their decade-long streak of playoff appearances in jeopardy, theKansas City Chiefswill try to ignite their long-shot postseason chances when they play host to theLos Angeles Chargers. The Chiefs (6-7) are on the outside of the playoff field, two games behind the Houston Texans, who hold the third and final AFC wildcard spot. The Chargers (9-4) are playoff eligible as a wildcard qualifier. The last time Kansas City missed out on the layoffs was 2014.

Inside the final days of LeBron James in Los AngelesRead moreClark, who has quickly become one of the faces of the WNBA, understands the magnitude of how this CBA could shape the league going forward.“I think the most important thing for myself, thinking about these CBA negotiations – this is the biggest moment the WNBA has ever seen, and it’s not something that can be messed up,” Clark told reporters Friday after a Team USA training session.“And, you know, we’re going to fight for everything that we deserve, but at the same time, we need to play basketball. That’s what our fans crave ... because you want the product on the floor, and at the end of the day, that’s how you make the money, that’s how you’re marketable. That’s what the fans get excited about. That’s what the fans want to show up for.”Increased salaries and revenue sharing are the current points of contention between players and owners. The two sides have pushed their deadline twice – it was originally supposed to be resolved by 30 October – to now 9 January.Clark is about to enter her third season with theIndiana Feverand has brought with her the legion of fans she gained at the University of Iowa, where she became the all-time leading scorer in women’s college basketball.View image in fullscreenCaitlin Clark speaks to the media after a training camp for the US women’s national basketball team on Friday in Durham, North Carolina.Photograph: Matt Kelley/APShe was an All-WNBA First Team pick as a rookie before battling various injuries in 2025. Clark’s swaggering presence and superb playmaking abilities have been a key contributor to the WNBA’s surge in viewership and attendance over the past two years.By talking to people like Team USA managing director Sue Bird and Fever teammate Brianna Turner, who is on the negotiating committee, Clark is trying to educate herself on the key issues.“It’s business, it’s a negotiation. There has to be compromise on both sides. It’s starting to get down to the wire a little bit. It’s become really important. Obviously I want to help in any way I can,” Clark said.“... But like I said, this is the biggest moment in the history of the WNBA, and I don’t want that to be forgotten. It’s important that we find a way to play this next season.

Pieces start randomly placed on the two back rows, thus drastically limiting opening preparation. Its 2025 season, with a Tour financed mainly by a $12m investment from the venture firm Left Lane Capital, has featured tournaments in Weissenhaus, Karlsruhe, Paris and Las Vegas before the final in South Africa.Carlsen had already won two events and needed only to finish fourth in Cape Town to be sure of Tour victory. He was briefly in danger early on when, sick, he lost his first game to his old rival Fabiano Caruana, saying: “I’m quite aware that I’m just not able to think as clearly as I need on a day like this.” The 5/2 blitz tiebreaks brought a further challenge: “I had to tell myself several times, make a move, c’mon, what are you doing.” He survived that: “When it comes down to a bullet scramble, I’m a bit better than they are,” and alsowon his semi-finalagainst the World Cup champion, Javokhir Sindarov, who turned 20 during the tournament.View image in fullscreen4002:Peter Large v Ioan Rees, Gavin Wall Memorial, Darlington 2025. White to move.How can he stop Black playing Qxg2 mate?Illustration: The GuardianCarlsen really enjoys Freestyle: “It has brought back the feeling of pure discovery – you never know the position, you have to think and create.”Aronian took a different and more relaxed approach. He was undecided who to pick for his quarter-final opponent, so got his wife, Anita, to make the choice. After defeating Hans Niemann in that match, he expressed surprised satisfaction at getting so far, and then, after a somewhat lucky victory over Germany’s Vincent Keymer in their semi-final, he simply said: “I’m rich!”Aronian’s good fortune continued against Carlsenin the final, where the Norwegian chose a dubious opening gambit and never had sufficient compensation for two pawns.In the return game, Aronian established a solid position and easily held off Carlsen’s endgame attempts. The former Armenian No 1 completed 17 games over four days of play without a single loss.Keymer finished third after the German world No 4 defeated Sindarov 2-0. Caruana, the world No 3 and US champion, beat India’s world No 5, Arjun Erigaisi, 1.5-0.5 in the fifth place match, while Niemann beat Iran’s Parham Maghsoodloo 3-1 for seventh.Last week’s XTX Markets London Classic at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium proved a success for England’s grandmasters, who took third, fourth and fifth places behind the world stars Nodirbek Abdusattorov (Uzbekistan) and Alireza Firouzja (France).Final leading totals were Abdusattorov 7.5/9, Firouzja 5.5, Nikita Vitiugov (England) 5, Luke McShane and Michael Adams (both England) 4.5. The prizes were £25,000, £15,000 and £10,000. The organisation of the event was widely praised.Abdusattorov, 21, demonstrated his skills with a dominant 2900+ tournament performance. His dedicated approach was reminiscent of the Soviet grandmasters of the last century and he scored six wins in a row, a rare achievement in elite company, before easing into first prize and a final 2932 tournament performance rating.In afrank and detailed interviewafter the tournament, he revealed how he motivated himself by channelling his disappointment over his failure in the World Cup into a desire for revenge, and then boosted his energy with his winning sequence.XTX Markets, which sponsored the London Classic for a second successive year, also backs ChessFest, the annual free open chess day in Trafalgar Square, which takes place in July.The Classic’s final event was the Super Rapidplay, a 10-round competition staged last weekend at the London Novotel West Hotel with a huge entry of more than 300.Abdusattorov overwhelms rivals at Arsenal but England hit back in styleRead moreIt produced three notable performances. Greece’s top player, Nikolas Theodorou, 25, won the £10,000 first prize with 9/10 after defeating Abdusattorovin the final round. The Uzbek GM lost on time at the end, but he had no defence to Theodorou’s passed d pawn. Firouzja, the world No 6, won the £5,000 second prize in the final round with adevastating 23 Nxh7! sacrifice.Theodorou scored 9/10, Firouzja 8.5, with six players sharing third on 8. A major surprise came among the players sharing ninth place on 7.5/10, where Livio Cancedda-Dupuis, 15, emerged as the top English junior ahead of the established national trio of Shreyas Royal, Sohum Lohia and Stanley Badacsonyi.Cancedda-Dupuis lives in Putney, London, where he attends the Ashcroft Technology Academy. He has played few classical tournaments but has an impressive online presence including more than 40,000 one-minute bullet games with a lichess rating above 2900 and more than 15,000 blitz games with a rating above 2770. His ambition is (of course!) to become a grandmaster.The teenager’s Super Rapidplay performance was rated at 2515, which in a classical event would easily qualify for an IM norm. It included 3.5/6 against GMs, and 4-0 against others. His biggest scalp was the former US champion Sam Shankland, whoblundered the exchange.Cancedda-Dupuis said that he recommends players wishing to improve to concentrate on tactical awareness, and also to play many online games so as to become familiar with typical openings and structures. His special hero is Carlsen, and he also admires Hikaru Nakamura and Firouzja, whogave him a lesson here.4002:1 Qh8+ Rg8 2 Qxg8+!

Hours later, police arrested Moore after he was accused of assault in Pittsfield Township, a community near Ann Arbor.Moore is accused of “unlawfully entering the dwelling of a victim with whom Mr Moore had a dating relationship”, the Washtenaw County prosecutor’s office said Friday.Michigan prosecutors said Moore “terrorized” his former girlfriend after losing his head coach job.Defense attorney Joe Simon said Friday, “There’s no evidence to suggest he’s a threat.”Michigan has not disclosed details of the alleged relationship but said an investigation found credible evidence against Moore, who is married with three young daughters. Athletic director Warde Manuel said the behavior was “a clear violation of university policy”.View image in fullscreenSherrone Moore signed a five-year contract with a base annual salary of $5.5m (£4.1m) last year.Photograph: Jeff Kowalsky/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockMoore signed a five-year contract with a base annual salary of $5.5m (£4.1m) last year. According to the terms of his deal, the university will not have to buy out the remaining years of his contract because he was fired for cause.Moore, the team’s former offensive coordinator, was promoted to lead the Wolverines after they won the national title. He succeeded Jim Harbaugh, who returned to the NFL to lead the Los Angeles Chargers.Michigan are set to play No 14 Texas on 31 December in the Citrus Bowl. Biff Poggi, who filled in for Moore when he was suspended earlier this season in relation to a Harbaugh-era sign-stealing scandal, will serve as interim coach.While the school seeks a new head coach, the Wolverines may lose players in the transfer portal this winter and donors who help fund revenue-sharing and NIL deals may hesitate to invest in the winningest program in college football history.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsMichiganUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The four-time defending division champions face the Panthers (7-6) twice in the final three games.Wearing their Creamsicle jerseys on the 48th anniversary of the franchise’s first win – that one came after an 0-26 start – the Buccaneers were booed off the field.After Pitts made a leaping, acrobatic grab for a seven-yard TD with 3:34 remaining to pull the Falcons within 28-26, Cousins was pressured and threw incomplete on the two-point conversion try.The Falcons forced the Buccaneers to punt and got the ball at their 30 with no timeouts and 1:49 to go.Haason Reddick sacked Cousins, forcing a fumble that the Buccaneers grabbed coming out of the pile. But officials ruled it was recovered by both team simultaneously, and the Falcons kept the ball.Pitts finished with 11 catches for 166 yards, becoming the first tight end with 150 yards receiving and three TDs since Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe did it in 1996. Cousins went 30 of 44 for 373 yards.Mayfield tossed a six-yard TD pass to Devin Culp, the second-year pro’s first scoring reception in theNFLthat made it 20-14.On the ensuing drive, Sills dropped what should have been a 44-yard TD catch and the Falcons ended up punting.Bijan Robinson fumbled on Atlanta’s next possession after taking a shot from Christian Izien and Jacob Parrish recovered at the Falcons 25.Mayfield fired a three-yard TD pass to Chris Godwin Jr. and the two connected for the 2-point conversion to extend the lead to 28-14.But Robinson’s six-yard TD run cut the deficit to 28-20 with under 10 minutes left. After the Falcons missed the two-point try, Dee Alford picked Mayfield’s pass and Atlanta drove 67 yards for a score.Mayfield had all of his wide receivers available for the first time this season after six-time Pro Bowl pick Mike Evans and second-year pro Jalen McMillan were activated from injured reserve. Evans broke his clavicle on 20 October. McMillan broken three vertebrae in his neck in the preseason.Evans made an immediate impact, catching six passes for 132 yards and drawing several penalties.Pitts was wide open for his first two TD catches. He caught a 17-yard pass from Cousins to give the Falcons a 14-10 lead under one minute left in the first half.Cousins tossed an eight-yard TD pass to Pitts to tie it at 7, one play after an offside penalty on cornerback Zyon McCollum during a field goal gave Atlanta a first down.Cousins beat the Buccaneers twice last year in his first season with Atlanta. He threw for 785 yards, eight touchdowns and only one interception. He had 509 yards passing against them in one of the wins.Tampa Bay’s Chase McLaughlin connected on field goals of 52 and 49 yards.

Will I follow England to the 2026 World Cup? No, no, noPhilip CornwallFifa’s demand that the most fervent supporters cough up a minimum of £5,000 in advance just for tickets is scandalousFri 12 Dec 2025 18.59 CETFirst published on Fri 12 Dec 2025 16.55 CETShareIt was not mathematically confirmed until theLatvia gamea month later, but as I watched Ezri Konsa turn in the third goalaway to Serbia in early SeptemberI smiled to myself in the Stadion Rajko Mitic, knowing England were going to the World Cup. But immediately, a key question surfaced: was I? The answer came on Thursday, with theannouncement of the ticket prices that the most loyal supporters of international football would have to pay. And that answer, emphatically, was no, as it will be for countless supporters worldwide. If you had asked me as a hypothetical what seeing England in a World Cup final was worth, I might have said: “Priceless.” But $4,185 – £3,130 – just for the match ticket? No, no, no.As a fan, I have been to 14 tournaments – nine European Championships and five World Cups – dating back to Euro 92. I have the money, or at least could get it by dipping into my pension pot, which I was braced to do for hotels and flights. But, in a sentiment being echoed across England, Scotland and all the other qualifying nations, I’m not spending a minimum of about £5,000 simply on match tickets, the price Fifa has put on watching your team from group stage through to the final (the exact total will vary, depending on where a country’s group matches are).Welcome to the 2026 World Cup shakedown! The price of a ticket: the integrity of the game | Marina HydeRead moreThe prices announced on Thursday were for the supporters who have already trekked across their own continent, creating the atmosphere at and around national-team matches. This year I have been to Barcelona, Belgrade, Riga and Tirana, as well as going to Nottingham, Birmingham and Wembley multiple times. It’s to these supporters, in each country’s membership scheme, that the competing teams’ allocations of tickets go, 8% of the total in each ground. That 8% provides a much higher percentage of the atmosphere, not just at the finals but in the qualifying matches that give meaning to the jamboree.Talk of paying upwards of £5,000 is not a case ofEnglandfans, or anyone else, being presumptuous about their side going all the way. It’s right that you have to pay the £500 or so for the guaranteed matches – the three group games – now if you want to go to them. But judging from some of the comments on social media, it may be less apparent that if you want to have a ticket from that 8% allocation, you have to pay the £4,500 for knockout games in advance too, however slim your team’s chance of progress may be. I would have to pay that five grand on my credit card in January, and if England faltered I might not get the refund until September; the terms and conditions give Fifa 60 calendar days to cough up once a team is eliminated – minus their $10 admin charge, naturally.It would not only be me paying for my notional seat at the final.Fifacan sell that 8% of tickets many times over. It is unlikely many fans from Curaçao or Cape Verde will fork out for the full package, but goodness knows how many people from other countries also bought what would have been my seat at the 2018 final, for instance. The $10 refund fee is a minor insult compared with knowing Fifa makes a fortune from interest on those millions, while Visa, a Fifa sponsor, will also be quids in if people borrow money for their potential tickets on their credit cards.View image in fullscreenEzri Konsa scores the goal against Serbia that all but ensured England would be going to the 2026 World Cup. But how many loyal fans will travel to watch them?Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersThe meaning of “upwards of £5,000” is also significant. The minimum is buying tickets in the lowest price band, category 3. But if I needed to buy category 2 tickets, I would be up to £8,600. Category 1? £12,400.I boycotted Qatar 2022. I tried to boycott Russia 2018 and was astonished that I saw an actualWorld Cup semi-finaland collected a belated refund on the final. That refund was $455, less than a ninth of what Fifa is asking for next year’s final. Also in 2018, in the bid book for the 2026 World Cup, the organisers suggested category 3 prices of $174 for group games and $695 for the final – expensive but conceivable – with a category 4 at $21 and $128.The whole thing feels like a conspiracy to make Uefa look good; our category 3 tickets for theEuro 2024 finalwere €300 and, as with the other knockout rounds, you bought them after England qualified, rather than having to stump up in advance. The Euro 2028 organisers have made clear their tournament will be accessible, too.The fact that next tournament is at home softens the blows a bit, as that will be eminently affordable for the English and Scots. But there is a danger that a significant segment of fans in other countries will throw their hands up now: what is the point of trekking around the continent if your loyalty in qualifying is rewarded with an expensive kick in the teeth for tournaments?The Football Association should be lobbying Fifa hard for a rethink and contacting other participating federations to do likewise – especially the Spanish and Portuguese, co-hosts with Morocco of the bulk of the 2030 World Cup. I don’t imagine for a second prices will change, but the FAs should make clear they stand against a repeat of this betrayal.There is zero chance, under the current Fifa regime, of England hosting a men’s World Cup, so as much as possible, the FA should withdraw cooperation from the governing body. However, it should extend an olive branch to the governing body’s president and invite him to be guest of honour at every England international. What would it be worth to see Gianni Infantino find out what the Wembley crowd think of him? Priceless.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026FifaFootball ticket pricesEnglandFootball politicsWorld CupcommentShareReuse this content"

And whatever happens on the pitch, off it the parties will be long and loud.Burning down the Baz-house is easy, but what comes after that for England? | Barney RonayRead moreEven Bazball’s nuclear implosion can’t shake this crew of hardened veterans. They’ve been watching England’s batting collapse since before Jamie Smith was born. They’ve seen more dropped catches than Jofra Archer has Test wickets. Their personal stats as an Ashes touring group read: played 37, lost 27, won 6 (I am excluding the Covid series which fans couldn’t travel to). If anyone knows how to weather a whitewash, it’s someone like Dave Peacock, one of their founding members. “The cricket’s been very, very disappointing,” he admits, “but we’re the lucky ones, because we’re on holiday. It’s probably harder for the people at home.”Certainly, if you’re watching along on TV, the Barmy Army do seem to be everywhere this series. Australian cameras at the grounds sometimes appear more interested in the Barmies than in their own fans. TNT Sports regularly uses them as banter-primed buildup to a day’s play, having sponsored their T-shirts and their trumpeter. Even the players on the field are heralding them. On the second dayat the Gabba, when a man clad as King Charles led a chorus of Jerusalem, Joe Root gave him a wave from the non-striker’s end.It’s possible that the Barmy Army’s combination of longevity and ubiquity has now obscured quite how stunning their takeover of travelling fandom has been. Three decades ago a handful of backpackers were drawn together in comical self-deprecation at England’s woeful away record. Today their legacy is so synonymous with the men’s Test side that their colourful, “maverick” crowd is all but establishment itself. They’ve certainly come a long way since Peacock first got them chanting, as a 27-year-old who had recently been made redundant.View image in fullscreenThe remnants of the Barmy Army party after England beat Australia by 106 runs at the Adelaide Oval in January 1995.Photograph: Patrick Eagar/Popperfoto/Getty ImagesHe still remembers the excited anticipation of the opening day of the 1994-95 tour, before Michael Slater carved Phil DeFreitas’s first ball for four at the Gabba. With Australia 224 for two, Peacock started a six-person conga in the stands, winding up the locals with a song about convicts. “The Aussie fans hurled abuse at us, then threw plastic cups – the stuff that we still get today,” he remembers. “But when we got back our little group of 30 England followers had all joined in.”After defeat in Brisbane, England lost one-day and tour matches to Zimbabwe, Australia A and even an academy side. Anyone following Mike Atherton’s men around the country must have been barmy indeed. By the Melbourne and Sydney Tests their ranks had swelled to the hundreds, and but not everyone appreciated the football-terrace flavour they brought to the cricket ground. Their first critic, Ian Wooldridge of the Daily Mail, called them “the detritus of the English national social security system”.The players, however, genuinely enjoyed their presence at the grounds, and even their company in the bars. When England pulled off a consolation win in the fourth Test in Adelaide, Alec Stewart beckoned Peacock up to the team balcony and had him lead the celebrations, Tetley’s in hand. You’d have thought that Covid, social media and an ever-tightening England bubble would have distanced the fans and players since. Instead, teams have treated them with increasing respect. Even Mark Wood’s injury announcement this week made a point to thank them for being “class as always”.View image in fullscreenA fan dressed as King Charles leads the Barmy Army revelry at The Gabba in Brisbane.Photograph: Jono Searle/EPABut then, the sheer numbers the Barmy Army can conjure are as attractive to the English game as they are to overseas venues. At this Ashes alone, their tours will host 3,000 paying travellers, with an events-packed programme that requires dozens of people to deliver. All kinds of celebrations are planned for the 30th anniversary next week, including a Twenty20 match (dubbed The Bashes) that will take place at the beautiful University Ground the day before the Test begins.This is, after all, an organisation born of cricketing passion and commercial nous. The reason the Barmy Army date themselves to the Adelaide Test is because that was when they started selling souvenir shirts. The short initial run was so instantly popular – and profitable – that they kept the Hindley Street printers in work all week. Since then Paul Burnham and Gareth Evans, Peacock’s co-founders, have helped turn a fan community that liked to throw parties in pubs into an industry-leading tour operator.That brings it own challenges, especially at a time when sport is looking to shed some of its lads-lads-lads image. The Barmy Army’s managing director, Chris Millard, is keen to point out that 30% of their travelling fans are now female. As times have changed, the chants have had to get cleaner, too. “Things that you’d say 30 years ago you can no longer say today, and that’s absolutely right,” says Millard. “We can’t tell someone how to behave within the confines of their seat, but wewon’t support songs that are offensive, or have swearwords in.”Might the Barmy Army mellow naturally? The average supporter age is now 47 – approaching middle age, like the founders themselves, who have been happy to step away from the daily operation. Peacock is enjoying this tour purely as a punter – leaving young professionals to populate the Barmy Army’s social media, and present its podcast. “You forget how hard it used to be to communicate with each other,” laughs Peacock. “We used to do it all by word of mouth – ‘everyone’s going to the pub!’”As for this Ashes series, the impossible dream of the 3-2 turnaround still lingers, which is very mid-90s indeed. And if England do lose in Adelaide … well, South Africa next Christmas looks nice.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesEngland cricket teamCricketAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

He has returned to the squad for the visit of Brighton.Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPALiverpool‘Mo has misjudged the mood’: five Liverpool fans on the Salah sagaWe ask supporters for their take on the Egyptian’s uneasy stance with the club before Saturday’s game with BrightonJosh Williams, Chris Smith, Chloe Bloxam, Adam Smith and Andrew BeasleyFri 12 Dec 2025 13.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 22.20 CETShareJosh Williams, writer and podcasterMohamed Salah is one of the greatest players in Liverpool’s history. That isn’t open for debate. But everyone makes mistakes, and afterthe draw at Leeds, Salah made a huge one. By seeking the media toair his personal grievances, he essentially justified Arne Slot’s decision to bench him for three consecutive games. Salah’s recent behaviour suggests he’s an individual playing in a team sport. An individual who Liverpool can’t quite afford to carry right now.Liverpool had conceded 10 goals in three games before Salah’s removal. That had to stop. And with the Egyptian struggling to deliver in the final third this season, it made sense for Slot to experiment without his superstar. The player who defends the least. And just to reaffirm that message, Slot placed Dominik Szoboszlai – Liverpool’s best presser – in Salah’s place.Liverpool’s subsequent matches have been less thrilling for the neutral, with the Reds restricting West Ham, Sunderland and Inter to very little in terms of valuable shots. And Leeds created virtually nothing in 72 minutes before Ibrahima Konaté’s random blunder changed the whole landscape. Slot is prioritising stability over stardust right now. And Salah is taking it personally.Chris Smith, author of Always LiverpoolIt is possible to be disappointed in Salah’s actions – in my view emotionally driven rather than nefariously calculated – but still have sympathy with his sentiment. Salah has a right to feel scapegoated and undefended. By bombing him out, Slot breathed life into the narrative that Salah istheproblem. Was it deliberate and self-serving? Doesn’t matter. It conveyed a message: Liverpool were moving on from the player whofired us to a title. And Mo had something to say about that.In part this is a crisis of Slot’s own making. The communication breakdown is a failure of man management. I already had massive concerns over how Slot disregards certain squad members, and for sure Mo required especially careful handling. Now Salah is cast as a pariah, and Jamie Carragher is leading the pitchfork parade. No longer a “little dancer!” and instead selfish and egotistical. To castigate those traits ignores how Liverpool have benefited tremendously from Salah’s unwavering belief in his own greatness and hunger to achieve more, for himself and us.Salah still has immense value to this team. The idea that his powers have waned so dramatically and so soon is absurd. The situation is redeemable, but I doubt that’s the club’s desire, despite Salahreturning to the squad for Saturday’s game against Brighton. Mo’s Liverpool career probably ends here. And that’s desperately sad.View image in fullscreenSalah in happier times with Liverpool supporters following the Premier League title-winning victory over Tottenham at Anfield in April.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersChloe Bloxam, presenter for The Redmen TVLiverpool have been having a turbulent season and Salah’s comments last weekend have only heightened the sense of disarray around the club. The Egyptian King is an Anfield legend, one of the very best to ever wear the red shirt, and undoubtedly a Premier League great. All of that being said, I don’t agree with the way he went about voicing his frustration in public and seeking out the media.I can understand Salah’s frustration at not starting – players with elite mentality shouldn’t enjoy sitting on the bench. But the reality is he’s not been in form and Szoboszlai, who has replaced him at right wing for the past three Premier League games, has been Liverpool’s heart and soul. If any player has a problem with the club or the manager, it should be discussed and resolved internally and away from the public eye, especially now given how much attention and scrutiny has been on Merseyside recently. In that regard it’s good news Salah isback in the squad for Saturday’s game against Brightonfollowing talks with Slot.Overall, this entire saga reflects badly on the club and it has caused an unnecessary divide in what should be a united fanbase, one that is doing everything it can to help Liverpool turn their season around.Adam Smith, contributor to The Anfield WrapFirst and foremost, Salah is a Liverpool legend. When the dust settles on his career, he will go down as one of the best to ever pull on the shirt. As with all superstars, Salah can also be incredibly selfish. Thisisn’t the first timehe has used the press to play out his side of an argument, having spent the rest of his Liverpool career studiously ignoring journalists when they’ve asked to speak to him.I do wonder, though, if this is the first time that he has misjudged the mood of supporters. Although some will agree with him no matter what, others have been saddened by his attempt to make it a “me or Slot” argument at a time when backs are against the wall. I’ve therefore asked myself, why it is that he’s chosen to do this now? I can’t get away from the sense that he is a man staring his footballing mortality in the face and being afraid of what comes next.The long-term future of Liverpool doesn’t includeMohamed Salah, which I can well imagine isn’t a nice prospect for him. Maybe he’s laying the groundwork to jump before he’s pushed.View image in fullscreenDominik Szoboszlai has predominately replaced Salah on Liverpool’s right side and, throughout the season, been the team’s ‘heart and soul’.Photograph: Gabriele Siri/IPA Sport/ipa-agency.net/ShutterstockAndrew Beasley, freelance football writerWhat Salah did is unacceptable. No player is bigger than Liverpool, irrespective of their personal contribution. Yet Salah seems to think he is. “I don’t have to go every day fighting for my position because I earned it,” he said at Elland Road. Earned it in the past, certainly, but now? Not so much. Slot was right to experiment without him.Salah hasn’t just under-delivered in 2025-26; he has got only two non-penalty goals and assists more than Szoboszlai this calendar year. Despite playing in a variety of positions, the Hungarian has delivered almost as much tangible output as a man for whom such numbers are a specialist subject.While Liverpool’s title defence has been poor, their troubles have been overblown a touch. The champions are three points behind fourth in the league and are ninth in the Champions League. The outlook could soon be considerably brighter. Everyone puling in the same direction would help, but the highest-paid player at the club appears to feel exempt from doing that. It has been suggested that Slot has lost the dressing room. Based on the togethernessshown in Milan, it is perhaps likelier Salah has lost it.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolMohamed SalahfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They have also dropped points against Atalanta, Brentford, Bournemouth, Brighton, Leeds, Qarabag and Sunderland. It is clear that winning against smaller sides remains a problem for Enzo Maresca. Chelsea rise to the big occasion but inconsistency flares when they are expected to win. They do not like playing against deep defences – Maresca has often reacted with dismay when opponents switch to a back five to counter his carefully formulated plans – and can be forgiven if they are edgy about hosting Everton on Saturday. David Moyes’s side have just recorded clean sheets at Bournemouth andManchester United. They will back themselves to neutralise Chelsea’s attacking talents.Jacob SteinbergChelsea vEverton, Saturday 3pm (all times GMT)2Is this really the end for Salah at Anfield?So, is this really it? After 250 goals in 420 appearances, Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup and Club World Cup titles, plus numerous individual awards and records, is this the day Mohamed Salah says goodbye to Liverpool? Will he even get the opportunity? Arne Slot’s side are unbeaten in the four games since Salah was dropped. In his now infamousinterview at Elland Road,Salah claimed he had asked his parents to join him at Anfield on Saturday when he will bid farewell to Liverpool fans before departing for the Africa Cup of Nations. He did not specify at the time whether it would be a permanent or a pre-tournament farewell, but battle lines in this unedifying episode have been drawn since then. On both sides. Liverpool consider his removal from first-team selection temporary and in the best interests of all concerned. Salah, judging by his lonely training ground selfie posted on the day of Liverpool’s importantChampions League win at Inter, sees it as another snub. This is no way for a legendary Liverpool career to end but a reconciliation looks far off. Perhaps another game out of the Liverpool spotlight and a month in Morocco will give Salah time to reconsider his stance.Andy HunterLiverpool v Brighton, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenWill Mohamed Salah wave goodbye to Anfield on Saturday?Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA3Broja deserves chance for goal-shy ClaretsArmando Broja’s career has been stalled by injuries and unsuccessful loans, holding back a clearly talented striker. One of those forgotten spells was at Fulham, where eight Premier League appearances brought no goals. He finally left Chelsea permanently in the summer but is yet to get up to speed, featuring nine times off the bench for Scott Parker’s Burnley without scoring. The Albanian’s teammates aren’t doing much better, especially at home where the Clarets have netted five times in seven league games, losing four times in the process. Parker is a conservative manager, relying on a strong defence as the foundation for victory. Burnley are not nicking the desired goals, and wereeasily brushed aside by Crystal Palacelast time out. The manager has told his players to be brave but maybe he is the one who needs to show more courage and start Broja, who has the potential to find the net regularly.Will UnwinBurnley v Fulham, Saturday 5.30pm4Jesus hoping for Christmas cheerGabriel Jesus is confident he can recapture his best form after recovering from the anterior cruciate ligament injury that sidelined him for almost a year. The Brazil striker came on as a substitute inArsenal’s 3-0 win at Club Bruggeon Wednesday night and will be hoping for more minutes when Mikel Arteta’s side face rock-bottom Wolves on Saturday. “One hundred per cent,” said the 28-year-old when asked whether the best is still to come from him. “I’m a different guy when I have a smile on my face. I’m 100% sure, and then obviously now I’m more experienced, now I had 11 months of doubting, of stepping back and watching everything around me, that has helped me a lot. I know if I have the chance I am going to go there and do my best to help the team, like everyone else here.”Ed AaronsArsenal v Wolves, Saturday 8pmView image in fullscreenGabriel Jesus is looking to force his way back into Mikel Arteta’s plans.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty Images5Clyne has big shoes to fillThe news that Daniel Muñoz requires knee surgery could not have come at a worse time for Crystal Palace, given they are in the middle of a month featuring eight matches in three competitions. The Colombia defender is so integral to Oliver Glasner’s system that he hadn’t missed a game untillast weekend’s win against Fulhamwhen the veteran Nathaniel Clyne – who made his first appearance for Palace way back in 2008 – stood in. The 34-year-old may not have the same energy as Muñoz but does provide a solid defensive base and that could be crucial for Sunday’s meeting with Manchester City. Pep Guardiola has never lost at Selhurst Park but will be wary of Palace’s threat aftera thrilling 2-2 draw last seasoneven without Muñoz, who opened the scoring almost exactly a year ago.EACrystal Palace vManchester City, Sunday 2pm6Howe tasked with tricky derby puzzleWill Régis Le Bris’s midfield trio of Noah Sadiki, Granit Xhaka and Enzo Le Fée outshine Eddie Howe’s first-choice three of Bruno Guimarães, Sandro Tonali and Joelinton at the Stadium of Light on Sunday? It will be the first Wear-Tyne derby for nearly two years –Newcastle won 3-0in the FA Cup third round in January 2024 – and the first in the league for almost a decade. If Le Bris’s team pretty much picks itself, Howe has dilemmas after Wednesday night’s2-2 Champions League draw at Bayer Leverkusen. Does he replace Aaron Ramsdale with a potentially fit again Nick Pope in goal? Does he drop Malick Thiaw – who struggled in Germany until injury forced Patrik Schick’s half-time removal – and recall Fabian Schär? And should he rest the exhausted-looking Tonali and offer the 19-year-old Lewis Miley a start in midfield? If Joelinton fails to recover from injury in time Miley may play anyway but, regardless of personnel, Newcastle will need to improve at defending set pieces or Le Fée’s deliveries could undo them.Louise TaylorSunderland v Newcastle, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenEddie Howe has some conundrums to solve this weekend.Photograph: James Marsh/Shutterstock7Gibbs-White can fire up Forest’s seasonFor a long time last summer, it looked as if Morgan Gibbs-White was heading to Tottenham for £60m before Nottingham Forest complained about tapping up and convinced their playmaker to sign a new contract. Gibbs-White was the man who led Forest to seventh last season but his powers have been somewhat stifled in a struggling team. He has three goals and only one league assist to his name, which came on the opening weekendagainst Brentford, and will be desperate to add to that as Forest look to move up the table from 17th. Gibbs-White has to embrace the fact he rejected a Champions League team to stay with the club that helped ignite his career and, if he does that on Sunday, it could do the same for Forest’s season. In this fixturea year ago, Gibbs-White created the winner for Anthony Elanga and the majority inside the City Ground will be hoping for a repeat.WUNottingham Forest v Tottenham, Sunday 2pm8Hammers need Summerville on top formProducing a better end product has to be the aim for Crysencio Summerville. The Dutch winger gives West Ham a different dimension when he is fit – which has not been often since his move from Leeds last year – but he has to do more in the final third. Summerville missed chances duringlast week’s draw with Brighton, has not scored this season and has not registered an assist sinceWest Ham’s win over Nottingham Forestin August. There is no doubt, though, that he is a dangerous player. Summerville worries full-backs with his pace and trickery. He will give Matty Cash a good test when Aston Villa visit the London Stadium on Sunday, but West Ham need the 24-year-old to do more.JSWest Ham vAston Villa, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenCrysencio Summerville has shown glimpses of excellence for West Ham, but must improve his finishing.Photograph: Ashley Western/Colorsport/Shutterstock9Leeds ready to sting the BeesBrentford have won five of their first seven league games at home, dropping points only to Chelsea,in a 2-2 draw, and ina narrow defeat to Manchester City, but have been victorious away on only one occasion, at West Ham. The Gtech Community Stadium is the difference between Keith Andrews’s side being comfortably above the relegation zone and part of the battle at the bottom. Leeds arrive in west London off the back of a positive week after beating Chelsea and securing a dramatic late drawagainst Liverpool. Daniel Farke has built a towering side and they will be ideally equipped to deal with the constant threat of set-piece deliveries from the hosts, meaning Brentford may need to implement plans B and C too. Now Leeds prefer a back five, the ability of Dango Ouattara to find the spaces in between defenders could be crucial.WUBrentford v Leeds, Sunday 4.30pm10United improving but still lopsidedManchester United have lost just one of their last nine Premier League games and equally encouraging is the fact that Ruben Amorim’s men have grabbed four goals twice, 15 matches into the campaign. Last season’s4-0 home win over Evertonwas the sole time this occurred in the league in 2024-25, while Monday’s 4-1 dismantling of Wolves at Molineux followed the 4-2 victory over Brighton at Old Trafford in October. Last season’s dismal goal tally of 44 will surely be overtaken. Twenty-six is the current count but, if Bournemouth want a rosier augury, the 22 conceded show how United’s defence is still malfunctioning.Jamie JacksonManchester United vBournemouth, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal1519332Man City1519313Aston Villa157304Crystal Palace158265Chelsea1510256Man Utd154257Everton151248Brighton154239Sunderland1512310Liverpool1502311Tottenham Hotspur1572212Newcastle1522213AFC Bournemouth15-32014Brentford15-31915Fulham15-41716Leeds15-101517Nottm Forest15-111518West Ham15-121319Burnley15-141020Wolverhampton15-252Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendLiverpoolBrighton & Hove AlbionChelseaEvertonBurnleyFulhamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Rams, the NFC’s current No 1 seeds, are welcoming the Lions, who claimed top seed in the conference last season. The Denver Broncos, the AFC leaders, host the Green Bay Packers who still have a shot at a first-round bye in the NFC. Either way you go you won’t be disappointed. Only there is a third way: Buffalo v New England. The emphasis is on the bounty that winning brings rather than the perils of defeat on Sunday. The Patriots can wrestle back the AFC’s No 1 seed while Buffalo can give themselves a shot at snatching the AFC East title from New England. Oh, and two MVP candidates in Drake Maye and Josh Allen are running the show. It could be a classic.What the Bills need to do to win:Take care of the football. In Week 5 the Patriots beat the Bills 23-20, or rather Buffalo gifted their rivals a win via three costly turnovers. Allen and company witnessed the devastating effect of turnovers only last week against the Bengals when Joe Burrow’s pair of interceptions completely flipped the snow game allowing the Bills to roar back. If the Bills cut out mistakes to increase their chances of getting into the red zone, they can exploit one of New England’s weaknesses. The Patriots’ opponents score a touchdown on 73.1% of trips into the red zone, the highest rate in theNFLthis season.If Allen can make drives last the distance then his ability to demolish New England with his arm or running power surely drives those odds of scoring even higher. What should allow Buffalo to really settle into moving the ball with precision is how their defense has begun to make plays through Christian Benford. The cornerback is the first player in franchise history to score a defensive touchdown in successive games while making a sack and recovering a fumble in their most recent pair of wins. If that doesn’t inspire some confidence, nothing will.What the Patriots need to do to win:Pour resources into containing Buffalo’s running game. New England rank third against the run (89.5 yards per game). When they beat the Bills earlier this season, James Cook could only manage 49 yards on 15 carries, his third-lowest total of 2025, and the Pats finished with 118 yards, their fourth-lowest mark on the ground as a team.If the Patriots slow down Cook, it will make put more burden on Allen to produce against the Patriots’ solid pass defense. The stats haven’t been pretty but New England’s dominance for long passages of most games means opponents have been slinging it here, there and everywhere. Those frequent desperate moments – the Patriots have played pass defense on 60.8% of their plays, fifth-most in the NFL – lead to lens-skewing production. The Patriots pass defense more than passes the eye-test in more regular game conditions. They will be confident of handling Buffalo’s weak receiving crew if given enough looks with Cook out of the equation.View image in fullscreenGuess who’s back?Photograph: Ryan Sun/APRising (in a way) – Indianapolis ColtsAfter losing starting quarterback Daniel Jones for the season with an achilles tear the Colts should be toast. They probably still are: their remaining schedule consists of four teams currently in the playoff places – the Seahawks, 49ers, Jaguars and Texans. There’s also the small matter of the man who may start in place of Jones on Sunday: 44-year-old grandfather and high school coach Philip Rivers, who the Colts haveplucked out of retirement to fill the gap. Rivers, if he plays, will almost certainly fail but the Colts could do with a heartwarming story after the pain of losing Jones. Even if the feelgood narrative only lasts a single snap with Rivers handing it off to Jonathan Taylor for a touchdown run, the veteran will have pressed the pieces back together for a brief moment.Falling – Detroit LionsThis season the Lions have a bad habit of following up a victory with a defeat. The yo-yo routine has to stop for the team to stand a chance of making the playoffs – they sit on the bubble at 8-5. Only the Lions have not put a winning streak together since sitting 4-1 after beating the Bengals, and a trip to Los Angeles to face the Rams rings alarm bells. LA destroyed Arizona 45-17 last week. Dan Campbell’s threadbare defense, which just added key safety Brian Branch to its list of 10 injured players, may make it easy for the Rams to score at will again. The kicker for the Lions is that the teams one game ahead in the wildcard race, Chicago and San Francisco, face Cleveland and Tennessee. A loss puts Detroit in a tough spot. However, a glimmer of hope remains in a Week 18 meeting with the Bears. Praying for one defeat to catch them up in time rather than two would feel much more achievable.Race for the No 1 pickThree horses are leading the run at the top pick in next year’s draft: the New York Giants, Las Vegas Raiders and Tennessee Titans. The bottom feeders share a 2-11 record with five more nestled just behind on 3-10. The form book says the Giants and Raiders are the most likely to be duking it out, as they share seven-match losing runs but this is not a battle fought with logic or conventional wisdom. This is a Salvador Dalí inspired fever dream in which wild, random wins from teams on life support emerge at the most awkward moments … with a leg up from the Browns. Yes, Tennessee are still red hot favourites to be choosing first again despite winning last week. The San Francisco machine will run them over on Sunday as the 49ers chase the Rams and Seahawks. The Raiders should stay on their shoulder after a meeting with the Eagles (although who knows these days) while the Giants could make light work of the Commanders and jump into the cluster of teams on three wins.If the season ended today …AFC:1) Denver 11-2; 2) New England 11-2; 3) Jacksonville 9-4; 4) Pittsburgh 7-6; 5) LA Chargers 9-4; 6) Buffalo 9-4; 7) Houston 8-5.

Maresca revealed that the 23-year‑old had a “mixed feeling” after training on Thursday, said that he was “completely bad” after making his comeback as a second-half substitute against Leeds last week and added that he is currently in the group of players whose minutes require careful management.The comments from Chelsea’s head coach did little to boost the sense that Palmer, who was rested as a precaution against Atalanta in the Champions League on Tuesday, will be able to build momentum in time for the World Cup. Maresca explained that it is an unpredictable situation with the playmaker, whose absence has allowed Jude Bellingham, Eberechi Eze, Phil Foden and Morgan Rogers to move in front of him in the fight to earn a spot in attacking midfield for England. “Yesterday he finished the session with a mixed feeling,” Maresca said of Palmer. “Overall he was fine but still a little bit painful.”The Italian is confident that Palmer, who is available when Chelsea host Everton on Saturday, does not need surgery to fix the longstanding groin problem and is hopeful the injury will not need managing for the rest of the season.“It’s something that is a little bit day by day,” Maresca added. “You can see if he’s getting better, some days it can be worse. For instance after Leeds, he was completely bad the day after. And he played half an hour. After Bournemouth, he was OK. He played one hour. There’s not any sense [to it]. It’s day by day that decides how he feels.”Jacob Steinberg2.Moyes will talk to Tarkowski about flashpointDavid Moyes has admitted James Tarkowski needs to tread more carefully with video assistant referees after barging into Dan Ndoye during Everton’s 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest.Forest have made a formal complaint to Professional Game Match Officials after Tarkowski escaped punishment for knocking down Ndoye in the 11th minute last Saturday. Speaking in the buildup to today’s match at Chelsea, Sean Dyche said he was “amazed” his former captain at Everton and Burnley was not shown a card of any description.The referee, Chris Kavanagh, did not see the incident on-field while the VAR, James Bell, could not intervene in what might have been considered a yellow card offence.View image in fullscreenDavid Moyes takes his in-form side to Stamford Bridge.Photograph: David Blunsden/Action Plus/ShutterstockTarkowski has had several run‑ins with opponents this season. “I’ve not [spoken to Tarkowski] but I should do really because with the world we’re in you’ve got to be careful,” the Everton manager said. “The action in the game, I had turned away and was looking at something else but I watched it back on the telly and thought it could have been a yellow card. I didn’t think personally it was a red card but it’s the sort of thing where you don’t want to give the referees or VAR a situation where they might have a decision to make.  We had just gone 1-0 up. I probably will have a word with him and just talk to him about it.”Four wins out of five have moved Everton to within a point of Chelsea and a rare victory on Saturday – they have not won at Stamford Bridge since 1994 – would lift them into fourth place overnight.Andy Hunter3.Arteta says Jesus will stayMikel Arteta has insisted Gabriel Jesus will not be sold and can be Arsenal’s first-choice No 9. Jesus made his injury comeback as a second-half substitute in the 3-0 win against Club Brugge on Wednesday after 11 months away. The Brazil international, 28, brings an extra dimension to Arteta’s frontline but he has just 18 months to run on his contract.After splashing out £64m on Viktor Gyokeres and with Kai Havertz, albeit sidelined with a knee injury, another striking option, Arsenal could be tempted to cash in on Jesus before his deal expires. However, speaking before Arsenal’s match against Wolves at the Emirates on Saturday, Arteta said: “No, I don’t consider that [selling him], especially with the situation that we have right now.“Gabriel has a lot to offer to the team and he’s proven that straight away in the first minute that he was available to play. He’s put so much to be in this position again and now the focus is to be with us.”View image in fullscreenGabriel Jesus after Arsenal’s midweek win in Bruges.Photograph: David Winter/ShutterstockArteta was without eight players for their midweek Champions League clash. The Spaniard would not comment on whether any of Declan Rice, who missed out on the trip to Belgium through illness, and some of the other shorter-term absentees such as William Saliba, Leandro Trossard and Jurriën Timber would be available to face Wolves.PA Media4.Frank hopes for some Solanke ‘good news’Thomas Frank is bored by questions about the fitness of the injured forward Dominic Solanke, but hopes for “good news” on him soon. Solanke’s fitness has been a regular topic of discussion in Tottenham head coach’s press conferences this season given the £65m striker has only made three appearances.An ankle issue disrupted Solanke’s pre-season and Frank has been without the England international since he featured at Manchester City on 23 August, with minor surgery on 1 October unable to speed up the recovery process. Before Sunday’s trip to Nottingham Forest, Frank returned to the subject after Solanke posted an image on Instagram that included an hourglass emoji to hint he may return soon.Frank said: “When he is training fully with the team and is available for selection that’s when I will say something. Hopefully there will be lots of footage of him training but yeah, that is my message.” Pressed further on Solanke given the lack of information around him in recent weeks, Frank provided a number of polite one-word answers that confirmed the 28-year-old is training individually and back on the grass.Pushed further on if he had kicked a ball yet, Frank said with a smile: “I’m happy to answer all these questions. I’m just a little bit bored of it because let’s talk about Forest, it’s much more interesting.”PA Media5.Bowen crucial to Nuno’s escape planNuno Espírito Santo is hopeful a fit Jarrod Bowen can help propel his team away from the Premier League relegation zone. Bowen has been the Hammers’ best player of a tough season so far and scored a brilliant goal inSunday’s 1-1 drawat Brighton. Nuno’s team are in the relegation zone and two points adrift of the last safe spot before Sunday’s game at home to Aston Villa.“I hope he can be involved in every minute because what he gives to the team is huge,” said Nuno of Bowen. “He leads by example, but if the situation comes [that he is injured], I have a group of players who I believe can contribute in the aspect of leadership.”Nuno said he was hoping for an improve defensive showing for the visit of Unai Emery’s team. With 29 goals conceded, West Ham have the joint-third worst defensive record in the league. “We haven’t achieved a clean sheet yet,” said Nuno. “That is something we need to do. There is improvement. But not total improvement.”PA Media6.Forest double down on Aina’s availabilityNottingham Forest are standing firm in their stance that Ola Aina was not fit enough to go to the Africa Cup of Nations with Nigeria. The right-back has not played since suffering a serious thigh injury in a World Cup qualifier for his country in September. He is nearing a return to fitness after surgery and the Nigeria Football Federation repeatedly asked Forest whether he was fit enough to be included in their squad for the tournament in Morocco.However, Forest insisted the player would not be able to go and he was subsequently left out of the Super Eagles squad. Sean Dyche said: “It’s just that he’s not fit. He hasn’t been fit, he’s still not fit. He hasn’t played any football yet. So, that’s all we can offer to that situation, that he’s still not fit. We’ve made that very clear.”View image in fullscreenNottingham Forest’s Ola Aina.Photograph: Andrew Kearns/CameraSport/Getty ImagesForest will lose Ibrahim Sangaré to the competition, though, as he has been named in the Côte d’Ivoire squad. “He’s done well since we got to the club and he’s kind of earned his place back into the side because when we came in it was like a fresh set of eyes for me and my staff,” Dyche added. “That’s the way it goes, these are the sort of challenges we’ve got as a club.”PA MediaExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe talknewsShareReuse this content"

A likable, passionate individual whose career has taken him from unheralded player to the forefront of a club the size ofCelticshould be worthy of high praise. It also feels only two games into the Frenchman’s tenure in Glasgow that he requires all the support he can get.Nancy will receive that backing from the stands. Whatever legitimate grievances Celtic’s fanbase has about the direction of their club and circumstance by which Nancy wascoaxed from Columbus Crew, they are generally wise enough to give the man a chance. Which is not to say there were no howls of outcry when Nancy’s name was initially floated as a potential successor to Brendan Rodgers.Ferguson’s double for Roma piles misery on Celtic in Nancy’s European debutRead moreNancy stood alone with his thoughts for much of Celtic’shumbling at the hands of Roma. He will encounter an even bigger gap between dugout and touchline at Hampden Park on Sunday as Celtic hope to navigate choppy waters by lifting the League Cup. A game that could ordinarily be shrugged off as a competitive non-event – Celtic’s resource dwarfs that of St Mirren – suddenly carries huge significance. Nancy is the first manager in Celtic history to lose his opening two matches. If the run stretches to three, the alarm bells will be heard in Ohio and beyond.It is preposterous that the League Cup offers Celtic a form of salvation. A year ago they were in the midst of a five-match unbeaten run in the Champions League and irritated by ascoreless draw at Dinamo Zagreb. Watching Roma – a strong side, it must be recognised – take a steamroller to Celtic on Thursday evening was the latest indicator of how a squad and environment have regressed. Celtic Park, where sparks usually fly on European nights, was depressingly flat.This will be no easy fix. Nancy took over a Celtic squad that has glaringly dropped in quality in the course of 12 months. On paper, the Frenchman inherited a group of players rejuvenated by Martin O’Neill’s run of seven wins in eight games. Scrape further and you will see the struggle to beat St Mirren, the holding on against Hibernian and the grim 1-0 against hapless Dundee. Celtic were terrific indefeat of Feyenoordin Rotterdam yet underwhelming when edging past the 10 men of Rangersin the League Cup semi-final. O’Neill’s mere presence and conviviality lifted pressure on custodians who hardly appear keen for external scrutiny.Still, had the much-maligned Celtic board kept O’Neill in office, they would have been accused of procrastination. There is also every chance Celtic’s results would have endured a drop off in the very games Nancy inherited. The 48-year-old needed this matter of weeks to prepare for a critical transfer window. He has undoubtedly made mistakes; indeed, at times against Hearts and Roma it was tricky to decipher what on earth Celtic were trying to do. Nancy is, however, worthy of patience and some personnel of his own. He refuses to make excuses but points out, fairly, how difficult it will be to pass on his coaching messages during an intense run of fixtures. O’Neill, as a temporary fix, had no reason to care about the longer term when making selections.View image in fullscreenMartin O’Neill managed seven wins in eight during his spell as interim manager but he was only a temporary fix.Photograph: David Young/Action Plus/ShutterstockCeltic have gone too far in their approach to signing players, where the pursuit of rough diamonds trumps tried-and-tested quality. It should be no shock that they apply a similar policy in the pursuit of a manager. The obvious hope is that Nancy can replicate the work ofAnge Postecoglou, who oversaw Celtic rejuvenation. Sceptics already fear he may drown in Glasgow, in a manner sampled by John Barnes, Paul Le Guen and Pedro Caixinha. Records depict Ronny Deila as a reasonably successful Celtic manager when the Norwegian was anything but. Left-field choices carry huge danger in this city. There is no journey comparative to Nancy’s which serves as evidence he can succeed at Celtic. He must prove the exception to a rule. Whether Nancy’s messages can land, and he is convinced they can, is fundamental.St Mirren are unfavourable opponents in this final. A belligerent team under a belligerent manager in Stephen Robinson is not at all what Nancy would like to see. Celtic have struggled all season to breach the low defensive lineSt Mirrenwill deploy. They have physicality and attacking threat. They must also have viewed Nancy’s early struggles with a rising confidence. Pressure, and no shortage of it, sits on Celtic’s shoulders.Should Celtic lift this trophy they can breathe. Three days later, they face a tricky trip to Dundee United. Aberdeen, Livingston and Motherwell all await before Rangers visit the east end of Glasgow. Nancy will either be empowered by that derby or be a man in deep trouble. Right now, it is impossible to call which option is the more likely.Explore more on these topicsCelticScottish League CupSt MirrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A summer review is standard practice, with the WSL opting to drop the 6.45pm Sunday kick-off this season after consultation with clubs produced the conclusion that it was off-putting to match-going fans. The Sunday evening game was Sky’s best-performing slot for the WSL last season, with an average audience of 144,000.The WSL adopted noon on Sundays for its flagship TV games for the start of a new four-year contract with Sky this season, although the jury remains out on whether this was shrewd. The decision to schedule up to four of the six weekly rounds of matches at the same time has proved unpopular and appears to have had a negative effect on viewing figures.The league’s hands are tied in the short term owing to the limited availability of other slots and its relationship with Sky, which wants to avoid matches clashing with its other football programming where possible. The WSL can use Friday evenings if there is no live EFL game, with Sky broadcasting Everton v Brighton on Friday 23 January for example, and may look to make greater use of that slot where possible this season.The 2pm Sunday afternoon slot is no longer available on Sky because it broadcasts multiple Premier League games at that time, although some of the BBC’s 14 exclusive matches have been scheduled for 2.30pm kick-offs.Sky has the rights to 118 live matches and lunchtime games have become its default this season, with 49 out of the first 66 WSL matches kicking off at midday or earlier. Such kick-off slots often clash with junior and grassroots games, which has had an impact on viewing figures.The Saturday lunchtime slot is particularly problematic for the WSL because it is often up against a live Premier League game on TNT Sports. The scheduling of Arsenal’s game last weekend was especially challenging because it clashed with the men’s side’s Premier League match at Aston Villa, which kicked off live on TNT 30 minutes later.WSL sources said average viewing figures for the Saturday lunchtime game had risen by 11% this season, although Sky broadcast only two games at that time last season, so a meaningful comparison is difficult.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Mohamed Salah has taken a blowtorch to his immediate hopes of returning to the Liverpool starting XI; Real Madrid are apparently in crisis; and Celtic are bad again, their fans perhaps the first in history to dread an approaching cup final. There might be more of that next summer though, with the full scale of ticket prices for Gianni’s jamboree offering a sobering “slap in the face” for fans still celebrating qualification. Not our words, but those of the Football Supporters’ Association and itsEngland Fans’ Embassy, which might sound like a Soccer AM bit, but is part of a European network offering “reliable and independent information to fans”.So while Rio Ferdinand has been busy cross-referencing the draw footage with his script, and Julian Nagelsmann wonders why his Germany side are playing a drink in their opening game, fan groups have been crunching the numbers for travelling supporters – and they make for bleak viewing. On Thursday, it emerged that the cheapest ticket available for the final in – and you’ll like this – the “supporter value tier”will cost $4,185 (£3,120). Fans hoping to watch their team’s entire journey through the draw are looking at a minimum cost of about $7,000 (£5,240) – and that’s just for match tickets. Throw in the price of flights and accommodation, and most supporters are looking at an enormous £10,000 outlay – more than five times the cost of following your team in 2022. The Fifa chief suit appears to have finally got his wish: making us look back atthe Human Rights World Cupwith the tiniest degree of fondness.Football Supporters Europe has labelled the ticket pricing “a monumental betrayal of the ­tradition of the World Cup”, calling on Fifa to pause sales on tickets allocated to participating nations, which – believe it or not – are not subject to dynamic pricing. One Scotland fan told BBC Radio 5 Live that taking his family to the tournament could cost upwards of £15,000. “I would love to take the kids because it may not happen for another 30 years,” he added, writing our jokes for us. Even the very cheapest match tickets are now north of £100 – too rich for our blood, but given that we’ve written this lengthy article slating ticket prices, we’reprobably not getting in to the USA USA USA next summeranyway. Let’s just go the whole hog and add that the Village People are a bit dated. Yes, we went there!Amid the justified outrage and eye-watering totals, we need someone who truly understands the game to remind us what it’s all about. “I know what it means to travel week in, week out, to go and watch your favourite team, because I did this myself.” That’s more like it! “I know what it means to love football and follow a team. Football without the fans is nothing.” Which thrusting egalitarian, which man of the people said this? Oh. It wasGianni Infantino, back in 2016. The game has truly gone.QUOTE OF THE DAY“I would say that the odds of us turning the season around are lower than Leicester winning the Premier League, so they are in our favour, right?” – Newport County are rock-bottom of the Football League but new manager Christian Fuchschats to Ben Fisherabout how being part of one miracle is keeping his spirits high.View image in fullscreenChristian Fuchs in the dugout, earlier.Photograph: Francesca Jones/The GuardianFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERSGoing along with the recent theme on awkward match seating (Football Daily letters passim), I attended a Marseille v Liverpool Big Cup match in 2008. The only snag was the tickets that myself and my Liverpool-supporting mate had were in the Marseille section. We agreed on the way in to say nothing and be subtle. The Marseille fan beside us started to make conversation with me before kick-off. Having lived for a while in Paris, my French was pretty good and he assumed I was from somewhere up the north of France. This assumption was blown up when Steven Gerrard scored and my mate jumped up, exclaiming wildly in his broad scouse accent. I got a decidedly unfriendly side-eye from the Marseille fan for the rest of the game. Needless to say, we didn’t hang about for a beer after the match” – Eoin Balfe.My son and I go to most Brentford games together, so it was a big deal when as a young teenager he was deemed old enough to go to an away match at Villa on his own. His mother, cheerfully un-streetwise, turfed him out of the car as near as she could get to the Holte End. Stood self-consciously in his Brentford shirt, he hastened to pull a hoodie on as a mountainous, bald, heavily tattooed man rumbled in his direction. ‘No need for that mate,’ he said cheerfully with a pat on the back. ‘D’you know where the away turnstiles are? I’ll show ya. So who should we look out for today,’ etc. I’ve always had a soft spot for Villa since then, though admittedly Ollie Watkins has tested it a couple of times” – Simon Skinner.Inyesterday’s Football Daily, you claimed that attending an evening seminar on economic history can be excruciatingly boring for a bunch of young millionaire footballers. As someone with a PhD in history who specialises in the political economy of the Eastern Mediterranean in the 19th century, I can say that this definitely applies to undergrads, the general public, and, maybe, some fellow historians and economists. It might also explain the current state of the world economy” – Dimitris Stergiopoulos (“and probably nobody else – I would be genuinely surprised if other fellow economic historians read the newsletter regularly”).As an American, I have many, many, many things I am inclined to apologise to the world at large for. So many and of such severity that a comedic list of three such things would not actually be funny. But parsing through the merciless cavalcade of apologetic impulses, I would like to say that I am sorry to your readers, my global and invariably good-looking comrades, for having to consider the opinion of Landon Donovan (yesterday’s Football Daily, full email edition).

Most likely – here’s why | Luke BeckRead more“As the Australian Human Rights Commission put it, ‘There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights.’”Reddit argued it was a forum primarily for adults without the traditional social media features the government has “taken issue with”.Reddit was challenging the law on the grounds it infringed on the implied freedom of political communication. It was also seeking to challenge whether Reddit could be considered an age-restricted social media platform under the legislation.It said it was not seeking to challenge the law to avoid compliance, and had implemented age-assurance measures since Wednesday.The company said the vast majority of Redditors were adults, and advertising wasn’t targeted to children under 18. The Apple app store age rating for Reddit is 17+.“Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark on actually protecting young people online,” Reddit said. “So, while we will comply with this law, we have a responsibility to share our perspective and see that it is reviewed by the courts.”Reddit’s challenge is separate from one filed by New South Wales Libertarian MP John Ruddick’sDigital Freedom Project group. The next court appearance for Digital Freedom Project group is late February, and Reddit expects it will be heard sometime next year, if the high court takes up the case.Prof Sarah Joseph, from Griffith university’s law school, said she believes there was a strong case against the ban.“I do believe the legislation has cut off the main source of political information for people under the age of 16, in terms of their receiving and giving information. Whilst that is not the intention of the legislation, that is one of its many effects,” she said.“Whilst other sources remain open, they operate in very different ways and do not provide the same means to communicate one’s opinions, and the same variety of opinions.”But Joseph said she believed the high court case was more likely to fail, as with most challenges to legislation on implied freedom of communications grounds.“The freedom is engaged in most cases, but the high court goes on to find the law to be proportionate. In reality, the constitutional freedom is quite weak due to the way that it has been interpreted and applied.”A law that has the effect of reducing the overall volume of political communication in Australia will be invalid unless it is proportionate to a legitimate purpose, constitutional law professor Luke Beckwrote in the Guardian on Thursday.“[But] the social media account ban only slightly reduces the overall volume of political communication in Australia,” the Monash University academic said.“The law does not ban teenagers from using the internet or having online group chats. It’s likely that in the [Ruddick] social media account case … the government will succeed.”The Guardian revealed on Tuesday thatReddit had argued to the eSafety commissioner in Septemberthat it should be excluded from the ban.“The sole or significant purpose of our platform is to provide knowledge-sharing in timely, context-rich conversations; interaction between end-users is simply an incidental step to enabling this primary purpose,” Reddit said in the letter obtained under freedom of information laws.‘Already had a profound effect’: parents react to Australia’s social media banRead more“It is not in keeping with Reddit norms for users to use their real names or identities on Reddit, as communities are not centred around real-time social networking among young people.”Reddit does not promote real-time presence, friend requests or activity feeds that drive ongoing engagement, the company said. It said it was committed to collecting minimal personal information from users to preserve pseudonymity on the platform.Reddit was a “pseudonymous platform organised around sharing information in topic-based communities rather than personal profiles or social networks,” the platform said.The 10 platforms the government announced were covered by the ban – Twitch, Kick, YouTube, Threads, Facebook, Instagram, Snap, X, TikTok and Reddit – had all implemented measures to comply by Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsSocial media banRedditSocial mediaAustralian lawnewsShareReuse this content"

To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueWhen the UK prime minister launched hisTikTokaccount earlier this week, I assumed we’d get the same slate of cringeworthy content that so many elected officials have given us before.Stiff line delivery, policy talking points awkwardly shoehorned into already outdated memes, and the general feeling a PR person is holding them at gunpoint just out of shot.Alas, no. In a shocking twist, Starmer’s TikToks are borderline competent.The majority of the videos seem to be attempts at ultra short-form cinéma vérité: a camera operator following the prime minister around, catching snippets of him saying good morning to security guards, questioning where chief mouser, Larry the cat, is and greeting the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueThe “peek behind the curtain” style is clearly designed to make the prime minister feel more relatable to young UK voters, and while there’s definitely potential here, all his videos share the same fatal flaw.Starmer cares about looking cool.“Aura farming” is an internet term for someone posting content trying to seem effortlessly suave, handsome or charismatic.And look, for my own sanity, I have to assume Starmer’s team was being tongue-in-cheek when they captioned that plane video: “I’d explain, but it’s classified” – that they were poking fun at people trying to seem cool on the internet.But the more I look through his TikToks, with every shot so carefully curated to make Starmer seem competent and in control, the more I began to feel the accusation of “aura farming” fitted.And on a platform such as TikTok, which trades off vulnerability and intimacy, being caught trying to seem aloof is a crime worse than murder. (Or at least worse than the “millennial pause”, and that’s pretty bad.)There are some rare examples of politicians feeling authentically at home on the app: in the US,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezhas found great success speaking frankly to her iPhone camera from her living room couch. Even a lower-profile politician such as the Australian MPJulian Hillhas cultivated a dedicated following by sharing his frustrations with the opposition from his cluttered parliamentary office.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

Where a little part of you is holding out hope that they might actually reply to your comment.But Starmer never gets within a metre of the camera lens, let alone a comment section keyboard. A style, no doubt, influenced by the fact that TikTok is technically banned on government phones, due to data security concerns, and his team is, no doubt, terrified to imply he might actually have the app downloaded.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

The comments under any politician’s post are going to be filled with far more vitriol than praise – that’s just how the internet works. What’s notable about Starmer’s is just how generic the comments are.It’s all “get this clown out”, “vote reform” and the occasional “best prime minister ever”, but barely any mention of the actual content at hand.Because ultimately, the videos don’t have any content – besides a fleeting sense of novelty, there’s no reason I would ever send them to friends, let alone bring them up at the pub. These videos only exist to prove what a cool guy Starmer is. And he isn’t.So no, the UK prime minister’s first foray into the world of TikTok hasn’t been an utter embarrassment. But it might have been better if it was.Like most politicians, Starmer is an innately dorky man and if he is really serious about winning the hearts (and votes) of young people, his TikTok needs to embrace and celebrate that, not unconvincingly hide it away.I have some ideas for what he could do, and I would explain, but hey, it’s classified.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerTikTokSocial mediaDigital mediaLabourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now – via a degree for developers and an incubator for startups – the tiny city is churning out world-famous video game hits. What is the secret of its success?Ralph JonesFri 12 Dec 2025 14.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 16.12 CETShareOn 26 March 2014, a trailer for a video game appeared on YouTube. The first thing the viewer sees is a closeup of a goat lying on the ground, its tongue out, its eyes open. Behind it is a man on fire, running backwards in slow motion towards a house. Interspersed with these images is footage of the goat being repeatedly run over by a car. In the main shot, the goat, now appearing backwards as well, flies up into the first-floor window of a house, repairing the glass it smashed on its way down. It hurtles through another window and back to an exploding petrol station, where we assume its journey must have started.This wordless, strangely moving video – a knowing parody of the trailer for a zombie survival game called Dead Island – was for a curious game called Goat Simulator. The game was, unsurprisingly, the first to ever put the player into the hooves of a goat, who must enact as much wanton destruction as possible. It was also the first massive hit to come out of a small city inSwedenby the name of Skövde.There’s a good chance you have never heard of Skövde. There’s an even better chance you don’t know how to pronounce it (“hwevde”). Historically, it which is nestled between the two largest lakes in the country, Vänern and Vättern, has relied on Volvo for much of its employment. But, for the last 25 years, there has been a shift. Skövde has managed to produce some of the biggest and most talked-about video games on the planet – not just Goat Simulator but titles like V Rising, Valheim, and RV There Yet?.In a city of 58,000, there are almost 1,000 people studying or making a living from video games there–by comparison the entire gaming sector in the UK amounts to 28,500 people. How can Skövde punch so far above its weight?I am sitting in an office in the university where a revolution took place. At the turn of the century, Skövde implemented something that would separate it from the surrounding cities of a nation already getting a head-start in the gaming world. In the late 1990s Ulf Wilhelmsson wanted to study for a PhD in video games in Sweden. Various universities, he says, told him: “You can’t study computer games, that’s just silly.” He went instead to the University of Copenhagen and had his work funded by the University of Skövde, whom he was working for at the time. In 2001, seeing a lack of students entering the university’s IT programmes, he proposed a video games development qualification. One of the things that made senior staff reluctant was that there were no game companies in Skövde. “I’m quite stubborn,” Wilhelmsson tells me at the university, “and I said: ‘If we build it, they will come.’”View image in fullscreenFangs very much … V Rising.Photograph: Stunlock StudiosIt was difficult at the outset, when the degree began in 2002. “Since we were among the first educational programmes that did this,” says Sanny Syberfeldt, the director of the design programme, “we had no guide or no model, so we have had to make them up as we went along.” The degree is now hugely popular, attracting multiple applicants per seat. “Our aim has never been to help students to fulfil the short-term needs of the games industry,” says Wilhelmsson. “It has always been to change the industry, create something that has not yet been done.”His colleague Lissa Holloway-Attaway, who wears a pink multicoloured jumper with tigers on it, tackles gaming’s hinterland, asking the students to reflect on how gaming can intersect with subjects such as gender, identity and grief. One project involves them creating the prototype for a game that revolves around a historical environment or object.When you’re in a town that is this small but has this amount of game developers, it’s easier to form a game-development communityScience Park Skövde, another crucial player in the city’s continued nurturing of game developers, is right next door to the university’s gaming department. Outwardly an unremarkable white building, inside it feels light and airy, with colourful chairs and jigsaw pieces dotted on the wall. The team at the Science Park run a three-year programme called Sweden Game Start-Up, which incubates teams looking to turn gaming into a viable career, helping them to find funding for their works-in-progress. One colleague says they “loan out self-confidence”. “The goal is for them to exit with a sustainable company that will hopefully live on after they leave the programme,” says Jennifer Granath, who works in communications at the Science Park.Over fika – the Swedish term for a coffee-and-cake break, which in this case involves cinnamon buns – I meet around 30 of the developers in the incubation programme. They range in age from 22 to 45 and are incredibly warm and articulate. With a great deal of pride they show me their games in a big open room. There’s Home Sweet Gnome, in which you are a gnome who runs a bed and breakfast for creatures from folklore; horror golf game Club House on Haunted Hill; and Muri: Wild Woods, in which you are a mouse who goes on a cleaning adventure. Some of these games have been funded and released; some are still in development.View image in fullscreenBilly no mates … Goat Simulator 3.Photograph: Coffee Stain StudiosIt’s invaluable to be here, say the developers, 99% of whom studied at the university. One says that in Stockholm the game companies don’t care about graduates because there are so many of them; in Skövde, a city with 1/20th of its population, everyone knows everyone and scratches one another’s backs. “The size of this city is really to the community’s advantage,” says Louise Perrson, the head of the university’s game-writing programme. “If you come here with the thought of getting into the industry, you also come here knowing – or at least finding out – that you’ll be part of one big community.”It’s significant that the three game studios that have helped to put Skövde on the map – Iron Gate, Coffee Stain and Stunlock – have all stayed in the city. Josefin Bertsson, a community manager at Iron Gate, says: “Without the incubator, the company most likely would not have existed.” Iron Gate’s premises have a sleek, lavish feel: lots of dark wood, plum-coloured sofas, a huge lighting fixture in the shape of antlers. Various swords are dotted about the place; and there is a large model of Sauron’s eye atop a black Lego tower.Sweden is lacking a national strategy for the games industry, even though we’re super-famous for our games all around the worldThe studio is most well known for making Valheim, a Viking survival game in which players are placed in a kind of purgatory and must attempt to ascend to Valhalla by proving themselves to Odin. Its preview version sold around 5m copies in its first five weeks. It may be Skövde’s most successful game. “I think that when you’re in a town that is this small but you have the amount of game developers that you have,” says Bertsson, “it’s easier to form a kind of game development community than in, say, Stockholm. It’s easier to congratulate your friends on something because they’re right next door.”Coffee Stain, whom we have to thank for Goat Simulator, work out of an extraordinary space that was once a bank. (Studio manager Robert Lazic calls it a “bank palace”.) Over several floors there are features like a gym, a massage room, a board game room, and a huge wood-panelled meeting room full of fake trees. Lazic was part of the university’s first cohort of students – “at the fumbling beginnings”, as he puts it. The studio is now focusing on Satisfactory, its latest game, which puts players on an alien planet and tasks them with building factories and increasingly complex infrastructure. Success in Skövde breeds success, he says. Satisfactory has sold 5.5m copies.View image in fullscreenNorse majeure … Valheim.Photograph: Coffee Stain StudiosAt Stunlock I meet Ulf Rickard Frisegård, the company’s CEO, and Tau Petersson, its PR and event manager. It’s shoes off at the door, as in many Swedish establishments. There are velvet teal curtains and board games in cabinets around the place. Stunlock created V Rising, a game in which the player embodies an awakened vampire and builds a castle for them, defeating bosses and swerving garlic along the way. V Rising sold more than 1m copies in its first week. Frisegård and Petersson were also students at the university and are in no doubt about the unique prestige of the city. When you are pitching yourself to people, “you jump through a lot of hoops telling them you’re from Skövde”, says Frisegård. Industry bigwigs make a beeline for it. Frisegård remembers an extremely powerful games industry figure, who he declines to name visiting their offices to take a look at V Rising: “He had a cab parked outside here all day – one person sitting and waiting for him – and then driving him, what is it, one kilometre to the train station.”Nationally, Sweden is a towering force in the video games arena. It is the home of multi-billion-pound giants such as Minecraft and Candy Crush. In 2023 the revenue from Swedish game companies was more than £2.5bn. The country was quick to install high-speed internet and it made subsidised computers available to its population – perfect conditions for games design. I arrived, therefore, under the impression that Sweden’s status in the gaming world meant the national government was very supportive of the industry. Marcus Toftedahl, business coach in game development at the Science Park, says: “Weeelll … that is not true.” It’s a sore point. While the municipality of Skövde has been proud and supportive, the national government has not: “Sweden is lacking a national strategy and lacking a national support system for the games industry, even though we’re super-famous for our games all around the world.” This summer the Science Park went from receiving around £240,000 a year to £80,000 a year from the national government. There is a lack of understanding about game development, Toftedahl says, and the government has shifted towards more research-heavy areas such as AI.Goat Simulator 3 review – a deranged, self-destructive caprine benderRead moreDespite these worries Skövde continues to rightly blow its own trumpet about its gaming successes. But one of the priorities for people in the industry is to ensure that its locals know about them. “It’s well known outside Skövde – maybe not as known in Skövde – that we have this huge international industry that is really successful,,” says Theres Sahlström, the chair of the Skövde Municipal Executive Committee.“So we’re trying to bring attention to it.” She’s talking to me as we’re standing by the Walk of Game on the city’s cobbled high street – a newly created series of reminders of Skövde’s achievements in the gaming world.When people ask Toftedahl if Skövde’s success is replicable in other places, he says that while the short answer is yes the long answer is less encouraging. “The smallness helps,” he says. But even other small Swedish cities haven’t been able to emulate Skövde. On the island of Gotland, for example, there have been university courses on gaming since 2002. But for Gotland, which has almost exactly the same population as Skövde, tourism is the main industry, so the region hasn’t directed as much support towards gaming. You could follow Skövde’s lead – ensure that your town taught video game development at its university; host events where game developers could showcase projects; organise networking events where people felt safe exchanging knowledge – and you would cultivate something special. But lightning simply might not strike twice.Explore more on these topicsGamesSwedenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

New titles were announced, celebrities appeared, and at one point, screaming people were suspended from the ceiling in an extravagant promotion for a new role-playing game.Acclaimed French adventureClair Obscur: Expedition 33began the night with 12 nominations – the most in the event’s history – and ended it with nine awards. The Gallic favourite took game of the year, as well as awards for best game direction, best art direction, best narrative and best performance (for actor Jennifer English).The Game Awards 2025: the full list of winnersRead moreElsewhere, Hades II took best action game, Hollow Knight: Silksong won in best action/adventure and Arc Raiders won best multiplayer. There was a decent showing for the new(ish) Nintendo Switch 2, with Donkey Kong Bananza taking best family game and Mario Kart World scorching across the line with best sports/racing game.It was also a night of big budget video game announcements. Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, a spiritual successor to the classic Xbox series Knights of the Old Republic, was revealed with the original game director Casey Hudson at the helm. Developed by Arcanaut Studios, it’s a single-player narrative adventure set on the brink of major change for the galaxy.Another returning classic was Tomb Raider, which is gettingtwo fresh instalments– a remake of the 1996 original named Legacy of Atlantis, and a new adventure, Tomb Raider: Catalyst.A newcomer to the Divinity series of role-playing adventures was unveiled witha frankly gross trailer. Created by Larian Studios, maker of Baldur’s Gate 3, the game was teased by Game Awards organiser Geoff Keighley who posted photos on social media showinga mysterious statuealong with its coordinates in the Mojave desert.An unexpected highlight was the lovely looking Coven of the Chicken Foot, a fantasy puzzle platformer from Wildflower Interactive, a new indie studio set up by Naughty Dog veteran Bruce Straley, who worked on both Uncharted and The Last of Us. You play an elderly witch called Gertie and a lumbering creature in what looks like an arthouse riff on The Last Guardian.There was anew trailerfor Capcom’s latest survival horror opus Resident Evil Requiem which showed the return of series favourite Leon S Kennedy, now sporting a floppy fringe and leather coat like some sort of emo super cop. He’ll be playable alongside FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft, the characters experiencing parallel adventures with different special abilities.Among dozens of other reveals was4:Loop, a new co-op shooter from the makers of Left 4 Dead and JJ Abrams’ Bad Robot Games, featuring eternally cloned and re-cloned warriors trying to reclaim the world from alien invasion.Ontosis a sci-fi mystery from Frictional, creator of Soma, set in a repurposed hotel on the moon. Remedy Entertainment unveiled the sequel to its acclaimed sci-fi adventure Control; namedControl Resonant, it takes place in a Manhattan reshaped by an invading cosmic force. Wildlight Entertainment, a new studio from members of the Apex Legends and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare teams showed offHighguard, a free-to-play raid shooter. And Wizards of the Coast materialised withWarlock, a dark single-player action-adventure set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe.The Game Awards isa controversial and imperfect beast. But this will be remembered as a night in which an ambitious debut game froma small French studio, with a budget of less than $10m, took all the major awards, beating vastly expensive sequels such as Death Stranding 2 and Ghost of Yōtei. In a modern games industry of billion dollar takeovers and mass redundancies, we must grasp such positives where we can.Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCEventsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They will be the first new games in the series since 2018, and both will be published by Amazon.Announced at the Game Awards in LA, Tomb Raider Catalyst stars the “charismatic, self-assured, formidable Lara Croft” from the original 1990s games, says game director Will Kerslake. It’s set in the markets, mountains, and naturally the ancient buildings of northern India, where Lara is racing with other treasure hunters to track down potentially cataclysmic artefacts. It will be out in 2027.Catalyst is in development at Crystal Dynamics, the Californian developer that has looked after Tomb Raider since 2003. Crystal Dynamics previously developed Tomb Raiders Legend, Anniversary and Underworld, as well as the reboot trilogy that featured a younger, more vulnerable Lara. Its most recent game in the series was 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider.Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, meanwhile, is being developed in collaboration with Flying Wild Hog in Poland. Featuring modernised combat and redesigned tomb-delving puzzles, the game is an “expanded” ground-up reimagining of Lara Croft’s very first 1996 adventure, which established her as one of gaming’s most recognisable characters. “Our goal was to respect the spirit of Core Design’s original game, while updating the experience for today’s gamers including building it with Unreal Engine 5,” Kerslake says. “We see this is a reimagining of the original game with a gameplay experience that wasn’t possible on the technology at the time.” Legacy of Atlantis will be out in 2026.In both games, Croft will be played by the British actor Alix Wilton Regan, who previously had significant roles in Dragon Age: Inquisition and Cyberpunk 2077. She was also due to star as Joanna Dark in the cancelled remake of 2000’s spy-shooter Perfect Dark.Despite the series’ recent hiatus, Tomb Raider still has immense brand recognition, built on its 1990s heyday. Amazon also has aTV series in the workswith Phoebe Waller-Bridge, which is to star Sophie Turner as Croft. Over 30 years, Croft has been everything from Playboy pin-up to rugged wilderness adventurer to gentlewoman action hero.“Across the series, our goal is to show that Lara is always evolving,” Kerslake says. “Her core DNA will remain, but we believe it’s important to show how each adventure shapes her character over time.”This article was amended on 12 December, 2025. An earlier version stated that developer Crystal Dynamics is based in Canada. It is based in California.Explore more on these topicsGamesTomb raiderAction gamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCShareReuse this content"

Let us come together to protect the institution we all loveKeir Starmer is the British prime ministerFri 12 Dec 2025 19.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 19.02 CETShareIam a Labour prime minister who believes in workers’ right to strike. But let’s be clear about the strikesplanned by resident doctorsnext week. They should not happen. They are reckless. They place the NHS and patients who need it in grave danger.I remain hopeful they can be averted. A good deal is on the table, and the British Medical Association (BMA) isputting it to membersthis weekend. My message to the doctors is simple – take it.‘Beyond belief’ that resident doctors could strike amid flu crisis, says StarmerRead moreAfter all, you are no longer fighting a government that sees industrial conflict as a way to score cheap political points. We recognise the damage caused by years of Tory austerity. With this government, your pay has increased by 28.9% over the past three years. Wehave investeda record amount in the NHS, cutting waiting times. And we have listened to your concerns about jobs and training.That is what’s new about the latest deal. We are offering legislation that will prioritise British medical graduates for speciality training jobs starting next year. We will boost the number ofplaces by 4,000,giving new hope to doctors without a job next year. And we have offered to cover the costs of other training expenses such as royal college membership and exam fees.But we also made another offer to the BMA leadership: the chance to extend their mandate so strikes could be rescheduled for after Christmas if our offer was rejected. Don’t get me wrong – of course I would rather they were cancelled. I would rather resident doctors take a deal that improves their training and career prospects and puts money in their pockets. But under the circumstances, I wanted to be sure we have left no stone unturned in our efforts to protect theNHS.Because be under no illusions, those circumstances are potentially dire. The “super flu” epidemic sweeping the country means this is the NHS’smost precarious moment since the pandemic. Last week, an average of 2,660 hospital beds each day were occupied by flu patients – up 55% on the week before and much higher than this time last year. And the epidemic is still growing.Having lived through a pandemic, we all know what this means. It means a battle. On hospital wards across the country, NHS staff will be working around the clock to make sure patients get the care they need and the NHS stays above water. In fact, resident doctors’ colleagues will be cancelling operations, cancelling their Christmas leave and preparing for this coming storm. The idea that strikes could still take place in this context is frankly beyond belief.So resident doctors should vote to stop them. For patients, for the NHS and for the entire country, this dispute should now end. A fair deal for doctors is on the table. And instead of conflict this Christmas, we can come together to improve the NHS we love.Keir Starmer is the prime minister of the United KingdomExplore more on these topicsNHSOpinionKeir StarmerIndustrial actionDoctorsHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer and his fellow leaders have to face this new realityFri 12 Dec 2025 18.36 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 21.08 CETShareWhen are we going to get the message? I joked a few months back that, when it comes to Donald Trump, Europe needs to learn from Sex and the City’s Miranda Hobbes and realise that “He’s just not that into you”. After this past week, it’s clear that understates the problem. Trump’s America is not merely indifferent to Europe – it’s positively hostile to it. That has enormous implications for the continent and for Britain, which too many of our leaders still refuse to face.The depth of US hostility was revealed most explicitly in the newUS national security strategy, or NSS, a 29-page document that serves as a formal statement of the foreign policy of the second Trump administration. There is much there to lament, starting with the sceptical quote marks that appear around the sole reference to “climate change”, but the most striking passages are those that take aim at Europe.China and Russia, which you’d think the US would see as genuine strategic threats worthy of serious attention, are addressed flatly and with relative brevity. It’sEuropethat gets Team Trump’s blood up, against Europe that it unleashes its rhetorical firepower. It warns that economic stagnation, “censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates” and above all, migration, raise “the stark prospect of civilizational erasure”.You don’t need advanced decryption software to work out what that means. The NSS worries that soon some European countries “will become majority non-European”, which can only be a euphemism for non-white. Any doubt on that score was dispelled by the rambling speechthe president delivered in Pennsylvaniaon Tuesday, in which he mused on how the US only takes people “from shithole countries” such as Somalia, asking plaintively: “Why can’t we have some people from Norway, Sweden … from Denmark?”Perhaps this would not much matter if it merely confirmed that Trump and his circle view Europe through the same culture war lens that they apply to the US, blaming migration, DEI and “woke” for enfeebling societies that were stronger when they were solidly white and Christian (their understanding of “European”). But this is not merely a Fox News rant. It’s a plan.The NSS makes clear that theTrump administrationwill not stand idly by as Europe allows itself to become “unrecognizable in 20 years or less”. It plans to join the fight, backing those far-right, ultranationalist parties it hails for their “resistance”. It says that “the growing influence of patriotic European parties” is cause for great optimism and the US will do what it can to help Europe “correct its current trajectory”. In other words, the US is set on pursuing regime change in Europe and will be throwing its weight behind the likes of Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland or AfD, France’s National Rally and, no doubt, Reform UK.Trump’s defendershave sought to arguethat the administration has no problem with Europe per se; it’s the European Union it can’t stand. A Europe of individual, sovereign nation-states would, they say, find a warm embrace in Trump’s Washington. It just so happens that that’s the precise preference of one Vladimir Putin, who has regarded the weakening or breakup of the EU as a strategic aim for decades. No wonder theKremlin lavished praiseon the new US plan, which it was delighted to see aligned with “our vision”.Maybe talk of visions is too grand. Perhaps what leads Washington to share Moscow’s low opinion of the EU is not philosophy but something more basic. Note how a chorus of Trump officials chose torestate their anti-EU stance, always in the loftiest terms of course, straight after Brussels had slapped the former Trump appointee Elon Musk with a €120m fine for“deceptive” practices on his X platform. Could it be that what Trump and his acolytes really dislike about the EU is that it’s one of the few forces on the planet that can curb their power? The EU has muscle, and that alone infuriates the likes of Musk and Trump, especially when the common thread running through this second Trump term is the desire to remove or weaken any restraint on his ability to act. Far better a loose grouping of 27 states he can divide and conquer than a mighty bloc working together.The motive hardly matters: whether the US regards the EU as an enemy for transactional or ideological reasons, it now sees it as an enemy. That much should have been clear within weeks of Trump returning to the White House, and certainly by February when he gave Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dressing down in the Oval Office. But now that the US government has spelled it out in black and white, it is incontrovertible.The trouble is, Europe’s leaders still cannot quite face this painful new truth. The head of Nato, Mark Rutte, ominously announced on Thursday that “Russia has brought war back to Europe” and that “We are Russia’s next target.” He feared that too many don’t feel the urgency of the threat. But he failed to mention that, in this new war, Nato’s most powerful member, the US, has picked a side – and it is Russia.Note how the US is piling the pressure on Ukraine to accept armistice terms congenial to Moscow, instructing Kyiv to withdraw even from those parts of theDonbas region that it still controls, with no guarantee that Russian forces would not simply move in and seize the vacated land. Via aninterview with Politico, Trump told Ukraine it had to “play ball” since Russia had “the upper hand”.Rutte warns of war, urging Europe to prepare itself, yet he has nothing to say about the one-time ally across the Atlantic now turned foe. On the contrary, only a few months ago the Nato boss wasliterally calling Trump “daddy”.Few embody the contradiction more fully than Britain’s own Keir Starmer. He prides himself on his solidarity with Zelenskyy, but remains silent as Trump demonstrates his solidarity with Putin. The prime minister knows that the defence of Ukraine requires combining Europe’s military capabilities, yet last month he allowed the collapse of a plan for the UK to join a majorEuropean rearmament effort. The UK government had wanted to take part in the €150bn (£130bn) scheme, boosting Britain’s defence industry in the process, but balked at the entrance fee.This week, Starmer ruled outrejoining the EU customs union, explaining that he didn’t want to unravel the trade deal secured earlier this year with the US. It’s the same choice, made over and over again, putting the US relationship ahead of the European one, even as the signals could not be any clearer: this love is unrequited.It’s come to something when the sharpest geopolitical voice in Europe belongs to the pope. Leo criticised Trump for “trying to break apart” an Atlantic alliance that remained essential. In the current climate, even naming the problem counts as a radical act. Now it’s time for those leaders who do not speak in the name of God, but for the peoples of Europe, to be as brave.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The price of a ticket: the integrity of the gameMarina HydeIn World Cup parlance, Qatar was Fifa president Gianni Infantino’s qualifier. Now it’s the big time for Trump’s dictator-curious protegeFri 12 Dec 2025 15.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 21.37 CETShareIused to think Fifa’s recent practice of holding theWorld Cupin autocracies was because it made it easier for world football’s governing body to do the things it loved: spend untold billions of other people’s money and siphon the profitswithout having to worry about boring little things like human rights or public opinion. Which, let’s face it, really piss around with your bottom line.But for a while now, that view has seemed ridiculously naive, a bit like assuming Recep Erdoğan followed Vladimir Putin’selection-hollowing gameplanjust because hey, he’s an interested guy who likes to read around a lot of subjects. So no: Fifa president Gianni Infantino hasn’t spent recent tournaments cosying up to authoritarians because it made his life easier. He’s done it to learn from the best. And his latest decree this week simply confirms Fifa is now a fully operational autocracy in the classic populace-rinsing style. Do just absorb yesterday’s news that thecheapestticket for next year’s World Cup final in the USwill cost £3,120– seven times more than the cheapest ticket for the last World Cup final in Qatar. (Admittedly, still marginally cheaper than an off-peak single from London to Manchester.)Like all dictator-curious populists, Fifa loathes its people – the fans. Thinking back, I’ve even been at tournaments where the governing body has sponsored show trials. In South Africa in 2010, we had something called theFifa World Cup Courts– 56 courts where Fifa indicated it had finally outgrown fast food tie-ins and slapped its branding on justice itself. Or rather, on summary justice – which became an official tournament partner as cases were rushed through to appease the governing body. A group of Dutch women who’d worn orange minidresses to a game as stunt-marketing for Bavaria beerwere arrested. Fifa filed criminal charges against the company.Again, in retrospect that all seems rather small beer (sorry). Orange-coated faux fans are positively encouraged these days, but only if they come in the sole form of US president Donald Trump, whosebromance with Infantinohas been one of the more mesmerisingly weird developments of his presidency.But then, just as power-playing moguls place themselves on each other’s company boards, so autocrats love other autocrats. Back in January, many of us were still vaguely startled to see Giannigiven a great seatat Trump’s inauguration, barely two rows behind the tech oligarchs, where he was able to laugh uproariously at the bit of the speech where Trump announced he’d berenaming the Gulf of Mexicothe Gulf of America. (Just a little niggle between Fifa co-hosts.) But now that we’ve seen Infantino pop up everywhere from Gaza peace conferences to regular turns in the Oval Office, it almost feels strange when he isn’t part of Trump’s malarial travelling court – the Dontourage, if you will.Whether Infantino will at some point end up in the woodchipper, just like everyone does with Trump, is unclear. For now, the presidentis enjoyinghaving his tummies tickled. A week ago, at the World Cup draw, Trump obligingly suggested the NFL give up the rights to calling its sport football in the United States. “But when you think about it, shouldn’t it really be called …thisis football,”Trump waffled. “There’s no question about it. We have to come up with another name for the NFL. It really doesn’t make sense when you think about it.” This is what happens when the presidentgets booedat the Super Bowl, instead of being given an inaugural award like he was at Infantino’s fever dream of a draw. Yes, even though you couldn’t believe the shamelessness until you actually saw it with your own eyes, it was incredibly credible that Infantino would indeed confect some nutty “Fifa peace prize” andaward it to Trump.In recent history, both the Olympics and the World Cup have shown they are always able to covertly or overtlyoverride local lawsof the host country for the duration of their sporting event. Fortunately, though, this is unnecessary in the US, where being ripped off for sports tickets is effectively the 28th amendment. Furthermore, this World Cup is already shaping up to be the sort of reciprocally abusive arrangement we’ve seen when the tournament previously tipped up in non-democracies. Trump can use it tothreaten Democrat mayorswith loss of city hosting rights, while Infantino can charge genuinely crazy money and have Fifa run the entire secondary ticketing/scalping market without interference. Everyone’s a winner, as long as they hold all the cards.And the peasants – the fans – just have to suck it up.Fifaelections have effectively been hollowed out by the strong-arm practice of buying off the votes of smaller nations via disproportionately large grants. The dictator makes sure countries know what’s good for them. The gravy train rolls on. So if you fancy getting rid of Gianni and everything he represents, I’d love to know the mechanism you have in mind. Maybe one day football will have some kind of revolution, in which hordes of endlessly oppressed people who actually like the sport will storm Infantino’s Zurich palace, and loot all the valuable gifts of obscure provenance. But it won’t be soon, unless one or more of the big football markets gets it together and pulls out.Until then, we’ll just have to accept that there is simply no one who cares less than Infantino, and simply no sport that hates its fans quite as much as football. In fact, if only those fans could afford the tickets, they’d have the receipts to prove it.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGianni InfantinoOpinionWorld Cup 2026FifaWorld CupDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

A toxic debate does no one any favoursSimon JenkinsThe courts are a clumsy means to negotiate social relationships. Let organisations make up their own minds about inclusionFri 12 Dec 2025 11.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 11.09 CETShareTowards the end of her life, I was a friend of the writer Jan Morris. I had known her for many years and, much to my regret, had declined an offer to do her “tell all” interview when she transitioned. Jan presented herself as a woman and had undergone an operation. To me she was simply a remarkable woman. She touched, sometimes humorously, on embarrassing incidents in her life. But it never occurred to me that a legal ruling might hover over our restaurant table and block her from going to the ladies.Last April, the supreme court issued a ruling confirming that the word “sex” in the Equality Act 2010 refers to biological sex, not a person’s legal gender. This has a wide-reaching impact on how equality law is applied in practice, particularly in providing sex-based rights such as single-sex spaces. Six months later, adraft codeon the ruling’s implementation was sent bythe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to the equalities minister, Bridget Phillipson. She has been sitting on it ever since, pleading for more time.The WI and Girlguiding have been pressured to exclude trans women – yet the law is clear as mud | Jess O’ThomsonRead moreTo be fair, this territory is deep in fudge. The court verdict was ostensibly clear. Girlguiding was for girls, the Women’s Institute (WI) for women. If a toilet says it is for “women”, it means biological women. But the issue isnot so clearcutfor former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption. He told the BBC that what the court really meant was that women-only services “are allowed to exclude trans women from facilities, but are not obliged to do so”.With this the outgoing EHRC chair, Kishwer Falkner, disagreed. Speaking to the BBC, she said: “If a male person is allowed to use a women-only service or facility, it isn’t any longer single-sex, then it becomes a mixed-sex space.” Presumably, if the WI wanted to allow trans women as members, then it would become the “Women’s and Trans Women’s Institute” and would need unisex loos.Whose interpretation is correct? The EHRC has sincetaken downinterim advice on the subject from its website. Everyone is waiting for further guidance.Common sense must be with Sumption. Sex as defined as biological sex should clearly apply to physical sports, but less so to most women’s clubs or job quotas or competitions or restaurant loos. Trans people have a right to dignity and respect.Over the decades, the tiny percentage of the population who have transitioned have quietly integrated into the community. The gender recognition certificate – used for new passports – need not have legal status to be informally acceptable in most circumstances.The few trans people I have encountered are discreet. They avoid controversial situations and do not march for “trans rights”. They understand that they are exceptional and that it will take time for many others to accept them for who they are. It is for the world to judge whether to accept them as such, but in my experience most people are ready to do so, and most institutions as well. It is for Refuge, the women’s rescue hostel service, to decide whether it will or will not accept trans women.It has decided it will. The most liberal interpretation of the supreme court judgment is plainly called for.We are dealing here with the most intangible of phenomena, the pace of change within society. It was much the same with other exceptional groups, such as gay people, immigrants and some religious minorities. Often, as in the Church of England, objections become overt and lead to bans and litigation, as over the status of property in single-sex marriage. But change comes about fastest when the least fuss is made, and when a minority knows that it is initially different and reacts to antagonism with moderation.The new code needs to be nuanced, to suggest how single-sex bodies might help trans people towards acceptability. Rights are always sensitive, but there should be few cases that require litigation. The courts are a clumsy discipline to apply to the intimacies of social relationships.This is a real mess. If ever hard cases made bad law, this is a classic.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The European Commission published it in March. It’s a chart oftotal fertility rate: the average number of children born per woman. After a minor bump over the past 20 years, the EU rate appears to be declining once more, and now stands at 1.38. The UK’s is1.44. A population’s replacement rate is 2.1. You may or may not see this as a disaster, but the maths doesn’t care what you think. We are gliding, as if by gravitational force, towards the ground.Civilisational erasure is the term the Trump administration used in its newnational security strategy, published last week. It claimed that immigration, among other factors, will result in the destruction of European civilisation. In reality, without immigration there will be no Europe, no civilisation and no one left to argue about it.Of course, we’re talking about different things. The Trump administration appears to see “civilisation” as a white and western property, threatened by Black and Brown people, regardless of whether they were born here or have recently arrived. This week, Donald Trump claimed that, with the exception of Poland and Hungary, European nations “will not be viable countries any longer”, as a result of immigration. Well, Poland has atotal fertility rate of 1.2, which means a rapid slide to inviability unless it allows more immigration. “Civilisation”, as it has often been over the past two centuries, is in Trump’s case a racist and white supremacist concept. The erasure the Trump government appears to fear is of “white” culture.There is and was no such thing. Our language, science,mathematics, music, cuisine, literature, art and – thanks to the legacy of colonial and post-colonial looting – much of our wealth, originated elsewhere. Italian cooking might be unimaginable without tomatoes but, originating in South America, they were not widely useduntil the 19th century. The balti might have a greater claim to be the UK’s national dish than fish and chips (aPortuguese import), as itoriginated here. The roast beef of Old England, from an animal domesticated in the Middle East, was enjoyed by the elite: the rest derived much of their protein from dal (pease pottage, pease pudding, pea soup). This changed only when the means were found ofpreserving and shippingmeat from animals raised in the colonies. Widespread beef consumption in Britain required the civilisational erasure of Indigenous peoples in the Americas, Australia and New Zealand, and the eradication of their ecosystems.Some rulers once understood the power of pluralism. King Stephen I of Hungary, who reigned from 1001 to 1038, noted that the cultures and knowledge of foreignersenriched the realm, while “a country unified in language and customs is fragile and weak”. A thousand years later, Trump appears to have forgotten this obvious truth.What I’m talking about, by contrast, is actual erasure: the literal disappearance of society. Once the fertility rate falls below 2.1, it keeps falling, and the slide towards zero looks inexorable. This doesn’t mean I’ve become a “pronatalist” (wanting to see rising birthrates). I’m neither pronatalist nor antinatalist, as both positions are equally futile. As David Runciman points out in his excellentsummary of the sciencein the London Review of Books, the opportunity costs of having children rise with prosperity, leading inexorably to falling birthrates. In some parts of the world, this process began in the 16th and 17th centuries. No government constraint or incentive, it seems, can significantly alter the trajectory.For years I’ve been arguing with peoplewho want to reducethe human population for environmental reasons. I’ve pointed out that the growth rate today was established before most of us were born: as aUN reportexplains, “Considerable population growth continues today because of the high numbers of births in the 1950s and 1960s, which have resulted in larger base populations with millions of young people reaching their reproductive years over succeeding generations.” In other words, those who obsess about too many people are fighting a mathematical function. Global (and, in the UK, national) population will continue to rise for a while, beforesweeping dramatically downwards, largely as a matter of demographic momentum.The only thing the obsessives could do to change the peaking point by more than a couple of years would be mass murder on an unprecedented scale: slaughtering hundreds of millions of people. This is because the issue is not rising birthrates (the global rate hasbeen in declinesince the year of my birth, 1963), but a risingchild survival rateand greatlyincreased longevity. Ironically, the person who might have caused the greatest depopulation is the self-professed pronatalist Elon Musk, whose dismantling of USAID could, according to an estimate in the Lancet, cause14 million deaths. He wants to see more children born, but appears to care little about whether they survive.It’s Elon Musk’s ‘pronatalist’ bonanza – so many families, so little time | Marina HydeRead moreOtherwise, if the “population control” advocates have any significant impact, it will – because of the long and compounding time lags involved – be to hasten the plunge on the other side of the curve. People have devoted their lives to this fatuity.Why do they cling to the idea long after the evidence has departed? Partly, I believe, because population growth is a highly convenient scapegoat for, and distraction from, the impacts of consumption: wealthy people in the global north canblame much poorerBlack and Brown people in the global south for the environmental crises they themselves have caused. Switching to a plant-based diet or from fossil fuels to renewables, by contrast to altering the size of the human population, are things we can do immediately, humanely and effectively. But blaming other people requires no change, and no confrontation with power.Without immigration, there will, within a number of generations, be no Europe and no United Kingdom. Today’s racist obsessions will look incomprehensible to our ageing descendants, desperate for young people to look after them and keep their countries running. Before long, we’ll be fighting to attract people from overseas. But, as Runciman remarks, “There soon won’t be enough immigrants to go around.”Perhaps this is why, in the new novel by the always prescient Ian McEwan,What We Can Know, set 100 years hence, the dominant global power is Nigeria, one of the few countries that today still has a fertility ratewell above replacement, though it’s also falling fast.Trump’s security strategy, like all far-right politics, is simultaneously preposterous and sinister. But above all, it is wrong.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If push comes to shove, I know where my loyalty liesFri 12 Dec 2025 06.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 18.53 CETShareLast week, a Republican senator from my home state of Ohio, Bernie Moreno, introduced theExclusive Citizenship Act. The proposed legislation would strip me of my American citizenship, because I chose to be French too. Just as Moreno seeks to bully me into choosing citizenship, the US is bullying Europe, trying to force it to pick between total submission to its erstwhile partner, or a break with it.It is now official USpolicythat Europe is facing “civilisational erasure”, and that the US will actively support far-right, ethnonationalist, neofascist parties hostile to the EU. Standing by historic alliances is out,protecting Elon Muskand his fellow techno-nihilist broligarchs is in – as is reaping theKremlin’s praisesfor it.What should have been clear as early as November 2024 should, by now, be abundantly so. This version of the US is worse than simply “not our friend”: it is an actively hostile actor seeking to fracture European society in the same way that Russia sought to fracture British society by promoting Brexit, and US society by fuelling disinformation, Maga and Trump. And yet Europe (the UK included) has spent the past year coddling, backtracking, cajoling andcapitulating. It has ignored insult after insult from the White House, punitive measure after punitive measure.Have we not yet had enough of the humiliation?Two decades ago, the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Jürgen Habermasurged Europeto capitalise on the wave of popular opposition to the Iraq war to produce a new kind of European public sphere with a common sense of shared political fate and future. Only this kind of Europe, the pair argued, would be capable of rising to the challenge of defending cosmopolitanism and the rule of law. The EU is far from perfect, and faces its own internal challenges from far-right authoritarianism. But this is even more true today than it was in 2003: the EU is the sole global actor with superpower potential that remains committed to the rule of law and inclusive, progressive politics.As a graduate student, I read Derrida and Habermas and felt stung. The US was still under the Obama administration, and at least nominally committed to some type of international order. In hindsight, Derrida and Habermas were prophets of the present. The rift over Iraq that so many thought was temporary has returned as a divide that is structural and probably irreparable.Some pundits disdain the idea of a more aggressive European response to American interference and coercion. “What is Von der Leyen supposed to do,” they ask: “become a South Park character, and sling insults back at Trump?” To which I could answer: “And so what if she did? What, really, is there to lose?”Changing Europe’s material reality requires changing the narrative. European leaders have spent the past year negotiating quietly in back channels, hoping that some mix of balance-beam diplomacy and strategic patience will preserve the transatlantic relationship. But, and evidently it needs repeating,thisUS has made it an official policy to work to end the EU as we know it by publicly supporting far-right partiescommitted to its destruction.As the new National Security Strategy states, the US will “cultivate resistance” to the EU from anti-union parties in its member states. The US is also deploying de facto trade sanctions to force the EU to renounce its right to govern its own digital market, treating European regulation of X as barely short of an act of war.I feel it too, the foundation of humiliation that underpins the politics of anger. I feel it as deeply as any other European, with the added edge that the people who are stealing the deeply flawed, aspirational thing that was supposed to be “America” are also striving to steal it from me as an individual, as a citizen (still) of the US. How do we overcome this, to turn a politics of resentment into a politics of belonging? Not by cowering or grovelling, nor by hoping that some magical US midterms will save us.The first step towards autonomy is to behave autonomously. That doesn’t need to mean matching Trump’s incoherent-tantrum style of communication; it does mean meeting US hostility with public, rhetorical confrontation that shows Europeans their leaders are not in the business of submission. That they will state plainly that the US far right is an adversary to be countered.The break is as real as what Derrida and Habermas foresaw, and US attempts to bully Europe into submission also present a door cracked open: an opportunity to build the self-confident narrative that Europe needs to meet this moment.Proposing things like concerted funding of Europe-wide public media, or expanding life-changing schemes like the Erasmus student exchange programme, might seem quaint. In fact, they’re crucial to fostering a shared future and sense of political belonging among European citizens.When I chose French nationality, I chose European citizenship as well. Not simply a bureaucratic space occupied by technocrats, but a cognitive space. One deep enough for histories to interlock, where it’s OK to be more than one thing at once. That used to be an ideal that the US understood and extolled. Actively renouncing the citizenship I gained by circumstances of birth would mean renouncing people, a place and stories that matter to me. It’s not something I will do. Renouncing the citizenship I chose – and the people, place and stories that I chose along with it – is also something I will not do, and with even more conviction. If the US some day strips me of the former because of the latter, so be it.Alexander Hurst is a Guardian Europe columnist.

Instead, the US pursued a “maximum pressure” strategy of sanctions and threats.But Mr Maduro is still in place. And Mr Trump’s attempts to remove him are ramping up again. The US has amassed its largest military presence in the Caribbean sincethe 1989 invasion of Panama. It has carried out more than 20 shockingstrikes on alleged drug boats. Mr Trump reportedlydelivered an ultimatumlate last month, telling the Venezuelan leader that he could have safe passage from his country if he left immediately. There was already a $50m bounty on his head. This week came expanded sanctions and theseizure of a tanker.Mr Maduro, who took over from Hugo Chávez in 2013, swore himself into officefor a third termin January despitecompelling evidencethat the opposition candidate Edmundo González had easily beaten him in last summer’s election. But Mr Trump is not concerned about his dubious electoral credentials and authoritarianism. Nor do the administration’s claims to be tackling drugs cartels convince – though images of boat bombings may be viscerally pleasing to Mr Trump’s base. Venezuela is neither a significant producer of nor major conduit for drugs consumed in the US. And Mr Trump has just pardoned the former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández for major drugs-related convictions.But Mr Maduro’s failures have given Venezuelans good reason to flee. Around 700,000 of the 8 million who have left the country because of its economic collapse have ended up in the US. Mr Trump is determined to cut migration – though destabilising Venezuela, by turning the economic screws further or ousting Mr Maduro, is more likely toincrease refugee flows.Mr Trump’s declaration that the US would probably hold on to the tanker shipment will play to Mr Maduro’s claims that the US is solely motivated by oil. Those seemoverblown. The country has a fifth of the world’s known reserves, but accounts for less than 1% of production.María Corina Machado, the country’s best-known opposition leader and the winner of this year’s Nobel peace prize, described the US seizure as“very necessary”. She has previously proposed a $1.7tn privatisation programme, promisingmassive opportunitiesto foreign investors. Mr Trump is also clearly concerned about China’s growing role in Latin America, and Venezuela has signedenergy and mining dealswith Beijing – though it reportedlyoffered the USaccess to its mineral wealth in the vain hope that it would back off.But one might also surmise that Mr Trump is piqued at failing to remove Mr Maduro the first time around. Though his envoy Richard Grenell has promoted talks with Caracas, his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, is a longstanding hawk on leftist authoritarians in Latin America. His secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host, appears far out of his depth. While a full-scale invasion remains unlikely, land strikes cannot be ruled out if Mr Maduro clings on. Democratswarnthat the administration is “sleepwalking us into a war” that would further punish Venezuelans. Yet there is little reason to believe that escalated coercion would succeed where years of sanctions, isolation and economic collapse have failed.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But greater support must be given to the organisations that enable disabled artists to flourishFri 12 Dec 2025 19.25 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 21.37 CETShareThe Turner prize is no stranger to sparking debate or pushing boundaries. This year it has achieved both. For the first time, an artist with learning disabilities has won. Glasgow-bornNnena Kalutook the award for her colourful, cocoon-like sculptures made from VHS tape, clingfilm and other abandoned materials, along with her large swirling vortex drawings. Kalu is autistic, with limited verbal communication. In anacceptance speechon her behalf, Kalu’s facilitator, Charlotte Hollinshead, said that “a very stubborn glass ceiling” had been broken.Kalu’s win is a high-profile symbol of a shift towards greater inclusivity that has been happening in the UK arts world over the past five years. Last month,Beyond the Visualopened at the Henry Moore Institute, Leeds, in which everything is curated or created by blind and partially sighted artists. The exhibits range from Moore sculptures (which visitors are encouraged to touch) to David Johnson’s10,000 stone-plaster digestive biscuitsstamped with braille.Design and Disabilityat the V&A South Kensington is showcasing the ways in which disabled, deaf and neurodivergent people have shaped culture from the 1940s to now.During the pandemic, arts institutions were forced to close and to reconsider their purpose. The2021 Turner prizeresponded with a shortlist comprised entirely of artists’ collectives, including the Hastings-basedProject Art Worksfor neurodivergent people. The following year, disabled artists staged a one-day takeover of museums and galleries entitledWe Are Invisible We Are Visible (WAIWAV), uncovering hidden aspects of the disabled experience from Gateshead to St Ives. In 2023, theMiddlesbrough Institute of Modern Art (MIMA)set up a residency programme for disabled curators, with ashow by 15 disabled, deaf and neurodivergent artistslast year.This year’s Turner prize has brought this work into mainstream contemporary art. The judges compared Kalu’s sculptures to 3D versions of abstract expressionist paintings andsaidthat while “the quality and uniqueness of her work is inseparable from who she is as an artist”, her neurodivergence did not influence their decision. Some critics were unconvinced, accusing the panel of confusing“therapy with talent”and making“a collective act of goodwill”over aesthetic judgment.But all art is inseparable from who the artist is to some degree. Kelu’s work can only be understood visually – her sculptures and drawings must speak for themselves. They challenge us to look and think in new and different ways. This is what art can do.In a week when US diplomats were farcicallyorderedto return to using Times New Roman typeface in official communications, rather than the presumably “woke”Calibri– adopted because it is more accessible for people with disabilities – a recognition of the insights diversity can offer couldn’t be more timely.Credit must go to the charityActionSpace, which has supported Kalu and other learning-disabled artists in London for many years. It is part of a growing network of supportive studios across the country, includingIntoart,based in south London,Venture Artsin Manchester andProject Abilityin Glasgow. At a time of crisis in the arts, and controversy over disability and special educational needs funding, the Turner prize has shone a light on their vital work. If these organisations are not given the financial support they need, they will no longer be able to support prize-winning artists of the future.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The US declares itself our enemy. Europeemerges as its main adversaryin theUS national security strategy. Russia is its friend, not us. Everything that looked solid since the second world war is turned upside down; the land of the free becomes the destroyer of democratic values. Appeasement fails.He may ramble, but Donald Trump speaks plainly. He means what he says, and he hates everything European. Except its emerging“patriotic” parties, which he wants to support. His strategy warns of “civilizational erasure”, claiming Europe will soon “become majority non-European” and parroting the racist conspiracy known as the great replacement theory. Describing Europeans as “weak”, “decaying” and “destroying their countries”, with “real stupid” leaders, Trump responded to the question of whether they would still be allies, ina Politico interview, with a hint of threat: “It depends.”Note this: the official US strategy says that “the growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism”. He is what he is, in plain sight. No more pretending his fickle ways can be reversed. He appears to back the EU’s nativists, which his strategy suggests are “political allies”. Why wouldn’t he? British politics is already under threat from Russian and Chinese hacking and interference, as in the case of Reform’sformer Welsh leader– who has been jailed for taking Russian bribes. Expect electoral threats from the US from now on. Trump regards Europe’s vain struggle to protect itself – via itsDigital Services Act– from the worst excesses of US tech giants as an act of treachery.Britain looks singularly vulnerable to danger from this US friend turned enemy. But at least here’s one simple political defence that needs immediate action. Next month, the government is expected to publish its elections bill, but so far it has only weak suggestions for protecting our democracy from gross interference by hostile actors. Unlike many countries, we have no cap on political donations. Elon Musk wasreportedly going to back Reformwith £100m, a sum that buys a party – although he denied that specific figure. Though foreign, he can do it legally by paying out of his companies’ UK profits. He fell out with Farage, but might swerve back, and other plutocrats may support the hard right wherever the door is left open to their malign influence.This week, the government published itsanti-corruption strategy, drawn up by Margaret Hodge, its anti-corruption champion, together with David Lammy, and designed to arrest a steep decline: this year the UKfell from 11th to 20thin Transparency International’s corruption perceptions index.This new strategy on tax evasion, money laundering and the professional enablers of corruption – lawyers, accountants, PR companies – was welcomed by campaigners. More than £100bn islaundered a yearin Britain, according to the National Crime Agency, not just through the seedy world of fake barber, vape and sweet shops but reaching to the very top. Kleptocrats launder their reputations as well as their money using philanthropy, cultural institutions,private schools, universitiesand football teams, all over-eager for funds with too few questions asked.But one section of the strategy concerns political influence:Home Office pollingshows 73% of people are concerned about corrupt actors in the political system, and they are right to be. Today the FT revealed that a German private bankgave £300,000 to the Toriesbefore the last election: as it came from an illegal foreign source, it was given back. But it shows how many interests want to sway our elections. A£75,000 donationto Robert Jenrick was revealed to arrive from a UK-based company that took significant loans from a business registered in the British Virgin Islands. Jenrick said the donation was “perfectly legal and valid”, which is what’s wrong with the law.This month, the Electoral Commission has reported that a £9m donation to Reform UK isthe single largest everfrom a living person. Of all donations to Reform, 75% have come from justthree wealthy men. That £9m from one of them, a crypto investor, was not in cryptocurrency, but future donations could be. The government is weighing up whether to ban crypto donations, a shady sector that should be kept well away from political donations.On lobbying rules and onrestoring the independenceof the Electoral Commission, as called for by campaigners, we wait to see if the bill will be tougher than suggested so far. (For another day is the lack of proportional representation, which Labour will regret eternally.) As it stands, cleaning up political donations is a clear win for a distrusted party. Hodge has managed to drag them as far as at least reviewing it. Now they need to do it. As Full Fact, the Electoral Commission and a coalition of democracy and anti-corruption organisations propose, multiple reforms are needed: an annual cap on spending on election campaigns, instead of just restricting it in the pre-election period, would stop vast sums spent on preparing data and social media ahead of time. They want a £15,000 maximum single-person donation, but any cap would be a start.It will take unflinching action to restore public trust, but Labour could wash away public suspicion after the cabinet’s minor but painful moral embarrassment in taking gifts and tickets. Cash for honours is illegal, but a Conservative benefactor donatingmore than £3m to the partycan find a seat in the Lords. Stop donations from companies and unions when these eyewatering sums swashing about in our politics disgust the public. Brave public wrath by explaining that public subsidy to politics is a lesser evil than private corruption.The Labour manifesto says: “We will protect democracy by strengthening the rules around donations to political parties.” Will it, really? The democratic threat is terrifying. The time for timidity is over, for appeasing the US, for pretending Brexit can ever work – and for allowing big money into politics. For a government so low in the polls, boldness is the only way up.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsParty fundingOpinionDonald TrumpThe far rightEuropean UnionEuropeCorruption index and barometerReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

It is that Starmer shows through this the complete dearth of ideas available to European social democracy.Faced with the growth of Hayekian anti-state politics in the 1970s and 1980s, social democratic parties abandoned the idea of ameliorating the worst impacts of capitalism and became little more than a reserve managerial class occasionally allowed to manage. The problem is that they are now entirely devoid of coherent politics.Europe’s ageing populations and stagflating economies desperately need immigrant labour. Facing a rightwing discourse that is as wrong on immigration as it is on the climate crisis, Starmer and co can’t mount an ideological retort, and instead bleat about “legitimate concerns”, falling into line with Donald Trump’s power play about the “stark prospect of civilisational erasure” (‘Cultivate resistance’: policy paper lays bare Trump support for Europe’s far right, 5 December).When John F Kennedy was killed, Malcolm X said the chickens were coming home to roost. Starmer’s attack on the European convention on human rights is more like turkeys dressing up to celebrate Christmas.Nick MossLondonKeir Starmer and Mette Frederiksen claim to be speaking for all citizens when they say want to amend the ECHR in order to “control our borders” (We must protect our borders to defend our democracies. Here’s how, 9 December). They don’t speak for me, and, I’d argue, a majority of citizens whose voices never get heard in the press or in government policy.Migrants – whether refugees or “economic migrants” – have made this country better culturally and economically, bringing in new ideas, entrepreneurialism and some wonderful friends and neighbours.Freedom of movement is a core part of the human experience throughout time, and the ECHR doesn’t just protect refugees, it defends the rights of all of us, so chipping away at it will impoverish our freedoms when we need them more than ever. Who knows when people in the UK might need to flee a natural or human-made disaster?Starmer’s government is Blue Labour through and through, echoing many bot-inspired Maga talking points from migration to disability because they have little else to offer. It is not the Labour party I know and have voted for.Dr Deborah TalbotHarescombe, GloucestershireLet me get this straight. Donald Trump accuses Europe of being weak on immigration (Trump lambasts ‘weak’ and ‘decaying’ Europe and hints at walking away from Ukraine, 9 December), and hours later our leaderswrite that they want to take tougher action to protect our borders. I don’t think most Europeans want Europe to become Little America. We want to be a continent where human rights matter, and where our politicians, instead of scapegoating our migrant friends and neighbours, tackle the real crises we face: housing, wages, and public service cuts.To defend our democracies, we need our leaders to addressextreme wealth inequalities, not protect our borders from vulnerable people. The rise in popularity of green and truly progressive parties shows that if they are not willing to act for the many, we will replace their politics of fat cats and division with the politics of care and solidarity.Dimitra BlanaAberdeenSo, in order to halt the racist far right, you compete with them to abandon liberal democratic policies and beliefs?

It was a year ago that the Guardian’s John Harris outlined the details ofan investigationcarried out by the Observer into two Mossbourne academy schools, including MVPA. It had found, as Sir Alan Wood has, that for many years horrendous tactics have been used to enforce discipline. Many staff were appalled and left, with the final straw for many being a teachers’ training session entitled “healthy fear”.Harris concludedthen that there were “big questions about how academies and so-called free schools are scrutinised and overseen”, and it is certainly difficult to explain how Ofsted inspectors, regardless of the schools’ good examination results, could fail to notice both the appalling ways discipline was being enforced and the shocking after‑effects. Both schools were awarded the “outstanding” grade.Bernie EvansLiverpoolAs a parent of two children with a high level of special educational needs (Send) who were harmed while in mainstream schools, I welcome the Wood report, finally recognising the damage that is done to children through harsh regimes. Katharine Birbalsingh, take note.However, the government’s stance on targets contributes to this pressure cooker atmosphere in schools, and the latest announcements to cut back on mental health support fill me with horror. Where is the help for the children recognised as harmed in this report? A real overhaul of education would recommend that all children, even those with Send, get the support they need in school and for their mental health, so that they can emerge as young adults unharmed and able to confidently contribute to society.Name and address suppliedWhile it is shocking to hear of the awful treatment of children at MVPA, this climate of fear is a reality in too many schools, where results outweigh welfare and happiness. Teachers are made accomplices to this culture by allowing these abusive systems to happen. They too are fearful of being seen as incapable of maintaining “good discipline”. Education must be concerned with creating happy, healthy people rather than just churning out GCSE passes.Pat PorterWallington, SurreyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I no longer have the dread of weekends and holidays with insurmountable mountains of work. The move to a four-day teaching week would need to be thought about carefully.I, for one, would not want to have one full day out of school – this would mean four straight days of teaching. In most schools, a day not teaching would equate to five planning, preparation and assessment periods (PPAs).I think most full-time teachers would rather this was spread across five days, with the option of blocking an afternoon where they could leave the building. Flexibility in teaching needs to be about giving teachers a choice. Five PPAs is hardly radical ideology – it was the norm when I started teaching in 2007.Peter RussellSheffieldFlexible working for teachers has clear benefits, but it cannot solve the fundamental issue: schools are underresourced and workloads are extensive. Within current time requirements, a four-day week is not deliverable. Compressing teaching hours would only intensify pressure, limit schools’ ability to cover staff absence and increase reliance on supply or cover supervisors, to the detriment of pupils.Rather than a blanket four-day week, the priority for the government should be reducing workload (including through streamlined accountability), improving resourcing and embedding genuinely healthy flexible-working practices across the sector.Antonia SpinksChief executive, Pioneer Educational TrustHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

One aspect he did not mention was the strategic nuclear balance. Since the late 1940s, responsibility for deterrence has always lain with the Pentagon and has succeeded in keeping the peace, though at times a very fragile version of it.The recent US statement on defence makes it clear thatEuropeis no longer seen as a priority by the Trump administration, the danger now being that doubt is crucially being raised as to the credibility of Nato’s deterrent. Without certainty of a reaction in kind, Russia, under its ambitious and risk-taking president, might be tempted to chance its arm in what almost looks like a ceding of Europe by the US into a Russian “sphere of influence”.IfVladimir Putintriumphs in Ukraine, the future of the Baltic states will probably move up Putin’s agenda – and after that, who knows? In the 1930s, Europe ignored a clear existential threat, and millions paid for it. Europe has to realise that its superior economic and military potential has to be mobilised to secure not just the future of Ukraine, but the stability of Europe.Bill JonesHonorary professor of political studies, Liverpool Hope UniversityThe suggestion by Timothy Garton Ash thatBelgiumis acting egotistically in resisting the seizure of Russian assets is somewhat harsh. The potential financial liability in the unlikely event of an adverse international legal ruling at some future date would virtually bankrupt the country. Surely it is the resistance of the other EU countries in sharing this liability that is the problem.Robin WilsonLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Let’s hope the 50th anniversary upgrade is better than the ‘pointillist stippling’ tried in the 1990sCatherine SlessorFri 12 Dec 2025 15.49 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 16.13 CETShareTheBarbicanis aptly named. From the Old Frenchbarbacane, it historically means a fortified gateway forming the outer line of defence to a city or castle. London’s Barbican marks the site of a medieval structure that would have defended an important access point. Its architecture was designed to repel. Some might argue, as they stumble out of Barbican tube station and gaze upwards, not much has changed in the interim.The use of the word “barbican” was in decline in this country until the opening in 1982 of the Barbican Arts Centre. Taking 20 years to build, it completed the modernist megastructure of the Barbican Estate, grafted on to a huge tract of land devastated by wartime bombing. The aim was to bring life back to the City through swish new housing, energised by the presence of culture. Nonetheless, the arts centre, the elusive minotaur at the heart of the concrete labyrinth, was always farcically difficult to locate. To this day, visitors are obliged to trundle along the Ariadne’s thread of the famous yellow line, inscribed in what seemed like an act of institutional desperation, across concrete hill and dale.The Barbican is one of the most important postwar developments in the country – if not the worldThe Twentieth Century SocietyThe minotaur is also ageing. Just like people, buildings also physically decay and get into bad habits, necessitating the odd hip replacement or hair transplant. Approval has now been granted by the City of London Corporation for a multi-million-pound programme to upgrade and transform the Barbican, in time for the 50th anniversary of its opening in 2032. From June 2028, it willclose its doors for a yearto undergo the most ambitious makeover in its history. There will be a fair few architectural equivalents of hip replacements.View image in fullscreenA digital rendering of the renewed foyer.Photograph: Kin CreativesThe Grade II-listed complex suffers from leaks, crumbling fabric, outdated services and accessibility issues.Navigability is a perpetual bugbear, with apocryphal tales of famous people (including a celebrated explorer) getting lost in the cat’s cradle of walkways, decks and staircases, conceived by its architects, Chamberlin Powell & Bon, in an era when such things were seen as exciting and novel.Sectional drawings made at the time show the building as a heroic, concrete layer cake, sprung from the imagination of a modern Piranesi, with levels stacked around the cavernous volumes of the concert hall and theatre. Most heroic of all is the conservatory, which took the void around the theatre fly tower, enclosed it in glass and filled it with plants. In the refurbishment proposals, this hugely popular urban greenhouse, a Kew Palm House for the East End, will be spruced up and made more accessible to the public.Over time, the Barbican’s fortunes have fluctuated, but now, in the manner of the structure it was named after, it has successfully defended itself from public opprobrium, swatting away squeals of “concrete monstrosity” to become a kind of architectural national treasure. You can buy Barbican mugs, models, tea towels and other ephemera valorising its uncompromising brutalist heft.View image in fullscreenConcrete hill and dale … the Barbican Centre’s current Silk Street entrance.Photograph: Dion BarrettRemedial strategies have been tried before. In the early 1990s, Theo Crosby of design group Pentagram introduced some ill-advised pointillist stippling, along with gilded fibreglass statues, all contrived to “soften” the concrete. Derided as “feeble tinkering” by Geoffrey Powell, one of the original architects, it was a decidedly unflattering smear of lipstick on a rather fabulous gorilla.A subsequent rebranding and remodelling by modernist fanboys Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM) went slightly better, allowing the uncompromising brutalist heft to speak for itself, but below stairs, things were creaking and leaking, and have now got to the point where doing nothing is not an option.View image in fullscreenKew Palm House heads east … a render of the Barbican Renewal.Photograph: Kin CreativesFears that the Barbican would be “starchitect-ified” by its latest glow-up appear unfounded. This is a “fabric first” approach, concerned with diligently making good, decarbonising, and fitting for the future – now common architectural practice for buildings of this size and significance. The overhaul will be overseen by Allies and Morrison along with Asif Khan Studio, which will collectively be thoughtful, steady hands on the tiller; just what an ageing minotaur needs. Turner prize-winners Assemble will get a crack at sorting out the wayfinding, though it’s probably impossible to improve on the yellow line. In short, the Barbican will become more like the Barbican.The only blot on the escutcheon concerns possible new neighbours. Plans have been submitted for two new 20-storey towers on Silk Street, directly across from the arts centre, to replace an outdated 1980s office block. Designed by American architects SOM, the hulking, Jenga-esque extrusions will loom imperiously over the Barbican’s east end, like a pair of corpulent bouncers. Residents’ groups and heritage bodies are vigorously opposing the development in its present form. “The Barbican is one of the most important postwar residential and cultural developments in the country, if not the world,” says Catherine Croft, director of the Twentieth Century Society, “and its status as a prominent, architecturally outstanding London landmark should be respected as much as the fabric itself.” It seems the Barbican may still have some repelling to do.Explore more on these topicsBarbicanArchitecturePlanning policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The actors talk mourning, immortality and hospital vending machinesCatherine ShoardFri 12 Dec 2025 06.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 10.19 CETShareIn 2017, Sally Bridges-Winslet died of cancer. She was 71. It was, her youngest daughter said, “like the north star just dropped out of the sky”.It would have been even worse, saysKate Winslettoday, had the family not pulled together. “I do have tremendous amounts of peace and acceptance around what happened because of how we were able to make it for her.”Winslet’s eldest son, Joe, was then 13. “For him as a child, seeing that love poured into this moment was huge. And then he discovered through conversations with friends that that’s so rarely the case.”Six years later, in 2023, Joe decided to turn the experience into a screenplay. A few drafts and some heavy-duty casting later and it’s a movie, starring Helen Mirren as dying matriarch June, Timothy Spall as her blithe husband, Bernie, plus Toni Collette (flighty hippy),Andrea Riseborough(organic fascist) and Johnny Flynn (oversensitive) as three of their children. Winslet plays the fourth (stressed exec); the film is also her directorial debut.“However much I would try to separate my own personal experience from the experience we were having as this fictional family,” she says, “it was almost impossible. At times I almost felt like I was living out moments of my own mother’s passing that I never would have witnessed. So directing actors in a tender way without falling apart in the corner was definitely part of the challenge.”View image in fullscreen‘It all come flooding back’ … Helen Mirren as June and Kate Winslet as Julia in Goodbye June.Photograph: Kimberley French/NetflixThe challenge was exacerbated by another she set herself: to make it as authentic as possible. Overhead boom mics were banned and crew banished once the cameras were rolling, the easier for the actors to avoid distraction. “That certainly made it all come flooding back. It felt very present. Even just the shape of the hospital room; the noises – oh God, that beep. When you’ve been through it, it does get you. That sense of monotony. The corridors. That it’s C17 for a Snickers in the vending machine.”She smiles, clear-eyed and capable; friendly, professional and extremely keen the film (which she has also produced) not be misunderstood. Does cinema have a duty to be realistic about death? “It matters to me,” she says. “This is very much not the movie version of someone who is slipping away with cancer. And that was hard for Helen Mirren – not because she’s vain, but because it is emotionally difficult to be that broken-down and vulnerable.”There are no atheists in a foxhole. If you’re about to die, you’re praying to somethingTimothy SpallGoodbye June is a curious and winning mix of uplifting and unsparing: 60% Love Actually, 40% Michael Haneke’s Amour. Mirren does indeed look very ill, in bed and straining on the loo (the tumour has blocked her bowel). Spall has been issued with some strikingly horrible stunt legs, Bernie also not being in the best of health. Everyone looks like an actual flawed human being – unusual in a NetflixChristmasmovie.In one showdown with Riseborough, we watch as a blotch spreads across Winslet’s neck. “I really appreciate that you noticed that,” she says, “because when I get overwhelmed and stressy, my neck does go red.” The makeup artist flagged it; “Yeah, we’re totally leaving that in,” replied Winslet – just as she did when someonepointed out a bit of bumpy tumin her2023 Lee Miller biopic.“I’m infinitely more comfortable playing characters who don’t look perfect all the time, because I don’t understand that as a conceit. I want audiences to be able to see something of themselves, of their reality, in the stories playing out in front of them.”The complication is that Goodbye June could be held up as an example of palliative best practice. For all its scrupulous accuracy regarding June’s condition – medical experts combed the script; it all feels totally kosher – her decline unfolds in an impeccably unhurried and compassionate hospital, to which June is rushed after a fall and allowed to remain for as long as she likes. Her family – so devoted their visits are put on a rota – deck out her en suite room with plants, tinsel, furniture and a fridge. She has morphine on tap and a specialist healthcare worker, Nurse Angel (Fisayo Akinade), who goes above and beyond.I think the soul does live for ever and this is a transient experience. None of us know, and that’s why it’s  marvellousToni Collette“My initial thought was: could this be far-fetched?” says Akinade on the phone a few days later. But two palliative nurses – and his own mother, a carer – confirmed it wasn’t. “Not at all. One said: ‘The other week, we had a party in one room; I just put the family in there and closed the door.’”Setting the film in Cheltenham, rather than London, was strategic, says Winslet, so the drama wouldn’t be overshadowed by chaos or overcrowding. “Everyone’s experience is going to be very different. But I really did find the endless warmth and outpouring of support from the palliative care team overwhelming.”Later, Spall points out the film isn’t explicit about whether June’s care is fullyNHSor partially private – “whether it’s a mixture of them both, you don’t know” – though the absence of that conversation means that I, at least, assumed the former.View image in fullscreenJohnny Flynn as Connor, Andrea Riseborough as Molly, Timothy Spall as Bernie, Kate Winslet as Julia and Fisayo Akinade as Nurse Angel in Goodbye June.Photograph: Netflix/PAFor her own part,Winslet recently saidthat her mother’s condition necessitated moving her into a private ward at the very end of her life, about which the whole family were “horribly conflicted”. Spall uses both, he says: “It’s a bit of a lottery, which is the fault of the system. Some places are really organised and some are really struggling. If you’re lucky, you end up in a place like this one.”“It was important,” says Winslet firmly, “to maintain June’s dignity and sense of pride as a woman.” At one point, her children discover June has already drawn up a care plan. “She had made her choices. Sticking to that mattered enormously. It felt very necessary not to deviate from honouring the agency she had in her own decline.”There is some uncertainty among June’s children about when their mother realises she is never going home. Not for Winslet. “I think she knows exactly what’s happening. She knows that it’s coming and in those quiet moments when she’s alone, she is fearful.”If Winslet the director has a proxy in Goodbye June, it’s not the character she plays, but June herself: the woman in the middle, orchestrating everybody while trying not to look too worried. “I wanted to let everyone be free to make mistakes,” she says of being on set, “and never let on if I was feeling the pressure of the time-crunch. Because if you’ve only got 35 days, and Helen Mirren for 16 of those days, and seven children, you have to make your days.”She managed this by being “very, very good at being able to see everyone and assess what they need. I’d be talking to Tim one minute and then just revolving my body and engaging with Helen in a completely different way about the same exact scene. I found that really fascinating, knowing how to flip and adapt, and being open to how different and sometimes odd people can be in the greatest of ways.“I can count on the fingers of one hand – or less, frankly – the tricky experiences I’ve had with actors across 33 years. You have to be totally non-judgmental and embrace whatever that person brings into the room.”We’re not encouraged to ask questions in the face of death. It’s not in the interests of the powers that be that we really think about our purpose on the planetJohnny FlynnSpall backs this up. He first worked with Winslet in 1996 and says he always knew she would be a good director. Still, the atmosphere on Goodbye June was “exceptional, considering when you look at the lineup, you go: ‘OK, fucking hell, this could go either way.’ But instantly there was this warmth and kindness. She’s worked with some of the best directors in the world, had good and bad experiences, and is ultra-intelligent, ultra-open.”Especially with the children – whose scenes are notably unforced and charming. “You get so many directors who are afraid of kids and let the handler deal with their stuff,” says Spall. Winslet, however, would set up shots with a baby on one arm, a toddler at her side, playing with another one, chatting to actors all the while. “She’s a mum, you know; got three kids of her own. Knows what she’s doing.”It is too crass, I ask her, to suggest female directors do things differently? “No,” says Winslet. “Female directors do operate in a different way. I really think so, just because of our sensibility. Typically, female directors are mothers and the amount of mothering that we do in our own lives automatically transfers because you want to look after everyone. It’s just an instinct. This is not to say women are better than men. I would never ever say that. But it is different.”Ispeak to Winslet solo in a Soho hotel room. Shortly after she leaves, Riseborough and Collette come in to pay tribute to her and talk about death. Of all the cast, Collette seems happiest to engage with that tricky thing: the film’s potential place in theassisted dying debate.“I think society in general likes to manipulate and control,” she says, forthright and smiley. “And if you can’t give someone the privilege of letting go of their experience on Earth with any kind of grace and space, then that’s really fucking shit, isn’t it? To be able to do it in the way that they want.”View image in fullscreenToni Collette as Helen in Goodbye June.Photograph: Kimberley French/Netflix“I’m a Scorpio,” she continues. “I have a very active, passionate, spiritual life and I think the problem with humanity is that we feel so disconnected from everything else. Not just people, but from nature. We are nature. I think the soul does live for ever and this is a transient experience. None of us know, and that’s why it’s fucking marvellous.”Riseborough nods. The two women are on the same page; one just reads it out a bit more. “I used to be very, very angry,” says Collette, “about the fact that our very existence is a mystery. It took a lot of time to work through it. Now I just think it’s beautiful.”After a screening of the film the previous night, says Collette, she cried thinking about people spending Christmas alone: “It breaks my heart a little bit.” She trails off, then slaps her knee in mock cheer: “But if they’ve got Netflix, they’ve got us!”“It’s very healing to see people come together over death,” says Riseborough. “It may sound morbid …”“It’s not morbid!” says Collette. “It’s part of life. And it can be a celebration.”Ispeak to Spall in the same room, too, alongside tea andJohnny Flynn. Spall merrily reminds us he almost died, aged 39, of leukaemia, so he’s had “a peek over the precipice” and has a “vested interest” in demystifying the whole business.“Shitting and sex and death: all are taboo and all happen all the time, but we hardly ever talk about them properly,” he says. “When someone dies, there’s a ring on the bell and the milkman wants his money. That’s what happened when my dad died.”Both men happily bat back and forth what seem to be the film’s most overt nods to religion: scenes in a chapel; God’s-eye camerawork; the nurse called Angel; a nativity play just as things get really critical. Dying, they agree, makes such reflection inevitable.View image in fullscreenTimothy Spall, Toni Collette, Kate Winslet, Joe Anders, Andrea Riseborough, Fisayo Akinade and Johnny Flynn.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Guardian“There’s an old saying,” says Spall. “‘There are no atheists in a foxhole.’ If you’re at war and about to die, you’re praying to something.” For his part, he reads and thinks constantly about “eschatological matters”. Names like Meister Eckhart,Rumiand Richard Rohr tumble from him. In 2023, he mounted an exhibition of his canvases of angels in anguish.Flynn listens sympathetically. Spall paints; Flynn writes and records music – songs rooted in English folklore and rural mysticism. “In Christian liturgy there’s this service I love called compline,” he says, “which is basically about getting ready for bed. It’s really short, but it has a sense of like: right, I’ve got from here to there.”Female directors operate differently. The amount of mothering we do transfers automatically and you want to look after everyone. It’s an instinctKate WinsletContemplation is always helpful, however final the event it marks. “And it always boggles me, the absence of meaningful spiritual conversation around Christmas. So it is really nice to have a small sense of that energy and meditation. In society today, we’re not encouraged towards asking questions in the face of death, because it’s not in the interests of the powers that be that we really think about what’s going on in terms of our purpose on the planet.”June hopes to be reincarnated as snow, or to live on through the stories told by others. Flynn’s father died when he was 18; he now sings to his children a lullaby his father wrote. “So, in a way, my dad is still singing my kids to sleep, even though they never met him. And they have this really strong sense of him.”As a palliative care specialist, I’ve witnessed the human tragedy of our end-of-life care crisis | Rachel ClarkeRead moreSpall is moved – and heartened. “Whenever you are in a strain of memory, you are immortal, because you’re still living in other people.” And there’s more, he thinks; something deeper, something spookier: “Just at the moment my daughter was born, a tiny little thing, I saw everybody I knew in my family flash right past her face, like a kaleidoscope.”Goodbye June is a film born from a similar impulse: to keep alive those who have gone before by sharing their memory, and hoping it helps others. To encourage ghosts, not exorcise them.“You learn to live with the changing shape of grief,” says Winslet. “And whether you like it or not, you might see signs of that person in places and actually feel their physical presence. Particularly at times of year when you all would come together, like Christmas. In those moments, I certainly feel my mum is still very much around.”Goodbye June is in cinemas from 12 December and on Netflix from 24 DecemberExplore more on these topicsFilmKate WinsletDeath and dyingAssisted dyingHealthNHSHospitalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tate Modern’s Turbine Hallis currently occupied by a feeble installationthat would be weak in an ordinary-sized art space, let alone this gigantic one. It’s become genuinely hard to understand what Tate’s priorities are when it chooses artists for the annual Turbine Hall commission. And the Turner prize is even more mystifying. Once the stage of shocking, provocative art that engaged – whether they were for or against – a massive public, it has retreated into wilful obscurity, its trips around the UK starting to seem part of a studied wholesomeness. What’s the point ofstaging it in Bradfordwhen the shortlist just exports the enigmatic tastes of a metropolitan elite?Is Maria Balshaw,who is quitting her post as director of Tate, solely responsible for this? No, but perhaps she is courageously taking the blame and allowing the institution to reinvent itself as it needs to, fast. The achievements Tate stresses in its announcement of her departure centre on how she has “diversified” the collection, exhibition and audiences. But in that noble quest, there has been a loss of artistic ambition, aesthetic thrills, raw horror and beauty. Sometimes we really do want art for art’s sake and Tate has lost sight of that.This is appallingly evident in the collection displays, which critics don’t often write about but visitors have to endure. Tate Modern’s galleries have slid into insulting incoherence, and in the last few years treasures like its Rothkos, Picassos and surrealists have often been out of view. The rehang at Tate Britain did get critiqued in 2023,with justifiable harshness, for it puts politics before art, patronising everyone with loftily proclaimed yet naive readings of British history – such as criticising baroque artists for not being Ranters or Hogarth for being heteronormative. I can think those things for myself. Or perhaps better things.There have been some great Tate shows too, yet they were often marred by silly side battles. I was astounded by thesuperb Cézanne blockbusterin 2022. It didn’t worry me that contemporary artists were invited to make irrelevant, politically charged interventions – but in truth, when you are trying to understand what Cézanne is up to in paintings that pixelate the sunburnt rocks of Provence into cubism and abstraction, it doesn’t help to also have to work out what makes one of these stony landscapes colonialist. It would have baffled Edward Said.View image in fullscreenBathers (Les Grandes Baigneuses) at Tate Modern’s Cézanne exhibition, 2022.Photograph: Guy Bell/AlamyYet since Cézanne and Rodin, the brilliant retrospectives of modern greats that used to grace Tate Modern – it began, back in the noughties, with the unforgettableMatisse Picasso– have thinned out. Tate brags aboutLeigh Bowery!as a highlight of Balshaw’s time but this was a wasted opportunity: the great, unmissable exhibition would have been one that reunited all Lucian Freud’s portraits of Bowery.So the critic moans and gripes and – guess what? – the public agree. People have voted with their absence. Presumably it’s the poor attendances at Tate’s museums that are behind Balshaw’s departure. But she should not be made a scapegoat by an institution that simply ploughs on regardless. Tate has made arrogant, crass choices to put ideology ahead of art, worthiness ahead of aesthetic pleasure and bad politics over thoughtful radicalism. It needs to change its ways, not just its boss. Otherwise, given that Penelope Curtis left Tate Britain after criticism in 2020 while its current male head seems impermeable to an even worse performance, this will look like another misogynist removal of a powerful woman.Explore more on these topicsTate ModernTurbine HallArtPaintingSculpturecommentShareReuse this content"

The last time London’s Ambassadors theatre aimed to give audiences the shivers, with The Enfield Haunting, it led to somefrightfully poor reviews. But a couple of years later, this intimate West End playhouse is hosting Paranormal Activity, a new instalment in the franchise that was kickstarted by alow-budget supernatural movieabout a couple plagued by inexplicable nocturnal noises. “Hold your nerve” runs the play’s tagline – a directive you suspect applies not just to the audience.Arriving at the theatre on the day of the first preview, it’s not creepy bumps and thuds that echo through the building but whizzing drills, sound checks and the last-minute discussions of a crew with a deadline. Perched in the dress circle bar, US playwright Levi Holloway and director Felix Barrett (best known as the founder of immersive theatre specialists Punchdrunk) are discussing how rarely they have been frightened in the theatre.“I sawThe Woman in Black20 years ago,” says Barrett. “I so wanted it to be the most terrifying thing I’d ever seen. There were flourishes and moments but it just didn’t get me … I haven’t seen anything that has really scared me. We’re raising the bar on that ambition.”View image in fullscreenFrazzled states … Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat in the first Paranormal Activity film.Photograph: Paramount Pictures/AllstarHolloway’s CV includes Grey House, a hair-raising drama set in a cabin amid a blizzard, as well as a retelling of Pinocchio that amps up the fairytale’s fear factor. “I think horror in theatre is a burden and a privilege,” he says. “It’s pretty daunting. If the first question you ask is how you scare someone, you’re probably off on the wrong foot … Good theatre is usually about people being forced to change. And horror usually has people being forced to change in order to survive. So you just have to have a good, honest story. The weapons you deploy to unnerve or scare have to be in the narrative.”The pair make the case that horror brings audiences together like no other genre – more even than musicals or comedy. “It’s a bit of a sanity check with your neighbour, which seems kind of relevant right now,” says Holloway. “Like, does this scare you too? Yeah, stranger, this does scare me too!”Barrett says it provides catharsis “when the world itself is very scary” and the result is “bizarrely joyous”. Holloway adds: “Imagine if a rollercoaster only had one car. It’s a different thing. There’s something so thrilling about the camaraderie that happens in the lobby at the interval or after the show.” The pair enjoy eavesdropping on rattled audience members wrapping their heads around the show’s mystery.View image in fullscreen‘We wanted to get under your skin’ … Felix Barrett.Photograph: Stephen DobbieParanormal Activity premiered at Leeds Playhouse in the summer of 2024 (it has since been given a new ending) and a parallel production istouring the USto great acclaim. “What’s amazing about this, which is different from anything that I’ve done before, is that we did the illusions first,” says Barrett. Illusions designer Chris Fisher is more used to being summoned later in the process. “The clue’s in the title – we knew they needed to be baked in,” Barrett explains.Set designer Fly Davis has created a two-storey house for the play’s couple who have recently married in Chicago and moved to London for a fresh start. “They quickly encounter a truth that they can’t run from,” says Holloway. “So it’s about a marriage and it’s about the ghosts each person brings into that marriage.”The firstParanormal Activity film, written and directed byOren Peliand filmed in his own house over seven days, suggested that people can be as unfathomable as the occult – perhaps as malicious as any demon. The seven films in the franchise also explore the frazzled states that come with change and leave us vulnerable – such as moving to a new city or having a family. Starting work on the show, Barrett and Holloway were as sleep-deprived as the average doomed Paranormal Activity character. “Our sons were born back to back when we started this process,” says Holloway. “The original haunting!” laughs Barrett. Holloway says he hopes that audiences find the couple in the play familiar as his script “gives teeth to the mundane”. For Barrett, “it’s a portrait of a marriage and then there’s a third force coming in”. Holloway laughs: “A throuple!”What excited Barrett about the project was the memory of a trailer for the first film in 2009 featuring cinemagoers’ terrified responses. (It helped create a buzz that saw the $15,000 film make more than $100m within weeks at the US box office.) Barrett’s eyes flash as he savours the opportunity “to make an audience physically recoil in the theatre”. Seeing “the sweat and the fear in the eyes of the cast” will, he hopes, “bring it home all the more directly”.Grounding the story in realism has been key. The franchise followed the found-footage technique of The Blair Witch Project, with the first film featuring a series of timecoded nocturnal video recordings made by the couple who – like the audience – scrutinise each frame to help uncover the uncanny activity. It’s a “genius device” for a film, says Barrett. “But we made the decision on day one to not do that – let’s come up with a story that’s about liveness and about the threat and plausibility of what a live audience would be scared of.” He adds: “There’s a lot of cinematic trickery and camera work happening across theatre generally … we wanted to get under your skin and play with the idea of safety, what happens when that is under threat.”Horror theatre is all the rage.2: 22 – A Ghost Story, with its celebrity-led casts, had several West End seasons and ison tour. The macabre comedyInside No 9: Stage/Frightreturns for another London run in January. Rose Glass’s haunting film Saint Maud was brought spectacularly to the stagein Newcastlelast year. MeanwhileStranger Things: The First Shadowhas run for two years at the Phoenix theatre in London and is likely to get a boost from the fifth season of the Netflix show.What do the pair say to those who bemoan the dominance of plays based on such existing IP? “They’re in the service of bringing new audiences to the theatre,” says Holloway, who points out: “We’ve been lucky enough to do something original that is tied to a franchise, but it is about our fingerprint.”Barrett says that while theParanormal Activitybanner will attract new theatregoers, Holloway has written an emotionally affecting play that “could have a different title and be on at the Royal Court instead … There are touchstones that audiences are going to know if they’re into the franchise but we’ve striven to create something with substance.”View image in fullscreen‘The weapons you deploy to unnerve have to be in the narrative’ … Levi Holloway, centre, with the cast of Grey House on Broadway in 2023.Photograph: Bruce Glikas/WireImageOn the play’s previous outings, both have noticed an audience new to the world of theatre. “Like people shouting at the stage, ‘Don’t go in there!’ It’s so noisy,” says Holloway. “It took a minute, but then we just started embracing it because people are coming in and they’re like … is this what theatre can be?”Horror films and books fuelled the duo’s collaboration and burgeoning friendship. They rewatched Don’t Look Now, Jacob’s Ladder and When a Stranger Calls, turned to the stories ofArthur Machenand the novels ofJoe Hill. “We love creeping dread rather than schlocky gore,” adds Barrett. “The tendrils of a film wrapping around your neck.” As such, atmosphere is critical to Paranormal Activity, which has a sound design by Gareth Fry and lighting by Anna Watson.“The lights are as much a part of the narrative as the design, the illusion, the cast … You need an alchemy of ingredients to have the space in between,” says Barrett. “With a two-storey house you can’t watch everything simultaneously. There are corners and shadows where your imagination fills in the gaps. Anna’s lighting is amazing. You think you can just see to the back of the room but you can’t quite. As the claustrophobia builds, your imagination is starting to play tricks on you, like when you’re a kid in your bedroom.” In rehearsals, the company discussed their childhood fears and played games such as “grandmother’s footsteps”.Holloway: “The whole thing is kind of a dare.”Barrett: “It is! I yelped with fear and joy yesterday.”Holloway: “Yesterday! You’ve seen it a thousand times already …”Barrett: “It’s a visceral response. And it’s taken the journey from Leeds to here to get to that physicality.”The Ambassadors, with its proscenium arch, is a very un-Punchdrunk setting. “It’s like an amazing holiday,” Barrett laughs. “I’m getting a taste for it!” His company, founded in 2000, built a huge fanbase by taking over often unconventional spaces for site-specific spectaculars. More recently, their shows (including the gothicViola’s Room) have been put on at theirsprawling headquartersat Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, south-east London. But years offinding the right sitesfor their shows have given Barrett an astute understanding of a building’s feel.“The base job of any Punchdrunk show is to listen to the atmosphere of the space, work out where the threat is, the perceptible residue of something that’s gone before – the weight of time that can be felt keenly in a space.”But how much do they believe in the whole supernatural shebang? “I would love to believe,” says Holloway. “And I do believe people when they believe it. But I’ve never experienced the paranormal. I’m open to it.” Barrett adds: “I profoundly don’t believe but I’m obsessed with the history of spiritualism.”Several West End theatres are said to house ghosts, from “the Man in Grey” at Theatre Royal Drury Lane to an actor-manager at Theatre Royal Haymarket. But the Ambassadors is not famously haunted. “It will be after this show,” jokes Barrett. Holloway chuckles: “We’re working on it!”Paranormal Activity is at theAmbassadors theatre, London, until 28 March and on aUS touruntil 15 MarchExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreHorror booksHorror filmsParanormal ActivityPunchdrunkFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, at its heart is Jud (a superb Josh O’Connor), a young Catholic priest who butts heads with his new monsignor, Josh Brolin’s fire-and-brimstone Jefferson. Their flock – Glenn Close, Jeremy Renner, Andrew Scott, Kerry Washington – provide starry support in an unexpectedly moving exploration of truth and belief.Simon WardellOut now, NetflixF1View image in fullscreenSuitably spectacular … Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt in F1.Photograph: Warner BrosMade in conjunction with Formula One’s governing body, Joseph Kosinski’s pit-lane drama smacks of the real thing. Filmed at actual grand prix alongside actual drivers, it’s a high-glossredemption talein which Brad Pitt’s rule-bending, has-been racer is asked to save a failing F1 team threatened with a takeover – but only has nine races to do it. Damson Idris (surely based on producer Lewis Hamilton) is the rookie with lessons learn from the older man. It’s great fun watching Pitt do his laconic charmer routine and the action is suitably spectacular.SWOut now, Apple TVElfView image in fullscreenChristmas spirit incarnate … Will Ferrell and Zooey Deschanel in Elf.Photograph: New Line/Sportsphoto/AllstarElfis a festive comedy that, in less accomplished hands, could easily have fallen into a vat of schmaltz. Luckily, Jon Favreau’s hardy perennial has an extremely high gag rate, and in star Will Ferrell a performer with exquisite timing. Ferrell plays Buddy, adopted as a baby by Papa Elf and as a grownup sent to New York to finally meet his birth father, Walter (James Caan). Christmas spirit incarnate, Buddy’s perpetual joy at the season, and endearingly unfiltered honesty, should make even the Scroogiest of viewers melt a little.SWSaturday 13 December, 8.05pm, Sky ShowcaseParis, 13th DistrictView image in fullscreenA tangled web … Paris, 13 th District.Photograph: Shanna BessonJacques Audiard’stangled dramamay be shot in black-and-white but there’s nothing monochrome about the young people it focuses on. Call centre worker Émilie (Lucie Zhang) rents a room to teacher Camille (Makita Samba), but their instant attraction soon dissolves into hostility. Meanwhile, Noémie Merlant’s mature student Nora is mistaken by her classmates for online sex worker Amber (Jehnny Beth), but then the two start to video chat … Romantic but realistic, it’s a film about wanting the same thing – but not necessarily at the same time.SWSaturday 13 December, 12.45am, BBC TwoThe Wedding BanquetView image in fullscreenDoubling down … Lily Gladstone in The Wedding Banquet.Photograph: Luka Cyprian/Bleecker Street/APThis remakeof Ang Lee’s 1993 comedy drama covers the same hiding-sexuality-for-a-green-card theme but in these more open times has to double down on its premise. So we get Seattle lesbian couple Angela and Lee (Kelly Marie Tran and Lily Gladstone), who are in the expensive midst of IVF, and their friends, Chris (Bowen Yang) and Min (Han Gi-Chan), who hasn’t come out to his rich Korean grandmother. The partner-swapping is nicely farcical if lacking in real jeopardy, but it’s an interesting LGBTQ take on marriage and motherhood.SWSunday 14 December, 9.25am, 6.10pm, Sky Cinema PremiereThe HolidayView image in fullscreenSwoon alert! … Cameron Diaz and Jude Law in The Holiday.Photograph: AlamyThe Winslet clan will be making several appearances on your telly this Christmas (see also Goodbye June and The Phoenician Scheme). Kicking us off is Mum, AKA Kate, as one quarter of a film that strives to prove that love on the rebound can work out. She plays Iris, who briefly quits snowy England for LA, with Cameron Diaz’s Amanda swapping homes with her after a breakup. The love interest comes from Iris’s brother Graham (Jude Law) and, rather less swooningly, Jack Black’s composer Miles.SWSunday 14 December, 8.30pm, BBC TwoEverything Everywhere All at OnceView image in fullscreenEnjoy the rollercoaster … Michelle Yeoh in Everything Everywhere All at Once.Photograph: Ley Line Entertainment/Album/AlamyFrenetic fun for (nearly) all the family, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s Oscar-laden comicsci-fi adventurenever lets up during its two-hour-plus runtime. Michelle Yeoh harks back to her Hong Kong action film past as a struggling laundromat owner thrown into an increasingly surreal series of alternative universes in an attempt to defeat a powerful iteration of her unhappy daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). More exposition would be pointless – just go with the hotdog finger-verse, the anime-verse and, most hilariously, the universe where all the characters are rocks – and enjoy the rollercoaster.SWMonday 15 December, 11.10pm, Film4Dune: Part TwoView image in fullscreenGobsmacking … Dune: Part Two.Photograph: Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/APNext Christmas should see the cinema release of the third in Denis Villeneuve’s space opera trilogy, derived from Frank Herbert’s novels. IfNo 2is anything to go by, it should be worth the wait. Timothée Chalamet returns as Paul Atreides, heir to a colonising dynasty but also the prophesised liberator of the people of desert planet Arrakis, AKA Dune. Amid gobsmacking effects and intricate plotting, it’s a chilling tale of power and faith corrupting the best of intentions. Paul is the messiah, but he’s also a very naughty boy. SWWednesday 17 December, 10.25pm, Sky Cinema GreatsMission: Impossible – The Final ReckoningView image in fullscreenOh how we love it so … Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.Photograph: Paramount Pictures/Skydance/APIf this is the last we see of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt, then it will prove a fine farewell. Theeighth adventurefor the undercover agent returns him to the seemingly impossible battle against AI force the Entity, which has gained control of most of the world’s nuclear weapons. But the ins and outs of the plot are beside the point when you get to witness exhilarating action sequences such as Ethan’s dive into a sunken Russian submarine or a vertiginous fight on a biplane. But arguably the best scene is earlier on, when US military and political bigwigs are given an increasingly comical recap of Ethan’s rule-breaking exploits down the years, plus all his colleagues who have died in the process. It’s a superb encapsulation of the absurdity of the whole M:I enterprise – and why we love it so.SWFriday 19 December, 9.40am, 8pm,Sky Cinema PremiereThe Great FloodView image in fullscreenFrantic … Kim Da-mi and Kwon Eun-seong in The Great Flood.Photograph: Jeong Kyung-hwa/NetflixAn asteroid has hit Antarctica and melted it. For the residents of a Seoul apartment complex, that means a race to the highest floor before tsunamis hit them all. This frantic end-of-the-world thriller may have you working out how long you can hold your breath, as Kim Da-mi’s scientist Gu An-na and her young son Jan-in (Kwon Eun-seong) struggle through the waters. But the presence of her AI tech firm’s security operative Son Hee-jo (Park Hae-soo) hints at a weirder plot twist to come. SWFriday 19 December, NetflixShellView image in fullscreenEntertainingly silly … Kate Hudson and Elisabeth Moss in Shell.Photograph: RepublicIn between seasons of The Handmaid’s Tale, Max Minghella directed his co-star Elisabeth Moss in anotherdystopian drama– this near-future horror about the pitfalls of chasing the perfect body. Moss plays Samantha, an actor who signs up for an anti-ageing skin treatment (derived, ominously, from lobsters). It’s run by a company owned by 68-year-old – though you wouldn’t know it – Zoe Shannon (Kate Hudson). In true The Substance fashion, it all goes badly wrong, as the film gives in to its B-movie sensibilities and becomes increasingly, entertainingly silly. SWFriday 19 December, Paramount+ShrekView image in fullscreenOne of the great comic creations of the century … Donkey (Eddie Murphy) with Shrek (Mike Myers) in Shrek.Photograph: ReutersIt should be obligatory to read your kids every fairytale you can get your hands on. Because denying them the full enjoyment of all the fable-based gags in this sublime animated comedy feels like a cruelty worthy of an evil stepmother. There is some originality here, too, not least Shrek himself (voiced by Mike Myers), a grumpy green ogre forced to save the kingdom from the petty Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). And let’s not forget Eddie Murphy’s Donkey, one of the greatest comic creations this century. SWSaturday 20 December, 3.10pm, ITV1Bad SantaView image in fullscreenWhat a wrong ‘un … Bob Thornton and Brett Kelly in Bad Santa.Photograph: Rex FeaturesHe’s an incorrigible alcoholic and womaniser with a foul mouth who hates kids. So not the perfect choice for a department store Santa. But Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) has a cunning plan: every Christmas Eve, he and his “elf” helper Marcus (Tony Cox) rob the mall in which they set up their grotto. Terry Zwigoff’scomedyis true to its unsentimental premise despite the tinselly trappings, and Thornton wholeheartedly embodies a man who – even when his heart is tugged by a lonely, bullied boy – is still a wrong ’un. SWSaturday 20 December, 11.10pm, Comedy CentralIt’s a Wonderful LifeView image in fullscreenThrillingly life-affirming … It’s a Wonderful Life.Photograph: World History Archive/AlamyIt’s a Wonderful Lifeis so roundly celebrated as a festive staple that its reputation often camouflages the fact that this is a deeply weird film. The story of a man driven to suicidal thoughts by decades of relentless self-sacrifice, the bulk of it has precisely zero to do with Christmas. The fact that it can meander in such gloomy waters and still result in the most thrillingly life-affirming third act in cinema history is a testament to director Frank Capra and star James Stewart.Stuart HeritageSunday 21 December, 12.45pm, ITV1OppenheimerView image in fullscreenThe least Christmassy film ever made – watch out! … Cillian Murphy in Oppenheimer.Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures/APChristopher Nolan’sbiopicof Robert Oppenheimer is an impossible thing. It’s the story of the leading brain behind the atomic bomb, told in a non-chronological fashion that doesn’t care a jot whether its audience can keep up. Paced like a thriller, it contains plenty of spectacle, a truckload of career-best performances (including Cillian Murphy in the title role) and moments of all-out dread that will stay with you for years. It deserves every scrap of the commercial and critical success it got. It is also, however, the least Christmassy film ever made, so watch out for that.Sunday 21 December, 9pm, BBC TwoNativity!View image in fullscreenA full-hearted magic trick … Martin Freeman and Ashley Jensen in Nativity!Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyAlthough its impact has been diluted by several sequels that failed to recapture its joy, the first Nativity! film still feels like a full-hearted magic trick. Ostensibly the story of a miserable teacher (Martin Freeman) who rediscovers his sense of self as his school gets ready for a visit from a Hollywood producer, the joy of Nativity! comes from the child performers, who walk the line between chaotically silly and so aggressively heartfelt that they will reduce you to tears. The closest any film has come to a school nativity, for better or worse.Monday 22 December, 2.20pm, BBC OneChallengersView image in fullscreenOne of the sexiest films ever made … Mike Faist, Zendaya and Josh O’Connor in Challengers.Photograph: Metro Goldwyn Mayer PicturesLuca Guadagnino makes films like a man running out of time. Last year he directed both Queer andChallengers. And while Queer was arguably the best work of his career, Challengers was by far his most successful. A tale of former tennis doubles teammates who find themselves competing against each other after years of differing fortunes, Challengers is also one of the sexiest films ever made. There’s a simmering tension at all times between Josh O’Connor, Mike Faist and Zendaya, the three leads, that culminates in a breathtaking final sequence.SHMonday 22 December, 10.40pm, BBC OneGoodbye JuneFilm pickView image in fullscreenMachine-tooled to generate tears … Toni Collette in Goodbye June.Photograph: Kimberley French/NetflixMake mine a double Winslet. Not only doesKate Winsletproduce, direct (for the first time) and star in this seasonal weepie, but her son Joe Anders wrote the screenplay. Helen Mirren plays the titular June, who is dying in hospital from cancer and probably won’t make it to Christmas Day. Her grownup children – reliable Julia (Kate Winslet), resentful Molly (Andrea Riseborough), nervous Connor (Johnny Flynn) and new-agey Helen (Toni Collette) – rally round, but the agonising wait for the end brings all the family’s imperfections to the surface. Although it’s almost machine-tooled to generate tears (death, cute kids, hugs), the great cast pitch it perfectly between tragedy and joy.SWChristmas Eve, NetflixPaddingtonView image in fullscreenThis film has it all … Paddington.Photograph: Studiocanal/PAPaddingtonis now such an immovable national treasure that, whenever a beloved celebrity dies, social media fills with images of him literally escorting them to heaven. So it’s worth bearing in mind that Paul King’s film was a complete punt when it was made 11 years ago. At first, people complained about everything – from the slapstick comedy to the character’s weird design. But in the end, we’re all helpless before Paddington and his ability to show us who we want to be. Silly and sincere, hilarious and moving, this film has it all.SHChristmas Eve, 5.30pm, BBC OneA Minecraft MovieView image in fullscreenExpect pandemonium … A Minecraft Movie.Photograph: Warner Bros EntertainmentThink very carefully about the time you put this on for the kids. While A Minecraft Movie is fun and fast and colourful, effortlessly blending the lore of the world-beating video games with Jack Black’s high-voltage buffoonery, you may remember that its “chicken jockey” scene led to outright pandemonium in cinemas around the world. Putting it on first thing on Christmas morning, when they’re high on Haribo, will almost certainly lead to disaster. Much better to wait until after they’re groggy and full from dinner.SHChristmas Day, 7.10am, 6.15pm, Sky Cinema PremiereWallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most FowlView image in fullscreenIrresistible … Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl.Photograph: Richard Davies/Courtesy of NetflixOne year old and already a festive mainstay,Vengeance Most Fowlmarks the return of Feathers McGraw, the silently evil penguin last seen in 1993’s The Wrong Trousers. The runtime here is beefed up from that, however, thanks to the sheer amount of elements it has to fit in. The Aardman animation crams in mystery, suspense, more shameless puns that you can possibly count (Anton Deck remains a masterpiece) and a surprisingly sharp critique of AI. All that wrapped in a charming faux-nostalgic bow. Irresistible.SHChristmas Day, 11.40am, BBC OneMatilda the MusicalView image in fullscreenExcellent … Emma Thompson and Charlie Hodson-Prior in Matilda the Musical.Photograph: Dan Smith/NetflixAlthough Danny DeVito’s 1996 adaptation of Roald Dahl’s beloved novel has its strengths,Matilda the Musicalfeels like the film the book always deserved. Based on the stage musical by Dennis Kelly and Tim Minchin, it tells the story we all know – a lonely, self-reliant girl finds herself developing magical powers – while blasting it into orbit. The mood is heightened. The performances, especially Emma Thompson (literally) swinging for the fences as the abominable Miss Trunchbull, are excellent.SHChristmas Day, 1pm, BBC OneJawsView image in fullscreenStill a work of remarkable tension … Roy Scheider in Jaws.Photograph: Pictorial Press /AlamyIt is right and proper to end the50th-anniversary year of Jawswith a special screening on terrestrial television. After all, this is probably how most of us encountered the film in the first place. Incredibly, though the shark itself has now fully aged into kitsch, Jaws has lost none of its power. It is still a work of remarkable tension, and John Williams’s score still manages to fill you with instant terror. The mayor’s Johnsonian insistence on carrying on as normal in the face of obvious doom is just as maddening as it ever was, too. A classic for a reason. A making-of documentary follows straight after.SHChristmas Day, 9.15pm, BBC TwoNotting HillView image in fullscreenNever bettered … Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant in Notting Hill.Photograph: AllstarNotting Hillis arguably the pinnacle of the entire romcom genre. The storyline you will remember; Hugh Grant (playing a regular old bookshop owner in west London) falls in love with Julia Roberts (to all intents and purposes playing herself). But their differing statuses, and the attention of a clamouring media, work to drive them apart. However, on rewatching you’ll be struck by just how pin-sharp Richard Curtis’s dialogue is, and how it manages to fling the film forward even when the pacing starts to dawdle. Much imitated, never bettered.SHChristmas Day, 11.15pm, Channel 4The Rocky Horror Picture ShowView image in fullscreenWhat a classic … Tim Curry in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Sportsphoto/AllstarRare is the film that can outpace a reputation as a cult classic and simply become a classic, butThe Rocky Horror Picture Showis exactly that. A strait-laced couple enter the bizarre world of scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter and his muscular creation Rocky. In the space of a single evening they encounter musical numbers, sci-fi pastiche, horror, comedy and debauched excess. In short, precisely the thing you should watch to blow off steam after a day struggling to make polite conversation with the in-laws.SHChristmas Day, 12.25am, BBC FourCover-UpView image in fullscreenExposing the powers that be … Seymour Hersh in Washington Bureau Personnel, 1975.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/ReduxLaura Poitras and Mark Obenhaus’sprofile of veteran investigative journalistSeymour Hersh shows the absolute necessity of people like him – professional irritants who expose what the powers that be would prefer to stay hidden. From the My Lai massacre in Vietnam to Watergate to the Abu Ghraib prison abuses in Iraq, Hersh has been the driving force in revealing some of the biggest US scandals in modern history. He does get things wrong, as this documentary makes clear, and he’s a hard man to warm to, but it’s obvious that the struggle for accountability and transparency is far from over.SWBoxing Day, NetflixSinnersView image in fullscreenA runaway success … Michael B Jordan and Miles Caton in Sinners.Photograph: Warner Bros PicturesFilms like Ryan Coogler’sSinnersdon’t come along very often, especially now. A period vampire movie about the Mississippi delta in the 1930s that functions both as broad entertainment and an allegory about white appropriation of Black culture, Sinners was at once a critical darling and a runaway financial success. This might be down to how unashamedly sexy it is, or it might be down to its wildly good soundtrack. Either way, it’s a sign that people will still show up for quality projects.SHBoxing Day, 11.25am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere"

It’s not very showbiz,” Cohen says.It’s the busiest time of year for Cohen and Luu, assistant directors who founded not-for-profit organisationEvery Day Actionduring the Covid pandemic. Designed to helpunhoused peopleand those facing food insecurity across the city, the idea was born when Cohen noticed the amount of food waste on film and TV sets, and looked into redistributing it to those in need. “I remember asking, ‘Why can’t we donate this food?’ I kept being told it was illegal and that people could sue us if they got sick.” It didn’t take Luu, who grew up working in a soup kitchen her father founded, long to establish this was not the case. “In the US, there’s the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act that’s been around since 1996,” she says. “It protects food donors from liability issues.”They’re not the only women trying to turn the big screen green. In 2009, trailblazer Shannon Bart foundedEcoSet, an environmental production resource based in Hollywood that introduced recycling and composting to sets and began donating creative materials to nearby artists, theatres and schools. In the UK,Albertis a nationwide initiative from Bafta that helps the film and TV industry be more sustainable. One of its biggest goals is to phase out fuel generators on sets, which has the ability to wipe out as much as 5% of all emissions created by the sector. April Sotomayor, Bafta’s head of industry sustainability, says: “We’re also trying to encourage talent not to use private jets. Even getting them into first class goes a long way to reducing the carbon footprint of a production.”View image in fullscreen‘I remember asking: “Why can’t we donate this food?”,’ Cohen says.Photograph: PixelCatchers/Getty Images/iStockphotoAt the production coalface,Green Rideris a collective that sets environmental guidelines for productions, including using grid power, introducing ride-sharing for cast and crew and using beef-free caterers. Their efforts have reduced pollution on productions, including Wolf Hall and Gangs of London, by up to 80%. Tilly Ashton, whom Sotomayor calls a “darling of the sustainability industry”, co-created Wales’s first sustainability coordinator training programme for aspiring creatives last year. AndPropUpis a London-based non-profit set up by ex-producers Emma Chaplin and Kate Allan to rehome and recycle props and sets from popular TV shows. Despite preconceptions, what they do is serious business. “One prop can be life-changing,” Allan says. “Whether that’s a belt that means someone can wear something comfortable to a job interview or a rucksack that can help a child escape domestic violence.”These eco initiatives across film and TV are thriving. Every Day Action now redistributes more than 80,000 meals a year. It also works with big studios including Warner Bros and Disney, the latter of which recently found itself in hot water whenit was revealed the production of its live-action Snow Whiteemitted 3,153 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. They are also needed more than ever in cities such as LA, where 25% of the populationface food insecurity.View image in fullscreenRachel Zegler in Snow White, the production of which emitted 3,153 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.Photograph: Disney/APEvery Day Action can also offer supplementary income to people starting out in the entertainment business through its industry driver programme. It works because they’re insiders who understand set protocols and timings and can easily read site maps. Most importantly, though, they don’t get starstruck. “We can send them on set and they’re OK with only seeing mashed potatoes,” says Cohen.As for PropUp, it has now rehomed more than 50,000 props and partnered with ITV ReLoved, meaning fans can buy merch and niche memorabilia from its online shop – such as a Free Marlon Dingle poster from Emmerdale or Frankie Bridge’s I’m a Celebrity T-shirt – the profits of which are funnelled back into charitable causes. “We recently sold the Fernando’s sign from Take Me Out,” Chaplin says. Every Day Action has a similar tale to tell. “We were once given a bag of 200 flavoured condoms and a bunch of butt plugs” from the set of a show which must remain anonymous, Luu says. They were rehomed by a local sex worker outreach programme before their landlords, religious order Daughters of Charity, caught wind, in case you were wondering.View image in fullscreenHer T-shirt could be yours … Frankie Bridge in I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! in 2021.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockWomen are dominating the space. A 2023reportfound that 58% of chief sustainability officer roles are held by women. The broadcasting world, especially, is leading the charge, with women such as Danielle Mulder and Sara Peacock heading up sustainable drives at the BBC and S4C respectively.The end goal for Every Day Action and PropUp is to inspire more grassroots action, with a few small tweaks to regular programming. The duo in LA have their eyes on an industrial fridge-freezer, while in the UK Chaplin and Allan hope to open a bricks and mortar shop. “We’re not sustainability experts, we’re just two women who saw a problem and wanted to do something about it,” Chaplain says. “It’s not rocket science.”Explore more on these topicsFilmWomen (Society)Women (Life and style)Film industryHomelessnessHousingPovertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Modern couples’ dressing isn’t just about looking coordinated; it’s a semiotic performance.”For the fashion psychologist Dr Dion Terrelonge, “when a couple dress the same they may be consciously or subconsciously signalling the strength of their bond and togetherness … The question is, why a couple might feel the need to signal the status of their relationship to those outside of it.”View image in fullscreenBritney Spears and Justin Timberlake go double denim in 2001.Photograph: Mark J Terrill/APHis and hers matching outfits are not a new thing. Zoë Kravitz and Harry Styles haverecently been spotted wearing similar beige-on-taupe outfits. Arguably, though, couples dressing is most fun when it does go for gold, or purple: David and Victoria Beckham’s matching purple at their wedding is seared on the nation’s retinas. Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake famously did it via a wrangle of denim. Then there’s the bold tailoring of Elton John and David Furnish, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky, the suit-loving Gilbert & George.Looking further back, Sonny and Cher enjoyed matching their bell bottoms, fringing and fur. John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s fruitful creative partnership and aligned values at times found expression via military garb or head-to-toe white.“When couples engaged in joint ventures dress the same they are to some extent saying that not only are they internally connected and one, but that they are joint in their output also,” said Terrelonge.Phillips cited other historical examples of couples dressing alike. “During Hollywood’s golden age, iconic duos like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers or Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton used coordinated attire to … project an ideal of glamour and cohesion, effectively presenting themselves as a single public ‘brand’.”Couple dressing is not just for showbiz. In Hemingway’s posthumously published, half-finished novel The Garden of Eden, a couple’s style merges into a shared uniform of fisherman shirts and espadrilles. Hair is shorn to match; their aesthetics mirror one another as they toy with gender roles. F Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, were also photographed in matching outfits.“Across these eras, couples dressing consistently occupies the space between intimacy and performance, functioning as both a personal expression and a public narrative,” said Phillips.View image in fullscreenElton John and David Furnish at the Oscars in 2020.Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty ImagesFor celebrity couples dressing alike today, Phillips thinks the “impulses have shifted: in the early 2000s, the focus was on conspicuous cohesion … to assert power, status and public visibility”. Today’s approach, she says, “is conceptually driven and often social media conscious”. Branding is also a key driver.The UKCP relationship therapist Marianne Johnson makes a distinction between celebrity and non-celebrity couples dressing alike. “As a celebrity couple you might share a love of being in the spotlight … It’s creative and bonding for the couple.” Whereas “on a non-celebrity front, I think couples often seem to influence each other’s style”.When non-celebrity couples dress alike on purpose it tends togenerate attention– cringes or “awws”, at least in the west. But it is a common occurrence in some non-western cultures. In South Korea, for instance, it is called thekou-peullook, with couples dressing similarly to demonstrate their love or foster closeness.Couples who dress alike: ‘It looks like we’re from the same cult’Read more“Psychologically speaking, matching or echoing one another’s clothing can signal a sense of unity and be a non-verbal way of saying: we share a world together,” said Johnson. “We naturally mirror the people we feel close to, and clothing is one of the more visible ways mirroring can show up.”But even for non-celebrities, Phillips pointed out, “it often functions as personal branding, an image of the couple that they want the world to internalise”.She said it was “not all calculated marketing. There’s still an intimate dimension: the joy of synchronicity, playful coordination, or expressing relational identity visually. Branding and genuine expression coexist.”Whether you see this particular couple dressing in orange as a sweet expression of togetherness or a cynical marketing ploy might be nuanced. But there is a brilliant simplicity toone user’s take on X: “Both look like oranges.”Explore more on these topicsTimothée ChalametKylie JennerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her early works, written under the pseudonym Caroline Harvey, were historical romances, but from the mid-1980s onward, she turned to contemporary fiction, a shift that would define her reputation.In a statement, her daughters said she died peacefully at home on Thursday.“It is with great sadness that we learn of the passing of Joanna Trollope, one of our most cherished, acclaimed and widely enjoyed novelists,” said the author’s literary agent, James Gill. “Joanna will be mourned by her children, grandchildren, family, her countless friends and – of course – her readers.”Trollope’s breakthrough came with novels including The Rector’s Wife, which in 1991knocked leading authorsoff the top of the charts, and later works including A Village Affair and Mum & Dad, which tackled issues ranging from infidelity, remarriage, parenthood and adoption to the strains on the so-called “sandwich generation” caring for both their children and their parents.Though sometimes dismissed by critics as “middlebrow” or “cosy” – Terence Blackerfamously labelledher novels “Aga sagas” – Trollope long rejected such categorisations. In a2006 interviewwith the Guardian, she said, “actually, the novels are quite subversive, quite bleak. It’s all rather patronising isn’t it?” Rather than fairytale versions of domestic life, her books were praised by critics for their honest reflections of ordinary people’s dilemmas, addressing themes of broken families, difficult relationships, love and betrayal.Born in 1943 in Gloucestershire, Trollope is a distant descendant of Anthony Trollope, the celebrated 19th-century novelist known for The Chronicles of Barsetshire and The Palliser novels. She studied English at St Hugh’s College, Oxford, before joining the Foreign Office. She subsequently turned to teaching. It was during this period, while balancing work with raising two daughters, that she began writing in earnest.Throughout the 1990s and 00s, she produced a succession of bestsellers, including A Village Affair, Next of Kin, Other People’s Children and Marrying the Mistress. Many were adapted for television, bringing her stories to an even wider audience. Explaining her success, she said in a 1993 interview: “I think my books are just the dear old traditional novel making a quiet comeback”.Trollope’s later novels demonstrated her awareness of social and economic change. In City of Friends she turned her attention to the pressures women faced in corporate life; in Mum & Dad, published when she was in her 70s, she explored the strains of elder care.The changing expectations of women were a central concern in Trollope’s work. “I was born at the very end of 1943, and for my generation there were almost no women who worked,” she said in a 2017 interview with Radio Times. “I knew I wanted to, and I did. Then you get my daughters’ generation – I’ve got one of 48 and one of 45, the same age roughly as the characters in City of Friends – and they all work. And by the time you get to the generation of my 18-year-old granddaughter, they wouldn’t think of not working.” In a 1994episode of Desert Island Discs, she again addressed criticisms from men who suggested her books were trivial, responding: “It is a grave mistake to think there is more significance in great things than in little things”.She has been praised for her ability to give voice to the hidden anxieties of everyday life in her work – fellow novelist Fay Weldon once said Trollope had “a gift for putting her finger on the problem of the times”. In a2020 interviewwith the Guardian, Trollope echoed the sentiment, speaking about her motivation as a writer: “What I’m trying to do in all these novels is mirror a contemporary preoccupation. I’m not providing any solutions. I’m simply saying: ‘Can we please get the conversation going?’” She argued that fiction has value precisely because it can allow readers to “admit to all kinds of things that you can’t otherwise”.Away from writing, Trollope served as a judge for several major literary prizes and was an advocate for literacy and public libraries. She was awarded an OBE in 1996 and later elevated to CBE for services to literature. Later in life, she also spent time volunteering in prisons and young offender institutions, and was a patron of numerous charities.Trollope married a city banker, David Roger William Potter, in 1966. The couple had two daughters, Louise and Antonia, divorcing in 1983. Two years later, she married the television dramatist Ian Curteis and became a stepmother to his two sons. The pair divorced in 2001.Of her legacy, Trollopetold the Guardianin 2015: “I’d like to be remembered for something more general: that my novels were an enormous comfort to a lot of people who felt despair or jealousy or whatever it was. I want my books to say: ‘It’s OK, we all feel like that.’”Trollope is survived by her two daughters and her grandchildren.Explore more on these topicsBooksJoanna TrollopenewsShareReuse this content"

He was a perfectionist performer with huge talentActor and comedian Stanley Baxter dies aged 99Mark LawsonFri 12 Dec 2025 12.17 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 17.14 CETShareThe description “special” is overused in television schedules; Stanley Baxter’s programmes justify it. The comedian is one of the few stars whose reputation rests on a handful of astonishing one-offs – standalone comic extravaganzas screened in the 1970s and 1980s, first by ITV’s London WeekendTelevisionand then the BBC.In both cases, the networks ended their associations with Baxter not because of lack of audience interest – at their peak, the shows reached more than 20 million viewers – but due to the colossal costs demanded by the performer’s vast and perfectionist visual ambition. One of Baxter’s favourite conceits was to re-create, in witty pastiche, scenes from big-budget Hollywood movies that made it look as if his versions had also spent millions of dollars.Cashflow was further stretched by the fact that Baxter played multiple roles – 18 of them in one sketch. Recent digital technology has made such multiplications relatively easy, but at the time Baxter was sharing a screen with several selves, primitive image-mixing technology left a giveaway outline – like the chalk marks homicide cops put around a corpse on the sidewalk – when scenes recorded at different times were merged together.To avoid this, Baxter built up his multicharacter spectaculars moment by moment, often spending hours in costume and makeup between two lines of dialogue. Back views of doubles had to be carefully positioned in shot to produce the illusion that he was in conversation with others. Whereas most comedians – even the equally ambitious and meticulous Morecambe and Wise – routinely made a Christmas show in addition to a series of weekly episodes, Baxter would spend a year working on his.View image in fullscreenBaxter and Leslie Phillips in the 1964 film Father Came Too.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockBaxter’s performing fortune lay in two body parts: his ear and his legs. He was a precision mimic of celebrity and everyday voices, a skill that began, he told interviewers, when, as a child in Glasgow, he noticed the spectrum of Scottish accents, from a posh mock-Anglo to a patois so thick that it could sound initially to outsiders like Italian. The latter twang later inspired one of his most popular sketches, “Parliamo Glasgow”, a perfect showcase for his vocal virtuosity, in which a host with clipped BBC English “translated” densely Glaswegian sentences, such as the warning from a female to a male acquaintance that he was becoming overfamiliar by touching her buttocks: “Takyurhonaffmabum.”As well as his exceptional listening, Baxter was also lucky with his limbs. Not only could he do impressions with them as well – never having learned to tap-dance, he made it look as if he had by copying the trained – but they had the ideal dimensions for someone frequently required to play female characters.A surprise to those rewatching TV comedy from the 1960s to 1980s is the prevalence of drag acting. This was largely necessity. Because almost all star comedians were male but their material often involved marriage and/or misogyny, light entertainment resembled an all-boys school trying to put on a production ofThe Trojan Women. But, whereas frequent cross-dressers such as Les Dawson, Dick Emery and Terry Jones were built to play somewhat squat matriarchs, Baxter had calves and ankles of such unusual shapeliness for a man that he could plausibly portray superstar actresses of the Hollywood golden age. When he portrayed Fred Astaire, he could also play his dance partner, Ginger Rogers.In a 2019 Channel 5 profile in the Comedy National Treasures strand, the then 93-year-old Baxter explained that he did detailed impressions of Hollywood legends before knowing who they were. His mother, who had been prevented from becoming an actor by parents who believed that the profession was a euphemism for prostitution, trained Stanley from a very young age to entertain relatives and friends with versions of her favourite chanteuses, such as Marlene Dietrich and Gracie Fields. As her son had never seen nor heard the originals, she would do impersonations for him, from which he would create his own version. In retrospect, this was another key stage in the development of his exceptional ability to re-create cinematic scenes.View image in fullscreen‘A precision mimic’ … sending up Liberace on his ITV show.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockHe was a well-read man, his London flat filled with well-used books, and a notable feature of his shows was that they trusted the mass audience to enjoy collisions of high and low culture. Wouldn’t it be funny if the classical actor Sir John Gielgud presented the light entertainment show The Generation Game? Another speciality was to mash two franchises, so that a Michael Crawford sitcom and a sub-aquatic nature show became Jacques Cousteau Presents Some Mammals Do Ave ’Em. There were also extended spoofs of Dallas and Upstairs, Downstairs, and a spoof of the Queen’s Christmas message, with Baxter in regal drag, which prompted outrage in parliament and middle-market papers.Born in 1926, Baxter came to showbiz partly through a narrow route specific to men of his age, serving in the Ensa (Entertainments National Service Association), which was set up in 1939 to provide entertainment for soldiers, sailors and airmen serving overseas, provided by colleagues with theatrical or musical ambitions. Its early recruits included three people who became significant in television: the comic magician Tommy Cooper and the writers Jimmy Perry and David Croft, whose greasepaint war service informed one of their sitcoms, It Ain’t Half Hot Mum (1974-81).A teenager in his native Glasgow during the second world war, Baxter joined the troops’ troupe during national service in postwar, pre-independence Burma and Singapore.Ensa’s acronym was mocked as Every Night Something Awful, but Baxter’s pack included others with a significant showbiz future: comedian Kenneth Williams, film director John Schlesinger and playwright Peter Nichols, who comically fictionalised their experiences in the play and film Privates on Parade. Two frequent styles for the uniformed performers, parody and cross-dressing, became Baxter’s signature strengths.However, while other broadcasting stars of his era had their first professional exposure in music hall theatre (including Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise, Ken Dodd, Clive Dunn, Bruce Forsyth, Max Bygraves), Baxter is relatively unusual in having been discovered when young by broadcasting, then in its own infancy. His mother having achieved her ambition of turning him into a child prodigy, he came, in the 1930s, to the attention of Children’s Hour, an early BBC radio series, the Scottish edition of which was presented by “Auntie Kathleen”.View image in fullscreenStanley in pantomime mode.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlaIn the early 1960s, Baxter appeared in a run of British movie comedies – Crooks Anonymous, The Fast Lady, and Father Came Too! – and briefly seemed destined to become a disguise-master movie actor, in the manner of Peter Sellers. However, cinematically, Baxter’s greater talent was for caricature, rather than whole-cloth creation, and he found his happiest outlet as the comedian who brought the big screen to the small screen at one remove.The titles of early specials, such as The Stanley Baxter Big Picture Show and The Stanley Baxter Moving Picture Show, acknowledged his cinematic inspiration though their use of “picture”, as cinema was called in his era. His most ambitious sketches included shot-by-shot re-creations of scenes from movies such as Gone With the Wind and Casablanca, with the twist that all the personnel were Baxter impersonations.It helped that the weekend schedules in which his breakthrough work appeared featured movies in peak time, in a way that would later be restricted to major religious or bank holidays. The first edition of The Stanley Baxter Picture Show (a series of 30-minute episodes), when it played on LWT at 9.30pm in 1972, immediately followed a Sunday night screening of the 1941 western Belle Starr, starring Randolph Scott. So, while many of the sketches drew on a cinematic literacy that Baxter had possessed since childhood, he could also assume that viewers would get the references.While classic movies were his initial fuel, parodies of TV drove the later shows, a shift recognised in the double-meaning titles of Stanley Baxter on Television, and Christmas Box.View image in fullscreenBaxter was awarded an outstanding contribution award at the 2020 Scottish Baftas.Photograph: Ian Skelly/Bafta Scotland/PABaxter was an intellectually inquisitive, well-read man, who spent his final years quietly and alone, described in profiles as a “widower” after the death, in 1997, of his wife, Moira. However, in November 2020, aged 94, he agreed to the publication ofThe Real Stanley Baxter, a biography by Brian Beacom that he had previously stipulated should only appear posthumously. The book disclosed that Baxter, who had always known he was homosexual, had wed Moira, against his instincts, following societal and showbiz fashion. The marriage had been a disaster, and the couple had lived separate lives, including, for Stanley, many gay relationships.This publication, from such a private man, felt like a brave final accounting, and had the effect of focusing attention – in his final years – on his work, rather than delayed private revelations.The people who never found Baxter’s TV shows funny were the accountants at LWT and the BBC, who, at both networks, ultimately declared the productions unjustifiable. Retired by TV, he returned – after a period of exile – to radio, which thus came to frame his career in a way Baxter found artistically satisfying but financially dismaying, joking that “Radio is all work and no pay.”First commissioned to mark his attaining octogenarian status, The Stanley Baxter Playhouse developed into a regular series, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 from 2006 to 2016, in which Baxter and another actor (including Richard Briers and Geoffrey Palmer) performed two-hander dramas. It was a perfect final platform for a performer so vocally adept.Although greatly admired by younger TV stars who had grown up watching him – such as the impressionist Rory Bremner – Stanley Baxter had, unlike most great performers, no later imitators. This was partly because no network could have found the budgets, but also because there has been nobody since with such impressive ears and legs. Each of his best shows was genuinely a special.Explore more on these topicsCultureTelevisionTV comedyShareReuse this content"

The star talks feeling inferior to Meera Syal, his life in the US and why he’s thrilled to be typecastZoe WilliamsFri 12 Dec 2025 06.00 CETShareWhile we embark on the inhumanly long wait for the new season ofLine of Duty, whichstarts shootingin January, you’ll seeMartin Compston– the show’s hero and true north – a number of times. Twice as you’ve never seen him before, and once, in Red Eye, in the form that you’ve come to know and love him: brisk and taciturn, brave and speedy, the man you’d trust to save the world while the dopes all around him can’t even see it needs saving.But first, The Revenge Club, in which he is a revelation. The setting is a support group for divorcees, a ragtag gang united by nothing but the fact that they’ve been summarily dismissed by their spouses. “There’s no other reason for these characters to be in each other’s lives,” Compston says from his home in Las Vegas (more on that later – much more). “They’re all desperate and lonely and in dire need of companionship. They’re all, in their own ways, broken, which makes for this explosive mix.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m very comfortable in my own skin and career’ … Compston.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty ImagesIf that sounds miserable, it is anything but – even the scenes in a beat-up community centre are heightened, exotic and alive with possibility. The acts of revenge, undertaken by the whole group against one ex at a time, start off pretty mild: rats down the chimney, remote messing with a Spotify playlist, that order of magnitude. When they get into spiking a drink, though, things turn darker and I think it’s fair to say, life-threateningly so. At first it reminds me of Netflix’s Russian Doll, largely due to the chaotic charisma of Aimee-Ffion Edwards, the heroine-divorcee to Compston’s hero; as it goes on, though, it ceases to resemble anything else. “It sits in its own space,” he says. “It goes from intense, emotional scenes into a sort of Ocean’s Eleven caper. You think you’re going down this path, then you’re not. But as long as a cast commits to that, the audience will go along with it.”This is something he learned from Ken Loach and has stayed with him his whole career, Compston says. “If you’ve got an excitement about what you’re doing and enthusiasm for what you’re doing, the audience will come with you.” This is a casual but lurching pull back to 2002, his first role, when he was discovered as a teenager in Greenock, to play a teenager in Greenock, for Loach’sSweet Sixteen. Looking at the stills from that movie, it’s hard to believe he was once that kid; he looks so unactorly, almost embodies the spirit of authentic, uncinematic adolescence.But back to the point. There are two surprising things about casting Compston in The Revenge Club. The first is that he’s playing for laughs, which he’s only done once before (in Sky’s Urban Myths – a magic-realist retelling of Band Aid, in which Compston was Midge Ure). This time round, the witty dialogue is the engine of the drama, and every actor is pin sharp, comically speaking. “It was outside my comfort zone,” says Compston. “One terrifying moment I had was such a tiny little scene with Meera Syal; we were improvising little bits, and I remember sitting there thinking: ‘She’s comedy royalty. What if she thinks I’m shit?’” He point blank refuses to put himself in Syal’s class: “The way Meera and Sharon [Rooney, who also stars – perhaps most memorable for her role as Lawyer Barbie in Greta Gerwig’s movie] can turn it on, I don’t have that in me, it’s an artform. But I can play the angry Scotsman and be quite funny.”View image in fullscreen‘It became a monkey on my back’ … Martin Compston with Gary McCormack in Ken Loach’s Sweet Sixteen.Photograph: Bbc/AllstarCompston is also the romantic lead in The Revenge Club, which is a major fork in the road – his fictional love life, definitely as a cop, always has disaster written all over it. He and Edwards have a delightful screwball energy, spiky and passionate, and there’s a maturity to the storytelling in so far as they’re both – you suspect – a bit of a nightmare, but you’re rooting for it to happen anyway. Although that, he says, is just because I haven’t seen how it ends. “That’s one of the things I love about the show: we’re not just good guys who have been wronged. Our exes might just be people who’ve moved on with their lives. We’ve all gone down this rabbit hole because we had nothing to cling on to, and all of a sudden we have this group, we’ve taken it too far and we don’t know how to stop.”Perhaps even more unexpected is the real-life Compston in the upcoming Living Las Vegas, a delightfully old-school travelogue about his life in the US. He married American actor Tianna Chanel Flynn “nearly 10 years ago and we still haven’t had a honeymoon”, and they split their time between Greenock and Las Vegas, prompting him to make this three-parter for Channel 4. He partly explains it, in the show, by the fact that he doesn’t know that many people in Vegas. So he bods about, making friends with the lady who runs the vintage shop and some people who teach him how to ride a horse. It’s incredibly cute – Chanel Flynn is adorable, and adoring, in the background – and quite strange, at this juncture, to not only describe the US by its epic landscapes and casinos, but to spend a morning with a drag queen, Lawrence (also from Greenock), without mentioning the political ambience, in which drag is a faultline and the house always wins.View image in fullscreen‘It’s brilliant fun’ … Martin Compston in Red Eye, alongside Jing Lusi.Photograph: Laurence Cendrowicz/Bad Wolf/Sony Pictures Television“A lot of people live their lives on social media,” he says, diplomatically. “I’m not unaware of the problems out there, but we live on a lovely street, we’ve got nice neighbours, politics aside; we’re all just getting on with our lives. My wife and her family are Democrats, that would be my leaning, but I’m just a guest here. It’s become such an angry space right now that I try to keep quiet. But I still believe the same things, and [when] the time comes, I’ll still vote the same way.”Hours before we speak, the BBC announced the return of Line of Duty, for its seventh series. Seventeen million people watched the finale of season six, in 2021, making Jed Mercurio’s the most-watched drama since records began at the start of the century. “That 9 o’clock slot, whether it be on a Sunday night or over the holidays, it’s gold dust,” he says. “You feel like you’ve got the country in the palm of your hand if you’ve got something good to show them, and there’s no feeling like it.” Compston thinks Britain has fallen forAdrian Dunbar, or Supt Ted Hastings to give him his proper name: “He’s become like the nation’s uncle. A guy who wants to do right. People want to root for the good guys, and know there are good guys out there, especially in times like these.”Between that and the endless fanfic speculation on social media, its popularity is so intense I’d forgotten that the first three seasons landed quite quietly. “It wasn’t until series five that things really blew up,” he remembers. “When Sweet Sixteen came out, I was 17. It did really well, but it became a monkey on my back because everyone thought: ‘That’s who you are.’ Now if I’m typecast, if they say ‘Line of Duty is the best thing you’ll ever do’, I’m happy. I’m very comfortable in my own skin and career.”View image in fullscreen‘People want to root for the good guys’ … Compston with Adrian Dunbar and Vicky McClure in Line of Duty.Photograph: BBC/World Productions/Steffan HillThe second season ofRed Eye, in which he plays the head of security at the American embassy in London in the grip of a terrorist attack, draws on many of the qualities he conjured as DI Arnott: a charismatic certitude, a seriousness of purpose, a lot of rushing around meaning business. He would have worked on anything from director Kieron Hawkes, who’s one of his best friends – they’re also working up a film together, which has just got funding. It’s just happy coincidence that Red Eye involves so much “running about, talking into your wrist, hand on the ear like you’ve got an earpiece, that’s just cops and robbers grown up. I love all that. I live for all that. Getting to play this kick-ass, ex-SAS agent, it’s brilliant fun.”Compston is starting to think about producing, because otherwise, when he’s not working he can’t relax: “You get that working-class guilt, you need to do something.” He’s started to love it, though, and the different bits of brain it requires. “You’re suddenly thinking, should we be filming this on a train or a ferry? What’s cheaper? When you’re reading a script as an actor, all you’re thinking is: ‘Why is the character doing that?’ You’re not thinking: ‘That’s going to cost us two days’.”He describes one project, a biopic of “Allan Pinkerton, a Scottish guy on the run who landed in America and became the most powerful law man in the US. He started the secret service, worked on the Underground Railroad, invented the first rogues gallery with mug shots, chased down Butch Cassidy, Jesse James – had an incredible life. This little guy from the Gorbals.” Just when you thought there was nothing more quintessentially Compston than DI Arnott, a period drama idea appears that does, you must admit, sound extremely him.The Revenge Club is out now on Paramount+; Red Eye is on ITV1 on New Year’s Day at 9pm.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionLine of DutyDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I devoured the first 12 in the franchise.My favourite book growing upLike everybody else growing up in the 1970s, I had a copy ofWatership Downby Richard Adams on my bedroom shelves – it was the law. I did love it, though. Whatever fondness I have for the English countryside probably comes from that book. I remember my grandfather – a real country dweller – seeing me reading it and being outraged. “A book about rabbits?” he shouted. “They’re vermin!”The book that changed me as a teenagerMonty Python’s Flying Circus had given me a taste for comedy that deconstructed the conventions of television itself. It hadn’t occurred to me that a novel could be self-parodic in the same way until I chanced upon a copy of Flann O’Brien’sAt Swim-Two-Birdsin the school library. Multiple narratives nested inside each other? A group of aggrieved characters taking revenge on their own narrator? I was hooked.The writer who changed my mindWhen I arrived at Cambridge at the age of 19, just over a year after Margaret Thatcher had become PM, I may not have been a Thatcherite but I was still definitely a Tory. Conversations with new friends helped to change that, but so did the passion and lucidity of Tony Benn’s Arguments for Socialism.The book that made me want to be a writerI don’t know what made me want to be a writer, exactly (I started at the age of eight), but I don’t believe it was a book. Years later, one of the novels that showed me the kind of writer I might aspire to be was Joseph Heller’sSomething Happened, with its combination of mordant wisecracking and overwhelming melancholy.The author I came back toAs a student I discovered Pilgrimage by Dorothy Richardson in the four-volume Virago edition and decided she was the British feminist Proust and it was my duty to read her. Boy, it was heavy going. Years later, I realised she doesn’t have to be read in full or in sequence: it can make more sense to take random dips and scoops which mirror the narrator’s own floating, unanchored consciousness.The book I rereadI’ve lost much of my teenage enthusiasm for Hermann Hesse, but I still occasionally return to his first novel,Peter Camenzind. It’s a lyrical Bildungsroman that combines simplicity (and brevity) with profound moral and intellectual depths, and its evocation of Swiss, German and Italian landscapes is matchless.The book I could never read againIn my youthful quest for great comic fiction I remember reading and enjoying Kingsley Amis’sLucky Jim. Returning to it in middle age I found the comedy laboured and its hero’s attitudes – once considered a breath of fresh air – felt simply peevish and entitled.The book I discovered later in lifeAs a film snob in the 1980s, I looked down on the Merchant Ivory EM Forster adaptations. I now consider them perfect films. And a recent re-viewing ofHowards Endled me to the novel that turns out – who knew? – to be a masterpiece.The book I amcurrentlyreadingBorrowed Landby Kapka Kassabova (to be published in April). No other writer’s political acuity matches her responsiveness to the natural world, whose despair at the human propensity for greed and corruption is matched by her insistence on the moral necessity for hope. “Nature writing” doesn’t do justice to her range.The Proof of My Innocence by Jonathan Coe review – ingenious cosy crime spoofRead moreMy comfort readI do believe in the concept of comfort reading. Books can and should challenge us, but they don’t all have to do that. In anxious and depressing times, we all need a steaming bath of familiar certainties. For me, it comes in the form of Arthur Conan Doyle’sSherlock Holmescanon: warm celebrations of male friendship which also happen to be (sometimes perfunctory) detective stories.The Proof of My Innocence by Jonathan Coeis published byPenguinin paperback(£9.99).To support the Guardian, buy a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

I was with her, a radio producer trying to capture the sounds of paper creasing as Orlean attempted to keep pace with the “Da Vinci of origami”, wincing when her goldfish’s fins didn’t exactly flutter in hydrodynamic splendour.It was Orlean in her element: an adventurous student, inquisitive and exacting, fully alive to the mischief inherent to reporting – and primed to extract some higher truth. “When we first met you said something to me I’ve never forgotten,” Orlean told Lang. “That paper has a memory – that once you fold it, you can never entirely remove the fold.” Was that, she wondered, an insight about life, too?Over the course of four decades, seven books and countless exquisite magazine features, Orlean has profiled celebrities and nobodies, followed cults and choirs, turned her eye to supermarkets and surfers. “Writers fall into two categories: there are those who have something they want to say to the world, and there are those who believe the world has something to tell them,” she observes. Orlean falls squarely into the second camp. There are two kinds of story she likes best: “hiding in plain sight” and “who knew?”.A memoir is usually neither of these sorts of stories, but Orlean rises to the challenge of writing about her own life with grace. Joyridefollows another thread she has repeatedly returned to in her work: the nature of obsession. At the Willamette Week in Portland, where she got her start, the editor preached that “no matter how small or narrow its focus, every story was meaningful”. Orlean married a likeminded Weekstaffer and got her big break covering the Rajneesh cult for the Village Voice.The subjects of her pieces from this time – for the Voice, the Boston Globe, Rolling Stone, Vogue and the New Yorker – are a cultural time capsule. There’s a history of Lycra, profiles of Bon Jovi and the artist Christo, an investigation into the folding practices at Benetton. Assignments are elastic, and so are budgets. While negotiating the terms of a New Yorker feature about a Bronx cab driver who had found himself elected the king of the Ashanti people in the United States, she is merely told, “Sphinx-like” by editor Chip McGrath, that her expense budget will be enough to cover travel to Ghana if “necessary”. Her final payment? “It will be sufficient.” “I don’t need to tell you that magazines don’t work that way any more,” she writes.Joyride represents the liner notes to a career of hits. There’s the deliciously “heady, fun, surreal” experience of watching Spike Jonze’s movie Adaptation, based on her book The Orchid Thief, come to life – including being played by Meryl Streep. (Orlean’s account of flipping open Charlie Kaufman’s script for the first time to discover herself in it is laugh-out-loud funny.) A memorable Twitter thread from 2020 – the result of too much rosé on an empty stomach – that made her the “patron saint of pandemic drinking”, gets its moment, too. And harder episodes: a divorce, a cancer diagnosis, the sorrow of moving her mother into a nursing home.Orlean sees the writing life as one of constant highwire creative reinvention – “you never build equity”,  is how she puts it. Her father, who wanted to be writer but became a businessman instead, might have agreed: after she published The Orchid Thiefhe suggested she consider finally enrolling in law school. Thank goodness she didn’t. “I felt called, I really did, to describe ordinary life in a way that revealed its complexity and poetry – to show how rewarding it is to be open to and curious about the world, and how much joy can be found in letting yourself be surprised.”Joyride: A Memoir by Susan Orlean is published by Atlantic (£20).

Jordan Fein’s production shimmers and shines with all the humour and pathos of these errant fairytale characters who misadventure into the woods, winding their rearranged stories around each other.The show begins with swift efficiency, racing through some of the early songs, but it gathers feeling and there is picaresque fun. A witch’s curse inflicted on the Baker (Jamie Parker) and his wife (Katie Brayben) for the sins of his father can only be broken if they bring her Cinderella’s shoe, Rapunzel’s golden hair, Red Ridinghood’s coat and the milky white cow so dear to Jack (of the beanstalk).View image in fullscreenGetting messy … Jamie Parker (Baker) and Katie Brayben (Baker’s Wife).Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianPartly informed by Carl Jung’s concept of the collective unconscious, things get messy after the “happily ever after” of act one and this production brings just the right balance of levity and emotional darkness as regret, blame and betrayal kick in. The witch is a textbook case of Jung’s “devouring mother” who stalls Rapunzel’s growth by locking her away. The two princes’ marriages become stale and parenthood is difficult for the baker. Other parents perish and children must go on without them, such as Red Ridinghood (Gracie McGonigal) and Jack (Jo Foster).The cast bring bags of charm: Jack is ultra-feminine, Red Ridinghood appears like a fearless girl guide, the Wolf (Oliver Savile) a vulpine version of David Niven, it seems, and the Witch (Kate Fleetwood) is both comically evil and wronged. The Baker and his wife’s struggles to conceive come weighted with feeling. After she marries the prince, you feel the yearning of Cinderella (Chumisa Dornford-May) for the old days when she could simply take off to the woods and talk to the birds.View image in fullscreenPhenomenal … Kate Fleetwood (Witch).Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe actors are on blazing musical form too, hitting every difficult or dissonant note, and each performer finds a moment to excel. There is the operatic melodrama of the two posturing princes (Savile and Rhys Whitfield) in Agony, the pained drama of Children Will Listen and the wit of Your Fault. Fleetwood is phenomenal both in and out of song (including Witch’s Lament).Snappily ever after: Sondheim’s fairytale musical Into the Woods – in picturesRead moreThe alluring darkness to this dysfunctional family drama (with fairytale bells on) is literal in the exquisitely conceived set design byTom Scutt. The pitch black backdrop is a dramatic canvas. It cracks open to a woodland with birdsong and shafts of light to become a living picture-book of arboreal splendour but with all of the Grimms’ gothicism.Scutt’s elegant costumes are largely medieval-era. Characters look real and rustic and it endows them with a grownup humanity, deflecting from any potential pantomime feel. The Giant and his wife are not seen but heard (voiced by Valda Aviks) and felt through an earthquake of sound and light.Alternative, non-nuclear family formations bring their own, hard-forged happiness at the end. This production has none of the broadness or festive spirit of a Christmas show or panto, but the wonder and magic of both.AtBridge theatre, London, until 30 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsStephen SondheimBridge theatreFairytalesTom ScuttreviewsShareReuse this content"

But his music is quite different: a slippery layer cake of samples, multitudinous keys and lo-fi pop production, with Brown singing of a world where “the ebb and flow isn’t ebbing right”, be it in love or civic life. There is still room for an instant-classic R&B ballad though, in Tossed Away.Ben Beaumont-Thomas49Rochelle Jordan – Through the WallEverything isjust soon the British Canadian producer’s sixth album: expensively plush deep house suggesting club lights low, gleaming mirrors, potent looks igniting across the dancefloor. As much as the cold beat and ballroom flow of Ladida or the slapping “body, body, body” incantations of On 2 Something suggest a steadfast commitment to abandon, Jordan maintains impeccable poise and control throughout, whether in diva mode on Words 2 Say, breaking hearts on Bite the Bait, standing up for her needs on Doing It Too (“I’m not too much / You just give too little”) or patiently waiting for a frustrated lover to see the light on Ladida. Commanding, wise and committed to atmospheric excellence, party hosts don’t come better.Laura Snapes48Jerskin Fendrix– Once Upon a Time … in ShropshireView image in fullscreenHarebrained prog cabaret … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttJerskin Fendrix’s high-profile scores for the last three Yorgos Lanthimos films can’t really help prime you for the Midlands composer’s eccentrically beautiful second album, which pairs pristine musical theatre with the harebrained prog cabaret of Faith No More and (particularly) the under-sung Morphine. At first, Once Upon a Time … casts the rural bliss of growing up in 00s Shropshire in a golden light, a haven of getting ratted on Baileys and listening to Kanye on a farm, then having a lovely hungover group breakfast in someone’s kitchen. But the unexpected deaths he has experienced in recent years intrude to spoil paradise, eliciting feverish, absurdist expressions of grief – Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle is a bravura wig-out – and fathomless devastation from his camp, craggy voice. It demands a full theatrical production.LS47Clipping– Dead Channel SkyClipping frontman Daveed Diggs is best known for being in the original cast of Hamilton, and for all that this album is filled with noisy industrial rap, you can easily imagine it being successfully adapted for the Broadway stage. Dead Channel Sky is set in a cyberpunk dystopia not dissimilar to the scorched-sun “real world” of the Matrix, humming with janky tech and populated with fascists and freaky hedonists. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes render it in acid squiggles and revving breakbeats, while Diggs delivers his mutoid poetry like a prophet jacked up on some amphetamine he’s synthesised in a backstreet lab.BBTTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more46The Tubs – Cotton CrownIn different hands,the Tubs’ second album might be a crushing listen, and understandably so. In 2014, frontman Owen Williams’ mother, the songwriter and author Charlotte Greig,died by suicide. Grief, as these songs detail, made him a rubbish boyfriend. But Cotton Crown is often funny and ardent, and especially self-aware about how new love might feel like a life raft to a depressed mind ill-equipped to reciprocate: “Know it’s all in my brain / Caught in the middle of loving you and being insane,” Williams sings on Fair Enough. His striking voice, somewhere between Richard Thompson and Bob Mould, bolts through the band’s joyful jangle-pop. Clear students of the form, they’re virtuosos with zero patience for perfection, their riffs hurtling and plundering like seagulls going at a spilled catch as they vigorously rough you up with profundity.LS45Smerz – Big City LifeView image in fullscreenAn album of stilted beauty … Smerz.Photograph: Alva Le FebvreCatharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt feel like the pop girlies of the incredibly prolific and off-kilterCopenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory scene, making music that’s more outward-facing and arch than some of their insular and traditional (and equally great) classmates. Their second album lurches between throwing yourself at life – “you’re a girl in the city and you shouldn’t think twice”, they chant in deadpan harmony on Roll the Dice – and actually thinking twice quite a lot in existential spirals about purpose and desire. The dissonance between confidence and anxiety comes through in the album’s stilted beauty: one minute, their whorls of prepared piano carry you along like clouds amid perfectly turned pop-R&B and balladry; then they stab and stutter, like cracks in the pavement destined to trap your heels. In 2023, K-pop’s brightest hopes NewJeans hired them as co-writers: more pop bearing their imprint can only be a good thing.LS44Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendReleased almost exactly a year after her superstar-minting breakthrough Short n’ Sweet, and using a palette of soft rock, 80s pop, light disco and yearning country melodies, Carpenter added rich colour to one of pop’s most distinctive self-portraits. Her blatant sexuality is offset by an ironising sense of camp and a deep streak of cynicism, as she wonders whether to wrap her little finger round a series of hot but useless men. But whether dialling her exes while hopped up on “go-go juice” or being toxic for the sport of it (“you think that I’m gonna fuck with your head / well, you’re absolutely right”), Carpenter knows she’s part of the problem. Her fake helplessness at her own worst impulses is just one part of a formidable screwball comedy arsenal – she’s a Rosalind Russell for the dating app era.BBT43Jennifer Walton – DaughtersView image in fullscreenBolt from the blue … Jennifer Walton.Photograph: Liam CosfordThis Sunderland producer’s previous work included one EP of power electronics, one of antic club tracks, collabs with Aya and 96 Back as Microplastics, gigging with Kero Kero Bonito and a smattering of other credits. So her staggering, fully formed songwriterly debut was a total bolt from the blue. A swarming orchestral epic with shades of Julia Holter and Phil Elverum, it addressed her grief for her late father in serenely surrealist images – hitting a deer with a car in the middle of the night – and the painfully mundane realism of sitting in hospital corridors together. The standout Miss America combined both to stunning effect, a numbed incantation of everything Walton had seen on the US trip where she learned of her father’s diagnosis, the familiar now remade horribly mythic.LS42Erika de Casier– LifetimeErika de Casier’s fourth album updates the Y2K R&B template that fought for body-to-body sensuality in the face of rising digital creep. The old-school dial tones that pierce Lifetime’s rapt, liquid atmosphere work both as Janet homage and ironic sigh at how good those forebears had it when emotional warfare could only be conducted via pager: “Took a screenshot so / I could look at your pretty face all the time now / Without a sign that I’m online,” de Casier sings on earworm Delusional, a low-slung anthem for contemporary dating anxiety. “Hit midnight / Not even a text to hold me warm,” she rues on The Chase. That’s one of the most inviting things about Lifetime: its seductively cool surfaces conceal de Casier frantically kicking her feet below the surface, just like the rest of us.LS41Danny Brown – StardustThe Detroit rapper’s first post-rehab record totally disprovedhis fearsthat sobriety makes artists boring. On Stardust, Brown is still hard-wired with cartoonish verve, coupled with a genuinely touching sense of gratitude: “Sleeping real good at night ’cos I’m proud of myself,” he raps on Book of Daniel. While you probably wouldn’t describe someone who ponders “going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” as a wise elder, his hunger for life, opportunity and unmediated sensation blares through in how evidently gagged he is to centre younger producers from the digicore and hyperpop undergrounds: his unruly kids 8485, Jane Remover, Underscores, Frost Children and more make Stardust trip with glitch, rave, squealing riffs and overdriven noise. The rare record that makes you want to riot and shed a smiling single tear emoji.LS40-3140YHWH Nailgun – 45 PoundsView image in fullscreenChews you up … YHWH Nailgun.Photograph: Steve GullickIn 21 minutes, the New York band’s debut chews you up and spits you out the other side in a tentacular whirr of rototoms, guitars that shriek and whine like neglected machinery, erratic tempos and frontman Zack Borzone’s choked-out vocals. The way the record lurches and reels brings to mind the classic horror film scene in which a human undergoes a violent, magnificent transformation into some sort of beast: much like Gilla Band’s Most Normal, 45 Pounds is a font of mutant rock pleasures.LS39Sudan Archives – The BPMThe title refers to the beats per minute of dance music, but for an album that is so totally alive, it surely also refers to a pounding heart. Sudan Archives (AKA Angeleno producer-singer-songwriter-violinist Brittney Parks) announces that “life’s a game and I got VR goggles” as she revels in the epicurean joys of sex, dancing, travel and music itself with an almost superhuman appetite: “The rest are cowards / They choose to eat and we devour.” It’s all done with breezy good humour but there’s something inspiring, even quietly political about this mindful rejection of the straight life. Her backings – full of pop-R&B and ethereal electro – also dart away from obvious mainstream paths.BBT38Ethel Cain – Willoughby Tucker, I’ll Always Love YouView image in fullscreenRomantic slowcore … Ethel Cain.Photograph: Dollie KyarnIt’s easy to see why US singer-songwriter Cain has become so adored. This album further sketches out the kind of storytelling universe that attracts footnote-writing fandoms: it’s a prequel to the events of her debut album Preacher’s Daughter, deepening the tale of Ethel and a cast of young peers as they fumble towards connection and understanding. Her moody, romantic slowcore is also perfect music for listening to on headphones as you walk around boring suburban streets wishing you could leave for bigger things. It’s also great for road trips: songs between five and 15 minutes that seem to make a long, slow blur of the pell-mell world outside.BBT37Olivia Dean – The Art of LovingThe British breakthrough of the year, as Dean – already doing decent business with her pleasant but rather neat debut Messy – reached a completely new level of songcraft. Bossa nova, folk and soul (classic and neo) are warmed together with beautiful production, evaporating any sense of pastiche to make a sound that’s both easy on the ear but distinctly Dean’s. Every song has a superb top line, Dean stretching them into loose jazzy shapes (Let Alone the One You Love, Lady Lady) or tightening them into brisk pop (Man I Need, Something Inbetween). But it’s the lyrics that make these songs so red-blooded: every stage of love, from the first flutter of flirtation to the adrenal shock of rejection, is made so true to life.BBT36Anna von Hausswolff – IconoclastsView image in fullscreenSense of awe … Anna von Hausswolff.Photograph: Philip SvenssonAnna von Hausswolff is no stranger to a monumental statement: her primary instrument is the pipe organ,a towering edifice of tin and arsenicthat offers her an ever-renewing sense of awe. But the Swedish composer’s sixth album goes bigger than ever, grappling with mortality, transcendence and evil in a series of stormy epics that also lash a little pop structure to her prow. “Oh, I’m breaking up with language / Oh, in search of something bigger than this,” she screams on Stardust, an exhilarating co-pilot on the path to absolution.LS35Bon Iver – Sable, FableIf, as Justin Vernon recently suggested, this is the last ever Bon Iver album, it’s a beautiful redemption arc: a loving send-up of his anxious, myopic sad-sack self blossoms into a radiant appreciation of possibility, sensuality, risk. Everything Is Peaceful Love has one of the year’s best refrains: “Damn if I’m not climbing up a tree right now!”, giddy with thrill and absolutely no idea of what to do when you get up there other than enjoy the view. And while there are gorgeously passionate songs here, it’s the ones about gracefully letting go of an unviable love that really underscore the admirable humility in Vernon’s bowing out.LS34Snocaps – SnocapsKatie Crutchfield’s full-throated transformation into country doyenne on her last couple of albums as Waxahatchee almost makes it easy to forget her indie-rock origins. Fourteen years since she and twin sister Allison wound down their teen band PS Eliot, the DIY stalwarts got back together – with a little help from MJ Lenderman and producer Brad Cook – and went back to brass tacks for their surprise album as Snocaps. What a treat it was: full of punchy indignation – “I could never just …coast!” they exclaim on Coast – crunchy ruminations and sing-songy contemplations of what it means to depend on and grow alongside one another. You’d follow them anywhere.LS33Amaarae – Black StarView image in fullscreenIrrepressible … Amaarae.Photograph: Salomé Gomis-TreziseWe all need an Amaarae in our lives: the person who, when you weakly protest that you’re a bit tired to go out, will soon have you holding a bottle of decanted rum in the back of an Uber, while alongside you she looks quizzically at a series of resealable plastic bags. “Ketamine, coke and molly,” she chants on Starkilla; “I spiked this drink so please open your mouth,” she tells her lover on Fineshyt. And this club-ready album from the irrepressible Ghanaian-American pop star ends up being a sensual body high, as she chases sex and glamour into the ends of the night.BBT32Perfume Genius – GloryWith typical grace and humour Mike Hadreas sends up his self-defeating tendencies on his seventh album, and wonders how old you have to be to escape those lifelong patterns: like the contradiction of struggling to face the world while also fantasising about violence and romanticising “all the poems I’ll get out” of it. It feels apt that Glory starts with the western twang of It’s a Mirror, suggesting a fixed, brawny masculine archetype – then breaks it down over the course of the record, a gothic, celestial voyage into the interior, and the latest addition to a uniquely beautiful American songbook.LS31Horsegirl – Phonetics On and OnView image in fullscreenFinely tuned … Horsegirl.Photograph: Ruby FayeSpindly rock à la the Velvets and the Raincoats is as spartan in its constituent parts as it is high on reward, and Chicago trio Horsegirl demonstrated the inexhaustible pleasures of this 60-year-old form on their second album. With production from Cate Le Bon, they wove magic from just a few thrumming guitar and bass notes and Nora Cheng’s nonchalant, near-spoken vocals, as well as a knack for melodic hooks as finely turned as intricate woodwork: the bittersweet, skipping chorus of Information Content is an all-timer.LS30-2130Oklou – Choke EnoughTrance, medieval polyphony and Y2K pop may seem like odd bedfellows, but French singer-producer Oklou cast them all in a dawn-like haze on her gorgeous debut album, flowing these distinct disciplines together until they swooped and soared like a flock of starlings. Choke Enough was no academic exercise, either, with standout pop moments including Take Me By the Hand with Bladee – a winsome conjuring of how Alice Deejay might sound in collaboration with a piping minstrel.LS29Jacob Alon – In LimerenceView image in fullscreenRustling with life … Jacob Alon performing at the ZYN Rolling Stone UK Awards, in London’s Roundhouse.Photograph: Sue Moore/Hogan Media/ShutterstockOne of the star-making moments of the year was at the Mercury prize, as Scottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon reduced the arena audience to a hush with just a voice and an acoustic guitar (though there were delighted whoops when a call of “free Palestine” was folded into their rendition of Fairy in a Bottle). It hopefully brought a broader audience to their debut album In Limerence, which has shades of Adrianne Lenker, Jeff Buckley and even Paul McCartney’s cadences to its unguarded indie-folk. It would have been easy to make this music blandly beautiful, but Alon and producer Dan Carey keep it rustling with life, as they reach for a burbling synth, trumpet improvisation or dusty-sounding drum kit.BBT28KeiyaA – Hooke’s LawThe title of the Chicago producer’s second album references the law of physics that reflects how stretch is proportional to load, how a spring always bounces back when tested within its elastic limit. The whistlestop Hooke’s Law expands and contracts accordingly as KeiyaA’s trifles with loss and romantic disappointment find their embodiment in racing breakbeats and collagist chaos one minute, gorgeous, soul-weary stillness – as with the liquid Stupid Prizes – the next. Listening can feel like being pleasurably blitzed with sensation, with each repeat revealing new details: an invitation to submit to KeiyaA’s masterful grip.LS27Wet Leg – MoisturizerIn 2022 they released one of the 21st century’s biggest indie debuts, which scored a UK No 1 and Grammy and Brit awards. The pressure was there for the follow-up, but not only did it top the charts again and earn another couple of Grammy noms, it had even more swagger and heart. “You wanna fuck me, I know, most people do,” Rhian Teasdale shrugs on Mangetout, and she actively intimidates a lustful bloke on Catch These Fists – but much of the album is given over to her wonderment at falling in love. “I’ll be your Davina, I’m coming to get you … I’ll be your Shakira, whenever, wherever”, she sings: great new vows for millennial weddings.BBT26Wolf Alice – The ClearingView image in fullscreenSomething symphonic … Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice performing at Manchester Arena.Photograph: Andy Von Pip/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“English bands are so hesitant to ever admit ambition, but I am ambitious with this record,” Wolf Alice’s drummerJoel Amey saidas The Clearing was announced – and sure enough, this was a huge step up and out for a band who were already one of British indie’s biggest. There’s something symphonic about the heft of it and not just because of the string sections, thanks to superb production by Greg Kurstin: the bass and toms are heavy yet warm, the piano pounding yet not overbearing. Ellie Rowsell sings about suitably big themes, too, from universe-bending love on Leaning Against the Wall (“it really, really made the room sing, the way you said my name”), invaluable friendship on Just Two Girls, and The Sofa’s uplifting manifesto for being wild and indolent instead of toeing the line.BBT25Wednesday – BleedsThe North Carolina band’s sixth album is littered with endings, some violent – the title of Carolina Murder Suicide tells you all you need to know – some devastatingly mundane, as Karly Hartzman examined the cracks that led to a long relationship’s end. Her unique gaze unites both, noticing the details and dynamics that other songwriters might write off as inconsequential: like the “mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail” at a wake in Wound Up Here (By Holdin On). Full of screaming noise and riffs that evoke knee-sliding through the mud, as well as moments of unexpected sweetness, Bleeds shows the fullest picture of her band yet.LS24Titanic – HagenView image in fullscreenUncontainable euphoria … Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta of Titanic.Photograph: Janet ChauThere can be few faster-evolving ensembles than that of Mabe Fratti and Hector Tosta, who in just two albums have leapt from sparkling cabaret jazz to … whatever the uncontainable euphoria of Hagen is. It’s a record that vaults from blast beats to choral beauty, eerie splendour to nervy cacophonies, like nothing else you’ve heard. Despite these bold stylistic clashes, it hangs together beautifully, thanks also to Fratti’s spectacular voice, as capable of cirrus-like delicacy as parched sharpness.LS23Cate Le Bon – Michelangelo DyingWhere two of this year’s most prominent breakup albums were savage (Lily Allen) or spectacular (Rosalía), Welsh innovator Cate Le Bon’s hypnotically murky seventh album reflected the circular sadness of love faltering – the catch-22 of wanting to escape heartbreak while knowing that letting go means relinquishing something that was once profound. Michelangelo Dying contains some of her very best choruses and melodies, powerful enough to penetrate the album’s billowing haze of guitar, sax and synths, like a hand reaching out in the dark.LS22Little Simz – LotusView image in fullscreenWider reckoning … Little Simz performing at the Co-op Live arena in Manchester.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianSimz’s sixth album came amid a dispute with the Sault producer Inflo – she has sued him for allegedly failing to repay a loan – and a couple of tracks target him in all but name (“You talk about God when you have a God complex / I think you’re the one that needs saving”). But Simz seems to be having a wider reckoning: she revels in how far she’s come from once just having “a dream and a pushbike”, and reflects on self-preservation, creative frustration and – in a gorgeous, naturalistic back-and-forth with Wretch 32 – push-pull family dynamics.BBT21John Glacier – Like a RibbonFor all that you can link her to trip-hop and cloud rap, what British MC has ever really sounded like this? It would be easy to call Glacier monotone, but in truth her careful, even flow holds so much musicality: her deliberately limited melodic and rhythmic range means that the subtle distinctions in her vocals are fascinating, as she goes from bored to wry to boastful to poignant within one-degree turns on the emotional thermostat. The grainy, faintly corrupted beats are superb, but it’s that delivery, and her lyrics themselves – stoic and even amused as life blows her from place to place – which make this album an all-timer in UK rap.BBT20-1120Aya – Hexed!A series of surreal vignettes confronting addiction, panic and the challenges of growing up queer, Aya Sinclair’s experimental electronic masterwork is a wind-whipped dash around the towns and moors of Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. From the rotor blade-whomp of Peach to the infernal pattering snares on Navel Gazer, her sound design hits you like a ton of feathers: a surreal, destabilising flurry of detail. And the lyrics, done as careful mutters or sarky sing-song, are world-class. Her poetry revels in multiple meanings – is she saying “Flemish” or “phlegmish”? – and in the plasticity of language, rhyme and even lived experience, whether retelling a toxic relationship (“Couple rows so we could pop our cysts / as though the pus’d bust right out of the tryst”) or evoking the feeling of being totally cut adrift: “Abseil away another day supine inside the bag.”BBT19Clipse – Let God Sort Em OutView image in fullscreenRich with wisdom … Malice and Pusha T of Clipse.Photograph: Cian MooreThey may have been outdone by Oasis as 2025’s most anticipated fraternal comeback, but there was still considerable excitement around the return of Gene and Terrence Thornton, AKA Clipse’s Malice and Pusha T. After making two of the best albums in 00s rap, Malice found God and left Pusha to it. But on returning, Malice’s mic tone – which always had a sort of ancient, oaken majesty to it – felt rich with wisdom, while Pusha, who in the interim had beefed Drake to hugely entertaining effect, still had his nose for a scrap, this time with Travis Scott. Together, they advocated for their own brilliance and for what they see as a better class of rap, sometimes at the same time: “They content-create, I despise that / I create content then they tries that.”BBT18Big Thief – Double InfinityAfter their bassist Max Oleartchik left the group, Big Thief pressed on as a trio but brought in a number of auxiliary musicians, resulting in an album that sounds like it could have been worked up around the campfire of a utopian off-grid commune. These are some of the American band’s best, biggest-hearted songs to date, with the type of easy facility with melody – and equally easy access to their emotions – that can’t be taught. Take Grandmother, in which frontperson Adrianne Lenker surveys our collapsing world and flawed humanity, and decides on the singalong chorus: “Gonna turn it all into rock’n’roll.” In many other hands this would be trite, but as with so much of Big Thief’s music, the purity of intention makes it life-affirming.BBT17Alex G – HeadlightsView image in fullscreenA new frontier … Alex G.Photograph: Chris MaggioWhat constitutes integrity? Working for love or money? Freedom or obligation to others? On his first album for a major label, standing at a new frontier of success, Alex G weighs these existential questions in appropriately vast, beautiful indie-rock epics, some breathless with anxiety (Spinning), others sardonic (Real Thing) or severe (Headlights). Despite the very contemporary, very Alex G touches – take the sprite-like voices and distortion of Bounce Boy – there’s a comforting solidity to this record that makes it feel as though it’s existed for ever, sharing the same spooked twilight as the best of Yo La Tengo and REM.LS16Pulp – MoreThe anticipation of a reunion album rarely measures up to the often dismal results. Perhaps the key is to spend a solid chunk of years playing together again, as Pulp did, before risking putting anything down on record. “I exist to do this / Shouting and pointing,” Jarvis Cocker sang on comeback single Spike Island; anyone who’s seen Pulp in recent years can attest that he has lost none of his calligraphic physical flair. Nor, as the magnificent More proves, has his gimlet eye for the grubby disappointments of middle age diminished. Life apparently feels no less of a charade at 62 than early adulthood did back in the 90s, a fact he sells as both anticlimax and a weird kind of comfort: if that’s the case, the unvarnished love songs and heartfelt stands against commodification suggested, you might as well stick it all on the line.LS15Turnstile – Never EnoughView image in fullscreenUncomplicated thrills … Turnstile in concert in Guadalajara, Mexico.Photograph: Medios y Media/Getty ImagesIs it hardcore punk or not? As this dull debate brewed on comment sections and Discord servers, the rest of the world got on with the business of just enjoying the uncomplicated thrills on Turnstile’s latest. Certainly, Seein’ Stars sounds like 90s Duran Duran, the epic title track could be played as NFL teams run on to the field and even the hardcore-paced Dull and Solo have a sheen to them. But for every frowning punk purist, you had 10 more lining up to pile into the pit with smiles a mile wide.BBT14Deftones – Private MusicThis was the US alt-metallers’ first album back after serendipitously getting a huge new following via TikTok, particularly for their sweeter, shoegazier material. But rather than court that audience by cynically remaking Sextape 11 times over, they instead created a balletic cyborg of a record. The riffs could put a dent in concrete masonry, but the groove-metal rhythms are light-footed and, as ever, vocalist Chino Moreno sets out even wider tonal possibilities. It’s as if waves of pain and relief pass across his spirit as he goes from dry croaks to thunderous denouncements to blissful clean singing.BBT13Suede – AntidepressantsThree decades since their debut and five albums into the second phase of their career, Suede sound as impassioned and vital as they ever have. Brett Anderson’s voice is a long way from the nasal sneer of Animal Nitrate all those years ago: it’s now rounder and deeper in colour, reminiscent of Echo and the Bunnymen’s Ian McCulloch, but the core Suede theme – humanity in all its reckless and sexy brokenness – is still there. Playing post-punk with a Britpop grandeur, Anderson and co reckon with the fleeting nature of existence (“Formless as a cloud / Weightless as a sound”) and the caprices of brain chemistry, but with a sense of optimism, even triumph.BBT12Jim Legxacy – Black British Music (2025)View image in fullscreenMore assured … Jim Legxacy.Photograph: Igoris TarranHis previous mixtape Homeless N*gga Pop Music was at No 42 in our 2023 albums list; rapper-producer Jim Legxacy jumps up the rankings as his place in British rap becomes more and more assured. Beats-wise, he defines the joyous anything-goes energy of the current UK underground, expertly applying chipmunk effects to samples, adding funny DJ-style vocal tags (“turn that mediocre bullshit off, we’re listening to Jim Legxacy right now!”) and even making a left turn into high-tempo pop-rock for ’06 Wayne Rooney. There’s more of a mournful cast to the lyrics though, as he works through grief for his late sister, and confronts the lingering effects of his impoverished, fatherless childhood.BBT11Jade – That’s Showbiz Baby!Pop’s trickiest manoeuvre is crossing the divide from successful group to solo career. After departing Little Mix, Jade Thirlwall didn’t so much jump it as pirouette across: her multi-part debut solo single Angel of My Dreams was completely nuts, impossible to ignore and spent 20 weeks on the UK chart. Could a whole album match up? From trashy ballroom house (It Girl) to disco-funk (Fantasy, Headache), Robyn-esque sad bangers (Plastic Box, Self Saboteur) and waltz-time ballads (Natural at Disaster), she certainly has the range, not to mention smart and sweary lyrics – rhyming Edward Enninful with experimental is a neat encapsulation of what moves her. It’s her voice that really sets it all apart, though: as you’d expect of a talent show graduate turned longtime pop star, it remains stunning on a technical level, but Thirlwall also brings a whole West End musical’s worth of emotion.BBT10-610Billy Woods – Golliwog“The English language is violence, I hot-wired it / I got a hold of the master’s tools and got dialled in,” Billy Woods announces at the outset of a rap masterpiece that works both as stunning poetry on the page and thrilling music out of loudspeakers. With intensely vivid lyrics, he picks his way through psychic wreckage wrought by racism, poverty, war and more, menaced by horrible dreams (“Didn’t want the doctor to turn, I knew it’d be something awful on the ultrasound”) and dispensing jaded wisdom: “Amputation how you survive / Can’t get away if you don’t leave something behind.” And then there’s Misery, a vivid romcom about a polyamorous and possibly vampiric lover. Frantz Fanon, Cecil Rhodes, Miles Davis and “Black Thanos” are among the other figures populating these strange, heat-sick tracks, helmed by a diverse and stellar range of production talent including the Alchemist, DJ Haram and Kenny Segal.BBT9Geese – Getting KilledView image in fullscreenOutrageously accomplished … Geese.Photograph: Lewis EvansThe ways that love unravels us and knits us back together are explored on the outrageously accomplished and wise fourth album from the New York garage rock band, who are still in their early 20s. They originally formed as kids at a Brooklyn music school which partly explains the depth of their connection, but there’s something bigger at work: how to explain the way a tiny chord change can carry so much emotional weight, or how these songs can groove so tightly at the waist while their arms flail this way and that. Cameron Winter’s lyrics and vocals are peerless, too, done in a reedy head voice that’s also somehow soulful. He’s trying to live his life on a higher frequency than the rest of us, but so often he’s having his heart broken, “getting killed by a pretty good life”, or hemmed in by his circumstances: “I was a sailor, and now I’m a boat / I was a car, and now I’m the road,” he glumly pouts on Bow Down.BBT8Bad Bunny – Debí Tirar Más FotosWith the absolute integrity that has become his trademark, Bad Bunny shone his inestimable spotlight back on his roots in Puerto Rico for his sixth album, singing of sacrifice, colonial oppression and the importance of preserving tradition. He’s an incredible conduit, synthesising the past – salsa, bolero, perreo – with the present, bringing local artists including RaiNao and Lorén Aldarondo along for the ride. As if it needed stressing, Debí … also underscored his own legacy, and his incredible range: heartbroken that life must one day end on Baile Inolvidable; lovelorn in the rave on Perfumito Nuevo; seemingly cast in moonlight on the heavy Bokete.LS7Lily Allen – West End GirlLily Allen’s divorce album is so lurid in its apparent disclosures (she has said she employed some poetic licence) that it felt as though there was a risk of the carcass being tossed aside once the tabloids had picked it clean for gossip. But the quality of the songwriting and silvery electronic production, as well as the tangibility of Allen’s hurt and her ability to mint viral bits in “who the fuck is Madeleine” and Nonmonogamummy, gave West End Girl not just staying power but a place in the pantheon of great breakup albums. Standout Pussy Palace turned the grottiest of reveals into a kind of cosmic reverie that seems to suggest the elemental rearrangement of life as she knew it; the guttingly powerful Relapse, about the sober musician’s fear of losing her grip after her relationship breakdown, highlighted the temptation of oblivion in numbed-out vocoder. It lands light as icing sugar but lingers deadly as toothache.LS6PinkPantheress – Fancy ThatView image in fullscreenBreathless … PinkPantheress.Photograph: Charlie EngmanTrue to her form for writing the shortest songs in the biz, in just 20 minutes and 34 seconds, PinkPantheress vaults from weed highs to romantic lows, obsessive crushes to gripping paranoia, seduction to confrontation. (“The status cheque is due / So do I still belong to you?” from Nice to Know You, is a classic bluff call.) The music of Fancy That is just as much of a slip’n’slide through British club culture at its most playful and dazzling, from jungle to UKG and the big-tent joys of Underworld, Basement Jaxx and even the hyper-cheesy Just Jack, samples she deploys expertly, and all threaded together by her pointedly sugary voice. It’s a breathless ride, and PinkPantheress’s best case yet for her micro melodramas: why dither when you can pack this much into so little?LSNo 5 coming soonCome back tomorrow for the next 10 albums in the countdown!

But success has stalled as acts face industry obstacles and rising homophobia. What now?Jeffrey IngoldFri 12 Dec 2025 07.00 CETShareAt the turn of the decade, gay male and non-binary pop stars seemed poised totake pop music by storm. Lil Nas X broke out with Old Town Road – which blew up on TikTok, sold about 18.5m copies and remains tied with Shaboozey’s A Bar Song (Tipsy) and Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas Is You as the longest-running No 1 single in US history – and artists such as Sam Smith, Troye Sivan and Olly Alexander from Years & Years were all singing about gay love and sex.But the initial promise has stalled. Lil Nas X’s attempts to build on his smash debut album have fizzled, and he is publicly dealing with mental health issues. In October, Khalid released his first album since being outed by his ex last year but only sold 10,000 copies in the first week in the US. A previous album, 2019’s Free Spirit, sold some 200,000 copies in the first week and led to him briefly dethroning Ariana Grande as the most listened to artist on Spotify.After chart-topping fame with Years & Years, Alexander’s debut solo album, this year’s Polari, could only peak at No 17 in the UK, with no charting singles apart from Dizzy, the UK’s 2024 Eurovision entry, which reached No 42. He tells me that being out in the “major label machine … felt like I was trying to pull off an impossible magic trick”. When it comes to selling gay music to the public, he says, “men explicitly loving men is so threatening to the status quo and patriarchy, which makes it harder to gain mainstream support”. Only Sivan has stayed culturally relevant, if not commercially dominant, thanks in part to savvy collaborations with two of pop’s biggest female stars, Charli xcx and Ariana Grande. How did gay male artists lose their place in the pop landscape?View image in fullscreenOlly Alexander.Photograph: Polydor Records/PAOne surprising reason might be that “there aren’t many male pop stars full stop”, explains Michael Cragg, a music critic and author of the Y2K pop oral historyReach for the Stars. At least, he says, not in the Madonna tradition of bombastic spectacle. “A lot of male artists got swept up in the beige world of Ed Sheeran and Lewis Capaldi,” says Cragg, where today “you can sell millions of albums” with a ballad-heavy repertoire. Cragg cites Calum Scott, best known for his stripped-down cover of Robyn’s Dancing on My Own, as an example of an out gay singer who has succeeded by falling into this “beige world”. Yet Scott’s last tour took him to venues such as the 2,300-capacity London Palladium, while Capaldi is headlining the 65,000-capacity BST Hyde Park next summer.For gay men in pop, says Jason King, dean of the University of Southern California’s Thornton School of Music, “there’s no question there is a glass ceiling. It’s not like we’ve always had hundreds of queer men in pop music hitting the top of the charts, and suddenly now we’re facing a drought”.You might argue: what about the 1980s? From here, the decade looks like a golden age of gay pop, thanks mostly to British men: Freddie Mercury (who was British Parsi), Elton John, George Michael, Pet Shop Boys, Dead or Alive’s Pete Burns. But at the time, few were out: pretty much just Bronski Beat and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although the straight public’s illiteracy about gay culture was proved when BBC Radio 1’s Mike Read yanked Frankie’s 1984 single Relax off air as he realised what it was actually about. To most people in the mid-80s, what are now unmistakable as queer codes – makeup, androgynous styling, elaborate hairstyles – just signalled “flamboyant pop stars”, which also created an indelible blueprint of how a pop star of any persuasion could look and sound.View image in fullscreenFreddie Mercury performing in 1980.Photograph: Fraser Gray/ShutterstockNonetheless, the Aids epidemic brought much of this progress to a screeching halt. Pet Shop Boys’ US career is thought to have stalled because their video for 1988’s Domino Dancing was seen as too gay. Mercury died in 1991. Elton John came out in 1992 when he was well past his pop peak, and George Michael wasn’t outed until 1998. Very rarely have gay pop stars been allowed to be honest about their sexuality in ways that are also commercially successful, as with Bronski Beat’s 1984 single Smalltown Boy or the Scissor Sisters in the early 00s. Lasting success is even more elusive.Hence why Lil Nas X’s breakthrough felt like a watershed moment, picking up the mantle of the gay men in pop who came before him. Here was an out Black gay man breaking chart records, winning awards and shaping pop culture, thanks to wittily provocative music videos such as Industry Baby, where naked men danced in prison showers. It looked as though true change had arrived. But within the industry, “record labels weren’t running to sign hundreds of gay men in pop, hip-hop and R&B”, says King. Or as Vincint, a gay non-binary singer, says: “Once the industry found one, that was enough.”In contrast, queer female pop stars have achieved full-beam mainstreaming, among them Chappell Roan, Billie Eilish and Janelle Monáe. Roan’s now familiar presence in the charts makes it easy to forget how extraordinary her meteoric success has been with sexually explicit songs about being a lesbian. Her mass appeal is not just due to the quality of her music, says Cragg, but also gendered dynamics of social stigma and homophobia: “If you’re a straight guy, you can blast Pink Pony Club because you’ve seen all the memes of tough, burly men loving the song. But if your most-played artist on Spotify is Troye Sivan or Sam Smith, you might worry your friends will think you’re gay or less of a man.”View image in fullscreenVincint at Outloud music festival at WeHo Pride in West Hollywood.Photograph: Amy Sussman/Getty ImagesFor queer women in pop, says King: “There’s a way in which their sexuality can easily be recuperated by the straight male gaze, so men don’t feel excluded by their queerness.” That same “logic” doesn’t apply to male queerness. Even if a male act finds a supportive label, manager, publicist and booking agent, being pigeonholed as a “gay pop star” can still limit his reach – especially if he’s singing about gay sex.“I was working with this well-known songwriter and was so close to this dream of a huge deal,” says Vincint. “Two days before, the writer said: ‘I don’t see a place for you. I don’t know how I can make this work.’” Now an independent artist, Vincint has about 102,000 monthly Spotify listeners: a pretty decent number, but one that pales next to an average major label star with a big marketing budget.Such are the opportunity costs and material consequences that come with being an out male pop star. This pushes some artists into behind-the-scenes roles as writers and producers, such as MNEK, who says: “Major labels aren’t searching for an openly gay pop star. They are searching for something that sells and is palatable for families and middle England.” He now “mostly works with women”, producing the kind of pop hits that gay male acts would struggle to sell.That’s the other obstacle that gay male singers face: appealing to pop’s biggest audience, straight women, who may not as easily relate to queer men as they do queer women. This is partly why Sam Smith (who later came out as non-binary) chose not to use gendered pronouns on their first album, “so that it could be about anything and everybody”, they said.‘They just wanted to silence her’: the dark side of gay stan cultureRead moreGay male artists also can’t rely on their own community to get behind them. While gay men come out in droves to support their favourite diva, they often reserve their harshest criticisms for queer male (and non-binary) singers, particularly anyone who doesn’t conform to punitive aesthetic ideals. Troye Sivan, Sam Smith, Khalid and MNEK have all experienced backlash: the criticism often boils down to the fact that they are either “too Black, too feminine, or too big”, says Vincint. By contrast, apparently straight acts such as Harry Styles and Benson Boone can push the boundaries of masculinity with queer-coded styling yet remain hugely popular.View image in fullscreenBenson Boone at the 2024 MTV Europe Music Awards at the Co-op Live in Manchester.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersAll of which puts gay male singers seeking pop superstardom in a difficult place – a situation likely to worsen as equality for LGBTQ+ people faces increasing threats worldwide.Recent polling foundthat only 54% of US citizens support same-sex marriage (down from 70% in 2021). Pride marches have downsized or disappeared entirely in the US and the UK, and companies such as Disney havecut transgender storylinesand beenaccused ofcensoring gay characters.“The tipping point of gayness, queerness and transness has happened and now we’re on the decline,” says a music publicist who wishes to remain anonymous. “I sit in meetings where execs are so dismissive and disrespectful towards queer artists. The music industry doesn’t want to invest in gay male pop stars because they can’t see them achieving mainstream commercial success.”Gay male musicians clearly haven’t disappeared altogether: many queer men (and those who shun labels) have, says King, “created alternative worlds that allow them to express themselves without having to strive for No 1 hits”. Frank Ocean came out as he released his culture-shifting album Channel Orange, and his refusal to embrace the limelight has made him one of pop’s most enigmatic figures. His Odd Future bandmate Tyler, the Creator used 213 anti-gay slurs on 2011’s Goblin, but later rapped about his relationships with men on 2017’s Flower Boy. The Texan singer-songwriter Conan Gray built his career using TikTok and YouTube, winning over a younger generation who areincreasingly eschewingtraditional labels of gender and sexuality. He now plays arena shows across North America. They may not have No 1 hits, but each of them is reshaping the boundaries of success in pop music for queer men.The great irony, however, is that gay men shaped so much of the history of mainstream pop music, one from which many of them are now excluded. Gay cultures such as drag and ballroom have seldom been so popular – albeit sanitised and co-opted by a mainstream more interested in catchphrases than the lived experiences that created them. This exclusion doesn’t just affect musicians, but also queer fans searching to hear their own lives reflected in music, and straight listeners whose worldviews might be expanded by hearing a counterpoint to the rise of rightwing “family values” fanaticism. The success of Old Town Road quashed perceptions that it was just a TikTok novelty hit. Seven years since its release, it represents a much more dispiriting kind of novelty.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockLGBTQ+ rightsSexualityGenderTransgenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

New titles were announced, celebrities appeared, and at one point, screaming people were suspended from the ceiling in an extravagant promotion for a new role-playing game.Acclaimed French adventureClair Obscur: Expedition 33began the night with 12 nominations – the most in the event’s history – and ended it with nine awards. The Gallic favourite took game of the year, as well as awards for best game direction, best art direction, best narrative and best performance (for actor Jennifer English).The Game Awards 2025: the full list of winnersRead moreElsewhere, Hades II took best action game, Hollow Knight: Silksong won in best action/adventure and Arc Raiders won best multiplayer. There was a decent showing for the new(ish) Nintendo Switch 2, with Donkey Kong Bananza taking best family game and Mario Kart World scorching across the line with best sports/racing game.It was also a night of big budget video game announcements. Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, a spiritual successor to the classic Xbox series Knights of the Old Republic, was revealed with the original game director Casey Hudson at the helm. Developed by Arcanaut Studios, it’s a single-player narrative adventure set on the brink of major change for the galaxy.Another returning classic was Tomb Raider, which is gettingtwo fresh instalments– a remake of the 1996 original named Legacy of Atlantis, and a new adventure, Tomb Raider: Catalyst.A newcomer to the Divinity series of role-playing adventures was unveiled witha frankly gross trailer. Created by Larian Studios, maker of Baldur’s Gate 3, the game was teased by Game Awards organiser Geoff Keighley who posted photos on social media showinga mysterious statuealong with its coordinates in the Mojave desert.An unexpected highlight was the lovely looking Coven of the Chicken Foot, a fantasy puzzle platformer from Wildflower Interactive, a new indie studio set up by Naughty Dog veteran Bruce Straley, who worked on both Uncharted and The Last of Us. You play an elderly witch called Gertie and a lumbering creature in what looks like an arthouse riff on The Last Guardian.There was anew trailerfor Capcom’s latest survival horror opus Resident Evil Requiem which showed the return of series favourite Leon S Kennedy, now sporting a floppy fringe and leather coat like some sort of emo super cop. He’ll be playable alongside FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft, the characters experiencing parallel adventures with different special abilities.Among dozens of other reveals was4:Loop, a new co-op shooter from the makers of Left 4 Dead and JJ Abrams’ Bad Robot Games, featuring eternally cloned and re-cloned warriors trying to reclaim the world from alien invasion.Ontosis a sci-fi mystery from Frictional, creator of Soma, set in a repurposed hotel on the moon. Remedy Entertainment unveiled the sequel to its acclaimed sci-fi adventure Control; namedControl Resonant, it takes place in a Manhattan reshaped by an invading cosmic force. Wildlight Entertainment, a new studio from members of the Apex Legends and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare teams showed offHighguard, a free-to-play raid shooter. And Wizards of the Coast materialised withWarlock, a dark single-player action-adventure set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe.The Game Awards isa controversial and imperfect beast. But this will be remembered as a night in which an ambitious debut game froma small French studio, with a budget of less than $10m, took all the major awards, beating vastly expensive sequels such as Death Stranding 2 and Ghost of Yōtei. In a modern games industry of billion dollar takeovers and mass redundancies, we must grasp such positives where we can.Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCEventsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They will be the first new games in the series since 2018, and both will be published by Amazon.Announced at the Game Awards in LA, Tomb Raider Catalyst stars the “charismatic, self-assured, formidable Lara Croft” from the original 1990s games, says game director Will Kerslake. It’s set in the markets, mountains, and naturally the ancient buildings of northern India, where Lara is racing with other treasure hunters to track down potentially cataclysmic artefacts. It will be out in 2027.Catalyst is in development at Crystal Dynamics, the Californian developer that has looked after Tomb Raider since 2003. Crystal Dynamics previously developed Tomb Raiders Legend, Anniversary and Underworld, as well as the reboot trilogy that featured a younger, more vulnerable Lara. Its most recent game in the series was 2018’s Shadow of the Tomb Raider.Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, meanwhile, is being developed in collaboration with Flying Wild Hog in Poland. Featuring modernised combat and redesigned tomb-delving puzzles, the game is an “expanded” ground-up reimagining of Lara Croft’s very first 1996 adventure, which established her as one of gaming’s most recognisable characters. “Our goal was to respect the spirit of Core Design’s original game, while updating the experience for today’s gamers including building it with Unreal Engine 5,” Kerslake says. “We see this is a reimagining of the original game with a gameplay experience that wasn’t possible on the technology at the time.” Legacy of Atlantis will be out in 2026.In both games, Croft will be played by the British actor Alix Wilton Regan, who previously had significant roles in Dragon Age: Inquisition and Cyberpunk 2077. She was also due to star as Joanna Dark in the cancelled remake of 2000’s spy-shooter Perfect Dark.Despite the series’ recent hiatus, Tomb Raider still has immense brand recognition, built on its 1990s heyday. Amazon also has aTV series in the workswith Phoebe Waller-Bridge, which is to star Sophie Turner as Croft. Over 30 years, Croft has been everything from Playboy pin-up to rugged wilderness adventurer to gentlewoman action hero.“Across the series, our goal is to show that Lara is always evolving,” Kerslake says. “Her core DNA will remain, but we believe it’s important to show how each adventure shapes her character over time.”This article was amended on 12 December, 2025. An earlier version stated that developer Crystal Dynamics is based in Canada. It is based in California.Explore more on these topicsGamesTomb raiderAction gamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCShareReuse this content"

She was also a communist who volunteered for the Red Cross during the Spanish civil war and an LGBTQ+ pioneer, living with the poet Valentine Ackland for decades in a quiet Dorset village, in a partnership theydescribed as a marriage.In the 1930s, Warner was described as “famous in two continents for numerous and brilliant contributions to literature”, but thoughmany of her worksremain in print, her name has faded from widespread recognition, even in the county where she lived.View image in fullscreenThe statue of Warner includes a cat – a nod to the witch’s companion in her novel Lolly Willowes.That is due to change this weekend, when a statue of Warner will be unveiled in Dorchester. The sculpture by Denise Dutton shows Warner sitting on a bench accompanied by a cat, in a nod to the creatures she loved and the witch’s companion in her best-known novel.Anya Pearson, who led the campaign to erect the statue, said that by placing the lifesize figure in the town’s main shopping area, “we are saying very clearly that women’s stories and queer women’s stories belong in our public spaces”. “Sylvia pushed boundaries, wrote without fear and lived authentically. This statue finally allows us to celebrate her as her authentic self, proudly and openly, in the town she called home.”Pearson is a veteran of this kind of thing, having previously been the force behind astatue of the Victorian fossil hunter and palaeontologist Mary Anningin nearby Lyme Regis. After that statue was unveiled to great local enthusiasm in 2022, Pearson set her sights on her home town of Dorchester, where statues commemorate the writers Thomas Hardy and William Barnes – but until now, no non-royal women.View image in fullscreenAnya Pearson led the campaign to erect a statue of an overlooked woman in Dorchester.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThe campaign, which asked for nominations of overlooked women, received more than 50 names that were shortlisted then put to a vote. Warner “won by a landslide”, says Pearson, who works at Arts University Bournemouth. The £60,000 cost was raised through crowdsourcing and a number of significant international donations.In a digital age, though, what is the value of a statue? “It’s about what towns choose to remember and to celebrate,” Pearson says.Statuesmay be easy to overlook, “but they are incredibly important because of the subliminal message they leave. And if they’re all of men and men of war, we are telling our kids that those are the only things that are worthy of remembrance. Battles, wars and the men that fought in them.“For me, this is an antidote to that symbolic annihilation of women within our civic landscapes. It’s putting them back in the story,” she added.Pearson’s successes with Anning and Warner have led to appeals for her help from other female statue campaigns, some of which have joined a loose grouping calledVisible Women UK. Alongside statues toVirginia Woolf in Richmond, west London, andAphra Behn in Canterbury, which are already in place, other groups are working on memorials to thesuffragette Mary Clarkein Brighton, the campaigning factory workerAda Nield Chewin Crewe and others elsewhere.Sam Johnson became involved in a campaign to commemorate thematch girls of east Londonafter discovering by chance that her great-grandmother,Sarah Chapman, had been a leader of their influential 1888 strike in protest at poor pay and terrible working conditions.Though the factory site – now a private residential development – has anEnglish Heritage plaque, Johnson and Pearson are working together on the campaign’s ultimate goal of a statue in a nearby park.“I’ve got this vision in my mind of three or four figures at ground height,” says Johnson. “I don’t want anything on a plinth because they’ve got to be personable and approachable. I like the idea of school kids going to visit them … as a reminder that, actually, this thing happened just down the road from where you live. And you can be that brave and courageous and wonderful as well.”Explore more on these topicsBooksStatuesFeminismWomenDorsetEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My son arrived and we walked to the top of the ski run and then ascended a giant spiral wooden viewing platform (the Slotwiny lookout tower) that gave magnificent views over fresh green pastures and woodland stretching far into the distance. In these Beskid mountains live Lemkos – a Carpathian upland people persecuted before the last war and dispersed afterwards. We found rustic wooden benches covered in animal skins, enthusiastic folk music and robust cuisine at the excellentKarczma Łemkowskarestaurant. A whole museum is devoted to prolific Lemko “naive” artistNikifor, and the verdant central spa centre has several mineral and medicinal waters on tap – try Zuber or Słotwinka.

The world famous (and rammed) Costa Smeralda is an hour’s drive north, but San Teodoro offered a more authentic experience at a quarter of the price.

The capital, Mariehamn, has a goodmaritime museumand some nice restaurants and it’s quite easy to get there thanks to ferries from Sweden, mainland Finland and Estonia. I found the countryside really attractive, with rocky inlets, woods and farms. At Bomarsund the ruling Russians set out rather half-heartedly to build a huge naval base in the first half of the 19th century. It was destroyed by the British and the French at the start of the Crimean war in 1854 during a naval action in which the first Victoria Cross was awarded – to a 20-year-old Irishman called Charles Davis Lucas. It’s free to explore the fort ruins but there’s a charge to enter the visitor centre.Martin LunnonThe only way is EssexView image in fullscreenSt Peter-on-the-Wall dates from the 7th century.Photograph: Wirestock/AlamyIn July, we walked for five hours along an English coastline without seeing a soul or passing any habitation.

Romania’s second-highest paved mountain road (after the Transalpina) is inaccessible in winter and only opened five days before our journey in early June. Constant turns are required to conquer the steep southern section of the Carpathian mountains, but these provide excellent views, and we were able to reach the still snowy Bâlea Lake by car instead of cable car. Our journey may have been less exhilarating than Jeremy’s in his Aston Martin, but at least we took in the sights along the way including, to my great delight, five brown bears at the roadside.Helen JacksonMansions and cats on an island near IstanbulView image in fullscreenCats at a historic wooden house in Büyükada.Photograph: Ayhan Altun/Getty ImagesAs the sun lowered in the soft July sky, two friends and I took a cheap ferry from Istanbul to the island of Büyükada. Cutting across the Sea of Marmara, urban combustion was replaced by an oceanic calm. Upon arrival, we walked in awe along mansion-lined, car-free streets, regularly stalling our meanderings to stroke one of the island’s many cats, and to gaze across the sea, back through the haze towards the distant city of 16 million people. On the ferry back at night, in high spirits, we plotted future expeditions to return to this most incredible of islands.Will BrownWinning tip: medieval manuscripts in FranceView image in fullscreenThe Dominican library has medieval maps and manuscripts.Photograph: Colmar TourismeOur Interrail trip took us to the French Alsatian town of Colmar – a history-packed, medieval, half-timbered melange of French and German culture, food and wine.

There are thousands of magnificent books, of which the 1,200 illuminated manuscripts are the highlight. Glorious 16th-century maps and translations of letters from Christopher Columbus are set alongside 13th-century books of psalms, Bibles and musical scores. Some documents date to the 8th century.

Philip Khoury’s recipe for pistachio yule logThis rich and moreish (and plant-based) yule log is a Lebanese Christmas favourite that harks back to the country’s French colonial pastPhilip KhouryFri 12 Dec 2025 14.00 CETLast modified on Fri 12 Dec 2025 14.01 CETShareIlove a yule log, also known as abûche de Noël. It’s a remnant from the time when Lebanon was a French colony, which lingers to the modern day, and is popular in Lebanese bakeries and patisseries over the Christmas period, often decorated with small figurines, plastic holly leaves and festive messages. Those decorations, and the trompe-l’oeil nature of this treat, enchanted me as a child, and I wanted to bring back some of that enchantment with this take on a woodland yule log.Pistachio yule logPrep10 minCook3 hr 15 minChill7 hrServes8–10For the chocolate chantilly mousse190ml plant-based milk,100ml of it well chilled120g dark chocolate(at least 65% cocoa solids), choppedFor the chocolate ganache200ml plant-based milk,100ml of it well chilled50g muscovado sugar, or dark brown sugar150gdark chocolate(at least 65% cocoa solids), choppedFor the pistachio praline200g shelled pistachios100g icingsugar¼ tsp fine sea saltFor the aquafaba meringue mushrooms75ml aquafaba¼ tsp cream of tartar150g castersugarUnsweetened cocoapowder, for dustingMelted dark chocolate, for dippingFor the pistachio sponge60g shelled pistachiosVegetable oil, for greasing105g plainflour100g castersugar¾ tsp baking powder¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda¼ tsp fine sea salt135ml soya milk¾ tsp vanilla extract1½ tsp apple cider vinegarTo decorate350g amarena cherries, or tinned cherries in syrup1 sprig dillIcingsugar, for dustingFor the mousse, heat 90ml milk in a saucepan on a medium heat until it reaches a gentle simmer. Meanwhile, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl, pour in the hot milk and blend with a handheld blender until completely smooth.Add the 100ml chilled milk and blend again until the mousse is glossy and smooth, with no visible streaks. If streaks appear, blend further, scraping down the sides to ensure a proper emulsion. Pour it into a shallow dish, place a sheet of clingfilm on the surface to prevent a skin forming, then refrigerate for at least two hours.Once chilled, transfer to the chilled bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk. Whip until light and fluffy with stable peaks (chilling the bowl before whipping helps speed up the process), then refrigerate until needed.For the ganache, combine 100ml milk and the sugar in a saucepan on a medium heat and heat until just simmering. Meanwhile, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Pour the hot milk over the chocolate and blend with a handheld blender until completely smooth.Add the chilled milk and blend again until completely emulsified. Pour it into a shallow dish, lay a sheet of clingfilm on the surface to prevent a skin forming, then refrigerate for at least four hours.Next, make the pistachio praline. Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)375F/gas 5. Spread the pistachios on a baking tray, lightly roast for eight minutes, then remove and leave to cool completely.Pulse the roasted pistachios, icing sugar and salt in a food processor or high-powered blender – they’ll turn into a fine powder and then a thick paste as the oils from the nuts are released. Stop blending and scrape down the sides whenever the paste starts catching. Continue blending until completely smooth, then set aside until needed. Any leftover praline can be stored in a sealed jar at room temperature for up to two weeks.For the aquafaba meringue mushrooms, heat the oven to 100C/210F/gas very low and line a baking tray with baking paper. For the meringues, it is best to use the static oven setting rather than fan. Pour the aquafaba into a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat to soft peaks. Add the cream of tartar and whisk again, then continue whisking while gradually adding the sugar. Beat until the meringue forms stiff, glossy peaks.Transfer the meringue mixture to a piping bag, then pipe small domes for the mushroom caps and thin cylinders for the stems on to the lined tray. Dust the caps lightly with cocoa powder. Bake for an hour, then turn off the oven and leave the meringues to cool inside with the door slightly ajar.Once cooled, attach the stems to the caps by dipping the top of the stem in a little melted dark chocolate and attaching it to the top. Leave to set.For the pistachio sponge, heat the oven to 170C (150C fan)/340F/gas 3½. Spread the pistachios on a baking tray, lightly roast for 15 minutes, then remove and leave to cool completely.Turn up the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9. Spray a large baking sheet with oil, then line with baking paper. Blend the pistachios, flour, sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt in a food processor until finely ground, then transfer to a large bowl.Warm the soya milk in a saucepan until it reaches 40C (104F) on a thermometer. Whisk together the warm soya milk, vanilla extract and vinegar in a bowl. Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. Spread the batter evenly over the lined baking sheet and bake for six minutes – the sponge should spring back when lightly touched. Remove from the oven and immediately place a sheet of baking paper on top, weighing it down with a dish towel to keep it flexible for rolling.To assemble, flip the sponge over and gently peel away the baking paper. Put on a clean sheet of baking paper. Spread 150g of the pistachio praline evenly over the sponge, leaving a 1cm border all around the edge. Spread a thin layer of chocolate chantilly mousse over the praline, then arrange the drained cherries in two rows along the long edge.Using the paper to help you, roll the sponge into a tight log, keeping tension as you go. Secure with more paper and chill in the refrigerator for an hour.Once chilled, trim one end diagonally, cut off a third of the log at a 45-degree angle, then reattach both pieces to look like branches. Spread the chocolate ganache in streaks over the log to mimic bark. Dust with icing sugar, then decorate with glacé cherries, dill fronds and meringue mushrooms. Refrigerate for up to two days. Leave to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving.This is an edited extract from Beyond Baking, by Philip Khoury, published by Quadrille at £30.
