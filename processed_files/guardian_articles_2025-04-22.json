The only future security guarantees for Ukraine will be provided by a UK-French 30-country coalition of the willing to provide a “reassurance force”, but this will not include the US.It had been hoped that Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, would attend the talks, but the state department said on Tuesday that would no longer be possible and that Keith Kellogg, the White House’s Ukraine envoy, would be present instead.The meetings in London take place amid European scepticism that the Russian leader is seriously willing to end the war, reinforced by events over Easter weekend, whenUkraine reported of thousands of violations of a short truceannounced by Russian president Vladimir Putin.John Healey, the defence secretary, told the Commons that the UK agreed with Ukraine that the Russian leader’s public pledges were not borne out by military reality.“Despite President Putin’s promise of a 30-hour pause in fighting, I can confirm that Defence Intelligence [an MoD unit] has found, and I quote ‘no indication that a ceasefire on the frontline was observed over the Easter period’,” he told MPs.“So, while Putin has said he declared an Easter truce – he broke it. While Putin says he wants peace – he rejected a full ceasefire. And while Putin says he wants to put an end to the fighting – he continues to play for time in negotiations.”On Tuesday, Zelenskyy said that Russia had continued to bomb the frontline with first-person view drones over Easter, though he said that the attackers had scaled back the number of operations and did not use long-range weapons.Healey also said he would meet Ukrainian defence minister, Rustem Umerov, “as the government is bringing together US, UK and European ministers and national security advisers to discuss next steps”.Ukrainian sources indicated that foreign secretary Andrii Sybiha was expected in London to meet Lammy, Kellogg and delegations from France and Germany at meetings expected to last throughout the day.Healey said the meetings in London would include discussion of “what a ceasefire might look like and how to secure peace in the long term”. Despite nearly three months of talks led by the White House there has until now been no breakthrough in ending the war.European officials had believed Moscow is not ready to agree to a ceasefire because Putin has not abandoned his efforts to dominate Ukraine while talks between the Kremlin and the White House continue.Russia has been demanding that Ukraine hand over the entirety of four eastern and southern regions its forces only partly occupy. That would include Kyiv ceding Kherson, which its forces recaptured in November 2022, and Zaporizhzhia city, proposals Ukraine would not be able to accept.But the FT reported on Tuesday thatthe Kremlin would soften its demands in direct discussions with the US, and would accept a freezing of the conflict on the frontline if the US agreed that Crimea, seized by Moscow in 2014, belonged to Russia.However, Zelenskyy ruled out recognising Crimea as Russian territory. “There is nothing new to mention or discuss. Ukraine will not recognise the occupation of Crimea,” he said, pointing out that it would be incompatible with Ukraine’s constitution.No details of any revised peace plan had been formally shared with Kyiv, Zelenskyy added. He said discussions should take place in the London format, rather than through the media, with the UK, France and the US as participants.According to one report in the Telegraph, Russia would hand over control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest in Europe, not to Ukraine but to the US – though it is unclear how Kyiv would respond to this.Putin floated on Tuesday that he wasopen to direct negotiations with Ukraine, which would be the first time the two countries had held peace discussions since spring 2022. This could involve discussing the issue of not striking civilian targets, his spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, later added.The US is expected to relay Ukraine’s response to Putin after the London meetings. Steve Witkoff, who is a close friend of Donald Trump and his informal envoy, is set to visit Moscow later this week. Witkoff has held three in-depth meetings with Putin, and his apparently warm relationship with the Kremlin has raised concerns in Ukraine that he may be amplifying Russian narratives.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyDavid LammyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The move comes after Mark Rowley, the commissioner of theMetropolitan policeforce, accused officials of dragging their feet on giving bosses stronger powers to sack rogue officers.Senior Essex police officer dismissed over sexual misconductRead moreRowley said in February that it was “absurd” that officers who were not fit to hold vettingcould not be lawfully sacked. The Home Office said the changes followed recent legal challenges which “brought to light” the difficulty forces could have removing officers who were unfit to protect the public.In February, a Met officer accused of sexual offences, Sergeant Lino Di Maria,successfully mounted a legal challengeafter having his vetting removed over the allegations, which he denies.He was found to have no case to answer in respect of misconduct allegations, and argued that having his vetting removed without the accusations being proved was a breach of his right to a fair trial.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said: “In recent years, serious cases which have badly failed all proper policing standards have damaged public trust in the officers who are supposed to protect them, and undermined the majority of brave, committed officers who work tirelessly to keep us safe.“It is simply not acceptable that officers who are clearly unfit to serve or pose a risk to their colleagues cannot be removed. That’s why these new rules are essential and it is why this government has been working closely with forces to overcome these barriers to restore confidence in policing.”The reformed police dismissal system will come into force from 14 May. NationalPoliceChiefs’ Council lead for vetting, the chief constable Alex Franklin-Smith, backed the changes which “provide clear routes for action to remove individuals who fall below the high standards the public and our workforce rightly expect and deserve”.The Home Office plans to introduce further safeguards to improve national standards for vetting later this year, including stronger requirements to suspend officers under investigation for violence against women and girls.Officers convicted of certain criminal offences will also be automatically found guilty of gross misconduct.While there are existing processes for forces to deal with allegations of misconduct, failing vetting may not be enough to sack officers. Officers can fail vetting for a number of reasons, including for domestic and sexual abuse. In some circumstances, those who do not pass the suitability checks but cannot be sacked can stay in the force on full pay.Dame Nicole Jacobs, the domestic abuse commissioner for England andWales, welcomed the move. “Ensuring officers are legally required to pass their background checks and providing police chiefs with the ability to remove individuals who aren’t fit to serve are positive first steps as we start to rebuild public trust in the force,” she said.“I look forward to seeing the government support these measures by introducing the statutory requirement for officers to hold adequate vetting, including re-vetting them when they transfer between forces, as soon as possible.”The mayor ofLondon, Sadiq Khan, welcomed the measures, adding that the new powers would give the Met leadership “the authority to automatically sack officers” who fail the checks and “ensure that anyone who fails vetting can no longer serve in the force”.Explore more on these topicsPoliceMetropolitan policeViolence against women and girlsMark RowleyEnglandWalesLondonShareReuse this content"

He is seen as one of the most amenable members of the Trump administration to doing a trade deal with the UK.Reeves’ task is largely a lobbying one. Officials say they are no longer looking to negotiate the terms of the deal with their US counterparts and instead are trying to put pressure on the president to sign it.Under the draft agreement, the UK will reduce the headline rate of a digital services tax paid by US companies, in return for relief on 25% tariffs on steel, aluminium and cars.“We’re happy with the text as it is,” said one British official. “But the reality is the decision sits with one man and no one can predict what he will decide.”Ministers accept the agreement will have to be renegotiated if Trump follows through on his threat to impose levies on pharmaceutical imports, which are the UK’s second-biggest export to the US at about £7bn. Cars account for about £8bn.Even if the British government persuades Trump to sign the trade agreement, it could make little difference to the economic outlook.The International Monetary Fund cut the UK’s growth forecast for this year from 1.6% to just 1.1%.While the downgrade had been expected, the IMF’s chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, said it had been caused more by domestic factors than Trump’s tariffs.“The tariffs are playing a role as they are in most countries, and it’s weighing down on growth in the UK,” he told reporters in Washington on Tuesday.“But there are some UK specific factors, and I would say in terms of the [downgrade for 2025] domestic factors are probably the biggest ones.”Gourinchas cited government borrowing costs, which began to rise after Reeves’ budget last year, and higher energy costs as principal reasons for the downgrade.Part of her task over the next few days will be to persuade the IMF’s economists to factor in what the government is doing to boost growth, including liberalising the planning system.MPs will debate those changes later this week when the planning bill comes back to the Commons for the committee stage. Ministers are expected to propose further amendments designed to encourage home-building and infrastructure projects.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsGlobal economyTariffsEconomicsInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)Economic growth (GDP)Planning policynewsShareReuse this content"

This is a government that will support the rights of our most vulnerable now and always.”She faced questions from a series of Labour MPs about what they said was a climate of fear generated by the ruling, particularly the practical impact of consequences such as transgender people potentially being obliged to use the toilets of their biological sex.Sarah Owen, the Labour MP who chairs the women and equalities committee, said: “Far from this ruling providing clarity, trans intersex and non-binary people are instead anxious and unsure about where this ruling leaves them, legally and practically, as they go about their lives.”Another Labour MP, Meg Hillier, raised the concerns of a constituent who transitioned to becoming a woman in the 1970s and had “used female toilets now for more of her life than she ever did any other toilets”, asking if she would now start to use male toilets.Other Labour backbenchers, including Emily Thornberry and Catherine Fookes, said they had been contacted in alarm by LGBTQ and trans organisations, with Fookes saying they were “really concerned and frightened about the potential implications of this judgement”.The Liberal Democrat equalities spokesperson, Christine Jardine, said that while she accepted Phillipson’s argument about women’s spaces, this “should not be at the cost of the human rights and security of another vulnerable group in society”.Phillipson also faced calls from Tory MPs to set out how the ruling would affect provision on hospital wards for transgender patients. She said she recognised the concerns and promised to meet MPs and others. However, she gave no answers to practical concerns, beyond saying that the updated code of practice from equalities watchdog the Equality and Human Rights Commission would take these worries into account.Earlier on Tuesday, Downing Street struggled to explain the seeming contradiction between Phillipson and other ministers suggesting trans people could use unisex or gender-neutral toilets in public spaces when updated building regulations inherited from Badenoch’s tenure as equalities minister set out that new buildings should prioritise single-sex facilities.“I’m not aware of those specific building regulations,” Starmer’s spokesperson said, adding:“It’s not for the government to tell businesses how to to run their premises.”With Starmer most likely being quizzed on the subject at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, some Labour MPs say they are concerned over the current position.“Toilet policing is not where we need to be in 2025,” one senior backbencher said. “No 10 needs to act. I don’t think we can leave this to a venue being taken to court because there’s no unisex toilet. I wish they hadn’t said it brings clarity, but had said we need to think about what happens next.”Also on Tuesday, theScottish government saidit would abandon plans to change legislation on gender recognition, saying it “fully accepts” the ruling of the supreme court.The case was prompted by long-running legal action brought by the campaign group For Women Scotland against Scottish ministers.Explore more on these topicsGenderTransgenderEquality Act 2010UK supreme courtLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Musk’s remarks came as the company reported a massive dip in both profits and revenues in the first quarter of 2025 amid backlash against his role in the White House.On an investor call, Musk said the work necessary to get the government’s “financial house in order is mostly done”.“Starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to Doge will drop significantly,” he said.That said, he expects to spend one to two days a week continuing to do what he referred to as “critical work” at Doge “for as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it is useful”.Musk is scheduled to leave Doge on May 30, a strict 130-day cap on his service as a special government employee.Tesla saw a 9% drop in revenue year over year in the first quarter of 2025. The company brought in $19.3bn in revenue, well below Wall Street expectations of $21.45bn. The company reported an earnings per share of 27 cents, also well under investor expectations of 43 cents in earnings per share.Tesla profits also slid 71% to $409m compared with $1.39bn in net income the previous year.The companysuffered a 13% drop in vehicle deliveries, making it the company’s worst quarter since 2022.Teslaclosed the quarter with 336,681 vehicles delivered.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators protest against Elon Musk and Doge cuts outside of a Tesla dealership in Kansas City, Missouri, on 12 April.Photograph: Charlie Riedel/APThough Musk has acknowledged there have been “rocky moments” of late, he remained optimistic about the company’s future.“The future for Tesla is better than ever,” he said. “The value of the company is delivering sustainable abundance with our affordable AI-powered robots. If you say, what’s the ideal future that you can imagine, that’s what you’d want. You’d want abundance for all in a way that’s sustainable, that’s good for the environment. Basically this is a happy future, this is the happiest future you can imagine.”That “happy future” includes the company’s plans for fully self-driving cars, said the billionaire CEO as he laid out an ambitious timeline for when he expects the vehicles to hit US roads in some cities – “by the end of the year”. Tesla hashistorically struggled to meettimelines Musk has publicly set for the launch of new products, especially when it comes to self-driving.“The acid test is, can you go to sleep in your car and wake up in your destination and I’m confident that will be available in many cities in the US by the end of this year,” he said.This would be on top of the Robotaxi service the company plans to roll out in June. “I predict that there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year,” Musk said.Despite missing Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom line, initial analyst reactions are optimistic given many had significantly lowered their expectations after the company reported a massive dip in vehicle deliveries.“Against the backdrop of catastrophic expectations, with everything from sales to margins projected to continue the slump, the less-than-bad numbers have been received as welcome news by Tesla investors,” said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst atInvesting.com.“In a curious turn of events, it’s as if numbers show that even at the worst moment, Elon and the team’s operation can still bring a robust $19.3bn in revenue, with total revenue partly making up for the huge drop in auto revenue.“If this is the worst it gets for Tesla, then certainly there must be some upside for the stock once tailwinds, such as the highly awaited cheaper model and the Robotaxi, finally hit the market later this year,” Monteiro continued.Analysts attribute the company’s overall difficulties to a number of factors, but ultimately concludeMusk’s role in the White House has caused a branding crisis for Tesla. The company is at a major crossroads, analysts say, that will only be remedied if Musk leaves his role in Doge and returns to Tesla as CEO full time.Doge cuts spark questions as employees supporting Musk space launches sparedRead moreIn addition to a drop in sales, a 50% dip in share prices, existing Tesla owners are looking to sell their vehicles in droves, Teslas have been vandalized across the country and in response to ongoing protests of the automaker, the Vancouver International Auto show removed the electronic carmaker from its March lineup. The company also recalled 46,000 Cybertrucks – nearly all that had been sold.Musk said that the drop in demand is due to the macro economic trends – not branding. “Tesla is not immune to the macro demand for cars,” Musk said. “When there is economic uncertainty, people generally want to pause on doing a major capital purchase like a car. Absent macro issues we don’t see any reduction in demand.”Analysts are not convinced.“If Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage…but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO to drive the vision and the long term story will not be altered,” read a Wedbush Securities analyst note. Wedbush remained bullish on the company’s chances of turning its financials around. “IF Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow.”The company declined to provide forward-looking guidance for the next quarter citing “shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains”.“While we are making prudent investments that will set up both our vehicle and energy businesses for growth, the rate of growth this year will depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts, production ramp at our factories and the broader macroeconomic environment,” the earnings report reads. “We will revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”The company did warn, however, that “changing political sentiment” could meaningfully impact short-term demand for Tesla products.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The reports equated to 7,644 images and a small number of videos, reflecting the fact that one URL can contain multiple examples of illegal material.The largest proportion of those images was “category A” material, the term for the most extreme type of child sexual abuse content that includes penetrative sexual activity or sadism. This accounted for 39% of the actionable AI material seen by the IWF.The governmentannounced in Februaryit will become illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to generate child sexual abuse material, closing a legal loophole that had alarmed police and online safety campaigners. It will also become illegal for anyone to possess manuals that teach people how to use AI tools to either make abusive imagery or to help them abuse children.The IWF, which operates a hotline in the UK but has a global remit, said the AI-generated imagery is increasingly appearing on the open internet and not just on the “dark web” – an area of the internet accessed by specialised browsers. It said the most convincing AI-generated materialcan be indistinguishablefrom real images and videos, even for trained IWF analysts.The watchdog’s annual report also announced record levels of webpages hosting child sexual abuse imagery in 2024. The IWF said there were 291,273 reports of child sexual abuse imagery last year, an increase of 6% on 2023. The majority of victims in the reports were girls.The IWF also announced it was making a new safety tool available to smaller websites for free, to help them spot and prevent the spread of abuse material on their platforms.The tool, called Image Intercept, can detect and block images that appear in an IWF database containing 2.8m images that have been digitally marked as criminal imagery. The watchdog said it would help smaller platforms comply with the newly introduced Online Safety Act, which contains provisions on protecting children and tackling illegal content such as child sexual abuse material.Derek Ray-Hill, the interim chief executive of the IWF, said making the tool freely available was a “major moment in online safety”.The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said the rise in AI-generated abuse and sextortion – wherechildren are blackmailedover the sending of intimate images – underlined how “threats to young people online are constantly evolving”. He said the new image intercept tool was a “powerful example of how innovation can be part of the solution in making online spaces safer for children”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)SextortionChild protectionChildrenInternetComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

It has covered issues around installing the technology, the cost, noise levels and the alternatives for people replacing their gas boilers.However, despite initially being given approval to go ahead with the non-BBC project, bosses told Davis the podcast risked exposing him to accusations of political bias.“As the series has gone on – in fact as the world has progressed over the last few months – they have become concerned that anything like this trying to inform people about heat pumps can be interpreted, rightly or wrongly, as somehow treading on areas of public controversy,” he told followers of the podcast’s YouTube channel.“I take their shilling, they dictate the rules. They have to try and keep their presenters out of areas of public controversy, and they have decided heat pumps can be controversial, so they’ve asked me not to be involved.”Gary Lineker says he felt BBC wanted him to leave Match of the DayRead moreThe widespread installation of heat pumps is seen as necessary to achieve the government’s target of hittingnet zero carbon emissions by 2050. Last month, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, dropped her party’s support for the target. Davis said he believed the decision to stop him appearing on the podcast had been taken because of a link between heat pumps and the net zero target.Bean Beanland, a director at the Heat Pump Federation and Davis’s co-presenter on the podcast, described the decision as “quite extraordinary”. Douglas Parr, Greenpeace UK’s policy director, said: “As an impartial broadcaster, the BBC should not be pandering to attempts from the right to turn the world’s most efficient home heating system into a culture war issue. What’s next – cancelling Gardeners’ World because of Monty Don’s support for peat-free compost?”Davis said he received “no remuneration at all” for the podcast and had personally paid its small costs for music, dissemination and microphone equipment. He said there was no link with the HPF, other than the fact it employed his co-host.However, he defended the broadcaster. “While it’s easy to be infuriated by the BBC and its caution on things like this – and of course, I do disagree with it in this case – I’ve never had the burden of actually having to run the BBC and make a hundred decisions a day, while people from all sides shout incessantly at me,” he said.“I’m obviously free to leave if I don’t like the restrictions that come with working here, but I choose not to because it is a great institution, the PM programme is in excellent shape, and they pay me handsomely.”The BBC has received criticism over its handling of environmental issues. In 2018, the broadcaster said it wouldstop “both-sidesing” the climate crisis, admitting that it got some of its coverage “wrong” by setting up debates with those who deny climate science.However, more recently, the broadcaster has given a platform to some who call for reduced action on the climate breakdown. Producers also accused the BBC ofshelving a 2023 political programmeby Sir David Attenborough that linked the UK’s biodiversity loss to the climate crisis. Insiders said this was because of fears its themes of the destruction of nature would risk a backlash from Tory politicians and the rightwing press.BBC guidelines state employees should not compromise the impartiality of the corporation in their outside work. A source said while the BBC is clear that climate change is happening, responses to it are a matter of public policy. They added that Davis’s podcast only explored and promoted one possible solution.The BBC has previously come under pressure over the external projects of its presenters. Last year, the broadcaster Clive Myrie apologised forfailing to declare at least £145,000earned from external events and said he would stop doing them for the “foreseeable future”.A BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC editorial guidelines are clear that anyone working for the BBC who does an external public speaking or writing engagement should not compromise the impartiality or integrity of the BBC or its content, or suggest that any part of the BBC endorses a third-party organisation, product, service or campaign.”Explore more on these topicsEvan DavisBBCHeat pumpsEnergyPodcastingnewsShareReuse this content"

Passersby including a junior doctor rushed to help the young girl but she had suffered fatal head injuries.Rehman, who had previously served a prison sentence after he torched a car involved in another fatal crash, fled the scene in a taxi.Rachel Shenton, prosecuting, told Manchester crown court on Tuesday that Rehman had taken “at least 20 lines of cocaine” in seven hours and visited two massage parlours before the collision.Shenton said he had left one of the venues at 6am and a second one at 6.30am before his Mercedes Sprinter van struck Louisa shortly before 10am.The three-year-old from Burnley in Lancashire had been enjoying a “happy family day out”, her family said. They described her as the “sweetest, kindest and most generous little girl” who was “full of creativity and joy, and she absolutely loved going to nursery every day”.Rehman was jailed for 11 years and three months in February 2018 after being convicted of being part of an armed drug gang in south Manchester, and he was released in October 2023. In January 2017, he was jailed for nearly four years for conspiracy to pervert the course after he torched a car involved in a fatal hit-and-run collision that killed a 25-year-old man in Manchester.Judges later reduced that sentence to three years after ruling that he should have received more credit for his guilty plea. At the time of the collision in February, Rehman is understood to have been out of prison on licence over the drugs offences.Abbie Clarke, a senior crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “This was a devastating incident which shocked our community, and our thoughts go out to Lulu’s family who must bear this unimaginable loss.“Rawal Rehman ignored the stop signs and tram warning signs when he drove straight into the path of an oncoming tram, and it is clear his driving fell far short of what is expected of a competent and careful driver.“Rehman failed to take responsibility for his actions. He fled the scene in a taxi and denied that he drove dangerously in interview, only accepting responsibility on his third hearing before the court. He must now face the consequences for his role in this wholly avoidable tragedy.”Rehman was traced by police after they found documents in his van. In his police interview, he accepted that he had been driving at the time of the collision but claimed his driving was not dangerous. He claimed to have panicked when he fled the scene.He was remanded in custody until sentencing on 27 May.Louisa’s family previously said in a statement: “Her absence has left a devastating void in our family – she was our only child, our whole world. We were simply enjoying a happy family day out in Manchester when this unimaginable tragedy struck. In an instant, our lives were shattered beyond repair.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Those who took part had brain scans, cognitive tests, and tracked their sleep using Fitbits.Even those with the best sleeping habits got less sleep than experts recommend, the study found. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 13- to 18-year-olds should haveeight to 10 hourssleep per night.The teenagers fell into three distinct groups. The first, about 39%, went to bed the latest and woke the earliest, sleeping on average seven hours and 10 minutes a night. The second group, about 24%, slept for seven hours and 21 minutes on average. The third, about 37%, went to bed the earliest, slept the longest, and had the lowest sleeping heart rates. They slept about seven hours and 25 minutes.While there were no meaningful differences in the educational achievements of the different groups, those in group three scored highest on cognitive tests, followed by group two, and group one scored the worst. Brain scans showed that those in group three had the largest brain volumes and best brain functions. Details are published inCell Reports.Sahakian said it was “surprising” that minor differences in sleep had such an impact, adding: “It suggests that small differences in sleep amounts accrue over time to make a big difference in outcomes.”For teenagers who want to improve their sleep and boost mental skills, Sahakian recommends regular exercise to help with sleep, and not using mobile phones or computers late in the evening.Colin Espie, a professor of sleep medicine at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study, said: “One of the consequences of having highly evolved brains, that can perform complex tasks, is that as humans we are particularly dependent on sleep, not least in the developing years.“As this research shows, falling asleep late and getting less sleep is problematic. No doubt this is exacerbated on school days when young people need to get up relatively early for school, and play catchup on the weekends – a phenomenon known as social jet lag.”He added: “We would do well as a society to place more emphasis on sleep by, for example, incorporating more sleep health content into personal and social education at secondary school.” Oxford’s Teensleep project proposes ways to help teenagers improve their sleep health.Gareth Gaskell, a professor of psychology at the University of York, welcomed the focus on early adolescence. “I would like to see more in the way of intervention studies during adolescence so we can find out how to help adolescents that might have suboptimal sleep patterns. Often, quite simple changes can be made to the bedtime routine, for example around screen use, to improve the timing and duration of sleep.”Explore more on these topicsScienceSleepYoung peopleHealth & wellbeingHealthUniversity of CambridgenewsShareReuse this content"

Palin appeared dejected as she left the courthouse in Manhattan.The case garnered much attention not just because Palin and the Times are household names across the USbut becauseit raised broader issues about free speech in the era of the return ofDonald Trump, who relishes repeatedly calling the mainstream mediaversions ofthe “enemy of the people”.It also highlighted the issue of malice as a legal standard that requires the plaintiff in such a case to prove that false information was published about them either knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth.Sarah Palin’s defamation suit retrial against the New York Times raises first amendment concernsRead moreThe verdict came in the retrial of Palin’s case, after a federal appeals court threw out a 2022 verdict that came down in favor of theNew York Times.Palin, 61, who also served as Alaska’s governor, sued the newspaper and former editorial page editor James Bennet over an article that inaccurately suggested she may have incited a January 2011 mass shooting in an Arizona parking lot.Six people were killed and the Democratic congresswomanGabby Giffordswas seriously wounded in the attack, with others also injured, as she held an open-air session outside a supermarket in the Tucson area to talk with constituents.The editorial piece about gun control, citing that earlier mass shooting, was published after the Republican congressman Steve Scalise of Louisianawas woundedwhen a man with a history of anti-Republican party activity opened fire on a congressional baseball team practice in Washington DC in 2017.Bennet said he was under deadline pressure when he added language to the column headlined “America’s Lethal Politics” that linked the attack to a map from Palin’s political action committee that put images of Giffords and other Democrats under crosshairs.The newspaper quickly acknowledged its mistake and apologized, publishing a correction 14 hours after the editorial appeared online.Palin said she experienced an increase in death threats against her after the erroneous reference in the column. Despite appearing sullen upon leaving court, she then told reporters: “I get to go home to a beautiful family of five kids and grandkids and a beautiful property and get on with life. And that’s nice.”She added that she had not yet discussed with her lawyers whether to appeal.A tearful Bennet apologized to Palin from the witness stand when he testified last week, saying he was tormented by the error and worked urgently to correct it after readers complained to the newspaper.Lawyers for Palin said the paper’s apology at the time was not enough because the backtracking did not mention her by name. In her closing argument, the Times’s lawyer Felicia Ellsworth alluded to the high burden that Palin, a public figure, had in order to hold the newspaper liable.“To win this case, Governor Palin needs to prove that the New York Times and James Bennet did not care about the truth,” she said. “There has not been one shred of evidence showing anything other than an honest mistake.”She added: “To Governor Palin, this is just another opportunity to take on ‘fake news’. To James Bennet, the truth matters.”But Palin’s lawyer Ken Turkel said: “This is not an honest mistake about a passing reference … For her, it was a life-changer.” Palin lost her first trial in 2022, but the second US circuit court of appeals last year said the verdict was tainted by rulings from the presiding judge. The case has been seen by Palin and other conservatives as a possible vehicle to overturn the US supreme court’s 1964 landmark New York Times v Sullivan ruling, which established the “actual malice” standard.The second circuit, however, said Palin waived the argument by waiting too long to challenge that standard.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsSarah PalinNew York TimesNew YorkRepublicansAlaskaDefamation lawUS press and publishingnewsShareReuse this content"

The Palestinian territory’s tiny Christian community had taken shelter in the strip’s three churches, but that didn’t mean they were safe. An Israeli airstrike had just hit the Greek Orthodox church, killing 18 people; soon, snipers and bombs would also kill civilians at the Holy Family.“I was so shy when Father Yousef handed me the phone, and there was his holiness on the screen looking at me. I thought, ‘Am I dreaming, what do I talk to him about?’ He was smiling and sweet, he asked me about what I’d had to eat that day, about my family,” Antone said.“We spoke about everything. He got to know all of us … Despite everything on his shoulders in this world he cared about us in Gaza. It feels like we have lost our father.”View image in fullscreenChristian Palestinians attending a special prayer for the late Pope Francis at the Holy Family church.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/APGaza’s population has endured terrible losses over 18 months of war. Although they never met in person, Francis’s diligent calls every night for a year and a half let the Palestinian territory’s Christian community know they were not forgotten, and his death on Monday has come as a hard blow.Father Gabriel Romanelli, an Argentinian who has served as the Holy Family parish priest since 2019, said: “Even after he was hospitalised, he continued calling to check on us. Our grief is deep because we lost someone we felt had become a member of our church.”Francis was a vocal advocate for an end to the war; he used his last public address, from the balcony of St Peter’s Basilica on Easter Sunday, to condemn the “deplorable humanitarian situation” in Gaza and implored Israel and Hamas to “call for a ceasefire, release the hostages and come to the aid of a starving people that aspires to a future of peace”.2:12Catholics across the world from the Vatican to Gaza pay tribute  to Pope Francis – videoThe 88-year-old pope called the two priests at the Holy Family as soon as the war broke out to check on the situation and offer the community prayers and counsel. In what became a nightly routine, at 8pm Gaza time sharp, Francis would call – and insisted on speaking to everyone about their hopes and fears, not just the priests, said another congregant, Bahia Ayad, 80.“He felt our pain and suffering deeply. He told us not to be afraid. He said, ‘I am with you and I will fight for you, I will call for peace and ask everyone to keep you safe,’” she said.“He told us to take care of ourselves, to be patient, and that the war would end just like all the wars before it.”Francis made several visits to the Middle East during his 12-year tenure, including the first papal visit to Iraq in 2021, during which he addressed the scars left by religious strife and extremism. On the news of his death, Palestinian, Lebanese and Syrian Christian leaders spoke of his commitment to the plight of the region’s oft-persecuted Christian minority.View image in fullscreenPalestinian Christians at the church after the death of Pope Francis.Photograph: Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersUnder his leadership, the Vatican recognised the state of Palestine in 2015. In the war in Gaza, Francis loudly and repeatedly criticised Israel’s actions, and urged for an investigation into whether the conflict amounted to genocide – a charge Israel denies.Pope Francis funeral to be held at St Peter’s Basilica on SaturdayRead moreAlthough Francis has gone, the Vatican’s support for the Holy Family continues. The church is currently sheltering about 500 people, both Christian and Muslim, and serves as a base for food, water and medical assistance for thousands of nearby families. Since Israel reimposed a total blockade on Gaza and the collapse of a two-month ceasefire in early March, the strip’s humanitarian crisis has reached unprecedented levels.The pope’s last call to the Holy Family church was on Saturday evening. It was brief, Romanelli said, as the pontiff was ill and busy with Easter.For Ayad, Francis’s Easter Sunday address was a poignant final message.She said: “His last statement, which he made just a day before his death, brought us great joy. When the war resumed, we felt that everyone had abandoned us – Arabs, foreigners, the whole world.“It made us feel that there are still people standing up for us and calling for an end to the war on Gaza.”Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismChristianityReligionThe papacyGazaPalestinian territoriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

(The film made Fiennes the dean of the College of Cardinals but gave him the duties of the real-life camerlengo.)View image in fullscreenCardinal Kevin Farrell puts seals on the papal apartment on 21 April 2025 after the death of Pope Francis.Photograph: ABACA/REX/ShutterstockFarrell has a reputation for personal warmth, a passion for social justice and moderation on doctrinal issues, likePope Francis.But liberals decry his stances on same-sex marriage and abortion rights, and his decision in 2018 to bar Ireland’s former president, Mary McAleese, from speaking at aVaticanconference, reportedly because of her advocacy for same-sex marriage and female priests. McAleese said she was “profoundly hurt” by the attempt to exclude her.As a senior bureaucrat – his jobs include running the Vatican’s investments and its Dicastery for the Laity, the Family and Life, which promotes marriage – he favoured opening the church’s lay movements to younger people.“The future of the movements depends on their ability to change the heads of these movements so that we prepare younger people all the time to take leadership roles,” hetold the Jesuit magazine Americain 2022.Farrell was born in 1947 to Edward and Molly Farrell, who worked at the Player Wills tobacco factory on South Circular Road. They instilled in their son respect for the Irish language, Ireland’s republican heritage and the Catholic church.Young Kevin was not sporty but “very, very bright”, a childhood playmate,Alan Wheelan, told RTÉ.Molly’s prayers that one of her four sons would become a priest were more than answered; Kevin and his older brother Brian both joined the Legionaries of Christ in the 1960s and went on to become bishops.After studying theology at the University of Salamanca in Spain and at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, Kevin served as a university chaplain in Mexico before moving to the US archdiocese of Washington in 1983. He became a US citizen, ran pastoral centres and charities, and studied business administration at the University of Notre Dame.Vatican power struggle: will an ‘anti-Francis’ pope emerge from conclave?Read moreFarrell served underCardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was later defrocked over allegations of sexual abuse. Farrell said he had no knowledge of wrongdoing by McCarrick. “I was shocked, overwhelmed; I never heard any of this before in the six years I was there with him,” he told Catholic News Service in 2018.In 2007 he was appointed bishop of Dallas and brought to Rome in 2016 by Pope Francis, who made the like-minded Spanish speaker a cardinal tasked withmultiple jobs.Farrell said he accepted the role of camerlengo on condition that Pope Francis outlive him. “I jokingly said to him: ‘I will accept this job, Your Holiness, but on one condition, that you preach at my funeral!’”The Dubliner is expected to lead a procession that moves the pope’s body from the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta to St Peter’s Basilica and to orchestrate thefuneral on Saturday, which dozens of heads of state and government are expected to attend. During the interregnum when there is no pope – thesede vacante– it is Farrell’s duty to destroy Pope Francis’s papal ring.Theconclaveis to begin in early May and will conclude with a puff of white smoke that announces the cardinals have selected a new pontiff.

Some potential candidates to succeed FrancisLatest updates after death of Pope FrancisHarriet SherwoodandAngela Giuffridain RomeTue 22 Apr 2025 11.23 EDTFirst published on Tue 22 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTShareThe death ofPope Franciswill throw into sharp relief the internecine power struggle that has been a hallmark of his papacy.In the coming days, a ferocious battle for the future of the church will be played out with the highest of stakes within the sanctity of the Sistine Chapel.There are more than 250 cardinals in total, but those over the age of 80 are ineligible to take part in the conclave. That leaves 135 eligible cardinals, who will begin making their way to Rome in the coming days.In the 12 years after Francis became pope, he appointed about 110 of those eligible, casting his net wide across the globe. SomeVaticanobservers have suggested he stacked the conclave in favour of a successor likely to embrace his outlook and continue his work.The appointments make it “difficult for an ‘anti-Francis’ pope to emerge”, said Iacopo Scaramuzzi, a Vatican journalist with La Repubblica newspaper and author of the bookTango Vaticano. La Chiesa al Tempo di Francesco(Vatican Tango. The Church in the Time of Francis).“But it doesn’t mean this group is unanimous and cohesive, or that they have the same ideas. Almost all the cardinals he has chosen are pastors from great dioceses around the world.” There were conservatives as well as progressives among them, Scaramuzzi added.For example, Gerhard Ludwig Müller, a German cardinal Francis appointed, clashed with the late pope on numerous issues, including blasting the decree to allow the blessing of gay couples as “heresy”.From the moment he was elected, Francis infuriated conservatives and traditionalists with a new style of papacy, a message of compassion and tolerance, and a challenge to centuries of privilege at the helm of the Roman Catholic church.In his public pronouncements, he championed the poor and marginalised, criticised the impact of global capitalism on people’s lives, demanded action on the climate crisis, urged mercy for sinners, and called for compassion towards migrants and refugees.2:53The life and legacy of Pope Francis – video obituaryIn the Vatican itself, Francis cut a very different figure. Where previous popes had favoured red leather slippers and ermine-trimmed capes, he preferred stout shoes and a plain white cassock. While his predecessors had resided in the lavish papal apartment waited on by devoted nuns, Francis chose to live in the simple Santa Marta guesthouse and eat in a self-service cafeteria.For much of Francis’s papacy, the figurehead for conservatives who opposed him was none other than his immediate predecessor. Benedict had promised to remain “hidden from the world” after vacating the papal throne in 2013 – the first pope to resign in 600 years – but had stayed at the Vatican, holding meetings, giving interviews and writing books and articles – and expressing views sharply at odds with those of Francis.Most of the cardinals electing the next pope represent EuropeBut the staunch opposition to Francis did not fade after Benedict’s death on New Year’s Eve in 2022, or after the death just 10 days later of the influentialcardinal George Pell, who described Francis’ papacy as a “catastrophe” in a memo published under a false name.Francis occasionally made stinging references to his enemies. In his autobiography, Hope, which published in January, he noted that a clue to the state of mind of his critics was evident in the ostentatious way they dressed. “These ways of dressing up sometimes conceal mental imbalance, emotional deviation, behavioural difficulties, a personal problem that may be exploited,” Francis wrote.Conservatives were infuriated by his softening of the church’s stance on divorced and remarried Catholics, opening the door to some of them receiving communion. Enraging those who adhered to the doctrine that divorce is a sin, the move prompted a group of conservative clerics toaccuse Francis of heresyfor that too.The heresy charge was repeated ina 20-page open letterin 2019, signed by prominent priests and scholars in response to “the accumulating harm caused by Pope Francis’s words and actions over several years, which have given rise to one of the worst crises in the history of the Catholic church”.Foremost among his critics was the US cardinal Raymond Burke, who has long pushed back against the pope’s stance on gay rights and social justice issues and who, like Müller, aligns with the views of Donald Trump. Francis marginalised Burke, even stripping him of his salary and Vatican-subsidised apartment. But Burke is still popular among conservative Catholic Americans.Cardinal Robert Sarah emerged as another arch-rival in January 2020 when he published a book, apparently co-authored with Benedict, which defended clerical celibacy at the moment when Francis was considering a relaxation of the rules. The Guinean cardinal has also railed against Islam, migrants, gay people and the role of women.Several variables will influence the outcome of the conclave, especially world politics.“Trump, China, nationalists … these are variables that will somehow count,” said Scaramuzzi. “Also, maybe there is a desire for someone more orderly, and less charismatic [than Francis]. Several things can carry weight at the time of the vote, which can either move towards a more progressive or conservative choice.”Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisPapal conclaveThe papacyVaticanCatholicismChristianityReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It shone a spotlight – the title of a latermovie based on the investigation– on the church’s dark shameful secrets.Eleven years later, Francis became pope. Wave after wave of abuse revelations continued to crash at the Vatican’s doors amid mounting anger and revulsion among the faithful and beyond. The issue threatened to derail Francis’s papacy and dominate his trips abroad. He was slow to grasp the scale and systemic nature of the issue and apparently reluctant to take firm action to deal with abusers and those who covered up abuse.Within hours of Francis’s death on Monday, survivors of clerical sexual abuse sounded a discordant note amid the lavish tributes. They said the pope failed to fundamentally change the culture of deference that allowed abusers to flourish and failed to deliver decisive action. It was the “tragedy of his papacy”, said one organisation.Among the scandals that erupted in the first half of Francis’s papacy were a damning report on thesexual abuse of potentially thousands of children by priests in Pennsylvaniaand the subsequent cover-up by the church; theresignationas a cardinal (and laterdefrocking) of Theodore McCarrick, a former archbishop of Washington, over alleged sexual assaults; apolice raid on the Catholic church’s HQ in Chile; and theconviction of an Australian archbishopof covering up child abuse.In 2018, George Pell, a cardinal and ally of Pope Francis, became the highest ranking Catholic to be convicted of child sexual abuse. He spent a year in prison in Australia before hisconvictions were overturnedin 2020.He died in 2023.In another crushing blow, a French archbishop and cardinal, Philippe Barbarin, wasfound guilty of covering up child sexual abusein 2019. He was lateracquitted on appeal.In Chile, Francis defended a bishop, Juan Barros, who had been accused of being an accomplice of that country’s most notorious paedophile priest, Fernando Karadima. Francis only changed his stance after adisastrous trip to Chilein January 2018. Headmitted “grave errors” of judgment, and summoned all the Chilean bishops to Rome andreceiving their resignations en masse.Later that year, Pope Francis’stwo-day trip to Ireland, once a devoutly Catholic country, was dominated by protests by abuse survivors who demanded that the pontiff take responsibility for the church’s failures. Francis made repeated pleas for forgiveness at public events.As his trip came to an end, archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, a retired Vatican diplomat,demanded Francis’s resignation, claiming he had failed to act on abuse allegations against a prominent figure in the church hierarchy.After the Pennsylvania report, Francis issued a 2,000-word letter to members of the global church. It spoke of sorrow and shame at atrocities committed by priests, and begged for forgiveness.The following year, hesummoned bishops from around the world to Romefor a summit on clerical sexual abuse. He told them survivors deserved “concrete and efficient measures”, not mere condemnations.That was followed by a decree that all Catholic priests and nunsmust report sexual abuse and its cover-upto church authorities – although not to police.But for survivors it was too little, too late.Ending Clergy Abuse (ECA) said after Francis’s death on Monday that his papacy “fell short of delivering the decisive action needed”.Its statement added: “Words without action ring hollow. Under [Francis’s] leadership, the church failed to hold bishops accountable for their roles in enabling, concealing, and perpetuating abuse. Systemic change remained elusive.“The resignation of a few prelates behind closed doors is no substitute for public accountability. His refusal to remove or discipline those complicit in cover-ups betrayed the church’s moral obligation to protect the vulnerable.”Snap, the Survivors’ Network of those Abused by Priests, said victims and survivors were mourning the “tragedy of [Francis’s] papacy” – children and vulnerable adults who were abused during his tenure.Shaun Dougherty, Snap’s president, said: “The bishops of the world – including the 137 cardinals who will choose the next pope – collectively possess knowledge of thousands of abusive priests still serving in parishes and schools. A true zero-tolerance policy would mean removing these offenders immediately and holding bishops accountable for keeping them in ministry.”Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the US-based group BishopAccountability, said Francis had “supreme power” but “refused to make the necessary changes”.Mitchell Garabedian, a Boston lawyer representing hundreds of abuse survivors, told the BBC: “There really hasn’t been any substantive change within the Catholic church. There hasn’t been any transparency.Pope Francissaid the right things, he meant the right thing, but the bureaucracy just shut him down.”There have been fewer scandals and revelations in recent years, but the fury and pain of survivors is undiminished and the repercussions for the church continue to reverberate.Members of the conclave that will meet in the coming days to choose a successor to Francis will know survivors will be watching closely.“The next pope must act where Pope Francis did not,” said ECA. “He must implement a universal zero-tolerance policy – one that holds clergy fully accountable for abuse and its concealment. He must reject secrecy and complicity and place the protection of children and vulnerable adults at the heart of the church’s mission.”Dougherty said: “We cannot afford another papacy that makes promises but fails to deliver real protection for children and justice for survivors.”Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismChristianityThe papacyReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She mentioned the experience of her daughter, a nurse, during the pandemic as an example of global instability.Minutes earlier, Hayes had confidently repeated the adage that “all politics is local” as he knocked on doors with Robert Waltham, an experienced local government leader who is the party’s mayoral candidate to head the newly created Greater Lincolnshire combined county authority.Yet in doorstep conversations with Conservative voters such as Chapman there was a glimpse of shifting national political foment as the party faces a serious challenge fromReform UKfor more than 1,600 government seats across England.View image in fullscreenThe MP John Hayes (front) campaigning in West Deeping.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe mayoral race is a key bellwether, effectively a three-way between Waltham, Labour’sJason Stockwood, who is a former chair of Grimsby Town football club, and Andrea Jenkyns, a former Conservative MP whodefectedto Nigel Farage’s party.The GLCCA area covering Lincolnshire is almost England’s electoral map in microcosm, welding together traditionally Labour-leaning industrial towns such asScunthorpein the north with farmland and prosperous market towns to the south including Grantham, popular with London commuters.In one of the most Eurosceptic parts of Britain, which already has one Reform MP in Boston,Richard Tice, Farage’s party should theoretically gain in Labour areas such as Grimsby and in Tory heartlands if his party’s “prime minister in waiting” spin has any foundation.An Electoral Calculus poll for the Telegraph suggested that while Reform would capture all the council seats on the Lincolnshire coast, the Tories should retain control of the county council.However, the Guardian understands that internal Conservative polling suggests the party is neck and neck with Reform in parts of Lincolnshire’s affluent south, where Kemi Badenoch’s party should be nailed on to win. In a contest where turnout is expected to be well below even last year’s general election – the second lowest in more a 100 years – historically more active rural voters could matter even more.View image in fullscreenWest Deeping resident Aggie Chapman says of Nigel Farage: ‘He terrifies me – he’s just Trump with a British accent.’Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianSome comfort for Badenoch can be found in Chapman and her neighbour Dominic Brownlow, Tory voters in West Deeping who endorsed Waltham’s track record in local government, while reflecting a residual distrust of Farage’s party. “He terrifies me – he’s just Trump with a British accent,” said Chapman.Nevertheless, Reform has clearly been cutting through elsewhere, where an anti-net zero message it has been honing at a national level has found receptive ears across swathes of Lincolnshire where villages are at odds with large-scale plans to site solar farms and battery farms.Jenkyns, whose other policies include a promise to cut supposed bureaucratic waste by introducing a Lincolnshire version of the “department of government efficiency” (Doge)led by Elon Musk in the US– has been campaigning hard up and down a corridor of villages and towns where plans for pylons and green energy infrastructure have met opposition.They include the picturesque village of Scopwick, which local campaigners say faces being surrounded on three sides by solar farms.“Pretty much as far as the eye can see you will just see solar panels and the opposition to that is overwhelming,” said Marc Williams, who is involved in running a campaign against the solar project in an area where anti-Labour sentiment runs deep.“No one who I speak to would shed a tear if anything happened to Ed Miliband. He’s turned into a net zero zealot,” said Williams, who also castigated Dale Vince, the Labour donor behind solar farm projects elsewhere in Lincolnshire. But while he noted Tory opposition to the plans, like others he had long since left the party behind in favour of Reform.View image in fullscreenMarc Williams, a member or the Springwell Solar Action Group, with his collection of protest placards at home at Scopwick.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianOther variables also make the Lincolnshire mayoral and local elections unpredictable.For example, how much of a fillip could Labour get from saving Scunthorpe’s steel plant? How much damage is being done to Jenkyns by Tory attacks on her for living in Leeds, the location of her former parliamentary constituency? Reform claims the allegations are “vexatious and politically motivated”, but she will reportedly face a statutory hearing into claims she is not eligible to stand.“I have experience of actually running local government here and I live here, as my family has done for generations, whereas Reform have parachuted in someone,” said Waltham.But localConservativesare spooked. One Tory source said: “Reform have no meaningful ground operation or data, but they are pouring money in.”They added: “Across Lincolnshire, Reform are polling at 60%. I don’t believe that but lots of activists and councillors are going into this thinking that this is an extinction-level event.“There’s also a strain of thought which says the only way we can lance the boil of Reform is to let them control and screw stuff up. Now, they might not screw it up, but if that’s where we’re at it’s pretty desperate.”Explore more on these topicsLocal electionsLocal governmentConservativesReform UKLincolnshireLocal politicsNorth of EnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They created their own rich culture and language, both of which are still practiced and spoken by their descendants today. After the emancipation proclamation, the Gullah Geechee decided to remain in their own lands, which now make up what is formally known as the Gullah Geechee corridor, spanning from North Carolina to Florida.Across the corridor, Gullah Geechee people are facing extreme land loss from climate crisis, gentrification and thedevelopment of their landsby outsiders.

With stakes this dire, a program like the GGSLP is increasingly important.GGSLP will be led by Ras Michael Brown and Tiffany A Player, assistant history professors at GSU. Undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in studying Gullah Geechee culture and traditions will have the chance to do so, while also having research, preservation and community engagement opportunities.“The Mellon Foundation’s funding allows us to strengthen our relationships with Gullah/Geechee communities and support their ongoing efforts to honor their ancestors and the legacies they left for descendants,” Brown said in a statement.GSU’s new undergraduate and graduate curricula will include four courses on oral tradition and folklore, immersive service-learning experiences and the establishment of an interdisciplinary GGSLP lab. Graduate students, under the direction of Chad Keller, co-investigator of the project, will have the opportunity to receive a newly created cultural resource management certificate.“This partnership with the Mellon Foundation will enable students to conduct and access groundbreaking research and meaningfully connect with the people and histories that make up one of the most innovative learning environments in the country,” M Brian Blake, the president of GSU, said in a statement.Explore more on these topicsGullah GeecheeCotton Capital: ongoing seriesGeorgiaSouth CarolinaBlack US cultureShareReuse this content"

Specifically, those who are kind, decent and compassionate.Take Radon Liz. In September 2022 shemade a fleeting visit to Balmoral to be sworn in as prime minister by the queen. The last picture that was taken of Queen Elizabeth was of her standing in front of a fireplace next to Truss. You can’t escape the desperation in her eyes. Please, please, she seems to be pleading, get me away from her.Just put yourself in the queen’s shoes. You’ve done a lifetime of service to the nation. Your first-ever prime minister was Winston Churchill, back when politicians were real politicians. And then just when you should be starting to take it easy, you get lumbered with David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. And then just when you think you might be in the clear, along comes the Trusster. Literally the dimmest prime minister of all times. Even 49 days of Radon Liz was 47 too many.On Easter Sunday,the US vice-president was at it. Forcing his way into the Vatican on one of the holiest days of the year to get an audience with a pope, who was clearly very unwell. That must have been one hell of a confession he had to make. His loathing of migrants, people dear to Francis. There again, the pope was a very forgiving man. So maybe he didn’t feel he could say no.Imagine it. Of all the vice-presidents that popes could have met over the last two and a half centuries, Francis had to make do with Vance. A man with whom he profoundly disagreed on most issues. It was his burden that he had wasted part of his last day on Earth with Vance. His last sacrifice in a lifetime of sacrifice.Though, I suppose it could have been worse. He might have spent the afternoon with Donald Trump. Agent Orange had to make do with an impromptu eulogy. “The pope was a good guy,” he said. “A hard worker.” Somehow you can always rely on The Donald to come up with the wrong words at the wrong time. A total failure to understand the importance of Francis’s papacy. You got the feeling Trump reckoned he’d have made a much better pope. You know, poping. He could do poping better than anyone else had ever done it. The bigliest pope.It makes you wonder where Liz and JD could go next. Perhaps it might be possible to steer them away from people who actually make the world a better place. Put them in front of men and women we can all do without.Perhaps a visit to the Kremlin may be in order. The world could do with less Vladimir Putin. If that worked they could emerge as latter-day heroes.View image in fullscreenThe last picture taken of Queen Elizabeth was of her with Liz Truss in September 2022 when she invited her to become PM.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAWhile some were eyeing up an alternative, more benign, future for Radon Liz, the government was having to deal with the fallout of yet another downbeat, economic forecast from the International Monetary Fund.Growth was revised down from 1.6% to 1.1% for the UK.Largely owing to the fallout from the trade war caused by Trump’s tariffs.Germany, Italy and France were predicted to take less of a hit. That must be the Brexit bonus we have been hearing so much about recently. Rachel Reeves tried to spin it as best she could. Kemi Badenoch was far too busy fighting a culture war to notice.Keir Starmer, meanwhile,was dealing with a culture war of his own after the supreme court’s ruling on how women are defined in equality law. And was sounding pretty chipper about it. He has come on quite the journey. Not so long ago, he was getting himself tied up in knots over whether all women had a cervix. Now he was hailing the judgment as a victory. “I welcome the clarity,” he said. Rather ignoring the fact the issue was rather more nuanced than some campaigners would have us believe.Still, you could understand Starmer’s relief. The supreme court had dug him out of a hole. The judges could have said it was not for the courts to define biological sex and it was a decision politicians should make instead. As it was, he was off the hook. The court had done his work for him. His hands were now tied.So … on the day more than 1 billion Catholics were grieving the death of a pope and the UK economy was given another kicking, most politicians in Westminster were being asked about who could go to which toilet. Media outlets that traditionally railed against the nanny state were now all for it. Trans women should use male toilets, Bridget Phillipson, the equalities minister declared. Which presumably means that trans men must use female toilets. I have a feeling we haven’t heard the end of this.Explore more on these topicsLiz TrussThe politics sketchQueen Elizabeth IIPope FrancisCatholicismJD VancecommentShareReuse this content"

Brummies of the world unite!Lucy ManganTue 22 Apr 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareJoe Lycett is on a mission to visit every one of the 17 Birminghams in the US and the one in Canada too. Why? Because he is a native of the UK’s own Birmingham, and he wants to see if there is any shared identifiable vibe and to foster a sense of togetherness among the scattered Brummies. Also, as he says, he has a pressing need to make a travelogue for Sky “and if anyone can do it, it’s Frank Sk– … it’s me”. There is also a Birmingham on the moon (a remnant of an impact crater – save your jokes, please, that’s Joe’s department) and one in Belgium. But “we don’t have a lunar budget and I’mnotgoing to Belgium,” says Lycett, so off he sets round the US in a tour bus suitably decked out in Cat Deeley and Alison Hammond scatter cushions. They both hail from Birmingham in the UK. This is not difficult, people. Do try to keep up.Joe has a sheaf of “friendship agreements” for the Birmingham mayors to sign – including a promise to stand together in Nato’s stead should it fall – a pen once used by the Queen Mother with which to do so, a collection of commemorative plaques and some Birmingham-centred presents to give to the people he meets along the way. There is Cadbury’s chocolate, of course, originally manufactured by one of the Quaker families whose histories are centred round the city; Bird’s custard (“sugar and asbestos”) invented by Brummie chemist Alfred Bird in 1837; HP Sauce (born of Nottingham but made famous under the aegis of the Midland Vinegar Company); and some of the 723 novels by “the David Walliams of her day”, Dame Barbara Cartland, originally of Edgbaston. Not all of these facts are in the programme, by the way. Joe’s enthusiastic spirit and evident love for his home town inspired me to go digging. He has that effect on you. And indeed on his driver, the North Carolinian Randy who, once he has figured out what little there is to figure out – and, indeed, that there is that little to figure out – relaxes and gets into the swing of things and functions as the perfect foil for his passenger.The first Birmingham they reach is in Pemberton, New Jersey, with a population of 32 “Pinies” as those who live so close to the Pine Barrens are known. “Wow!” says Joe, looking round in wonder. “There really is fuck all here, isn’t there!” But this is America, so there is still a diner and a gun shop. Joe duly does the rounds, enjoying a Jersey Devil burger among the friendly people at the former and himself at the latter when it turns out that he is a surprisingly good shot. “I’m a natural!” he exults as his first bullets land firmly within the target zone of a human-shaped silhouette. “I’m a cold-blooded killer!” He is honest about the experience. “It worries me how much I get it. I loved it … I have to remind myself that people shouldn’t have these.”View image in fullscreenThe silliest of conceits … Joe Lycett with the fire department in Birmingham, Missouri.Photograph: North One TV/North One TV ©Sky UK LtdFrom there, he takes in the rest of the Birminghams on the east coast (one seems to be literally a set of bushes by a roadside, and from another he is firmly rebuffed by officialdom – or at least by emails from “Susan” and “Linda”, who have lost their county the chance to be a tiny part of “at least a difficult quiz question of the future”), heads on through the midwest and ends up in the deep south, where the most famous American Birmingham can be found – the centre of the civil rights movement in Alabama.He meets civil war re-enactors, cavern owners and mayors aplenty, drinks a bloody mary with a sausage in it and attends a Beer and Bacon festival (the last two among the Hungarian population in Birmingham, Toledo, one of the three Birminghams in Ohio alone), and discovers that the inhabitants of the one in Detroit, Michigan call themselves “Birminghamsters”. “Like the little critters?” says Randy. Yes, and I would very much like this to catch on over here. The Detroit suburb is an impressively polished one. “It’s as smart as Solihull thinks it is,” says Joe admiringly.It is the daftest of conceits held together by Lycett’s charm and wit. He cuts his cuttingness with warmth and modulates neatly in accordance with his interviewees’ needs without becoming boring or patronising. His other programmes have had worthier goals as part of his work as a comedian-activist, helping to draw attention to such matters as the sewage crisis, greenwashing by big companies and various consumer rights issues, but the man has earned the right to a little jolly across America in the pursuit of lighter entertainment. No Brummies were harmed in the making of this programme and some may even have enjoyed themselves. Can’t say fairer than that, bab.Joe Lycett’s United States of Birmingham aired on Sky Max and is on Now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionJoe LycettreviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Idon’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that the right underwear can mean the difference between a good and bad day. Get it wrong and your day will involve retrieving fallen bra straps, pulling up socks or retrieving knickers sliding towards an uncomfortable spot.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.My evidence? The moment when, in 2020, aged 35, I put on my first pair of truly comfy pants. It was a warm day in lockdown. The banana bread was cooling, Joe Wicks was lunging, and I slid into my high-rise undies with a “full coverage” seat. That was the day I introduced myself to true underwear contentment (the fact thatbrasand I were on a break added to the sense of comfort).I wore them on repeat for years: no elastic snapped, no shape was lost, and no joy was stolen by discomfort. The best underwear worn on repeat will eventually look like a bargain when it comes to price-per-wear – and it makes sense to spend a little more on a good fabric, given it will spend its life in such an intimate spot.Of course, what the best underwear looks like will differ depending on your style, body shape, budget and priorities (although I suspect even the most devoted lingerie fan wouldn’t say boo to a fancy bra that was also comfortable). For many people, what they look for in underwear has shifted post-pandemic. Thericochet back to dressing upis being mirrored in our drawers as well.So, with a range of needs and desires in mind – from fancy to quotidian, sustainable to seamless – I have searched far and wide to find the best underwear for most (if not quite all) occasions. Much of this underwear I have tried, some I have worn for years, and others are the underwear heroes of friends and family with different needs and preferences to my own.The best women’s underwearView image in fullscreenPhotograph: FabrikaCr/Getty ImagesKnickers and briefsBest knickers for everydayView image in fullscreenM&S pure cotton high leg knickers£7 for pack of five at M&SThese cheap – and if not cheerful, then at least inconspicuous – M&S knickers served me fine for many years. They’re extremely good value, and these black ones are inoffensive and come in a range of sizes from 6 to 28.View image in fullscreenStripe and Stare high-rise knickers£50 for pack of four at Stripe & StareA similar proposition, if you have a bit more budget, is this four-pack of high-rise knickers. Made from 95% Tencel, they’re supremely soft and – big bonus – biodegradable (minus any lacey bits). They come in several colours that will suit everyday use and subtler tastes, but there are also moregarish pairs going for half price.View image in fullscreenChantelle soft stretch high waist knickers£50 for pack of three at John LewisI have it on good authority that these high-waisted briefs are excellent. Their soft stretchiness means they’re one-size-fits-all (or 8-16 at least), taking some of the jeopardy out of buying underwear online. The work of a French brand that’s been in the underwear business since 1876, they don’t come super-cheap – but I would pay good money to make each wear a treat rather than a pain in the backside.Best for something a little fancierView image in fullscreenBella yellow organic bamboo silk knickers£42 at Ayten GassonIf you’re after something a little less workhorse and a little more dressage, these yellow knickers from Brighton-based Ayten Gasson are pretty – and they haven’t given up all efforts to be comfortable. Handmade from organic bamboo fibres in thissustainably minded company’s seaside studio, these pants will also biodegrade. The lace comes from the Cluny Lace Company, which also produced the lace used in Kate Middleton’s wedding dress.View image in fullscreenKiki floral embroidery knickers£18 at John LewisIf the Ayten Gasson price feels excessive for knickers (I get it), the And/Or range from John Lewis has pretty briefs that come recommended by lingerie lovers. These embroidered ones are a case in point: a comfortable bikini shape, the decoration looks like a floral centrepiece on a harvest festival table. Plus, there’s amatching bra, should you want some vertical symmetry.Best for full coverageView image in fullscreenSloggi Basic+£36 for pack of four at Sloggi£36 for pack of four at M&SFor most people who were young in the 90s, the name Sloggi will bring back warm memories of visible, branded pant elastic, worn just above a low-slung jean. The brand is still around – offering a range of midi, hipster and string styles – and people continue to sing its praises. If you’re after a pant that gives full coverage, its maxi style is forgiving and soft, while coming high enough to give your belly button some company. It’s available in a range of colours.View image in fullscreenNot Basics women’s boxer briefs£18 at Not BasicsIf navel-grazing isn’t quite enough for you, these women’s boxer briefs give coverage in different directions. They’re made from deadstock fabrics – the company was set up by two sisters during lockdown to transform T-shirts into underwear. Available in more classic colours as well as a refreshing blue called Salty Air, they range from XS to XXXL. This is a good style on days when you feel the need for more coverage or support.Best eco-friendly knickersView image in fullscreenElliot Organics Bettie hipster short£24 at Elliot OrganicsElliot Organics makes high-quality organic cotton underwear that is soft to the touch. The styles are simple in an earthy kind of way, ranging from ribbed cotton briefs to side seam-free, high-waisted gym knickers. This pair of hipster shorts reads like an elevated take on something the American modernist pioneer writer Willa Cather might have worn on a Nebraska plain. I bet hers wouldn’t have come in “extra soft slub cotton jersey”, though, or spared a thought for avoiding a VPL. The only downside: they’re expensive for a pair of underpants.View image in fullscreenPico high waist knickers£20 at PicoFew knicker companies would go to the trouble of washing your pants using soap nuts – an eco-friendly alternative to washing detergent – but this one does. Again, if you’re worried about your yoni rubbing up againstfabric that has been potentially dyed with harmful chemicals, this is among the most natural pair of pants you’ll find. They’re made from unbleached and undyed organic cotton sourced from farmers’ cooperatives in India, plus a bit of elastane. A lot of thought and care has gone into this simple pair of pants. Crucially, they’re superlatively comfy.Best seamless knickersView image in fullscreenBamboo Clothing seamless high waist brief£18 at Bamboo ClothingStretchy and high-waisted, these pants give you a lot of coverage – equivalent to comfort, in my mind – without chunky seams screaming that you’re wearing a massive pair of pants. They’re made from viscose bamboo and come in either classic black or racier purple. There are also briefs and midi shorts if you’re after the seamlessness without the full coverage.There are seamless bras to match, too.View image in fullscreenSkims soft smoothing seamless brief£22 at SkimsSeamless doesn’t have to mean massive, of course, so if you’re looking for something skimpier these seamless briefs may be more tempting. I hate to drive more business in the direction of the already omnipotent Kardashian family, and Skims isvery far from a leader in ethical or sustainable practiceswhen judged against most standards, but I can’t ignore the fact that underwear aficionados swear by this shapewear brand.Best thongView image in fullscreenOrganic Basics flex thong£13 at Organic BasicsCotton jersey feels like a smart fabric for a thong: soft enough that it won’t leave you smarting. This thong comes in neutrals, as well as lime and melon pink, and is available to buy in a bundle. It is the work of Organic Basics, purveyors of attractive undies that also prioritise comfort – and planet.Best for an unexpected-but-great pair of pantsView image in fullscreenMerino wool briefs£14.39 at DillingI once met a man who wore cashmere boxer shorts, attesting that he’d “put them through their paces in Berlin’s clubs” and they were worth the cash. I won’t repeat what I thought of him here – not least because I no longer have a leg to stand on. This winter I bought a pair of mulesing-free merino wool pants and I will not look back. They’re cosy and breathable and, while they’re deeply unsexy, they make me feel as if I belong in a cabin in Maine, about to shuck oysters. A not unenjoyable feeling.They also come in plus-size.BrasBest everyday brasView image in fullscreenOrganic Basics core triangle bralette£28.50 at Organic BasicsFor me and many others, comfortsimply cannot be found when wearing an underwire. However, it certainly can be found – and is being found while I type – in this cotton jersey triangle bralette. It comes in a range of sometimes quite unexpected colours, from XXS to XXL. Considering you can forget you’re wearing it, this feels like good value to me.View image in fullscreenBoody Lyolyte triangle bralette£19.95 at BoodyFor me, “everyday” means fairly full coverage – who needs to see nipples in the office – so the double front layer is a nice touch in an otherwise unpadded bra. The deep V suits a range of outfits, particularly as summer hits and buttons are unbuttoned. The work of a B-corp, this bralette is made using lyocell and in a seamfree construction that apparently reduces waste.Best eco-friendly braView image in fullscreenPico crop top£34 at PicoOnce again the work of Pico, the company that washes with soap nuts, this crop top made largely from organic cotton is a worthy contender. It’s minimal and inoffensive – plus allows that dream situation of being so comfy you can forget you’re even wearing it – although it “provides light support”, which is perhaps why it’s available only up to a size 14. The only downside I have discovered: the underband can get a little twisted in the wash and need rejigging.Best strapless brasView image in fullscreenJohn LewisIvy seam-free bandeau bra£16 at John LewisWhile strapless bandeau bras can admittedly feel a little bit more like a bandage than a bra, there are certain outfits where that is what is needed. This John Lewis seam-free bandeau bra won’t win any awards for style, but it may just make the outfit worn over it that much more streamlined. Some strapless bras pincer you to stay put, but this one opts for a more gentle squeeze. It might need the occasional hoiking-up but I am yet to meet a strapless bra that doesn’t.Bra tape can help.View image in fullscreenM&S Flexifit multi-way bra£16 at Marks & SpencerIf you’re after something with more structure, you could do a lot worse than this M&S bra. If, like me, you need a strapless bra only every now and again, it makes sense to get one that can double as a bra with straps. Available from a 30A to a 42E, this is a classic shape and comes in a range of skin-toned shades.Best bras for bigger bustsView image in fullscreenFreya undetected moulded bra£39 at FreyaBras don’t come much more classic than this. Some bras designed for extra support can look a little over-engineered, but this one is sleek, elegant and seam-free, so it won’t be too visible under clothes. Unless you want it to be, that is: the chilli red iteration is the good kind of red flag. Available up to a double H cup, and in a more inconspicuous black.View image in fullscreenBravissimo Millie Bra£39 at BravissimoUnderwired, non-padded and made from soft stretchy lace, this pretty bra from the bigger-boob specialists that my bigger-boobed friends favour, Bravissimo, is available up to a K cup. Opt for cobalt, green or a more classic shade if you would rather something more low-key.Read our guide tothe best brasfor more comfy and supportive stylesThe best underwear setsView image in fullscreenDora Larsen Bea graphic lacebralette£62 at Dora LarsenDora Larsen Bealace knickers£42 at Dora LarsenDora Larsen makes extremely pretty lingerie, minus the usual tropes: less Ann Summers, more Patricia Arquette’s iconic True Romance bra (with a modern shake). The colours pop, with often brave combinations, such as this bright red with sky blue, and the fabrics are impeccably soft.This lace bralette comes in sizes 32B to 36D. A set with matching pants will come in at more than £100 – but this isn’t underwear for every day, meaning one set should have a longer lifespan than your workhorse bras and pants. The company, which is named after the founder’s dog also spares a thought for sustainability: where a lot of lingerie is pure virgin polyester, the Dora Larsen lace and tulle are made partly of recycled materials. Sort the bras by price to find some relative bargains, particularly if you’re a less “typical” size.View image in fullscreenPink City Prints Feeling Fresh bra and pants set£35 at Pink City PrintsSpeaking of pretty underwear, this screen-printed organic cotton set is also worth praise. With teams in London and Jaipur, the company places emphasis on preserving traditional craftsmanship – hence the block printing. The results look almost too good to be worn under clothes. Be warned: they run big and are more of a style to be worn for lounging than for marching to the corner shop and back.SocksBest everyday socksView image in fullscreenArket cotton rib socks£15 for three pairs at ArketMultipacks are the sock equivalent of a cereal variety pack: perfect for those who don’t feel like Frosties every day. This particular three-pack will add pizzaz to a loafer on a Monday (the red), look Scandi and chic on a Tuesday (the beige), and mysterious and highbrow on a Sunday (the plum). There are reinforced toes and heels for added durability, which is a nice feature for a sock you plan to wear on the regs.View image in fullscreenColourful Standardclassic organic£9 at Colourful StandardEveryday doesn’t have to mean dull and Colourful Standard knows it. Its organic cotton socks, made in Portugal, come in 31 different colours. From burned yellow to spring green, there’s a pair to suit every outfit, mood and occasion. They’re a little dear for an everyday sock, but mine have been brightening my feet for some time and show no signs of dimming.Best socks for cold weatherView image in fullscreenM&S Thermal Sumptuously Softsocks£10 for pack of three at M&SOf course M&S knows its way around a pair of socks. Thermal, soft and affordable, these socks are available in black or a charcoal mix, with reinforced toes and heels that should keep your socks wearable well into 2026 and beyond.View image in fullscreenLe Bon Shoppe Margot socks£15.46 at Le Bon ShoppeLe Bon Shoppe makes delightful, if expensive, socks. This chunky, fuzzy pair is designed to keep feet warm and toasty. The lavender colour is an unexpected dash of levity on a grey day.Best for a special occasionView image in fullscreenNishiguchi Kutsushitalinen socks£22 at ToastThere are fancy socks and then there are very fancy socks, and this pair from Toast is the latter. Made from linen and crafted by Nishiguchi Kutsushita, a Japanese sock company established in 1950, the Toast website tells us pleasingly that they’ve been made “in a small workshop using old knitting machines”. The colour feels contemporary even if the makers are heritage and the breathability of the fabric will make sure feet feel fresh.View image in fullscreenSwedish Stockings Elin premium knee-highs£20 for pack of two at Swedish StockingsThese apple-green 20-denier knee-high socks may not have the plushness of the Toast pair, but they’re very much here for a good time. Knitted from recycled yarn in Italy, they’re just as good for work as for parties, with either a pair of kitten heels or a more businesslike loafer.Explore more on these topicsLingerieThe Filterbest ofShareReuse this content"

As in both the lowercase, technical meaning – the sequestration of cardinals to elect a new pope with a two-thirds majority – and the capital-C film of the same name from last year, which allowed viewers to vicariously participate in a process long shrouded in secrecy and reverence. (And premiering during the US vote, toexperience election thrillswithout grim disappointment.)The film, directed by Edward Berger, luxuriated in process both sacred and profane – the orderly processions and cafeteria run-ins, the ceremonial burning of paper votes and security screenings, the white smoke and the complimentary toiletries bags. The hallowed halls of the Vatican and the gossip that flits among them, especially as different factions compete to see their vision cemented by the most powerful religious leader in the world. As a deft and highly entertaining thriller on the furtive process of electing a new pope, well, you can expect people to considerConclaveas close to documentary as laypeople can get to the action. But how accurate is it?Conclave: the fun, exciting Vatican thriller is perfect election escapismRead moreAccording to experts, more spot-on than not, and at the very least meticulously researched. “They got a lot of the details right,” said Kathleen Sprows Cummings, a historian of Catholicism at Notre Dame who closely followed the election ofPope Francisin 2013. “The movie did a really good job of balancing the human – people, men who are ambitious, who have very strong feelings about what the church needs – and the Holy Spirit” that Catholics believe guide the proceedings.“It gets a lot of the details right,” agreed Bill Cavanaugh, a professor of Catholic Studies at DePaul University. “Certainly the mise-en-scene of the movie, they take pains to be very accurate on that.” Berger, screenwriter Peter Straughan and the production team have spoken at length, as part of the film’s awards campaign – it was nominated for the Oscar and won the Bafta – about the film’smeticulous research process, which did not directly involve the Vatican, to avoid undue influence. Instead, the team interviewed numerous cardinals on general details, toured the Vatican, and recreated the Sistine Chapel at the Cinecittà Studios in Rome. Religious advisers consulted on archaic proceedings not officially confirmed but passed down through the centuries, such as the process for removing and destroying the dead pope’s ring. “It was remarkable the way that they took something that’s secret and really got a lot of it right,” said Cummings.View image in fullscreenStanley Tucci in Conclave.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyThe film, she added, “got a sense of the types of conversations that happen before a conclave”, during what is called the general congregation, where all cardinals – including so-called “kingmakers” over age 80 who are too old to vote – travel to Rome for conversations and meetings about the future of the church. (“You’re not going to call a movie ‘general congregation’, that’s too boring,” she joked.) The unofficial chatter around the election began in earnest in February, when Francis fell gravely ill with pneumonia. But as of this week, the action depicted in the film will more or less get under way. “They’ll be having dinners, they’ll be gathering in apartments,” she said. “There will be: ‘who’s supporting who? Is there a clear majority going in? Is there a clear front runner going in?’ That’s all happening.”The film delineates those conversations along clear factions headed by archetypes: Cardinal Goffredo Tedesco (Sergio Castellitto), an Italian reactionary, represents the church’s conservative wing opposed to relaxing strictures. Cardinal Aldo Bellini (Stanley Tucci), the leading liberal candidate, seeks to reform the church in the lane of the late pope. Nigerian cardinal Joshua Adeyemi (Lucian Msamati) stands for the large percentage of practicing Catholics in the Global South; he would become the first Black pope, as well as a staunchly homophobic one. Cardinal Joseph Tremblay (John Lithgow) is a savvy and transparently ambitious Canadian keen to power. And Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Fiennes, whose uncle Nicholas Lash was one of England’s most renowned Catholic theologians) operates as the moderate, tradition-bound peacekeeper nonetheless tempted by personal ambition and sympathies to the liberal wing.This factionalism loosely maps onto a Church grappling with liberal and conservative visions, but the politicking is likely “a little bit exaggerated”, said Cavanaugh. “Cardinals don’t fall neatly into progressive and conservative camps … in general, it’s much more of a mixed bag.”“They’re caricatures, certainly, but they also capture something that’s real,” said Cummings. “There are certainly people who are traditionalist, who think Pope Francis went too far in meeting people on the margins. There are people who want his legacy to continue in just exactly the same way.” How those visions play out in an election featuring 135 cardinals, the vast majority appointed by Francis, is more complicated.Both Cavanaugh and Cummings noted some inaccuracies, such as the influential presence of Cardinal Benitez (Carlos Diehz), a Mexican cardinal appointed archbishop of Kabul in secret (“in pectore”) by the pope before his death, who emerges as a dark horse contender and ultimately – spoiler alert! – the newly elected pope. “The idea that a cardinal in pectore could just like roll up to the conclave and say: ‘Hey, I’m here to vote’ – that actually could not happen,” said Cummings. “A cardinal doesn’t get the privileges of being a cardinal until he’s publicly announced as such.” Fiennes’s role as the dean of the College of Cardinals was conflated with that of the camerlengo – the key dignitary tasked by the pope with overseeing the transition. (The film is correct that the role of camerlengo does not disqualify a cardinal from being elected pope, though it is unusual. According tothe Times, only two camerlengos have ever been elected pope: Gioacchino Pecci, as Pope Leo XIII in 1878, and Eugenio Pacelli, as Pope Pius XII in 1939.) As the college is truly sequestered, it’s unlikely Isabella Rossellini’s nun would be poking around at night. There has never been evidence of a cardinal buying votes, as alleged against Cardinal Tremblay. And the logistics of a bomb blowing out the windows of the Sistine Chapel, in a terrorist attack roughly akin to the Vatican’s “October surprise” was, according to Cummings, highly unlikely. But “procedurally, they got it right,” she said. “The aesthetics were absolutely stunning.”View image in fullscreenIsabella Rossellini in Conclave.Photograph: Courtesy of Focus Features. © 2024 Focus Features/APTechnical inaccuracies aside, Cummings pointed to one moment that captured some emotional truth about a papal election: when the upstart Cardinal Bellini asks Lawrence what his papal name would be. Lawrence demurs, claiming that he never thought about it. But later, he admits it would be John. “I just love that, because of course, if you’re a Cardinal, you have a papal name in mind,” said Cummings. One of the film’s best gags, which played out in memes for weeks, was the cardinals’ persistent front of not wanting to be pope, while accusing others of wanting to be pope. “Of course no one says theywantto be pope,” said Cummings. “I thought that captured really the humanity of the cardinals.”‘We create gods because the world is chaos’: Ralph Fiennes, John Lithgow and Stanley Tucci on celebrity, sin and papal thriller ConclaveRead moreAlso true was the inherent mystery around how someone would act as pope. “Once you elect somebody, you don’t exactly know who they’re going to turn out to be,” said Cavanaugh. Pius IX, for example, was elected in 1846 as a progressive, but became an arch conservative once he was forced to flee Rome by the revolutions of 1848. John the 23rd was elected as a peacekeeper in 1958, but ended up calling the Second Vatican Council modernizing the Church. And Pope Francis himself surprised many with (relatively) progressive stances on homosexuality and social justice.InConclave, Benitez, the newly elected pope, reveals to Lawrence in the Room of Tears – the customary last stop before publicly taking on the weight of a 2,000-year-old institution, lushly imagined in the film as a nook of blood red – that he was intersex, thus challenging the church’s rigid conceptions of gender and who can be pope. The twist, on top of the bombing, is “a little far-fetched”, said Cavanaugh, “but the idea that you never know exactly who you’re getting when you elect a pope, I think it nails that”.Ultimately, those of us outside the Vatican will almost certainly have to speculate on what goes down in Casa Santa Marta and the Sistine Chapel. “We are not supposed to know how the cardinals vote,” said Cavanaugh. “That is supposed to remain a secret forever.” And yet, rumors fly – it was widely known that Jorge Mario Bergoglio, aka Pope Francis, was the runner-up to Joseph Ratzinger, soon to be Pope Benedict XVI, in 2005. The desire to talk, after all, is quite human. If there’s one thing Conclave captured, it’s the unpredictability of living, breathing, emotional people within an institution – or, as Cavanaugh put it, “the balance between the solemnity and sanctity and seriousness of what’s going on, and the fallibility of the humans that are doing it.”This article was amended on 22 April 2025. An earlier version misnamed the character of Joseph Tremblay and stated that he was American; in fact, he is Canadian. Also, Ralph Fiennes played the dean of the College of Cardinals, not the camerlengo.Explore more on these topicsConclavePope FrancisCatholicismChristianityReligionThe papacyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A growing number of event organisers across the UK are putting their own spins on literature readings – and there are queues out the doorSinéad CampbellTue 22 Apr 2025 08.21 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 12.37 EDTShareOn a Saturday evening in London’s Notting Hill, a large crowd of moderately tipsy young people are spilling into a tailor’s shop on Portobello Road. A passerby could easily assume they were walking past a fashion pop-up attracting a stylish herd of fanatics. But they’d be wrong. The buzzing crowd is here for a live reading event, and they’re eager with energy and anticipation.Soho Reading Seriesbegan in the summer of 2023 and was founded by Tom Willis, a writer and PhD student. He wanted to make a “scene where anyone could turn up, party, and have a killer time with literature as the centre,” he tells me over an extra-dry martini a couple of hours before one of the events.Live literature readings are, of course, nothing new. Salons, bookshop readings, poetry slams and open mics have been fixtures of literary cultures for decades. However, lately this tradition has been revitalised, with events like the Soho Reading Series cropping up all over the country.Willis was inspired by the cultural heyday of Soho in the 80s and 90s, an era when writers and literary types coalesced in the boozy backrooms of private members’ clubs. Unlike its name, the Soho Reading Series migrates with each event to different venues across the city – from a Grade II-listed pub in Harringay to a Victorian Anglican church on Ladbroke Grove.“If you’re a published writer, you might go to your publishing house’s Christmas party, and everyone just knows each other there. That’s the professional literary scene, and then we’re theunprofessionalliterary scene.” Willis says with a smile.Some people come for a party. Some people come for readings. People end up staying for the thing they didn’t come forSophie Barshall“Scene” is a word used by many of the event’s attendees – but only ever while miming air quotes. I guess this is because the word implies an air of pretentiousness and exclusivity. In reality, these events are unassuming and attract a diverse and expanding crowd. There’s no immovable barrier, secret password or even a ticket to enter – anyone can walk in.“It’s a party of like-minded people who care about literature. So that’s why it’s such a good party, because everyone cares about the same thing, and everyone’s not there for their career. They hang out with people who like books and have something nice to share,” says Willis.Soho Reading Series is just one vein in a growing web of live reading events. The audience is young compared with the average literature festival crowd and it attracts a devout congregation of both literary and party-curious individuals.View image in fullscreenToye Oladinni reading at the Soho Reading Series.Photograph: Isobel Landell Mills“Some people come for a party. Some people come for readings. People often end up staying for the thing that they hadn’t planned to come for,” saysSophie Barshall, editor of London-based quarterly DIY arts and culture newspaperThe Toe Rag, which also hosts popular live readings.Inside the tailor’s shop on Portobello Road, the readings begin an hour late. There is no microphone; each reader flicks through printed sheets of paper or scrolls through the notes app on their phone, attempting to project their voice over shuffling, mumbles, momentary laughter and heckling. The shop – usually populated by people shopping for cashmere socks – is full to capacity. The audience has leaked out on to the pavement, and a young woman next to me is FaceTiming a friend outside so they can hear what’s going on.What is being read aloud is unrestricted by theme or genre. The readings jump from excerpts of short stories published in Granta magazine to a five-star Google review of the 2007 Pixar film Ratatouille.Most of the people I speak to have“never been to something like this before but came across the event through social media or a writer’s Substack and decided to give it a try. Avid readers and amateur writers make up around half of those in attendance, but a significant portion of people tell me they are there purely because they like the idea of being considered literary.As the reading ends and we move from one local pub to the next, a young man drunkenly confesses that “he doesn’t even enjoy the readings that much” – he just comes to “meet the types of people whowouldenjoy it”.“It’s probably not for everyone,” Willis says. “It’s boring unless you’re really engaged in it. It’s free and open to everyone, but it does self-select. But that’s the scene – that’s why literature is so good for scene making.”View image in fullscreenA Waterwings live reading event, featuring artwork by Gabriella Day.Photograph: Eden Bø DowerIn Glasgow, a number of reading series such asthi wurdand Shrill have emerged in recent years.Waterwings Press, which has been hosting live reading events in the city’s south side since 2020, was set up by Leo Bussi, who moved to Glasgow wanting to discover its art scene and meet different people. “I thought the best way to do that is to message someone on Instagram and say, ‘Hey, do you want to read for my reading?’” he says.Each Waterwings event is made up of readings by five writers: some are seasoned performers, others are first-time readers. Contemporary poetry is the most represented genre alongside what Bussi loosely defines as “art writing” – a mixture of autofiction, art and literary criticism.“It’s like taking a piece of spaghetti and throwing it against the wall to see if it’ll stick,” he says. “There’s an improvisation to the evening, which can be incredibly stressful but also gratifying because when it works, it really works.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

If anything, these are spaces specifically curated to rail against it.View image in fullscreenEliza Clark reading at New Work at South Parade Gallery.Photograph: Isis O’ReganIn trade magazine the Bookseller’s2025 survey of publishing salaries, 73% of respondents said they were middle class and 86% that they were white. Because so many publishing staff members “come from the same background”, they “picture the reader as someone like them and people they know,” says Rachel Connolly, a writer and regular on the London live reading circuit.Connolly co-hosts a series calledNew Workalongside her friend and writer, Isis O’Regan, a dedicated space for fiction writers to litmus-test new, unpublished work with an audience. The series debuted last July; previous readers include authors Eliza Clark, Gabriel Smith and Nicole Flattery.“Our ideal reader is really good at writing, funny, sexy and a bit weird, a bit out there. In the digital age, writers probably know each other online from Twitter and Instagram, but it’s way nicer to come and meet people and listen to their work, hear their voice and actually put a body to the impression that you have of someone,” Connolly says.“But maybe people are also trying to get laid,” she adds, half jokingly.This seems to be a common theme – Willis often begins a Soho Reading Series event by jokily suggesting that audience members get with someone they find attractive – and is another reason that attending them feels more like going to a music gig than a literature fixture.“It’s meant to be enjoyable,” says poet and musician James Massiah, whose east London reading seriesAdult Entertainmentis all about “party poetry”. His nights typically begin with audiences sitting on the floor listening to performances by poets and rappers, before a DJ takes to the decks and the dancing begins.‘Reading is so sexy’: gen Z turns to physical books and librariesRead more“What do people like at parties? They like dancing, they like meeting someone they fancy, they like hearing some tunes and they like getting it on,” he says. “I want the writing to reflect that, and I want the mood to reflect that as well.”“Any live literature event is about bringing work into the world and sharing it with others,” agrees Joey Frances, a poet and organiser of the long-running reading seriesPeter Barlow’s Cigbased in Manchester, named after the chainsmoking character from Coronation Street.“You’re hearing one another, you’re feeding back from one another, you’re hanging out, you’re having fun.”Fun is the key to the success of these events, Massiah thinks. “It’s not a lecture. It’s like the spirit of dance or dub sound systems where people congregate for the music. It’s like that, but people are congregating for the words.”Explore more on these topicsBooksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The singer of Ordinary, the longest-running No 1 of the year, talks about his journey to breakout successTue 22 Apr 2025 11.21 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareAt 18, Alex Warren was homeless, sneaking into the gym of a gated community in his home town of Carlsbad, California, to shower for job interviews and filmTikTokvideos of himself singing in the bathroom. Six years later he is one of pop’s next potential superstars. His bombastic ballad Ordinary has been No 1 in the UK charts for five weeks, the longest-running chart leader this year, and entered the US Top 10 last week. As soon as he heard the finished version, he was “freaking out – my wife and I listened to it on repeat for our entire drive home, for 45 minutes.”Ordinary may be Warren’s breakout hit but he’s been famous for a long time. He gained notoriety on social media in his teens by making hugelypopular videoswith titles such as “BROTHER WAKES UP IN MIDDLE OF LAKE PRANK!” In 2019 he co-founded the Hype House, a shared house of content creators (including the D’Amelio sisters and Addison Rae) known for Covid-era internet videos, as well as at least one controversial facemask-free influencer party and, eventually, a $300,000 (£226,000) lawsuit – which Warren wasn’t named in – which alleged property damage and unpaid rent.I hated who I was becomingHe was also one of the stars of Netflix’s subsequentHype Houseshow, in which Warren goes to increasingly deranged lengths to film his prank videos, eventually staging a fake wedding with his now real wife, influencer, Kouvr Annon. He calls Hype House his “college experience: that’s what I did when I was 19. I wouldn’t be here without that time in my life.”Warren is speaking by video from Tennessee – an income-tax-free state, and therefore an increasingly popular influencer haven. One of Warren’s sisters lives nearby, and it felt like a spot where Annon could “feel safe” while he’s on tour. The chic new home he moved into last week – I spy vaulted ceilings and a large yard as he paces back and forth – matches his nice new life, miles removed literally and spiritually from the Hype House, and from his difficult youth.He is one of four children born to a “very successful” real estate father and a stay-at-home mother. He was raised Catholic, which he attributes to his father, who was diagnosed with terminal kidney cancer before Warren was born. “You tend to have a more religious standing” when you’re dying, Warren says, “because you know what’s coming”.Warren grew up listening to worship music – and arguably Christian-rock-adjacent acts such as Coldplay – which he says has been a strong influence on the music career he has pivoted to. He has “always loved a pop ballad”, but admits he’s no music nerd. “Everyone’s always asked me [what music] I know, and I’m like, ‘I have no idea who these people are and I wish I did.’ So I’ve been really trying to put myself out there and like other music. I’ve been listening to a lot of albums – that’s something I wasn’t doing before.” He cites the latest LP from Hozier, whose soulful vocal delivery is similar to Warren’s, and Charli xcx’s Brat. “I liked it a lot. I was like, ‘Wow, I’ve never listened to music like this before,’ from start to finish. It’s been interesting.”As Warren grew up, he began to question his faith. His father died when he was nine, leaving his mother with an immense amount of debt in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash. She descended into alcoholism and was unable to hold down a job. “She was a troubled person who didn’t have it all there in her head, and she suffered a lot her entire life,” he says. “We were on food stamps, and my mum lost everything my dad built for us.”Warren describes his mother as abusive as a result of her alcoholism. When he turned 18, she kicked him out, leaving him homeless and sleeping on the street or in cars – an experience he describes as “sick” in a positive sense. “I’m not gonna say it wasn’t,” he says. “I felt free – I think anyone who’s been in an abusive situation knows once you’re out of it, no matter the circumstance, it is the most freeing feeling in the world, knowing you don’t have to look over your shoulder and worry.”View image in fullscreen‘These songs are helping people’ … Warren.Photograph: Jimmy FontaineDuring this period Warren was introduced to Annon on Snapchat. She moved from her family home in Hawaii to Carlsbad to live with him, initially in his friend’s car. Warren began making money from social media videos, and later found his way back to the church. I ask how he feels about certain pranks that scan as particularly wasteful, or perhaps unchristian – such as the video in which he crushes Annon’s car, before surprising her with a new one.“There are things I did that I definitely cringe at,” he says. “But you also have to remember, I was a kid who was just previously homeless, coming out of an abusive household. I was just doing what I thought was the cool thing at the time. Yes, I’m not happy with who I was and what I did, but I had to do those things to appreciate who I am today.”Warren released his first original song,One More I Love You, in 2021, and started to move away from his comedy videos. “I love the vlogs, but I stopped vlogging because people would make jokes like, ‘Oh, Alex is going to film his wedding, Alex is going to film when he has a baby’, and I was like, ‘Why would I actually do that?’ Then I started thinking, ‘Oh, maybe I might.’ I hated who I was becoming.”But he did film his wedding – I refer to a clip he posted recently of Annon and him reciting their vows. “That’s like, my wedding video. That’s not, like, me vlogging it. Everyone films their wedding,” he says, scowling. And what about the music video you filmed at it? “I wrote that songformy wedding,” he says. Our conversation has become tense, and a publicist informs me our time is nearly up.For all that he has already endured in his life – his mother died in 2021 – there will be sceptics about Warren’s pivot from fame-obsessed prankster to God-fearing pop star. His manager Brian Sokolik works for a company that promises to empower content creators to “diversify their businesses and produce projects across music, merchandise, books, podcasts, television, touring and more”. Adam Yaron and Cal Shapiro, two of the songwriters who co-wrote much of Warren’s debut album You’ll Be Alright, Kid (Chapter One), mainly work with social media stars and TV singing competition contestants looking to move beyond cover versions.But Warren seems to be setting himself apart, at least in the sense that very few content creators have had a song as successful as Ordinary. He hopes his songs about love and grief can help his new fans through their own emotional struggles. “I’ve realised after playing live shows that these songs are helping people,” he says. “I think that’s important.”Explore more on these topicsPop and rockYouTubeTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But neither sore feet nor swarms of midges would stop the librarian and his scientist wife, Dee Johnson, from reaching their goal: the promise of pastries at theBakehousein the west coast fishing town of Mallaig, a 14-day trek plus two ferry hops away from their home near Montrose.View image in fullscreenDan Warren at the Bakehouse.Photograph: Dee JohnsonThe pair are so-called “bakery pilgrims”, travelling significant distances in the pursuit of a fine loaf or bun. “Some of the time we were pushing through overgrown tracks, and there were lots of bogs,” Warren says of their journey. But their eventual reward was a soft brioche bun, filled with crème pâtissière and finished with crumble and berries.I can relate. The siren call of the honey buns atPopty’r Dref bakeryin Dolgellau, Wales, drew my wife and me from Oxfordshire, nearly four hours away. We tagged on a hike up Mount Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), but it was really just a scenic spot to enjoy our bakery haul.A couple of weeks ago, my family and I also travelled an hour or so to sample the babkas and honey croissants atFarro bakeryin Bristol. Not long before that, it was a rhubarb-cardamom-brioche concoction atPobl bakeryin Talgarth Mill, near Hay-on-Wye. Both were well worth the journey.But it turns out we are amateurs among hardened bakery tourists. Professional cyclist Maddy Nutt often plans long-distance routes around the promise of a croissant or a pain au chocolat. “I’ll go out of my way to get to the best bakeries,” she says, recounting a recent five-hour endurance ride from London to Ramsgate’sStaple Stores. A puncture meant she arrived three minutes before it closed. She spent £3 on a charity shop rucksack and took home what remained of the bakery’s daily output.Long-distance bakery-seekers don’t mind a queue, and there is often a sense of camaraderie, with people who have travelled from far and wide swapping shop recommendations to pass the time. (The chewy almond thumbprint cookies atBriar Bakeryin Ashburton, Devon, are one suggestion.)In the UK, you rarely need to travel far to find a bakery. Greggs has more than 2,600 outlets. Gail’s, the chainassociated with high-street gentrification, now has 170 branches. A pack of two croissants from a Tesco bakery costs £1.75.View image in fullscreenRefreshing the window display at Long Boi’s Bakehouse in Levenshulme, Manchester.But it is the rarer treats that attract the bakery tourists. Usually, these are created by small operations, run by an owner-baker from a single site. Many pride themselves on using sustainable ingredients, such as flour sourced from regenerative farming. The pastries are often an upmarket twist on the classics, as is the case with a kimchi and egg danish atLong Boi’s Bakehousein Levenshulme, Manchester, and a spiral-shaped miso bacon escargot from London’sArôme.Journeying to a far-flung bakery obviously carries a carbon cost, but for many people this kind of travel has replaced other holidays or breaks they would have taken. There are plenty of social media influencers on the hunt for pretty pastries to gorge their feeds, but bakery wanderlust is bigger than that. In Korea, they have a word for the trend: “bbangjisullae” is a portmanteau of “bbang” meaning “bread” and “seongjisullae” meaning “pilgrimage”. Koreans, it seems, are increasingly prepared to travel to try the country’s best bakeries;some take overnight trainsfor fear of missing the morning’s limited supply.On a bright Saturday morning atBath bakery Landrace, pilgrims share the queue with local residents. “They all come for the cinnamon buns,” says manager Charlotte Briggs. At £4 apiece, these fragrant, springy coils have kept a spot on the counter since the shop opened in 2019.View image in fullscreen‘We’ve been out here when it’s -3C’ … Hetty Niblett (left) and Tomos Owens at Landrace, Bath.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianLycra-clad couple Tomos Owens and Hetty Niblett cycled nearly two hours to visit. “I just love croissants,” says Owens. “We’ve been out here in line when it has been -3C in winter.” The pair are trying as many spots as they can from the bookBritain’s Best Bakeries, which was published last year.Mother and daughter Chie and Karin Takita, from Ibaraki in Japan, included Landrace in their UK itinerary after Karin spotted its creations onInstagram. The pair came away with a newfound appreciation for hot cross buns – “So good!” – despite Chie’s previous impressions of “dry” British buns.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

Everyone thought I was mad. To me, it was worth it!” At Landrace, Burgess’s favourite is an Italian-style croissant, with a filling of cream blended with pistachios that are roasted in-house.BakeryTŷ Melin, which means “mill house” in Welsh, is the creation of Angharad Conway and partner Lance Gardner. They have four sites in south Wales, all of which bake their signature “croissant bomb” – a crispy outer filled with chocolate or hazelnut or salted caramel – which has become a social media sensation. “We have been overwhelmed … we have customers willing to travel so far to try our products. It makes the hours and effort that we put in worth it,” says Conway. Their bestseller, however, is their almond croissant; one customer travelled from Scotland to Cardiff just to get their hands on one, says Conway.View image in fullscreenLannan’s cherry tart with pistachio custard.Photograph: Darcie MaherBut there are few bakeries that have drawn more tourists thanLannan in Edinburgh. Since opening in Stockbridge in July 2023, the shop has developed a cult-like following. “People travel from all over the world. It’s mind-blowing for me,” says baker-patron Darcie Maher. “We just had someone who had come all the way from Canada to try the bakery. There was someone from New Zealand last year who booked their trip around coming to Lannan.”Maher cringes at any association with being a “viral bakery”, but she has become something of a star. Many bakery devotees are quick to reel off names of who owns which bakehouse, and where they worked previously.“I feel like I’ve been to Lannan just from seeing it on social media,” says Megan Hermes, who lives in Guildford, Surrey. She has yet to make the trip to Stockbridge, but she is happy to put in the miles for a good pastry. What started as a way for the local government worker to treat herself at the end of a 25km run has become a plan to criss-cross the country, combining bakery visits with weekends away. “I’m not into a beer crawl but I am up for a bakery crawl,” she says. That has sometimes meant queueing for the best part of an hour at sites such asLondon’s Toad bakery, home to a sought-after yuzu-orange jaffa cake.Bakeries can be pricey: at Landrace, the sausage roll will set you back £5. But these treats are obviously far cheaper than a restaurant meal, or some of the other experiences and events that people have tended to travel for in the past.View image in fullscreenScéal’s cardamom honey bun.Photograph: Scéal BakeryMilly Kenny-Ryder, author of Britain’s Best Bakeries, planned a trip to visit Dublin’sScéalwith her husband and child – only to realise after booking flights that it had moved outside the city. The extra train journey didn’t deter her. “It was torrential rain; we all turned up in soggy socks. But it was worth the visit” A long queue doesn’t faze her, either: she waited for more than an hour atEric’s, the London bakery whose recent creations include a lime and mascarpone mousse pastry.In February, Evie Clement from Somerset went to Paris to seek out the best bakeries, planningher trip around where to have breakfast,” she says. Stops includedLand&Monkeys,LeonieandCafé Nuances, where she tried an “amazing” pain suisse. In the UK, Clement has hopped on the bus with her brother, Guy, for the 40-minute journey to have baked goods atBristol’s East Village Cafe.Pastries are often an upmarket twist on the classics: a kimchi and egg danish, a miso bacon escargotFor bakers, renown can bring pressures. When Lannan first opened, says Maher, “we were busier than I expected. I was working 120 hours a week and sleeping on a foam mattress in the basement of the bakery.”Thankfully, Lannan has now grown from two to 10 bakers. There have been rumours that some of the most sought-after bakeries deliberately limit supply, creating an artificial scarcity to push up the hype factor – but this seems absurd to Maher, who has spoken aboutmaxing out the bakery’s oven capacity. Lannan is staffed seven days a week, despite only being open to customers Wednesday to Sunday.A willingness to follow the breadcrumbs far across the map often comes from an appreciation of just how difficult it is to achieve baked nirvana. Many bakery tourists are home cooks who appreciate the chasm between their banana bread and the intricate hazelnut and vanilla poached pear danish from London’sFortitude Bakehouseor the perfectly constructed rosemary and sea salt twists atMabel in Norfolk.Whether it’s on your street or halfway across the country, that moment when you step outside a bakery, open your brown paper bag and sample the goods inside is always a promising start to the day.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Being a half Palestinian, wholly homosexual freelance writer based in the US isn’t currently looking like the most stable situation. Either my livelihood is going to get obliterated by AI, or I’m getting shipped to a detention centre for thoughtcrimes and gender treachery. It’s anyone’s guess which comes first.Having mulled over the various directions my future could take (dog-cloning saleswoman, astronaut,head of sanitationfor the city of Philadelphia), I have finally decided what I want to be when I grow up. And I’m going to exclusively reveal the result in this column. I’m … going into politics!Once upon a time, the fact that I have zero experience in politics may have been an impediment. In a country run by a reality TV star turned convicted felon, however, the criteria for what qualifies one for office have drastically changed. The fact that I am a permanent resident rather than a US citizen would also normally pose a problem, but the beauty of Trumpworld is that all the silly old laws from the past are getting ripped up. Anything – even Republican congresswoman Arwa – is possible if you abandon your principles and play your cards right.And I intend to play my cards perfectly. I have done extensive research and devised a cunning plan for how to make it in modern American politics. Study it carefully and you too can be as successful as I am obviously going to be.1. Become a billionaire and buy yourself a roleAmbassadorships have, in effect, always beenpay-to-playin the US but, thanks to theself-proclaimed“GREATEST FRIEND THAT AMERICAN CAPITALISM HAS EVER HAD!”, the entire government is now for sale. You can seemingly buy yourself everything from anice little foreign policyto acabinet position. Never has democracy been so democratised: anyone with enough cash can participate. The only snag to this strategy is that I do not, in fact, have enough cash. Like many a feckless millennial I squandered all my “political influence” money on avocado toast.2. Become a billionaire’s special little boyIf you can’t become a billionaire yourself, find one you can sell your soul to: it’s what I call the JD Vance manoeuvre. The vice-president would still be writing about hillbillies were it not for tech billionairePeter Thiel’s mentorshipand piles of money.3. Achieve notoriety through whatever means possibleShould you be unable to locate a billionaire who wants to useyou as an avatarto advance theirdystopian accelerationist agenda, you will have to master the dark arts of the trollitician. John Fetterman (nominally a Democrat) and far-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene both seem to have advanced their careers by modelling themselves on internet trolls. Fetterman wanders around in basketball shorts,chumming it upwith accused war criminals, and praising Trump for his “God-tier level trolling”; Greenespreads conspiracy theoriesabout governments controlling the weather. Meanwhile, a Republican candidate for governor of California, clearly hoping to achieve name recognition through virality, has proposed that migrant women can stay in the country if they “marry one of our Californian incels”.4. Harness the potential of “A1” technologyDuring a recent panel discussion, former wrestling mogul turned education secretary Linda McMahon – who may or may not be in that position because she donated handsomely to Trump’s campaign – repeatedlyreferred to AI as A1. “Now let’s see A1 and how can that be helpful,” McMahon mused at one point. Food for thought.5. Share your top-secret plans inmultiplegroup chatsThe Trump administration, we keep being told, is themost transparent in history. If you want to get ahead, you’ll have to embrace that ethos. For more information, go find Pete “nobody’s texting war plans” Hegseth on Signal – he’ll fill you in on all the deets.Along with his brother, lawyer, wife, and some random dude he once met in a bar.6. Finally, sit back and watch your net worth riseGetting your foot in the door is the hard part. Once you’re in, the job’s a breeze: cancel allyour public eventsand ignore your constituents, stat. Like Marjorie Taylor Greene, focus onmaking extremely well-timed tradesin the stock market. If you bump into a pesky constituent, post a video of yourself ranting at them in the skincare aisle, asSouth Carolina congresswoman Nancy Mace just did. Most importantly, remember JFK’s famous quote: “Ask not what you can do for your country, but what your country can do for you.” That’s how it goes, right?Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsRepublicansDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

These weapons might at least keep staff and inmates safeAlex South is a former prison officerTue 22 Apr 2025 08.21 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareIt was a hot day in Texas when I visited in 2018. Hotter still inside the walls of the Eastham Unit, the men’s prison near Huntsville where I spent a few hours. My hands were sweaty enough as it was, as I focused my attention on the target board in front of me and practised firing rounds from a small silver pistol.The men and women with me were wardens at the Eastham Unit. “I wouldn’t do this job without a gun for no amount of money,” said one. These were experienced correctional officers who knew the Texas prison system well. And they were baffled that, as an English prison officer, I didn’t carry a gun. But I felt differently. There were plenty of things that I would have changed about our prison system, but introducing weapons wasn’t one of them.Afteran attack on three guardsat HMP Frankland, which left two of them seriously injured, the Prison Officers Association (POA)is demandingthat prison staff be equipped with electric stun guns. Instinctively, I object to this. To me, the suggestion seems at odds with what the UK is supposed to want from our prisons: the rehabilitation of the men and women inside. We want them to be released as better citizens, neighbours, colleagues. It’s hard to imagine how the use of stun guns would help to achieve that.I have spent a considerable chunk of my life in prisons; in high-security establishments,young offender institutionsand Victorian-era jails in the UK, and in mother and baby units in Melbourne and death row in Texas. My time as a prison officer taught me how to read a room, and how to use words, humour and compassion to navigate my way out of challenging situations. The idea of giving weapons to prison staff feels like a backwards step – and a scary one. The risk is obvious – if officers are given weapons, could prisoners get hold of them too? When I was an officer working in a category A men’s establishment, a particularly violent individual overwhelmed a team of four officers who had entered his cell with the intention of relocating him. Staff retreated from the cell, leaving behind the six-foot riot shield the prisoner had taken. Not an easy job for the next team sent in.Over the decade I spent in the job, I was involved in some serious violent incidents. I have seen weapons fashioned from toothbrushes, ironing boards and sharpened chicken bones. Apples adorned with razor blades and thrown at staff. But I haven’t been in the position of those three officers at Frankland. A man with a 55-year tariff and nothing to lose hasn’t come at me with cooking oil and an assortment of weapons. The prison landscape has changed now. Such incidents are not anomalies. Prison officersare assaulted almost hourly. The safety of both prisoners and officers must come first.That’s why, although I hate the idea in principle, I can see the sense in the POA’s proposals that designated response teams – not all officers – should carry stun guns. It’s a risk that has been taken on and managed by police forces, in which certain specially trained officers can use weapons. And it’s a risk that has become necessary in our seriously depleted prison system. The same week that staff at Frankland were assaulted, a prisoner at HMP Whitemoor wasarrested on suspicion of the murderof another inmate. We can’t rehabilitate prisoners who don’t feel safe to come out of their cells. Further, many prisoners face makeshift weapons, dilapidated buildings, a lack of staff, rats, sentences with no release dates andwaits of up to a yearto get mental health treatment. Our prisons are full of angry prisoners and exhausted, fed-up staff.Most officers already walk a difficult line. They must balance compassion with discipline, rules with grey areas and empathy with the word “no”. There is real skill involved – a strong relationship can be the thing that stops an argument from turning into violence or a bad day from becoming a person’s final day. The dynamic between officers and inmates is delicate, but powerful too. Adding a stun gun to an officer’s belt complicates that even further. And so, I don’t want stun guns to be allowed into prisons. But I also do not want to read that another of my former colleagues has been stabbed five times in the abdomen or had their face slashed. Physical injuries are one thing, but the psychological damage is impossible to measure.I say all this as someone who is out of the job now. As someone who had 10 years’ experience and all the lessons, interactions and insight that come with that length of time. Experienced staff count for a lot. As do positive relationships, a safe and hygienic environment, time out of cells and a decent, stimulating regime. The lack of those has made our prisons dangerous. Prison officers have already been stripped of their most effective tools. Maybe a stun gun is the next best thing.Alex South is a former prison officer and the author of the memoirBehind These DoorsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But getting rid of him would only invite more chaosTue 22 Apr 2025 12.16 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareUS stock markets, Treasury bonds and the dollar itself are sliding amid the tariff turmoil and Donald Trump needs a soft target. It was probably only a matter of time before heintensified his attacks on Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve. It is an easy narrative to blame the dull central banker with orthodox worries about anchoring inflation expectations. Nor is Powell able to engage in tit-for-tat soundbites. Unlike Trump, he must measure the impact on markets of his every word.The open question is how far Trump intends to push things. Monday’s reaction in financial markets was strong because it seemed for the first time that the presidentcould be serious about removal. “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” declared Trump, which was several notches beyond his usual whine about urging the Fed to hurry up with cuts in interest rates.Yet the first effect of firing Powell should be obvious. Financial markets would tank, possibly to the extent of making the current upset over tariffs look like a mild tantrum. You do not mess with central bank independence lightly – especially not in today’s circumstances. If loose monetary policy were thrown into an already unstable inflationary and tariff mix, the dollar would fall further, the flight from US assets would accelerate and long-term borrowing costs for the US would increase.Under a tame Fed chair Trump might get his desired immediate cut to interest rates, but only at the cost of wrecking confidence in US monetary policymaking further. Credibility would be gone. The real cost of long-term borrowing for businesses and consumers would rise.Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at the thinktank CapitalEconomics, takes a slightly more optimistic view that ditching Powell “might not end up being a full-blown disaster for the markets” if a“relatively-qualified replacement” could be swapped in immediately – candidate A being Kevin Warsh, who was on the Fed board of governors from 2006 to 2011. But Ashworth also makes the critical point that the saga would not end there.Warsh, or anybody else, would have only one vote on the policymaking committee, so could not guarantee to deliver what Trump wants. Indeed, the chair of the Fed board has to be confirmed as chair of the policymaking committee, so the other members might not play ball if they take their independence seriously.“At this point, Trump would be forced to go all-out and fire the rest of the Fed board too,” suggests Ashworth. “Sometimes it is not enough just to cross the Rubicon, you have to march on Rome too.” Cue mayhem in markets as Trump, presumably, would try to pack the Fed with a full line-up of poodles. “The Senate might still be willing to vote down overtly political picks, in an attempt to maintain some of the Fed’s credibility, triggering more chaos,” adds Ashworth.None of which means Trump won’t attempt such a manoeuvre, of course. But you’d think even he would conclude that throwing insults at Powell, whose term ends in May next year anyway, is simpler business than acting on them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So it goes forPope Francis, now lauded by leaders and media outlets that were complicit in the very evils he condemned. “Pope Francis was a pope for the poor, the downtrodden and the forgotten,” said Keir Starmer, a prime minister who stripped the winter fuel payment from many vulnerable pensioners before launching an assault on disability benefits predicted to driveup to 400,000 Britonsinto poverty. “He promoted … an end to … suffering across the globe,”wrote Joe Biden, enabler of Israel’s genocidal assault on Gaza.Indeed, the fate of Gaza seemed to preoccupy the pope’s final years. In hislast Easter address, he condemned the “death and destruction” and resulting “dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation” – a powerful sermon that hardly any western media outlets covered. Indeed, you will struggle to find much prominent coverage of any of his courageous statements on Gaza, such as: “This is not war. This is terrorism.” In hisfinal published piece,the pope reiterated his support for a Palestinian state, declaring: “Peace-making requires courage, much more so than warfare.”Starmer noted Pope Francis’s work with “Christians around the world facing war, famine, persecution and poverty”. He made no reference, however, to how the pope rang Gaza’s only Catholic church every day to offer solidarity and prayers – or how he rightly feared for a Christian community that faces erasure after having lived in Gaza for more than 1,600 years.Islamophobia has served a pivotal role in Palestinian life being stripped of any worth or meaning. But that dehumanisation also transcends religion, because there was little western outrage over the Israeli attack on Gaza’sSaint Porphyrius church, or the recent strike on the Anglicanal-Ahli Arab Baptist hospital, or the slaughter of many Christians, among them the elderlymother and her daughterwho were shot dead by an Israeli sniper in the Holy Family church on the eve of Christmas 2023. That was the church the pope rang each day;its school was attackedby the Israeli military last July.Britain was no idle bystander.The “death and destruction” deplored by the pope includes the bombs that rained down on Gaza from F-35 jets – and Britain supplies theircrucial components. In his final book, thepope noted: “According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide.” Yet the UK government refuses to describe a single Israeli obscenity as a “war crime” – recall when foreign secretary David Lammy wasreprimanded by No 10for simply stating that Israel had broken international law.The passing of public figures is invariably politicised in one of two ways. In cases like that of Margaret Thatcher, the death entrenches political divisions, and critics are treated as indecent and disrespectful if they draw attention to dire legacies. If the dead were respected figures who dissented from the status quo during their lifetimes, then they face instead having their views posthumously sanitised. That was the fate of Nelson Mandela, who famously declared: “We know too well thatour freedom is incompletewithout the freedom of the Palestinians.” Again, those who point to the authentic beliefs of the deceased risk being denounced as seeking to cause division at a time of grief.In a perverse way, there is something almost refreshing about the honesty of far-right US politician Marjorie Taylor Greene,who tweeted, in seeming reference to the pope: “Today there were major shifts in global leaderships. Evil is being defeated by the hand of God.” An astonishingly offensive thing to say. But how much more disrespectful is it than skirting around the substance of the pope’s beliefs and courageous stands, instead offering generalised platitudes?Political and religious leaders around the world pay tribute to Pope FrancisRead moreIndeed, this was why the pope’s role was so important. The west is in the grip of the most extreme assault on free speech since McCarthyism in the 1950s, with those who speak out against Israel’s genocide being deplatformed, threatened, sacked, expelled from universities, assaulted by police officers, arrested, imprisoned and now evenfacing deportationfrom countries including Germanyand the US. In this environment, Pope Francis was a remarkable exception to the rule – and you cannot cancel the pope. Instead, political and media elites have sought to airbrush his record in death as in life – another plank of a strategy of eradicating scrutiny and accountability for this crime of historic proportions.This was an unusual pope who denouncedunbridled capitalismand a “new colonialism”. Yet he was riddled with contradictions, offeringmore acceptancefor LGBTQ+ people than his predecessors while denouncing what he called “gender ideology” as the “ugliest danger” of our time. Popes, after all, are not democratically accountable: those of us who are non-believers hold that their selection is arbitrary rather than God’s will. Like any powerful figure without a democratic mandate, whether a pope is sympathetic to justice or otherwise is a matter of chance. And a benevolent pope does not negate the need for critiques of the Catholic church for, to take two examples, its treatment of child abuse and its opposition to contraception during the HIV/Aids pandemic in Africa.But what matters is this. If you believe a monumental crime is happening in front of our eyes, then you should expect anyone with power and influence to take a stand. Let history record that this pope took a stand against one of the great horrors of our time.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Congress must reject his planned cutsTue 22 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 14.35 EDTShareIt was entirely predictable thatDonald Trumpwould go after public media in America. Harming the reality-based press – in every form, whether public or private – is a central part of his playbook for controlling the political narrative as he moves the country toward an authoritarian model of government.For Trump, the message is all, and anything that gets in the way should be portrayed as an evil to society and stamped out.Like every would-be autocrat, Trump has an anti-media playbook. His includes disparaging journalists, calling them the enemy of the people, suing news organizations and tightly controlling access to newsmakers.All of that is well under way in the first three months of Trump 2.0, as is the effort to dismantle the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, which are funded by the federal government.Now, cue up the attack on National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System.“Radical left ‘monsters’,” as Trump characterized them in a social media post a few weeks ago.Then another shoe dropped. Last week,NPR itself reportedthat the Trump administration was drafting a memo to call for eliminating federal funds for public media.It reportedly involved a “rescission” – the blocking of more than $1bn that’s already been approved by Congress for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which administers the federal funding for public broadcasting. The memo, in theory, would give Congress 45 days to approve the cut or keep the funding.Though the funds have already won approval, Trump is fond of acting as though his every whim will become law. Hisrecord-setting barrage of executive ordersincludes many that are being challenged in federal lawsuits.This entire subject, of course, is political theater at its finest. Witness, for example, the president’s ever-loyal ally in Congress, the far-right Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has helped to lead the charge against public media.“You can hate us all on your own dime,” Greene insisted at a congressional hearing in late March. The facts belie the theatrics to a large extent. NPR receives only about 1% of its funding directly from the federal government; however, the many small “member stations” in communities throughout the country are much more dependent on federal money. The loss would be devastating for them – and for the public, which often has no other form of news in communities that, increasingly, are becoming “news deserts”.Congress should send Trump’s plan packing and continue to provide funding – not because NPR and its member stations are perfect, not because PBS always gets it right in its overall excellent NewsHour program that airs each evening, but because, on balance, they are a critical part of the fact-based news ecosystem necessary to democratic self-governance.That’s especially true at a time when media companies increasingly are owned by large corporations or by individual billionaires, all with their own financial agendas. Disney owns ABC News. Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post. Warner Bros owns CNN. Most local newspapers now are owned by big chains or by private equity companies. (The Guardian, thankfully, is different; it is owned by the Scott Trust, which operates like a non-profit, not a corporation.)Public funding – at least in theory – should provide some distance from corporate ownership by the rich and powerful.Should taxpayers really be paying for news? I think it’s reasonable – legitimate news is, after all, a key element of our democracy. And throughout western Europe, according to aPew Research study, public media is not only more dominant but much more trusted than private news organizations.NPR and its member stations do a lot that’s right. They correct their errors – a litmus test for legitimate news organizations. They also continue to have an ombudsman or public editor to serve as the readers’ representative and to consider complaints.When I interviewed NPR’s chief executive, Katherine Maher, on stage at TribFest last year in Austin, I asked if she would commit to keeping a public editor – unlike many news organizations, including the Times and the Washington Post, which have eliminated the role. She publicly pledged to do so for as long as she is in charge.NPR also boasts many excellent journalists, who are dedicated to the facts and to getting stories right. In my own area of specialization – journalism and the news industry – there’s no American media reporter I respect more than David Folkenflik, whose work is characterized by energetic, unbiased reporting and frequent scoops.I was not convinced by the over-the-top complaints of the former NPR business editor Uri Berliner, who railed last year against his longtime employer’s leftward drift. Neither was Erik Wemple of the Washington Post, who took a deep look at NPR’s reporting on Trump’s relationship with Russia, following Berliner’s broadside.Wemple’sapt conclusion: NPR is no hive of lefty ideologues, as Berliner would have it, but rather is a singular news organization, one “driven by old-fashioned journo-principles, an aversion to offending anyone, and a steady propensity to annoy listeners”.Imperfect, certainly. But just as certainly, important to the overall news ecosystem – and worthy of having Congress stand behind it, regardless of Trump’s bullying, now and in the future.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionNewspapersRadio industryNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

We’re going again this yearTue 22 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 10.03 EDTShareYouth might not be wasted on the young, but for the longest time I thought Interrailing was. When I was a student, as the 1980s became the 1990s, many of my friends took the opportunity to discoverEuropeby train and they all returned with amazing stories of discovery. But for long-forgotten reasons, it was something I was always going to do but never actually got round to. And then suddenly I was in my late 20s and reluctantly resigned myself to never doing it, having been reliably informed by so many people that it was an opportunity only open to those under the age of 26.Fast forward a few decades to spring 2023 and I’m trying to decide where to take my teenage children for our first holiday in five years – a gap caused largely, but not wholly, by the pandemic. My most memorable childhood holiday had come in 1981 when, over the course of a few days, my dad drove my family and our caravan from Nottingham to Pisa. I still remember the incredible feeling of my horizons broadening overnight. I’d love to give my children a similar experience, except I don’t drive.And then I start to see excitable posts from a Facebook friend about his family Interrail trip from Edinburgh to Slovenia and back. “But … but … he’s too old for that,” I thought to myself, before the penny belatedly dropped and I hastily checked out theInterrail(Eurail for non-European residents) website. And there,30 years late, I finally discovered the truth: theage restriction is long gone. And nobody had thought to tell me! People older than 26 can still go Interrailing! Yes, it’s marginally more expensive, but hardly prohibitively so. So I cobbled together an itinerary and a few weeks later my two sons and I set out on a voyage of discovery. It was such a success that we did it again (to different places) in summer 2024.In short, Interrailing was a revelation – for me and for my children. Any doubts I may have had about travel broadening the mind were quickly dispelled when, on the first day of our first trip, I saw my elder son’s sheer amazement at the way the departure boards on the metro in Brussels differed from those on London’s tube, or – a few days later – my younger son’s delight at seeingBerlin zoo’s giant pandas.View image in fullscreenPhil Mongredien’s elder son on a family Interrailing tripPhotograph: Phil MongredienThere were mishaps along the way: some homesickness in Vienna; a spectacular inability to read a weather forecast and then dress accordingly in Prague; a poorly child in Bergen necessitating a tour of the city’s chemists rather than a nearby national park. But more often, what initially seemed to be a major problem turned out to be an opportunity to discover fresh wonders.When I was too spontaneous with our travel plans for Deutsche Bahn’s liking and realised that I’d left it too late to book us on to the Hamburg-Kolding train, I was terrified that we might not get to Legoland Denmark, very much the jewel in the crown of my younger son’s trip. This would have been a dereliction of duty I feared might be unforgivable. But there was a slower, moresedate alternativeto the Hamburg-Copenhagen express – which proved to be an absolute delight, wending its way across the hypnotically flat Schleswig-Holstein countryside and necessitating briefly changing on to seemingly the world’s tiniest train in Tønder,Denmark’s answer to Gretna Green. It took us several hours longer, but seeing parts of northern Germany and western Denmark that were far off the beaten (railway) track felt like an adventure in itself.That ability to glimpse Europe’s more obscure spots is one of the massive advantages Interrailing has over air travel, where you’re whisked from one interchangeable airport to another, going from your home city to the tourist destination of your choice and skipping all that lies in between – the beautiful, the bleak, the places that understandably don’t appear in guidebooks, the messy thrill of actual real life – and seeing only the sanitised endpoints. And so, unlike air travel, where the transit element of a holiday is at best a soul-sapping chore in consumerism hell, the actual journeys were as much a part of the holiday as any of our destinations, whether we were on theOslo-Bergen line, which is habitually – and rightly – described asone of the most scenicin Europe, or theZutphen-Hengeloline in the eastern Netherlands, which is not, but did have the bonus of a garrulous passenger keen to know my children’s views on Brexit (they had many) and the state of Belgium’s roads (they had none). (For the record, he was a fan of neither.)That slower pace of travel brings other benefits, too: it’s hard to get a grip on how vast and varied Europe is when you can fly over it in the time it takes to digest an airport sandwich. By train it can take almost a full day just to cross Germany. That pace affords a greater connection with your surroundings. As a series of trains gradually took us north from Calais to Oslo last summer, we could watch as the architecture of churches and houses changed; as oak slowly gave way to beech to spruce to white birch; as cedillas on signs were replaced by umlauts and then overrings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yes, it is peculiar, you might even call it chilling, that you can now be ejected from America for not having sorted your accommodation before you arrived. The experience itself – handcuffs, strip-searches, body scans, prison uniforms, a night in a cell – sounds pretty harrowing. But at least they were only detained for one night. They could have been held for 12 days, like theCanadian actress Jasmine Mooney; or 16 days, likeLucas Sielaff, also German, who was driving from Mexico with his American fiancee, and says he still has nightmares about it.Marco Rubio has reassured the world that: “If you’re not coming to the United States to join a Hamas protest, or to come here and tell us about how right Hamas is, or … stir up conflict on our campuses and create riots in our streets and vandalise our universities, then you have nothing to worry about.” And in a funny sort of way, that is quite reassuring; because it makes travel to America a non-decision. Previously, you might have been on the horns of a dilemma. How authoritarian must a country become before it’s morally unacceptable to go there for leisure purposes? Is it bad enough that people are being lifted off the streets and deported to El Salvador with no due process? Or can you turn a blind eye and still go to Disneyland? Rubio’s statement makes it plain that the border authorities will have a problem with anyone who doesn’t like their politics, and even if you had no plans to vandalise anything, that pretty much makes the decision for you.As hard as I try to focus on what this means for the new world order, there’s a self-soothing voice going, “This is not the end of the world – because you know where else is really nice? Canada.” I mean, obviously don’t fly there if you’re not nearish already, but it’s got all the same vastness and majesty, plus you’ll be able to afford eggs.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionMarco RubioGermanyMexicoDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

In 2021, a decade after the movement swept across the region, it remained a flickering yet precious beacon of democracy when other nations had swiftly fallen into chaos or authoritarianism. Then President Kais Saied staged a self-coup andreversedmost of his country’s progress, dismantling institutions and snatching away his compatriots’ hard-won civil liberties.Following hisre-election last year– in a contest from which all significant oppositionhad been removed, and on a historically low turnout – he has redoubled his efforts. Civil society, business, the judiciary and the media as well as political opponents have all felt the pain, but it hasn’t stopped with them. Last year, officials from the Tunisian Swimming Federation were arrested forplotting against state securityover their failure to display the national flag at a competition.Human Rights Watch warned in anew reportlast week that arbitrary detention has become a cornerstone of the government’s repression, and that multiple detainees face the death penalty in cases relating to their public statements or political activities. It was published as a court sentencedopposition politicians, former officials and other prominent Tunisian figuresto up to 66 years in jail following a mass trial. The trumped-up conspiracy case (in which some defendants are still to be sentenced) includes charges such as plotting against the state and membership of a terrorist group. One of the many tried in absentia was theFrench intellectual Bernard-Henri Lévy, who was reportedly handed 33 years.The verdicts were never in much doubt. Mr Saied said in 2023 that the accused politicians were “traitors and terrorists” and that judges who acquitted them would be accomplices. The defendants included key figures from Ennahda, the largest opposition party; its co-founder, 83-year-old Rached Ghannouchi, wassentenced to 22 years in prisonin a separate case in February. As if to ram home the message of the conspiracy case, the leading defence lawyer Ahmed Souabwas arrestedafter calling proceedings a farce.Western democratic partners of Tunisia have been strikingly and shamefully muted as Mr Saied’s campaign of repression has unfolded. When ethnic violence and evictions followed hisxenophobic and cynical attackson undocumentedmigrantsfrom sub-Saharan Africa two years ago – blaming them for the country’s economic woes – relations remained cosy.For the European Union and the UK, the president’swillingness to control migrant flowshas mattered far more than his crushing of domestic democratic impulses. Earlier this month, the European Commission proposedincluding Tunisia on a new EU list of safe countries of origin– allowing member states to speed up processing of asylum claims from those countries on the basis that they are unlikely to be successful. The court verdicts last week are just another reminder of why they shouldn’t.Mr Saied’s paranoia underscores the truth that he is not invincible. The failure to match material progress to democratic advances fuelled his rise, but the country’s economic travails have deepened under him. There is reportedly growing discomfort about his rule in military and governmental circles. Nonetheless, there is immense personal risk in speaking out. That makes it all the more admirable that some Tunisians are still willing to do so. They should not be left to defend what little remains of their democratic dream alone.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

When the most sober of global institutions, the International Monetary Fund, abandons its usual technocratic calm to sound the alarm on the political roots of global financial instability, it’s time to pay attention. The IMF iswarningof a non-negligible risk of a $1tn hit to global output, as Donald Trump’s erratic “America first” agenda – part oligarchic enrichment scheme, part mobster shakedown – collides with a perfect storm ofglobal financial vulnerabilities.Such a shock would be equivalent to a third of that experienced in the 2008 crisis. But it would be felt in a much more fragile and politically charged environment. This time, the crisis stems not just from markets but from the politics at the heart of the dollar system. The IMF’s latestGlobal Financial Stability Reportsees the danger in Mr Trump’stradepolicies, especially his “liberation day” announcements, which have pushed up America’s effective tariff rate to the highest in over 100 years.The IMF put investors on notice that Trumpian volatility was taking place as US debt and equities – especially tech stocks – were overvalued. It cautions that hedge funds have made huge bets that have gone sour, requiring them to sell US treasuries for cash and potentially deepening the chaos in bond markets. Ominously, the IMF draws the comparison, first made by the analystNathan Tankus, with the “dash for cash” in March 2020 during Covid, when the Federal Reserve rescued US treasury markets directly. Developing nations, already grappling with the highest real borrowing costs in a decade, may now be forced to take on even more expensive debt – the IMFwarns– just to cushion the blow from Mr Trump’s new tariffs, risking a dreaded “sudden stop” in capital flows.At the heart of this chaos stands the US, the very country meant to uphold the global financial architecture. Just over a week ago,Adam Tooze of Columbia Universitywondered if markets had begun to “sell America” after US long-maturity bond prices fell precipitously. He thought that markets were no longer just responding to economic fundamentals but to politics as a systemic risk factor. In this case: Mr Trump’s tariff threats and his increasing political pressure on Fed’s chair,Jerome Powell. In essence, Prof Tooze gave us the theory; the IMF just confirmed the data.The US president’s continued attacks on the Fed chair over the weekend have only added to a flight from US equities, bonds and the dollar itself. The money is fleeing to safe havens such asgold. Some of the loss has beenclawedback, but at what cost? Investors aren’t just jittery about inflation or growth – they’re hedging against political chaos. That might explain the seemingly divergent IMF messaging: blunt systemic warnings in its report versus the soothing market-facingcommentsfrom a senior official at the fund’s press conference. This is central bank diplomacy. The institution is signalling that it is worried while trying not to spark a self-fulfilling panic in treasuries and the dollar.The real concern here is not technical dysfunction intreasury marketsor the mechanics of the Fed, which are the bedrock of the global financial system. It’s about the politicisation of the monetary-fiscal nexus under a Trumpian regime that is fundamentally hostile to the norms of liberal-democratic governance. When even the dollar is no longer a safe haven, what – or who – can be?Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I made the decision to transition one night, having left my home with no intention of ever returning. On that occasion I chose “do” rather than “die”.Fast forward a decade, and I now have a career in the NHS and a quiet life with travel, socialising and time in the gym being my interests. At the start of last week I was as happy as I’ve been in my adult life. Now, every one of those aspects is shrouded in uncertainty and worry. Will the gym still welcome me? When out with my friends, what do I do about toilets? When I travel, airport security is even more of a minefield than before.Then there is work. I found myself lying awake the night after the supreme court ruling wondering where in our department I’ll have to get changed. Where will I keep my things when the locker room is out of bounds? I’m dreading the day that an apologetic looking manager looks on while I clear my locker out before I get banished from a room I’ve used daily for the past nine years. A room I’ll continue to walk past, but I’m no longer a member of. It feels like no man’s land (painfully ironic). I’m not one thing, but legally not the other now either.Thinking back to the night I made my “do or die” decision, being trans was becoming more “normalised”, rights existed for our protection, and it seemed that the hostility towards our community that I had seen growing up was fading into history. I made my decision based on this information. I cannot honestly say I would have come to the same conclusion if I were making this decision today.Jessica WilliamsDereham, NorfolkGaby Hinsliff’s article (If Britain is now resetting the clock on trans rights, where will that leave us?, 18 April) mentioned that recent surveys show rising public hostility towards the trans community. Unsurprising. All sensible, two-way discussion of this topic has been prevented. If you stop people from saying what they think, it doesn’t mean that they stop thinking it – quite the contrary. Views become more deeply entrenched if they cannot be expressed, discussed and challenged.I suspect that most people didn’t previously have a strong opinion one way or the other, but years of having Stonewalls’s view of the world stuffed down their throats, with no possibility to challenge it in any way, on threat of life-destroying “cancellation”, death threats and hysterical screams of “you bigots can’t bear the fact that we exist!” have made them anti-trans.Stonewall has created this climate and, in doing so, has done trans people a disservice. I would have thought that the desired outcome would be for people to accept trans people on a day-to-day basis in normal life. That can’t be achieved by bullying and censorship. Get the topic out in the open and let everyone express their honest views, then these can be discussed properly, with counterarguments suggested, and a possibility of progress is created.Will that happen? Of course not. Stonewall will put all its energy into trying to get the court’s decision reversed and keeping the public forced to pick a side and too scared to express an opinion. And ordinary trans people will be more alienated from mainstream society than ever.Name and address suppliedGaby Hinsliff speaks a lot of sense, but I disagree with her implied view of the safety of changing rooms. Many women’s changing rooms are not like the “locked cubicle at the local lido”. They are open rooms with only a couple of lockable cubicles. Users are not just adult women but girls and children too. The appearance of a male-looking person in an open-style changing room would be very difficult for most women.In the 1990s, I used two public pools that changed their single-sex changing rooms with individual cubicles into unisex “changing villages”. Immediately a problem arose of holes being surreptitiously drilled into cubicle walls, until eventually it was hard to find one without a spyhole. Pool managers claimed they couldn’t do anything about it. This created a feeling of unease about whether there was a voyeur nearby and what else he might do. The problem is not trans women, it is male sex offenders.For this reason, although sympathetic to trans women, I feel arrangements for the safety and privacy of biological women, girls and children must not be overridden as they have been in recent years.Name and address suppliedGaby Hinsliff sounds a much-needed note of hope. I underwent full genital modification surgery 40 years ago. I have lived almost all my adult life going into female spaces without problems. It seems cruel that a point of law can erase my established identity. Nor is this without precedent. In 1970, Justice Ormrodreached similar conclusionson another point of law. The Gender Recognition Act was a belated attempt to remedy this.Talking only of rights and legal truths, we have forgotten the medical aim of the treatment. My generation needed to be diagnosed with a persistent and incurable mental disorder (primary transexualism) before surgery was offered. The aim of genital surgical modification was that, while a true sex change was beyond medical science, the removal of all functionality in our original sex would enable us to “pass” and achieve peace of mind, precisely by permitting access to some single-sex spaces without posing any threat. The court ruling talks of proportionality and shared biology, but while we may not completely share biology with our adopted sex, those who have undergone surgical processes no longer share biology with our natal sex either.It is true that not all trans people are the same, but lumping us all together as a “threat” is a simplistic view of proportionality, and nullifies the point of arduous and painful medical treatment.We may not truly change sex, but many have made major biological changes and the law should recognise that. As Gaby says, if this judgment results in a more nuanced approach, it will do good. But the Equality and Human Rights Commission appears to be ignoring the needs of those who have undergone irreversible surgery. Please can we try to return to a mutually workable accommodation.Jenny DayGlasgowIn your report (Court ruling on ‘woman’ at odds with UK Equality Act aim, says ex-civil servant, 18 April), Melanie Field is quoted as saying that it is not for her to say that the supreme court has got it wrong. But that is clearly what she is doing.If sex was meant to have a different meaning, those involved in the drafting should have made it clear that they intended to rewrite the English language and the biologically accepted interpretation. As to how Field knows the intentions of parliamentarians, that’s an entirely different question. The fact that there appears to have been some ambiguity for all these years does not mean the matter should not finally have been cleared up. This appears to be another case of laws being passed without the scrutiny they should have been given.Simon Lauris HudsonPontefract, West YorkshireExplore more on these topicsUK supreme courtTransgenderWomenGenderEquality Act 2010lettersShareReuse this content"

When I registered my firstborn, I refused to say whether I was married and insisted my partner’s name also go on the certificate. The registrar, horrified, told me: “But then your child will be registered as illegitimate!” I had to point out to her that illegitimacy had not been a legal category for some time. But I didn’t tell her that I’d been born in a mother-and-baby home. I found her words ridiculous, but they could as easily have been an unnecessary (and inaccurate) cruelty.Naomi StandenBirminghamAs the 1 May local elections near, Nigel Farage’s campaign is featured in every media outlet.

But we are the daredevils of sport’Donald McRaeBritish boxer discusses the horrors of making weight and strained relations with his dad before Saturday’s grudge match with Conor BennTue 22 Apr 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareChris Eubank Jr sits in his hotel room, locked in the extremes of a savage weight cut. Boiling down in weight gets even harder at the age of 35 but the words still flow freely. Eubank Jr can produce intelligent insights as easily as he churns out typical bombast and so he has no difficulty in explaining why his fight on Saturday night with Conor Benn will darken the British sporting landscape this week.They were first meant to fight in October 2022, when a manufactured scrap was built on the enmity between their fathers, Chris Eubank Sr and Nigel Benn, in the 1990s. Separated by two weight divisions, the sons were brought together in a dubious catchweight contest while banging on about family feuds and legacies.Those lucrative plans were ruined when Benntested positive for clomifeneon two separate occasions. Despite embarrassing attempts to proceed with the boutit was eventually cancelledon the Thursday of fight week.Two and a half years on, they will walk to the ring at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium rather than at the original venue of the O2. Eubank Jr calmly outlines why they need space for three times as many spectators: “For better or worse, controversy, drama and scandal sells. This is what this fight has been bathed in over the last few years. People are invested in not only the story of our fathers having two of the best British bouts of all time more than 30 years ago. They’re invested in the story of me and Conor because it’s now and it’s real.“The first fight we were fighting for our fathers and our family name. Now it’s about all the things that have gone on between me and Conor. That beef has captured the imagination and we’re going to fill a 62,000-person stadium.”There was never much grace between their fathers but the sons have reached new lows. Benn has refused for more than two years to share “scientific” information which he says clears him of intentionally taking clomifene. Meanwhile, theWBC suggested that clomifene appeared twicein Benn’s system because he ate too many eggs – but the boxer himself refused to accept the findings of the sanctioning body and stressed that egg consumption was not the reason. At a recent press conference, Eubank Jr smashed an egg against Benn.“The egg was meant to embarrass him,” Eubank Jr tells me. “It was meant to make an example of him. It was meant to make sure that his cheating will never be forgotten. There are so many active fighters that have been caught cheating and are now still fighting and no one says anything about it. I couldn’t let that be the case with this man. I needed to make sure I did something so he would be remembered for ever as the cheat that he is and he would never be able to play it down – which is what they were trying to do. ‘Oh, he’s cleared, he spent £1m on proving his innocence.’ No. He was cleared to fight. But cleared of having performance-enhancing drugs in his system? That’s very different. Conor is not cleared of being a cheat.”View image in fullscreenChris Eubank Jr strikes Conor Benn with an egg during a press conference at Manchester Central.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAIn his two fights before the drugs controversy, Benn looked sensational when stopping seasoned but essentially washed-up veterans in Chris Algieri and Chris van Heerden. In his subsequent bouts Benn has looked distinctly average during a couple of unimpressive points victories against obscure opponents.“There’s nothing to be suspicious of,” Eubank Jr says. “The facts are that the drugs were found in his system. Eddie Hearn, naturally, tried to cover it up andmake the fight go ahead. They knew the whole time that he’d failed these two drug tests. So there are no suspicions. He is a cheat.”Benn has always insisted on his innocence andthe WBC reportsaid there was no conclusive evidence that he had “engaged in intentional or knowing ingestion” of clomifene. He has also never failed a UK Anti-Doping test. But his positive results emerged in two Voluntary Anti-Doping Association tests. How often have Vada and Ukad testers visited Eubank Jr in the buildup to this fight? “Every week. Getting woken up at 6am, 7am, urine tests, blood tests, it’s been relentless. But that’s what happens when such a huge fight is mired with scandal and drug cheating. You have to deal with that.”WhenI last interviewed Eubank Jrin 2023 he said: “[Benn’s] done wrong by me. So he’s lost all his privileges and bartering power. There are no weight clauses now. There are no rehydration limits.”That quote came in reference to the fact that, the previous year, they had agreed to weigh in at 157lb and Eubank would scale no more than an additional seven pounds on the morning of the fight. Logic suggests that Benn, as a welterweight who usually weighs 147lb, would be at a gross disadvantage in fighting a bigger man who is at his best in the 168lb super-middleweight division. But the rehydration clause is dangerous and prevents a fighter from fully recovering and taking on enough food and water to protect himself from fatigue and the threat of brain damage.View image in fullscreenChris Eubank Jr lands a punch on Liam Smith during his victory in September 2023.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAEven though the 2022 fight had been cancelled, Eubank Jr still made weight on the scheduled day to prove a point.Photographs of his emaciated framewere disturbing and the dangers remain despite Friday’s weigh-in carrying a 160lb limit with Eubank allowed to add 10 pounds, about half of what he usually gains, on Saturday morning.“They are paying me a separate fee to restrict my weight gain and rehydration,” Eubank says. “I was never going to do it for free.”Benn has since claimed that Eubank Jr’s team mentioned the rehydration clause first. Eubank Jr dismisses this. “Why would I think: ‘Let me make this harder on myself and restrict my weight gain after a weigh-in for no reason?’”He remembers that “another thing happened between me and Conor. We hadn’t been face to face for a long time. He chose to grow some balls and push me on the day that I was cutting weight for my previous fight [last October in Saudi Arabia]. He knew I was very weak and, because I’m boxing the next day, I’m not about to get in a fight with him. That shows you the character of Benn and Hearn, who was right next to him.”Eubank Jr initially rejects concerns about the weight cut. “I’ve been doing this for so many years and know my body. It can be horrific but it’s part of what fighters sign up for. If we’re going to make all this money, you have to make sacrifices. One of those sacrifices is starving yourself, dehydrating yourself, pulling yourself down to an extremely uncomfortable weight.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am a man that enjoys a challenge, even a dangerous oneI recently interviewed Peter Hamlyn, the neurosurgeon who operated seven times on Michael Watson after his fight with Eubank Sr in 1991. Watson is still severely damaged and Hamlyn was shocked when I outlined the rehydration stipulations for Saturday.Eubank Jr listens quietly as I read these words from Hamlyn: “Unless you’re fit, which includes being properly hydrated, you shouldn’t be boxing. And if you’ve engineered a situation where somebody isn’t fully fit, it’s not a sensible idea. A boxer is at maximum risk when they’re fatigued … and not able to defend themselves.”He pauses before replying: “I understand and accept the risks. I am a man that enjoys a challenge, even a dangerous one. I believe my skills are far superior to Conor’s, so I can give myself the disadvantage of restricting my rehydration. But the doctor you spoke to is absolutely right. I probably shouldn’t be doing it. But we are the daredevils of sport. We do things that we shouldn’t do. This is not a normal life we are living, punching each other as hard as we can in the head and body. But it’s what we love, it’s what we train for as professionals, and I am very confident.”What happens if Eubank Jr decides not to adhere to the rehydration clause? “I can change my mind at any time but it will cost me a substantial amount of money. I don’t want to lose $1m so I’m pretty sure I’m going to stick to it.”He has lost the support of his father, who hascastigated Eubank Jr as “a disgrace”and for risking his health. The boxer believes his relationship with his dad will only heal once he retires from the ring. “Unfortunately, that looks like the case. But maybe after I prove what I’m capable of against Benn it will be enough to win him over. I have no idea.”When did they last talk? “We met briefly at my cousin Harlem Eubank’s fight [six weeks ago]. There were some ups, some downs. But since then we’ve had no communication and he’s obviously spoken out about how he is against this fight and wants to stop it. So it looks like I’ll be on my own on the night.”View image in fullscreenChris Eubank Sr (right) and Nigel Benn engaged in two memorable fights in 1990 (pictured) and 1993.Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/AlamyDoes Eubank Jr understand why his dad is so emotional? “No. There’s nothing that can really justify his views. He should be with me. But he has his issues and I’ve got to accept it. I can’t let anything get in the way of completing the mission.”Eubank Jr softens when he remembers his brother, Sebastian, who suffereda heart attack and drownedin 2021, and the son he left behind. “When I’m in the UAE I spend a lot of time with Raheem,” he says of his nephew. “He comes and stays with me. I take him to the park and the mall and we go roller‑skating and swimming. He is a very special human being and gives me a happiness I’ve never really experienced before.”He first met Raheem at Seb’s graveside. “We were in the desert and the cemeteries in the Middle East are not like the UK. In the Muslim community everybody is equal and the graves are very close together and they’re just buried in the sand. So it was a very shocking place and, at the grave, Raheem’s mother passed him to me. He couldn’t have been more than six months old but he looked just like my brother. I held him and he was completely silent the whole time. In the despair and horror he gave me such calm. It made me think: ‘We’ve lost my brother but we’ve got a second chance with this young boy in my arms.’”Eubank Jr speaks more about Raheem in moving ways but we cannot shake the week that lies ahead. “The business side of boxing is despicable,” he stresses, “but the sport is noble.”That’s often true and so I ask a simple question. Does he think that Benn believes he will win? “Sure. He’s undefeated. He doesn’t know how to lose yet. I remember being undefeated and thinking I’d never lose. He has that mindset that he can go out there and slug me. He thinks I’m old and washed up. Oh, he’s made a mistake thinking that.”Eubank Jr makes one last emphatic statement: “I’ve said before that if I can’t beat Conor Benn, I’ll retire. So I’ve got to do everything I can to win, because I do not want to retire. I love boxing. I love the sport. So this is a deathly important fight for me.”Explore more on these topicsBoxinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

ForManchester City, Pep Guardiola showed sheer delight at a late, late victory that lifts them to third on 61 points, four ahead of Chelsea in sixth. Across from him, Unai Emery felt despair as Aston Villa were down in seventh, the Spaniard’s next job to lift his men for their FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace on Saturday.Nunes’s far-post strike from Jérémy Doku’s cross from the left also disappointed Nottingham Forest, Newcastle United and Chelsea in the race for the top-five berth that secures a Champions League place.‘So important’: Pep Guardiola delight after last-gasp strike stuns Aston VillaRead moreUntil Nunes’s intervention, Marcus Rashford, chosen at No 9 by Emery, was the star turn, scoring Villa’s goal – from the spot – as he menaced City’s backline until his removal on 75 minutes: 17 seconds were all the 27‑year‑old forward needed to splay City. The champions’ midfield slumbered, Youri Tielemans made a mug of Josko Gvardiol and found Rashford, who twisted Rúben Dias’s blood and shot: the ball bounced from the base of Stefan Ortega’s left post and the game remained scoreless.Not for long. City have lacked speed this term, in thought and execution, and this was precisely how Omar Marmoush undid the visitors. The Egyptian swooped around Matty Cash and fired in a cross from the left that deflected into Bernardo Silva; the Portuguese unloaded and a weak Emiliano Martínez parry only pushed the ball in.For his United connection Rashford was booed each time he collected so, when roaring along the left in the move that led to the penalty, he could chuckle. The ball came to Jacob Ramsey, Dias barged him over, and Craig Pawson initially refused the spot-kick. It seemed obvious so there was scant surprise when the VAR, John Brooks, ordered the referee to the monitor. To Guardiola’s fury Pawson gave the penalty and Rashford, via a slow boot-shuffle, fooled Ortega and rolled the ball in, to the goalkeeper’s left, and his delight.View image in fullscreenEmiliano Martínez is beaten by David Silva’s shot as Manchester City take an early lead.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersFor the rage directed at the assistant referee, Guardiola was booked – provoking disgust – his anger having ratcheted up when the incident was replayed on the stadium screen before Rashford’s penalty. So, we had a contest that bubbled. An on‑loan United man had registered the equaliser, City felt swindled (wrongly), and Pawson fielded jeers each time he failed to give them what they wished: basically, every decision.Martínez’s self-proclaimed “all powerful” on-field persona nearly took another battering moments later. A poor clearance from the Argentinian went straight to Silva, who headed it back into the area for Marmoush to take aim. But rushing out, Villa’s No 1 smothered the ball, so he and Villa escaped.Rashford, in for Ollie Watkins as one of five Emery changes, was near unplayable. Lucas Digne was found on the left, the Villa No 9 fashioned a curving sprint that kept him onside, shredded City’s rearguard and took him in behind. What ensued was a clumsy touch – a Rashford achilles heel – and an attempted dink above the advancing Ortega that was fluffed – his finishing another weakness.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Guardiola’s two changes were James McAtee and Mateo Kovacic for Savinho and Nico González but at the close of an invigorating period it was Rashford, again, who was the key factor among the fresh personnel. Ignoring more derision from fans, he arrowed in a corner from the left at which Amadou Onana rose and headed and would have given Villa the lead but for a block.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Villa forward went down under Josko Gvardiol’s attentions, but Pawson was not interested. On show was a bout between two foes who parried, jabbed and counterpunched and City did the latter, launching a raid that claimed a free-kick that pushed Villa back.McAtee’s delivery, from an inside‑left channel, was scrambled out by Onana for a corner and City had three in succession: one from the right, the others from the left, all taken by Kevin De Bruyne, all failing to breach Villa.Guardiola spoke of McAtee, who was City’s nominal No 9, having special qualities required for this game. When De Bruyne passed to him and he took aim, here was a chance to show finishing – but, while the lob over Martinez was audacious, it flew wide to the keeper’s left. The Catalan puffed his cheeks, the crowd “oohed” and, soon, Rashford caused a similar reaction when barrelling in and rounding Ortega, the effort, from an angle on the right, missing.In City’s last home match McAtee scored – against Crystal Palace – while spurning several chances and a further miss when Nico O’Reilly delivered from the left again suggested he may not be as lethal as required. Towards the end Marmoush put the ball in the net but was rightly ruled offside. Next came Nunes’s priceless moment of glory.“I am overall proud of everything we are doing,” Emery said.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

After internal discussions this morning, it turns out that it was our goalkeeper Vic Chambaere who kicked the ball on to the pitch,” said a statement. “This is an action that Union strongly disapproves of and which does not reflect our values or those of our supporters. Union will always fight to the bitter end on the pitch, but above all, we advocate respect and fair play, both on and off the pitch.“This morning, our management spoke with our technical staff and player Vic Chambaere. We also wish to apologise to the match referee and our opponent on Sunday afternoon for throwing the ball onto the pitch in the final minutes of the match.”The result allowed Club Brugge to move top of the standings with a two-point advantage to set up a close three-way contest for the title with four rounds of matches left. The 22-year-old Chambaere, who joined from Genk at the start of the season, was handed a four-match ban and fined €5,000 (£4,300) at a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday while Fadili was given a two-match ban for “misleading the referee” and fined €2,500.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballLa LigaBarcelonaMallorcaValenciaEspanyolLigue 1newsShareReuse this content"

They are at their best when they are playing and they have consistency in their performances.”A fixture rearranged because of Palace’s presence in the weekend’s FA Cup semi-finals hands Arteta five days to get ready for the first leg at home to Paris Saint-Germain, in pursuit of the club’s first European Cup. “It gives us more time to prepare for the game,” Arteta said. “Very unusual but we take it. We’re very short in numbers at the moment. That little break will be good for us.”Arsenal, on course to come second for the third season in succession but unable to maintain a sustained title challenge, have found Europe a welcome balm, though Arteta stands by his belief that injuries and ill fortune have affected this season’s domestic campaign. He said: “We are very clear about how we are doing in thePremier Leaguewith everything that happened. So I don’t think we have to make up for anything.” If Arsenal lose at home to Palace, Liverpool will be champions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s in his nature. That is something we can’t coach or take credit for. That’s him. He is really calm, very rational, very intelligent in the way he manages his emotions.”Arteta will tailor his preparations for next week’s PSG game according to what he senses. “If they need more tension, less tension, be more emotional, more tactical, we will try to manage to get the levels in the right way to be as prepared as possible and ready to win.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalChampions LeaguePremier LeagueCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

However, Carter dug deep after O’Sullivan missed a long red to the top corner in the final frame of the day, gradually reeling in a 51-point deficit and nervelessly clearing the colours to cut his deficit to 5-4.John Higgins fights through emotional turmoil to ignite Crucible challengeRead moreBefore Carter’s impressive recovery, respective breaks of 107 from both men had proved the highlights of an error-strewn affair. The sluggish display on the table was mirrored by relative serenity off it as the pair, who have engaged in a long-running and highly publicised feud over the course of their respective careers, shared a warm handshake before the opening frame.O’Sullivan and Carter barged shoulders during Carter’s 13-9 win in the second round in 2018 and recriminations flewafter O’Sullivan’s Masters final winlast year, with Carter accusing his rival of “snotting” all over the floor and O’Sullivan responding by saying Carter should “get a life”.After sharing the first two frames on Tuesday, O’Sullivan took the third when Carter failed to punish him for leaving a red dangling over the pocket – O’Sullivan’s subsequent century then put him in command at 3-1.Carter once again reduced the deficit but missed the simplest of straight reds on a break of 60 in the sixth and allowed O’Sullivan to clear up and regain his two-frame lead.For all his evident rustiness, O’Sullivan was clearly still capable of keeping a misfiring Carter at bay and a knock of 85 in the next sent him three frames clear. However, Carter responded with a 107 of his own then seized his chance in the final frame of the day with a fine clearance.“I didn’t really expect much today,” O’Sullivan told TNT Sports. “I thought if I could get a few frames off Ali and make it a little bit competitive, I’d be happy with that.”View image in fullscreenJudd Trump plays a shot during his first-round match against Zhou Yuelong.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAAsked about some wayward shots, he said: “I’ve had four years of it to be honest with you, hitting the ball all over the place. I’ve just got to try and tried to stay in the moment and play my way through it.”Judd Trump made steady progress towards the second round after establishing a 6-3 overnight lead against China’s Zhou Yuelong. The world No 1, still anxious to add to hissolitary 2019 title, threatened to overwhelm his opponent as he fired a break of 117 en route to a 5-1 lead.But the 35-year-old was dragged into a more attritional affair later in the session and Zhou was rewarded for an attacking start to the last frame with a break of 95 to give him a glimmer of hope ahead of Wednesday night’s conclusion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ding, the 2016 finalist, had threatened to blow a rattled Surety off the table in Monday’s opening session, winning the first four frames and probably counting himself unfortunate to lead only 6-2 overnight.It was a different story on Tuesday as Surety reeled off four centuries in the opening five frames to become the first player to hit four hundreds on his Crucible debut. That helped him to narrow the deficit to 7-6 and then 8-7 before the Chinese player’s experience told and consecutive breaks of 116 and 75 took him through.Ding’s compatriot Si Jiahui, a surprise semi-finalist two years ago, repelled back-to-back centuries from David Gilbert to turn a 6-3 overnight lead into a 10-6 win.Shaun Murphy made a strong start to his attempt to win a second world title 20 years after his first as some heavy scoring secured a commanding 7-2 lead against Daniel Wells. Murphy and the debutant Wells each made two centuries in a high-quality session but a run of four frames in a row proved the difference as the Masters champion flexed his muscles.Zhang Anda leads his Chinese compatriot Pang Junxu 5-3 after winning the final two frames of their opening session.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipRonnie O'SullivanSnookerJudd TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Farke is a little too unconventional, a little too resistant to groupthink, to always do the expected and his club’s owner, the San Francisco‑based 49ers Enterprises, is poised to reap the benefits.The German’s unusual amalgam of high emotional intelligence and advanced numeracy have helped to provide the framework for the freshly secured promotion to the Premier League that Leeds so narrowly missed out on last May.Burnley rise again but will Parker’s battlers buck trend of recent history? | Will UnwinRead moreAs the stars of that campaign – Crysencio Summerville, Archie Gray and Georginio Rutter – departed and Elland Road regulars despaired, Farke held his nerve. With English football’s spending rules complied with, the manager reconstructed a slimmed-down squad in a manner befitting his former roles as an economics student and the sporting director of the German club Lippstadt.In, among others, came Ao Tanaka for £3.5m from Fortuna Düsseldorf, Jayden Bogle for £5m from Sheffield United and the Tottenham loanee Manor Solomon. While Japan’s Tanaka proved one of the second tier’s best anchoring midfielders, Bogle shone as an increasingly outstanding attacking right‑back and Israel’s Solomon impressed on the left wing.Farke had never really wanted to be a coach. As a third-tier player in Germany he studied economics and became more interested in contracts, taxes and balance sheets than tactics. His dream was to remain in football as a sporting director and it came true at Lippstadt, where he oversaw the construction of a new stadium.Fate intervened when Farke, temporarily combining that job with training the team, secured nine wins in 10 games. An offer to coach Borussia Dortmund’s second string scuppered a subsequent plan to take a sabbatical travelling the world, and the experience of working alongside his friend Thomas Tuchel, then Dortmund’s first-team manager, helped to persuade him he was not too shabby at tactics after all.Three promotions from theChampionship, the first two with Norwich, have ensued, the most recent showcasing the 48‑year‑old’s ability to create a Leeds side arguably exceeding the sum of its parts. If Tanaka, Bogle and, should he stay, Solomon have the ability to hold their own in the top tier, so too do the Welsh trio Ethan Ampadu (Farke’s excellent captain), Joe Rodon and Daniel James.View image in fullscreenKarl Darlow has been first choice for Leeds during the run-in but Daniel Farke has also shown a lot of trust in Illan Meslier.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThis time last year Farke said his team would have been promoted had Patrick Bamford stayed fit but 12 months later the Championship has been escaped despite an injury‑plagued Bamford kicking far fewer balls than his manager would have liked. Much of that is down to Joël Piroe’s 19 goals but the limitations of Piroe’s all-round game dictate that a centre‑forward – along with a No 10 and, quite possibly, a goalkeeper – seems to be a transfer priority.If Bamford undoubtedly retains the quality to excel at Premier League level his fitness record leaves question marks, and Illan Meslier’s goalkeeping talent has been undermined by a creeping susceptibility to making mistakes under pressure, particularly at set plays. Meslier is far too gifted – his footwork is top-drawer – for the Frenchman’s career to be written off but he quite possibly needs a change of scene. Farke, bravely, replaced Meslier with Karl Darlow during the run-in but, although the former Newcastle No 2 proved solidity personified, the manager’s long-running persistence with Meslier suggests he may not quite trust Darlow at the highest level.As Leeds enjoy the moment, such decisions remain for the future. “Don’t stress me with the Premier League right now,” Farke said after confirmation of his team’s promotionon Monday night. “We want to become an established Premier League side but lots of work, lots of ambition, is needed.”It perhaps does not help that Elland Road’s much-admired chief executive, Angus Kinnear, is leaving for Everton this summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That latter figure is relatively modest by Premier League standards, dictating that staying within profitability and sustainability rules will remain an issue next season.“The domestic transfer market’s overpriced,” Farke said recently. “That means we have to be creative and think outside the box; we’re increasingly looking outside Europe.”Matters are complicated further by the need for 49ers Enterprises to invest significant funds in updating and expanding an outdated Elland Road, with a formal planning application due for imminent submission to the city council.It appears Farke may soon need to draw heavily on the emotional balance and original thinking that shine through during his invariably sure-footed yet always interesting media addresses. Club officials say his dressing-room persona is little different but it will be intriguing to see whether a manager uncomfortably aware that last season’s cohort of promoted clubs are coming straight back down will take into account the height and physique of new signings.If a possession-dominant, technically accomplished Leeds are, by common consensus, the Championship’s best side, they are comparatively diminutive. At a time when athleticism and physicality are increasingly prized top-flight attributes, that matters.“In the past 21 years this club has spent only three seasons in the Premier League but that’s where Leeds belongs,” Farke said. “My job was to get us there – now it’s keeping us there.”Explore more on these topicsLeeds UnitedChampionshipanalysisShareReuse this content"

Biles will be 31 when the LA Olympics start: theoldest all-around female gymnastics championis Maria Gorokhovskaya, who won gold at the age of 30 at the 1952 Games.“I’m really trying to enjoy life, to spend time with my husband [NFL player Jonathan Owens)], go support him at his games, live my life as a woman,” she said in an interview with French sports daily L’Equipe published on Tuesday. “I’ve accomplished so much in my sport. For me to come back, it would really have to excite me.”Simone Biles’ coach says gymnast suffered from ‘twisties’ before 2016 OlympicsRead moreBiles, the most decorated gymnast of all time, says many fans underestimate the time taken in preparing for the Olympics. “A lot of people think it’s just a one-year commitment but it truly is the four years leading up to the Olympics,” she said. “It’s in LA it’s back in the States, which is so exciting. But if I’m going to compete again, I’m not so sure.”Biles said she will attend the Games in LA, but is unsure in what capacity. “Whether on the [gymnastics] apparatus or in the stands, I still don’t know that,” she told L’Equipe. “But 2028 seems so far away, and my body is aging. I felt it in Paris.”Biles won three gold medals and a silver at the Paris Olympics, taking her career tally to seven Olympic golds and 11 medals overall. But she says her body suffered under the strain.“I went back to the [Olympic] village, I took the elevator and my body literally collapsed. I was sick for 10 days,” she said, before recounting another experience. “The other day, we were sprinting in the garden with friends, I had aches and pains for three days. So, I honestly don’t know. We’ll see.”She praised her rival, Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, for recovering from injury and for “pushing me beyond my limits,” but also said gymnastics no longer needs both of them.“It only needs one of us, no? Especially since [Andrade] will not be alone,” Biles said. “A young generation will knock at the door and everything will start again.”The interview took place before Monday’s Laureus Awards in Madrid, where Biles was named sportswoman of the year. Swedish pole vaulter Armand Duplantis, the double Olympic champion and world record holder, was named sportsman of the year.Whatever she decides regarding her career, Biles says she will continue to speak about mental health. Biles withdrew from several events at the Tokyo Olympics, partly because she wanted topreserve her mental health.“I am very proud of the work accomplished to reach this point,” she said, “and I will continue to be the voice of the voiceless.”Explore more on these topicsSimone BilesGymnasticsLA Olympic Games 2028Olympic GamesUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

United could get a higher fee if Rashford were sold to another club.Pundits’ showy partisanship reflects football’s embrace of fan-centric populism | Jonathan LiewRead moreRashford earns about £365,000 a week and will have three years on his contract in the close season. His transfer would release about another £56m in saved salary, giving United close to £100m to finance the deal for Cunha.The Brazilian is thought to earn about £90,000 a week, so if he agreed terms for five years with a considerable salary increase, offloading ­Rashford should allow United to finance most of the purchase.Rashford is minded that he will not play again competitively for United while Amorim and this executive are at Old Trafford, owing to a breakdown in the relationship.Jadon Sancho, Antony, Casemiro and Rasmus Højlund are other players whose departure would boost United’s transfer budget. Amorim’s first-choice signing at centre-forward is Liam Delap, who has a £30m release if Ipswich are relegated, which is all but guaranteed.Sancho is on loan at Chelsea, who have an obligation to buy the forward for £22m-£25m but can pay United £5m if they decide to send him back. If he returns to Old Trafford his asking price would be a minimum of £20m. Offloading Sancho would source most of Delap’s cost.Antony has proved a success at Real Betis since moving on loan in January and United would hope to recoup at least £30m for the forward, who cost £81.5m in the summer of 2022.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In almost all countries, people believed only a minority of their fellow citizens would be willing to contribute. In reality, the opposite was true: more than 50% of citizens were willing to contribute in all but a few nations.The global average of those willing to contribute was 69%. But the percentage that people thought would be willing was 43%. The gap between perception and reality was as high as 40 percentage points in some countries, from Greece to Gabon.Perception gap on the willingness to contribute income to fight global warmingFurther analysis of the survey data for the Guardian showed that public backing for climate action was as strong among the G20 member countries as in the rest of the world. These states, including the US, China, Saudi Arabia, UK and Australia, are responsible for 77% of global carbon emissions.“One of the most powerful forms of climate communication is just telling people that a majority of other people think climate change is happening, human-caused, a serious problem and a priority for action,” said Prof Anthony Leiserowitz at Yale University in the US.Prof Cynthia Frantz, at Oberlin College in the US, said. “Currently, worrying about climate change is something people are largely doing in the privacy of their own minds – we are locked in a self-fulfilling spiral of silence.”Dr Niall McLoughlin, at the Climate Barometer research group in the UK, said: “If you were to unlock the perception gaps, that could move us closer to a social tipping point amongst the public on climate issues.”The existence of a silent climate majority across the planet is supported by several separate analyses. Other studies demonstrate a clear global appetite for action, from citizens of rich nations stronglysupporting financial supportfor poorer vulnerable countries and even those inpetrostates backing a phase-out of coal, oil and gas. A decades-long campaign of misinformation by the fossil fuel industry is a key reason the climate majority has been suppressed, researchers said.Prof Teodora Boneva, at the University of Bonn, Germany, who was part of the team behind the 125-nation survey, said: “The world is united in its judgment about climate change and the need to act. Our results suggest a concerted effort to correct these misperceptions could be powerful intervention, yielding large, positive effects.”The 125 countries in the survey account for 96% of the world’s carbon emissions, and the results werepublished in the journal Nature Climate Change. People in China, the world’s biggest polluter, were among the most concerned, with 97% saying its government should do more to fight climate change and four out of five willing to give 1% of their income. Brazil, Portugal, and Sri Lanka also ranked highly.The world’s second biggest polluter, the US, was near the bottom, but 74% of its citizens still said its government should do more, while 48% were willing to contribute. New Zealand, Norway and Russia were also relatively low-scoring.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In the UK,MPs vastly underestimated public supportfor onshore windfarms. In the US, almost 80% ofcongressional staffers underestimated people’s support for limits on carbon emissions, sometimes by more than 50 percentage points.“Perception gaps can have real consequences – they could mean that climate policies are not as ambitious as the public sentiment,” said McLoughlin.Substantial evidence exists thatcorrecting mistaken beliefs about the views of otherscan change people’s views on many subjects, from opinions on immigrants and violence against women, toenvironmental topicssuch assaving energy. This is because people are instinctively drawn to majority views and are also more likely to do something if they think others are doing it too.“People deeply understand we are in a climate emergency,” said Cassie Flynn, at the UN Development Programme, whosePeople’s Climate Votein 2024 found 80% of people wanted stronger climate action from their countries. “They want world leaders to be bold, because they are living it day to day.

I get it.

No president has explicitly named Trump in their remarks.Obama called out Trump’s mounting attacks against colleges and universities during a speech at Hamilton College in New York on 3 April.Obama said: “It is up to all of us to fix this … It’s not going to be because somebody comes and saves you. The most important office in this democracy is the citizen, the ordinary person who says: ‘No, that’s not right.’”In his first post-presidency speech last Tuesday, Biden criticized Trump’s plans to slash social security.“The last thing [beneficiaries] need from their government is deliberate cruelty,” Biden said. He added: “In fewer than 100 days, this administration has done so much damage and so much devastation.”Explore more on these topicsAl GoreClimate crisisTrump administrationNazismUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Below, sheets of white extended beyond the horizon.But the pilots, who were searching for a suitable site to land a 34-tonne (76,000lb) Hercules transport plane a month later, needed ice that was 1.5-metres (5ft) thick.They could not find any. The teams scoured 10 other possible spots, stretching as far west in the Arctic asHerschel Island, five miles off the coast of Canada’s Yukon territory.In the end, no site proved suitable for a sea-ice landing area. The north, it seemed, was too warm.A map of Canada, showing the Arctic circle, Tuktoyaktuk and the Northwest passageHowever, that same month, during the same mission, the cold was snarling plans to move soldiers across the tundra. It had grounded transport helicopters. It had broken snowmobiles and other equipment and, at times, spirits. The north, it seemed, was too cold for the materiel the military had hauled up to the tundra.For generations, the intense cold of the Arctic has served as the bulwark of a military defence of the north. But a rapidly changing climate, defined by extreme shifts in temperature in both directions, threatens to unspool that defence, replacing it with a land and seascape more volatile and far less predictable.View image in fullscreenCanadian military personnel rest during Operation Nanook, which tests the armed forces’ readiness to fight in harsh Arctic conditionsOver February and March, hundreds of soldiers from several countriesgathered in Canada’s western Arctic for Operation Nanook, a military exercise meant to show that allied nations, including the US, Finland, Sweden, Belgium and the UK could “sustain force” in the region, testing cutting-edge equipment in the unforgiving tundra.In recent months, political leaders have revived longstanding fears thatCanadahas only a tenuous hold over its northern border. Despite the spectre of hostile nations creeping over unseen borders, however, the biggest threat facing the troops was the freezing temperatures.The primary enemy is the cold. Whether the bullets are flying or not, that’s the thing that is going to eat people aliveMaj Matthew Hefner“In kinetic fight or a civil response, the primary enemy is the cold,” says Maj Matthew Hefner, who runs the US army’s Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory in New Hampshire. “Whether the bullets are flying or not, that’s the thing that is going to eat people alive.”The American, commanding a team of military scientists, combat veterans and Arctic specialists, was in the hamlet of Tuktoyaktuk on thecrumbling Arctic Ocean coastline, as part of a community celebration to mark Operation Nanook. Members of Hefner’s international cooperative engagement programme for polar research have brought cold-weather gear to show local people.The event is also a few miles from where teams have cut triangular holes in the sea ice so Belgian naval divers can plunge into the emerald waters. Visibility extends as far as your arm and the frigid murky waters can disorient even seasoned divers astonishingly quickly.View image in fullscreen‘Everything is slower up here,’ says Maj Hefner, of the US armyFor those new to the landscape, Arctic veterans say a lack of awareness for the capacity of the cold to degrade and disorient is one of the biggest dangers. It makes plastic as fragile as glass. It confounds the intricate machinery of modern military aircraft.And at its most deadly, it untethers those travelling in its deepest reaches from reality. Exposed skin can sustain lasting damage within minutes; confusion quickly sets in with hypothermia.The Inuit who call the land home have pushed the outer bounds of human limits, finding pattern and tempo in a landscape that, to outsiders, is an unappeasable adversary.That knowledge is a lifeline to Arctic forces that have long acknowledged that tundra is one of the most hostile theatres for warfare conceivable for its ability to render hi-tech equipment unusable.During Operation Nanook, Hefner’s team went through periods of a cold-imposed communications blackout as their radios and satellite devices shut down, the result of “smart” lithium-ion batteries that will not charge in the cold.View image in fullscreenThe children of Tuktoyaktuk joke with soldiers in the area for Operation Nanook“Most equipment is metal, and if you touch it without a glove on, your hands go bad. But even if you don’t take your glove off, they’ll get soaking wet because everything’s covered in snow. Then they get really, really cold. And your hands go bad.“So everything is slower up here,” says Hefner. “I’ve got some guys complaining that we’re not doing a lot of tactical stuff – you can’t do tactical until surviving is second nature.”Regardless of your opinion on global warming, you will have your own modified opinion when you get out thereLt Col Darren TurnerBut the cold, for all its power to degrade, is also a powerful natural defence. In summer, the western Arctic is a boggy, infuriating morass of rivers strewn across the landscape like spaghetti. Enemy forces on the attack would find it near impossible to navigate. In the winter, travel routes open up with few natural barriers.It has long been the cold, and its power to break machine and mind, that has served as the chief deterrent. This winter, however, the community of Inuvik saw rain in December for the first time in nearly half a century. The drizzle came in the second half of a year that saw apunishing heatwave settle over the town, with the temperatures hitting 35C (95F) more than 125 miles above the Arctic Circle.This year,more snowmobiles plunged through ice roads– transport corridors built on frozen rivers – than ever before. Hefner’s team also lost two snowmobiles when they fell through the ice.View image in fullscreenThe aurora borealis over Tuktoyaktuk, which is north of the Arctic Circle“I’ve never experienced this many warm fluctuations in a year,” says Justin Pascal, who lives in Inuvik and is a member of the Canadian Rangers, a paramilitary force of northern reservists drawn from Indigenous communities.“This year it was jumping between -8C, -40C, back to -8C and then even above 0C at the beginning of the year. Call it what you want, but it’s different than anything I’ve experienced.”These changes have long been predicted andthaws coming earlier in the year have already expanded travel routes through the north-west passagefor cargo and tourist ships.View image in fullscreenBelgian military divers test equipment in the Arctic OceanBut they have also had profound effects on the landscape. Thawing permafrost and the subsequent sloughing of land into the ocean means communities such as Tuktoyaktuk are disappearing.“There’s open water where traditionally there was ice,” Lt Col Darren Turner, commander of Operation Nanook’s land forces, tells Canadian reservists. “Regardless of your opinion on global warming, you will have your own modified opinion when you get out there.”Melting glaciers will harm us all. Yet still we watch, unmoved | Robin McKieRead moreThe uncertainty surrounding these shifts has confounded local people and military units testing their capabilities in the north.After a series of reconnaissance flights failed to find suitable sea ice, the military chose to build a landing area on a frozen lake – the first time a Hercules had landed on fresh water. The landing was framed as “enhancing operational flexibility” by giving the plane access to otherwise inaccessible areas.View image in fullscreenChinook helicopters are key to moving supplies to remote areas but are also vulnerable to the harsh Arctic conditionsBut challenge, and failure, to find sufficiently thick sea ice in the depths of winter highlights a reality military leaders have had to start planning for in earnest.“Our first level of defence is leaving us,” says Turner.Explore more on these topicsArcticSeascape: the state of our oceansNatoIceCanadaClimate crisisExtreme weatherSea icefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hecalled the leaders of fossil fuel companies into the Vatican to hold them to account; declared a global climate emergency, in 2019; and in his final months, held aconference on “the economics of the common good”.Simon Stiell, the UN’s top official on the climate, paid tribute: “Pope Francis has been a towering figure of human dignity, and an unflinching global champion of climate action as a vital means to deliver it. Through his tireless advocacy, [he] reminded us there can be no shared prosperity until we make peace with nature and protect the most vulnerable, as pollution and environmental destruction bring our planet close to ‘breaking point’.”Laurence Tubiana, chief of the European Climate Foundation and one of the architects of the 2015 Paris agreement, wrote on social media that Pope Francis had been an ‘important voice’: “By clearly setting out the causes of the crisis we are experiencing, [he] reminded us who the fight against the climate crisis is aimed at: humanity as a whole.”The prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, said Pope Francis was “beacon of global moral strategic leadership” who had guided and inspired her through the “dark and desolate days” of the Covid pandemic. Describing him as her hero, she recalled spending time with him late last year, where he reinforced in her “the importance of always aligning our hearts, our heads, and our hands with our faith – to see, hear, and feel all people, so that we may help them, and to protect our planet.2:12Catholics across the world from the Vatican to Gaza pay tribute  to Pope Francis – video“His voice comforted and inspired many. His hands led him to places where others dared not go, and his heart knew no boundaries. His humour and his laughter were not only infectious but calming. Let us, each and every day, see, hear, and feel people – to fight the globalisation of indifference.”After his appointment in March 2013, Francis quickly took up the climate and environment as key themes of his papacy. “If we destroy creation, creation will destroy us,” he warned an audience in Rome in May 2014, the year beforethe Paris agreement was signed. “Never forget this.”His predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, had taken steps to green the Vatican with solar panels, andspoken of the sinfulness of environmental destruction. But Francis went further, with alandmark encyclical in 2015. Laudato Si’, translated as Praise Be to You, set outin 180 pageshis vision of “climate change [as] a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political”, and warned of the “grave social debt” owed by the rich to the poor, because of it.View image in fullscreenPope Francis, pictured here in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 2015, and who has died at the age of 88, was viewed by many as a champion of climate action.Photograph: Ettore Ferrari/EPA“This is his signature teaching,” said Austen Ivereigh, a papal biographer, at the time of the publication. “Francis has made it not just safe to be Catholic and green; he’s made it obligatory.”“Laudato Si’ was a wonderful achievement and vision – an environmentalism of hope and justice that profoundly resonated,” said Edward Davey, head of the UK office of the World Resources Institute.This was followed by a fresh encyclical,Laudate Deum, in October 2023, with even starker warnings, thathumanity was taking the Earth “to breaking point”.Part of what made Francis’s words stand out was their clear focus on the social justice aspects of the climate crisis. St Francis of Assisi, the 13th-century Italian friar from whom Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina took his papal name, was known for living among the poor and in close harmony with nature.As Pope, Francis seemed equally determined to bring the two together. “We have to hear both the cry of the Earth, and the cry of the poor,” he wrote in Laudato Si.Mark Watts, executive director of the C40 Cities group of mayors supporting climate action, said: “He established for a worldwide audience that the climate crisis is not just an environmental challenge but a profound social and ethical issue, exacerbated by greed and short-term profit seeking, disproportionately affecting the world’s most marginalised communities. His leadership highlighted how inequality and the climate crisis are inextricably linked, mobilising community-led climate action.”In Laudate Deum, Francis called for “a broad change in the irresponsible lifestyle connected with the western model”, anddefended protesters, writing: “The actions of groups negatively portrayed as ‘radicalised’ … are filling a space left empty by society as a whole, which ought to exercise a healthy ‘pressure’, since every family ought to realise that the future of their children is at stake.”He wasregarded by some as too radical himself– as he noted: “[I have been] obliged to make these clarifications, which may appear obvious, because of certain dismissive and scarcely reasonable opinions that I encounter, even within the Catholic church.”This year’sUN climate summit, Cop30, will be held in Brazil, in November, and campaigners had been hoping that, despite his increasing frailty, the first ever Latin American pontiff might be able to make it. Few figures of such authority have staked their reputation on the climate crisis, and fewer still have so publicly yoked together social justice with the environment.Stiell said: “His message will live on: humanity is community. And when any one community is abandoned – to poverty, starvation, climate disasters and injustice – all of humanity is deeply diminished, materially and morally, in equal measure.”Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisClimate crisisVaticanCatholicismChristianityItalyReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

I can, however, confirm that we are closing the redundancy consultation without action. Since the government passed its legislation on Saturday, we have been working day and night to ensure we are able to stabilise our operations.British Steel must now join the modern economy, not be a prisoner of the old | Will HuttonRead moreBritish Steel said that ensuring continued supply of coking coal to the plant hadavoided the need for a so-called “salamander tap”, a process in which a hole is drilled in the bottom of the blast furnace to let out, or tap, molten metal and slag.Tapping Queen Bess would have effectively paused its operations, allowing the limited remaining raw materials available to be diverted to keep Queen Anne burning as normal. In theory, Bess could have been restarted but in practice this is not cost-efficient for furnaces that are nearing the end of their lives.The industry minister, Sarah Jones, said: “The action this government took on 12 April, and the measures we’ve taken since, matter greatly for this country, and are of huge importance to thousands of steelworkers and their families. We will always stand up for our steel industry.“Now, thanks to our decisive action to protect steelmaking at Scunthorpe, British Steel has cancelled the redundancy consultations started by its owners Jingye, bringing certainty for thousands of hard-working staff for the long term.”TheUniteunion said: “Unite are pleased that British Steel have come to their senses and realised that job losses are not the way to ensure Britain remains an industrial power.“This should be just the first step to begin the process of nationalisation. The government now needs to implement a wholesale overhaul of its energy policy with a commitment to invest in renewables to lower energy prices for heavy industry like steel production.”Alun Davies, the national secretary for steel at the Community Union, said: “We welcome these positive developments, which follow constructive discussions between steel unions, the Labour government and British Steel management.“We look forward to continuing these productive relationships going forward. Through this collective effort, backed up by the commitment and resolve of the workforce, Scunthorpe steelmaking was saved from a disastrous cliff edge.“We will now continue to work tirelessly to ensure the business gets the bright future it needs and deserves.”Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelSteel industryIndustrial policyUniteJob lossesManufacturing sectorTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

She did not give a timeframe for the Scottish government to revise its own guidance.Scottish Labour’s Jackie Baillie said the SNP government had a “poor track record” in court with “at least 10 cases of failed action”, including Sturgeon’s own challenge that resulted in the supreme court ruling against Holyrood holding a second independence referendum without Westminster approval.She asked how much taxpayer money has been spent in defending this case. Somerville said she was “unable [to give Baillie] a number” but that such costs would be made public.A number of LGBT+ MSPs of all parties referenced the insistence of Lord Hodge, who delivered the judgment, that the ruling should not be read “as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not”.As public and private sector organisations wrestle with the practical implications of the ruling, and trans advocates raise concerns about access to basic facilities such as toilets, Somerville acknowledged that in future “services and facilities may have to be delivered in a different way in some aspects” but added it was “important that everyone has access”.Explore more on these topicsScottish politicsScotlandGenderTransgenderWomenNicola SturgeonnewsShareReuse this content"

However, given the Gambling Commission’s decision, and my understanding of what will follow, this is likely to be a lengthy process that may not be resolved by May 2026.“In the circumstances, I feel I have no alternative but to withdraw my candidacy for next year’s Senedd elections so that I can focus on fighting to clear my name.“I will of course continue to serve the people of Montgomeryshire to the very best of my ability.“I am grateful for the many messages of support that I have received in recent days, particularly from constituents.”Among others facing charges are: Craig Williams, the former MP for Montgomeryshire; Nick Mason, a former chief data officer for the party; Laura Saunders, the Conservative candidate for Bristol North West last July; and Tony Lee, the Conservatives’ campaigns director, who is married to Saunders.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sources said that ministers could authorise the introduction of the incapacitant spray in YOIs afterdemands from the prison officers’ union.Senior members of the Prison Officers’ Association are due to meet the justice secretary,Shabana Mahmood, on Wednesday.The meeting was called after theattack on three guardsat HMP Frankland, an adult prison, allegedly by the convicted terrorist Hashem Abedi. Two officers were seriously injured after being doused in hot cooking fat and stabbed, one five times in the torso, in a sustained assault in a prison kitchen on 12 April.I hate the idea of British prison officers carrying stun guns – but it may be our only option | Alex SouthRead moreThere have been rising concerns about the levels of violence aimed at staff in YOIs, which hold more than 400 children aged between 15 and 18. A report in October by HM inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor, found that only one of five of the institutions was deemed to be “safe”.“Our inspection reports of establishments holding children described behaviour management systems that were overwhelmed by very high levels of violence,” the report said. “Many comments from staff highlighted fears for their own safety.”Any decision to allow the use of Pava on juveniles would be opposed by prison welfare charities and the prisons watchdog, who say its use would create further divisions between staff and the minors in their care.Squirted from a canister, Pava spray, or pelargonic acid vanillylamide, causes searing pain and discomfort in the eyes for about 40 minutes and a burning sensation to skin.In 2018, it wasrolled out in men’s prisonsin England and Wales. Since then, there have been claims of disproportionate use against disabled people and those fromminority ethnic backgrounds.Tom Wheatley, the president of the Prison Governors’ Association, said Pava had become a useful tool in adult prisons because it allowed smaller and physically weaker staff members to halt bigger and stronger assailants. “Pava is about levelling a violent confrontation between a member of staff and a prisoner. It has value because not all officers are 6ft 4in and 18 stone,” he said.Asked if he would be worried about the effect of Pava on children if the spray was used in YOIs, Wheatley said: “I don’t know if there’s a greater physiological risk on young people. But being punched in the face by a 6ft 4in 17-year-old probably feels very similar to being punched by a 6ft 4in adult.”Mahmood previously announced that the Prison Service will investigate whether frontline staffshould be given protective body armour, and the Ministry of Justice has pledged to carry out a review after the Frankland incident.Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, Mahmood said: “The House will be aware of the attack at HMP Frankland … Since the attack, I have suspended access to kitchens in separation centres and in close supervision centres.“Alongside that, an independent review will ascertain how this incident was able to happen, what more must be done to protect prison staff and, more widely, how separation centres are run.“The Prison Service will also conduct a snap review of the use of protective bodily armour. In addition, I can today announce that HMPPS [HM Prison and Probation Service] will trial the use of Tasers in our prisons.“Wherever we can strengthen our defences, to better protect our staff and the public, we will do so.”The MoJ was approached for a comment regarding Pava.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationShabana MahmoodUK criminal justiceTaser electronic weaponsYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

The programme, along with another £11m project, will make the UK one of the biggest funders of geoengineering research in the world.Geoengineering is controversial and some previous plannedoutdoor experiments have been cancelledafterstrong opposition. Most geoengineering proposals aim to block sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface, for example by launching clouds of reflective particles into the atmosphere or using seawater sprays to make clouds brighter.If successful, this could temporarily reduce surface temperatures and the harm the climate crisis is causing, giving more time for the deep cuts in global carbon emissions needed. Given the failure of the world tostop emissions risingto date, and the recent run ofrecord hot years, backers of solar geoengineering say researching the issue is vital in case an emergency brake is needed.solar geoengineering methods graphicHowever, solar radiation management (SRM) could have serious unintended consequences, such as shifting rains vital to food production. Some scientists warn that starting to develop geoengineering could reduce the drive to tackle the root cause of the climate emergency – the burning of fossil fuels.Prof Mark Symes, who is leading the Aria programme, said the looming threat of climate tipping points was a strong reason to research solar geoengineering. Thetriggering of tipping pointsby rising temperatures, such as thecollapse of vital ocean currentsorgiant ice sheets, would have catastrophic impacts.Early warning system for climate tipping points given £81m kickstartRead more“The uncomfortable truth is that our current warming trajectory makes a number of such tipping points distinctly possible over the next century,” he said. “This has driven increased interest in approaches that might actively cool the world in a short timeframe in order to avoid those tipping points.“Having spoken to hundreds of researchers, we reached the conclusion that a critical missing part of our understanding was real world, physical data. These would show us whether any of these potential approaches would actually work and what their effects might be. Modelling and indoor studies are essential as prerequisites but can only tell us so much.”He said no toxic substances would be released, an environmental impact assessment would be published before outdoor experiments and that local communities would be consulted. Details of the projects funded by Aria are expected in a few weeks.Aria’s programme was recently called a“dangerous distraction” from cutting emissionsby senior scientists, who called SRM “barking mad” and akin to treating cancer with aspirin.A£10m programme of geoengineering researchwas announced by the UK’s National Environment Research Council (Nerc) on 3 April to investigate the impact of solar geoengineering interventions. It will not involve new outdoor experiments but rely on computer modelling, existing data and natural analogues, such as volcanic eruptions and changes in shipping emissions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The US was the leading funder but President Donald Trump’s attack on climate research is expected to reduce this, potentially making the UK the leading funder. “It’s worth stressing that geoengineering is not a substitute for emission cuts,” Irvine said.Prof Jim Haywood, at the University of Exeter and a Nerc grant recipient, said scaling up an SRM project could be feasible over about a decade. “At the moment, all of these ideas need to remain on the table, because otherwise climate change in the coming decades could be extremely damaging. Recent global temperatures have been a real wake-up call.”There is no international agreement between countries to govern any major geoengineering scheme and experts have called for amoratorium on deployment.“We know that SRM, or the prospect of SRM, would affect international relations – it’s a serious research question,” said Dr Sebastian Eastham, at Imperial College London and also a Nerc grant recipient. “So part of our project is going to be to convene people from different world regions to understand what might be the consequences.”Eastham said he thought the UK geoengineering research would rule out some proposed technologies: “I expect we will gather a small amount of observational evidence and it will close the door for some. Then we’ll know we focus our efforts on the areas that are going to be most helpful and least harmful.”Explore more on these topicsGeoengineeringClimate crisisClimate scienceGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The condition’s key feature is known as post-exertional malaise, which is a delayed dramatic worsening of these symptoms following minor physical effort. There is currently no diagnostic test or cure for the disease and its causes are unknown.The findings showed that the lifetime prevalence of chronic fatigue for women and men in England may be as high as 0.92% of the population for women, and 0.25% for men. This is equivalent to about 404,000 people overall.The previous estimate of 250,000 people living with chronic fatigue in England was based on data from the UK Biobank population, which researchers said disproportionately contains more people in better health.The study, funded by the National Institute forHealthand Care Research, also revealed stark ethnic inequalities relating to chronic fatigue diagnoses rates. White people with ME in England were almost five times more likely to be diagnosed with the condition than other ethnic groups.People from Black and Asian backgrounds were least likely to be diagnosed with the condition, with rates between 65% and 90% lower than their white counterparts.There were also regional disparities across England, with Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly having the highest rates, while north-west and north-east London had the lowest.These regional disparities also indicated there was a “postcode lottery” with regard to the likelihood of receiving a chronic fatigue diagnosis. The study found that of 6,113 large English GP practices, two-thirds had at least eight patients registered as having ME or CFS. However, there were 176 practices – mostly in deprived areas – that had no recorded ME patients.Prof Chris Ponting, study lead at the MRC Human Genetics Unit at the University of Edinburgh’s Institute of Genetics and Cancer, said: “The NHS data shows that getting a diagnosis of ME/CFS in England is a lottery, depending on where you live and your ethnicity. There are nearly 200 GP practices – mostly in deprived areas of the country – that have no recorded ME/CFS patients at all. The data backs up what many people with ME/CFS say: that they feel invisible and ignored.”Gemma Samms, an ME Research UK-funded PhD student, said: “People struggle to get diagnosed with ME/CFS. Diagnosis is important, because it validates their symptoms and enables them to receive recognition and support. Our results should now lead to improved training of medical professionals and further research into accurate diagnostic tests.”Dr Charles Shepherd, medical advisor at the ME Association, said: “Over the past year, the ME Association has been discussing with charity colleagues and other organisations how the current estimate of around 250,000 people with ME/CFS is almost certainly an underestimate given the growth in population since this figure was first used and the large number of people who now have post-Covid ME/CFS.“This new research does now provide some important new evidence that the true figure is around 400,000. Consequently, we will now be discussing with our charity colleagues to see if agreement can be reached on a new prevalence figure based on these research findings.”Explore more on these topicsME / Chronic fatigue syndromeHealthEnglandUniversity of EdinburghScotlandMedical researchNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

There was a narrow fish ramp in the centre of the weir only slightly wider than the width of a paddleboard.“Save for that ramp, the entire face of the weir dropped sharply down. On the morning of 30 October 2021, this was a drop of approximately 1.3 metres.” The court heard almost two tonnes of water was crossing a 1 metre-wide section of the weir crest every second.Watson said: “Although both the defendant and Paul [O’Dwyer] had undertaken a paddleboard instructor’s course earlier in the year, this was a basic entry-level qualification, wholly unsuited to leading a tour on a river in spate with hazards such as a weir.”The current propelled the group down the river. Lloyd managed to get through the fish ramp but the others were swept over the weir and fell off their boards.View image in fullscreenNerys Lloyd (centre, on crutches) leaving Swansea crown court last month.Photograph: George Thompson/PA MediaIn a victim personal statement, Mark Powell, the husband of Andrea Powell, said he thought about the “sheer panic” his wife must have felt.He said Lloyd’s failings were on a “monumental scale”, accusing her of being lackadaisical, arrogant and deceitful. He asked: “How can a police officer allow this to happen?” He had detected no remorse from her, he said.Teresa Hall, the mother of Morgan Rogers, told Lloyd: “You guided Morgan to her death.” She said she thought about her daughter “gagging” for breath. Hall said: “She had confidence in you as a leader.”Gemma Cox, a survivor, said: “I have remembered every day the feeling I had when I went over that weir. Having to jump over the edge not knowing what would happen when I hit the water. Not a day goes by without remembering what it felt to pull Morgan on to my board and trying to bring her back. I can remember the look in Nicola’s husband’s eyes as I was forced to tell him his wife was gone.”She added: “I had no idea what a weir was or that we would be going over it. I did not know what was ahead of me. If I had I would not have got on the river that day.”Another survivor, Melody Johns, said: “Paddleboarding is largely unregulated and boards are still being sold without quick release leashes that can save lives. Many people are continuing to buy boards without much thought about safety. Something needs to change.”A third survivor, Jemma Dugdale, said sporting bodies including Paddle UK, Paddle Cymru, Sport England and Sport Wales, needed to do more to prevent such a tragedy happening again.The court heard that Lloyd was suspended from South Wales police at the time of the tragedy after accepting a caution for a fraudulent insurance claim involving a vehicle. She had advertised the River Cleddau trip on Facebook for £149 a person to include overnight accommodation and supervision by two “fully” qualified instructors.Lloyd did not carry out risk assessments or obtain next of kin details for the victims – leading to a delay in contacting family members, the court heard.Moments after the tragedy she said: “It’s my fault 100% … I just turned around and they all fell over.”The prosecutor told the court all of the participants, who were “beginner and intermediate” paddleboarders, were “completely taken by surprise by the presence of the weir”.The sentencing hearing will conclude on Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsWalesCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

It is expected to lead to “league tables” of foreign nationals showing which nationalities are more associated with particular crimes.The move comes as Labour attempts to quell the threat from Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party atnext week’s local elections.Fizza Qureshi, the chief executive of the Migrants’ Rights Network, said publicising foreign national offenders’ nationalities was a “blatant exercise in scapegoating”.She said: “The criminal justice system, policing and immigration systems are infamously racist and disproportionately impact racialised people.“Attempts to manufacture a link between nationalities and criminality only serves to deepen prejudice and discrimination towards migrants from certain countries. Linking the nationality, ethnicity and immigration status with crime is nothing more than dog-whistle politics, which is incredibly irresponsible in the aftermath of last summer’s racist riots.”James Wilson, the director of Detention Action, which supports people in immigration detention, said the move risked increasing the possibility of riots. He said: “The dangers are very clear. Less than a year after the anti-asylum riots, the government risks feeding further division, dehumanisation and prejudice in our communities.”Clive Lewis was one of threeLabourMPs who told the Guardian that the move risked increasing community tensions. The MP for Norwich South and former shadow defence secretary said: “People deserve transparency, but that means the full picture – not just stats that single out foreign nationals without showing how they compare to everyone else.“Without that context, it’s too easy for the media and politicians to twist the story and stir up hate. In a time when debate around migration is so often driven by fear and headlines, we need honest, level-headed conversations that focus on facts and real solutions – not scapegoats.”Another Labour veteran said: “This is pandering to Farage, plain and simple. We need to fight prejudice not reinforce it.”There were more than 19,000 foreign offenders awaiting deportation at the end of last year, up from almost 18,000 when the Conservatives left office, figures show.In July and August last year, there was a wave of anti-immigration demonstrations and riots across the UK. Sometargeted mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers, driven in part by false claims that spread on social media platforms relating to the killing of three children in Southport.A Home Office source said the government wanted the public to be better informed about foreign criminals, including where they came from.The Tories said Tuesday’s commitment showed Labour had “buckled” after being put under pressure to disclose the figures.Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, last month demanded that nationality, immigration and visa status should be recorded and released whenever a criminal was convicted. Jenrick submitted an amendment to the government’s criminal justice bill, saying the data would help to inform deportation and visa policies.In response, government sources say the move has been possible only because Cooper ordered Home Office statisticians to overhaul their systems.Foreign nationals sentenced to 12 months or more in prison are subject to automatic deportation. The home secretary has the power to deport people who receive a shorter sentence if she decides their presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.Home Office sources blame the increase in the number of foreign criminals awaiting deportation on early releases on prison overcrowding, instability in some countries, making deportations difficult, and a litany of appeals against deportation on human rights grounds. The rise has come despite more offenders being deported since Labour came to power.Home Office figures are expected to show that the main three nationalities for foreign criminals living in the community are Albanians, Romanians and Poles. It is understood their most common offences were the production of drugs, theft and robbery, and acts of violent assault.Government sources say the change is only happening because ministers have addressed an issue that their Conservative predecessors ignored.A Home Office source said: “Not only are we deporting foreign criminals at a rate never seen when Chris Philp and Robert Jenrick were in charge at the Home Office, but we will also be publishing far more information about that cohort of offenders than the Tories ever did.“We want to ensure the public is kept better informed about the number of foreign criminals awaiting deportation, where they are from and the crimes they have committed.”A series of policies announced by the Home Office in recent weeks have attempted to harden the government’s position on immigration amid a surge in support for Reform.In February, it emerged thatguidance for staffassessing people who apply for naturalisation in the UK said applicants who had “made a dangerous journey will normally be refused citizenship”.Last week, there was news that the British and French governments were involved in early talks about areturns agreementthat would involve the two countries exchanging people seeking asylum.Welcoming the latest development, Jenrick said: “We will finally see the hard reality that mass migration is fuelling crime across our country. Frankly, the public deserved to know this long ago.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeRaceUK criminal justiceReform UKLabournewsShareReuse this content"

It was proposed by the commission in March, as part of a drive toincrease European defence spending by €800bnamid deep shock at Donald Trump’s rush to offer concessions to Vladimir Putin in a bid to end Russia’s war on Ukraine.Reflecting the influence of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the fund has a “buy European” rule meaning that components from non-EU countries can only make up 35% of the cost of any project. That restriction is relaxed forUkraineand any country with a defence and security partnership with the EU.An agreement is likely to be the centrepiece of the EU-UK summit on 19 May, between Starmer, the commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, and the head of the European Council, António Costa.The commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier said “one of the objectives of the summit will be to advance on that potential [security and defence] partnership”. Asked whether such a partnership – if agreed – would mean the UK would be treated as European for SAFE procurement, he said: “Exactly: UK companies, British companies would be considered under the buy European clause.”Regnier said, when asked about linking the agreement to fish: “The commission is committed to strengthening relations between the EU and the UK, and has not set preconditions.”But any defence proposal from the commission will have to be signed off by the EU’s 27 member states, including coastal countries that want to rollover existing arrangements on fishing rights.Under thetrade agreement struck between the EU and Boris Johnsonin 2020, the EU’s share of fish quotas in British waters was reduced by 25% over a transition period ending in 30 June 2026. Negotiations on quotas can then happen annually, although a multi-year agreement has not been ruled out.Countries with crews that fish in British waters have been instrumental in defining the EU position stating that an “early understanding” on fisheries was necessary to progress EU-UK talks in other areas.One EU official expressed confidence the UK would agree to maintain rights for EU fishing crews: “The Brits know they will have to prolong access.”No 10 did not explicitly deny that a fishing deal would be part of paving the way for the final agreement. The prime minister’s spokesperson said: “We have always been clear that through the process of these talks, the UK government’s priority will always be to deliver a better deal for the British people. That’s what those discussions are all about.”Starmer is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with von der Leyen on Thursday when she attends the UK’s energy security summit in London.Nick Thomas-Symonds, the minister acting as the chief EU negotiator, previously told the Commons business and trade committee the UK was open to having a multi-year deal on fisheries. He said: “As the trade and cooperation agreement stands at the moment, it would move into some sort of annual negotiations. I do think that having something that is more stable would be in our interests going forward.”In February,Costa appeared to express surpriseabout the link between fishing rights and the defence of Europe. “These are different things,” said the European Council president. “European defence and fisheries cannot be put on the same level. We should have common sense of what we are talking about.”A UK government spokesperson said: “No agreements have been reached and we have always been clear we will protect the interests of our fisheries. The UK has long been a leader in the defence and security of the continent, and we stand ready to negotiate a security and defence partnership agreement with the EU.”Regnier, the commission spokesperson, said: “The United Kingdom is a like-minded strategic partner for the EU and its member states with whom we share many fundamental values, goals and challenges.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionDefence policyEuropean CommissionFishing industryEuropeBrexitUrsula von der LeyenShareReuse this content"

The chancellor, who will meet her US counterpart, Scott Bessent, for the first time, is expected topress the UK’s case for reduced tariffs. She said she would be “defending British interests and making the case for free and fair trade”.Publishing the latest edition of its World Economic Outlook, the Washington-based IMF cut its forecast for global GDP growth to 2.8% for this year – 0.5% weaker than it was expecting as recently as January.The IMF said that while its forecasts had been prepared on the basis of current trade policy, “intensifying downside risks dominate the outlook”.Its forecasts show every major economy being hit, with the UK expected to grow by 1.1% this year, down from 1.6% predicted in January. The IMF expects a sharper deterioration for the US, from 2.7% to 1.8%.It said that although tariffs and the uncertainty created would weigh on the economy in the UK, “domestic factors” were mainly to blame for the downgraded growth forecast. These included increased government borrowing costs and weaker consumer spending in response to higher UK inflation, partly driven by rising energy bills.US to impose tariffs of up to 3,521% on south-east Asia solar panelsRead moreResponding to the UK downgrade, Reeves highlighted the fact that the IMF still expected it to be the “fastest-growing European G7 economy” in 2025.As its spring meetings kick off, the IMF said that even after Trump’s “pause”, which suspended punitive “reciprocal tariffs” on a string of countries, trade barriers were at the highest level in a century.Given the lack of clarity about the future direction of the policy, it predicted that companies throughout the global economy were likely to respond by cutting spending.“Faced with increased uncertainty about access to markets – their own but also those of their suppliers and customers – many firms’ initial reaction will be to pause, reduce investment, and cut purchases. Likewise, financial institutions will re-evaluate their credit supply to businesses,” it said.“The combined increased uncertainty and resulting tightening of financial conditions are a global negative demand shock and will weigh on activity.”The IMF added that emerging economies may be hit especially hard, as “unfavourable global financial conditions” make it harder for them to service their debts – a situation that could be exacerbated by overseas aid cuts.The UK recently announced ahistoric cut to its aid budget, to fund defence spending, and Trump is battling court action as heattempts to dismantle USAID.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is unclear what role the US could take in any such discussion, however, given its commitment to an “America first” approach.The IMF expressed concern in the report about the shock waves unleashed in financial markets by Trump’s trade policies – and said worse may be to come.In particular, it points to the risk of “strong volatility” in currency markets, which “may be difficult to navigate, especially for emerging market economies”.The dollar was up 0.5% on Tuesday after earlier hitting aa three-year low, as Trump issued further criticism of Jay Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, calling him “Mr Too Late” for failing to cut interest rates.Wall Street shares rose on Tuesday after the US treasury secretary suggested a trade war with China was unsustainable and that the world’s two largest economies would have to find a way to de-escalate.Bessent made the comments at a closed-door investor summit, according to Bloomberg. US shares had already opened higher and picked up after the comments were reported, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 both up by more than 2%.The IMF said the probability of a recession in the US had increased to nearly 40%, higher than its forecast of 25% made in October, the month before Trump’selection victory.Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyTrump tariffsInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)EconomicsTariffsUS economyEconomic growth (GDP)ShareReuse this content"

For younger women, the standards jump significantly – deadlifting 140lb instead of 120, and shaving nearly 90 seconds off required run times.The new policy appears to contradict findings froma 2017 studyof US army soldiers that concluded “gaps in cardiorespiratory and muscular performances between men and women should be addressed through targeted physical training programs that aim to minimize physiological differences” rather than applying identical standards.A2022 Rand Corporation studyalso found that women and older service members were failing the previous fitness test “at significantly higher rates than men and younger troops”, which raises questions about the feasibility of the new standardized requirements.Hegseth blames ousted officials for leaks in latest Signal chat scandalRead moreCombat soldiers must now score “a minimum of 60 points per event and an overall minimum score of 350” under the sex-neutral standards, according to the army’s press release. Active-duty troops have until January 2026 to meet requirements, while national guard and reserve members have until June 2026.Hegseth has previously said that he does not think women should be allowed to serve in combat roles, though he later moderated his stance. The former Fox News host wrote in a recent book that “women cannot physically meet the same standards as men” and that mothers were needed “but not in the military, especially in combat units”.Soldiers who fail to meet the new standards twice consecutively face potential removal from the army or,according toSgt Maj Christopher Mullinax, would be required to transfer to non-combat roles, which will continue using sex- and age-based scoring.The army will begin rolling out the changes on 1 June, with full implementation guidelines expected in May.Explore more on these topicsUS militaryWomenPete HegsethMenUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Conservatives have gained one point in the last two weeks, according to the CBC data.Carney, a 60-year-old who previously led the central banks of Canada and Britain, says his global experience managing economic crises makes him the ideal candidate to guide Canada through a trade war brought on by Trump’s tariffs.How Trump’s Canada threats dampened Quebec separatist movement – for nowRead morePoilievre, meanwhile, says that lacklustre growth under ex-premier Justin Trudeau’s decade in power left Canada vulnerable to Trump and the country cannot afford a fourth consecutive Liberal government.Most Canadian elections are multi-party battles with the leftwing New Democratic party and Quebec separatist Bloc Quebecois playing crucial roles in the makeup of parliament.This year, polling points to a two-party Liberal-Conservative race, with smaller parties facing significant setbacks.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The area was expanded last May to cover a larger area in south-west Gaza, including Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah and al-Mawasi.Up to January, the humanitarian zone had been marked on maps that were posted online and dropped from the air by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). More than a million people had flocked to the areas as a result.The humanitarian zones were not entirely safe. Official figures showed they were hit by at least 28 Israeli strikes before January andan investigation by the BBCput the number as high as 97, with 550 people killed. The IDF accused Hamas militants of using the zones as protection and as a launchpad for attacks on Israeli troops.Despair in Gaza as Israeli aid blockade creates crisis ‘unmatched in severity’Read moreMention of the humanitarian zones has disappeared from maps since Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas collapsed in March. The IDF has resumed its airstrikes and seized swathes of land as a “security buffer zone” and the UN estimates that 70% of Gaza is now under either an evacuation order or is a “no-go zone”.In meetings with aid agencies, the IDF and Cogat – the Israeli government unit coordinating policy in Gaza – have sidestepped questions about humanitarian zones, according to a senior international official who asked not to be named in order to speak freely.The source added: “[The Israeli authorities] have not indicated if they will reinstate some of the humanitarian zone designations. There’s a logic there: if they don’t reinstate the humanitarian zones, they therefore can’t guarantee security of movement within that zone for aid workers or civilians.”The IDF did not respond to questions on the issue.Tens of thousands of Palestinians have continued to flock to al-Mawasi, a sandy area with few buildings, many in the belief it is still a protected zone. But the area has been hit by 23 airstrikes since the ceasefire ended, according to the UN.Last week, two Israeli missiles struck refugee camps in al-Mawasi, setting fire to dozens of tents, many with women and children inside. The attacks killed at least 16 people and wounded many more. “Images of children burning while sheltering in makeshift tents should shake us all to our core,” said Catherine Russell of Unicef.Nasser, a father of four, sought sanctuary with his family at al-Mawasi after their home in Deir al-Balah was wrecked last year.“Mawasi was not really better,” said the 35-year-old accountant. “The conditions were crowded, hot, and dirty, there was nowhere to wash or have any privacy. Sometimes there were airstrikes on al-Mawasi when we were displaced there and they set the tents on fire. The Israelis told us to move again even inside the camp.”The family went back home when the ceasefire was declared but Nasser said it was now clear to everyone in Gaza that nowhere was safe.“We don’t know what to do,” he added. “I spent all day looking for clean water and firewood to make a fire to boil wastewater. But Mawasi is dangerous too, it has been targeted 20 times in the last month and there were many martyrs.”The UN warned on Tuesday that Gaza was facing famine after more than 50 days of a total Israeli blockade on aid entering the territory. Also on Tuesday, Israel airstrikes killed 17 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, described Gaza as a “land of desperation”.“Hunger is spreading and deepening, deliberate and manmade,” said Lazzarini on Tuesday. He said the 2 million people of Gaza were “undergoing collective punishment” and he charged Israel with using humanitarian aid as “a bargaining chip and a weapon of war”.His comments were echoed by Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, who told reporters on Tuesday: “It is true that right now is probably the worst humanitarian situation we have seen throughout the war in Gaza.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He had been recovering from double pneumonia for which he was hospitalised for five weeks.His death certificate, released by theVatican, said the stroke caused a coma and “irreversible” heart failure.A Vatican official recounted some of his last moments on Tuesday, saying his death came quickly and he did not suffer. Francis fell ill at about 5.30am on Monday and was attended to by his team of medics. He later fell into a coma and died at 7.35am.The funeral mass will begin at 10am local time and will be led by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the dean of the college of cardinals, in what is expected to be a solemn ceremony.Photographs of Francis’ body, dressed in his vestments, holding a rosary and lying in an open coffin in the chapel of his home at Casa Santa Marta, were released by the Vatican on Tuesday.His coffin will be taken to St Peter’s Basilica on Wednesday morning in a procession led by cardinals. He will remain there until 7pm on Friday, to allow the public to pay their respects. The basilica will remain open until midnight on Wednesday and Thursday.As confirmed by Francis in his final testament, he will be buried at the Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica in Rome’s Esquilino neighbourhood, breaking with longstanding Vatican tradition.He specified that he wanted to be buried “in the ground, without particular decoration” but with the inscription of his papal name in Latin: Franciscus.The cost of his burial will be covered by a sum provided by a benefactor, which Francis transferred to the basilica, he wrote in his will.Popes are usually buried with much fanfare in the grottoes beneath St Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City, but Francis – loved by many Catholics for his humility – simplified rites for papal funerals last year.‘A signal of simplicity’: Pope Francis’s funeral will be his final humble gestureRead moreThe procession of his coffin from the Vatican to Esquilino, a journey of two or three miles through central Rome, would require the Vatican’s Swiss Guards.Heads of state and government who have so far confirmed their attendance at the funeral include Emmanuel Macron, Donald Trump, Keir Starmer and Javier Milei, the president of Francis’s native Argentina. Francis had a delicate relationship with politics in his home country, but Milei hailed his “goodness and wisdom”.Macron said at a press conference during a visit to Réunion: “We will be present at the pope’s funeral, as is only right.”Trump, who repeatedly clashed with Francis over immigration,said on Monday that he would be attending with his wife. “Melania and I will be going to the funeral of Pope Francis, in Rome.

People will still be able to see his body in the basilica, but his remains will be placed in one simple coffin made of wood and lined with zinc, and will not be raised on a platform.‘He listened to everyone’: Buenos Aires remembers pope as voice for the poorRead moreFrancis almost died twice in February during treatment for severe pneumonia at Gemelli hospital in Rome.

Due to the area’s lack of road access, helicopter services were deployed to evacuate the wounded.Describing the scene, a local tour guide told the AFP news agency he reached the scene after hearing gunfire and transported some of the wounded away on horseback.“I saw a few men lying on the ground looking like they were dead,” said Waheed, who gave only one name.A female survivor told the PTI news agency: “My husband was shot in the head while seven others were also injured in the attack.”Omar Abdullah, the region’s top elected official, wrote on social media: “This attack is much larger than anything we’ve seen directed at civilians in recent years.”Government officials said the dead included tourists from the Indian states of Karnataka, Odisha and Gujarat and two foreign nationals. At least six others were wounded.India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, decried the “heinous act” cut short a visit to Saudi Arabia.“Those behind this heinous act will be brought to justice ... they will not be spared. Their evil agenda will never succeed. Our resolve to fight terrorism is unshakable and will only grow stronger,” said Modi,who met with Vance the day before.Donald Trump expressed his “full support” to India in a call with Modi late on Tuesday, Delhi’s foreign ministry said.The scene of the attack was cordoned off as police launched an operation to track down the attackers.According to local police officials, two to three gunmen opened indiscriminate fire on tourists in the area, which is accessible only by foot or on horseback, before fleeing the scene.A witness speaking to India Today said: “The shooting occurred right in front of us. At first we thought it was just firecrackers, but when we heard others screaming we rushed out of there to save ourselves.”Another witness, who also did not reveal his name, said: “We didn’t stop running for 4km … I’m still trembling.”Protests erupted in several areas of the Indian-administeredKashmircondemning the attack, with a rally led by rightwing vigilantes in the city of Jammu blaming Pakistan.A militant group identifying itself as “Kashmir Resistance” has claimed responsibility for the attack in a social media message. The group cited anger over Indian settlement of over 85,000 “outsiders”, which it said was driving a “demographic change” in the region.The mountain region is claimed in full but ruled in part by both India and Pakistan, and has been riven by militant violence since the start of an anti-Indian insurgency in 1989.Tens of thousands of people have been killed, although violence has tapered off in recent years.Indiarevoked Kashmir’s special status as an autonomous state in 2019, splitting the state into two federally administered territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.Quick GuideKashmirShowWho controls Kashmir?The region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute sinceIndiaand Pakistan came into being in 1947.Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world's most heavily militarised borders: the \"line of control\" based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.How did the dispute start?After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \"princely states\" across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.What was Kashmir’s special status?Kashmir’s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir’s special status. The government argued that the provision had only ever been intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan – which quickly called India’s actions illegal – and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.What do the militants want?There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed withextreme forcein 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.For Indians, control of Kashmir – part of the country’s only Muslim-majority state – has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists.Michael Safi and Rebecca RatcliffeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.This also allowed local authorities to issue domicile rights to outsiders, allowing them to get jobs and buy land in the territory.Authorities have described the attack as targeted and intended to spread terror among the tourists visiting Kashmir.Tuesday’s attack seems to be a major shift in the regional conflict where tourists for many years have largely been spared from violence despite a spate of targeted killings of Hindus, including immigrant workers from Indian states, after New Delhi ended the region’s semi-autonomy in 2019 and drastically curbed dissent, civil liberties and media freedoms.The Baisaran area attracts tens of thousands of Indian tourists daily, especially during the summer months, when temperatures in mainland India soar.Indian army and paramilitary forces have been deployed to the area to search for the attackers. In recent years, militants have increasingly targeted security forces in the region’s mountainous and forested areas.Kashmir remains one of the most heavily militarised zones in the world and is claimed in full by both India and Pakistan, although each controls only a part. The two countries have fought multiple wars over the region.Explore more on these topicsKashmirIndiaSouth and central AsiaJD VancenewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, the supreme court panel reviewed charges against the second group, which Gonet said held managerial roles.Is coup trial ruling the beginning of the end for Bolsonaro and his supporters?Read moreThe second group includes the former presidentialforeign affairs adviser Filipe Martins, retired Gen Mario Fernandes, former federal highway police director Silvinei Vasques, former presidential aide Col Marcelo Câmara and two federal police officers, Fernando Oliveira and Marilia Alencar.These individuals coordinated actions planned by the core group, Gonet said in the indictment. These included mobilizing police officers to support the alleged coup, monitoring authorities and drafting a document intended to justify a state of emergency.Bolsonaro and his allies have repeatedly denied wrongdoing. The former president says that he is being politically persecuted. He has been hospitalized for more than a week, recovering from bowel surgery. On Monday, from his hospital bed in Brasília, he gave an interview to the local television network SBT and said that his trial was not technical, but political.Under Brazilian law, a coup conviction alone carries a sentence of up to 12 years, but when combined with the other charges, it could result in a sentence of decades behind bars.

But he said this could only happen if Moscow first implemented a complete ceasefire – something, he said, it had failed to do over the Easter weekend.On Friday, Putin announced a 30-hour pause in fighting. Zelenskyy said during this period the Russian army scaled back its military operation, with no long-range strikes and fewer assaults. But it did not observe a genuine ceasefire, and carried out numerous attacks with kamikaze drones, he said.Russia has frequently claimed it was open to talks with Ukraine but that Kyiv made that legally impossible under a 2022 decree barring negotiations with Putin. The Russian leader has previously suggested Ukraine must hold elections and choose a new president before any such talks could take place.There have been no official talks between the two sides since the early weeks after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.On Tuesday, Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine’s readiness for immediate discussions to end attacks on civilian infrastructure.“Our proposal for a ceasefire on civilian objects also remains in force. We need Russia’s serious readiness to talk about it. There are and will be no obstacles on the Ukrainian side,” Zelenskyy said in a statement.Putin and Zelenskyy have recently appeared more positive over the prospect of peace talks, probably in response to mounting pressure from the Trump administration, which has said itmay abandon its mediation effortsunless progress is made.Russia also reported a decrease in fighting during the Easter truce, and accused Ukraine of violating the temporary ceasefire.Speaking on Russian television on Monday, Putin said Russia had a “positive attitude towards any peace initiatives”.However, he has publicly given no indication he is prepared to back down from some of his extreme demands, including the demilitarisation of Ukraine and full Russian control over the four Ukrainian regions illegally annexed in 2022.The Kremlin on Tuesday also warned that negotiators were unlikely to obtain a swift breakthrough in peace talks on the war.Ukrainian officials are expected to meet western allies in London on Wednesday for US-led talks on ending the war. The meeting is expected to follow up on last week’s discussions in Paris, where the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, presented Washington’s proposed plan for a resolution to the conflict.Media reports suggest the US is promoting a “peace deal” that heavily favours Russia. The proposal reportedly includes freezing the conflict along the current 1,000km frontline, recognising Crimea as part of Russia, and a Russian veto over Ukraine joining Nato.Kyiv is expected to respond to the proposal during the talks in London.The US is expected to relay Ukraine’s response to Putin, with Steve Witkoff – a close friend of Donald Trump and his informal envoy – set to visit Moscow later this week. Witkoff has previously held three in-depth meetings with Putin, and his relationship with the Kremlin has raised concerns in Ukraine that he may be amplifying Russian narratives.Zelenskyy said he did not want to lose the US as a strategic ally and said it had a crucial role to play in the peace process. “We are America’s ally. Russia is a historic enemy of the US,” he said. “I believe the US is the real leader. We want them to exert pressure on Russia.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

Alternates step in if a member of the main panel can’t see the trial through.The main jury is more female than the five women and seven men who convicted Weinstein at his first trial five years ago. The verdict marked a signature moment for the#MeToo movementagainst sexual misconduct, which had been fueled in 2017 by a slew of allegations against Weinstein, then a high-flying movie producer of a string of Oscar winners including Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love.‘I want to talk about it honestly’: trauma of Weinstein’s unknown British victims is revealedRead moreBut in a reversal that dismayed #MeToo activists, New York’s highest court last year overturned Weinstein’s 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence. The court found that the original trial judge allowed prejudicial testimony. That judge’s term expired in 2022, and he is no longer on the bench.Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.Drawn from Manhattan’s jury pool, the 12 members of the main jury for the New York retrial include a physics researcher, a photographer, a dietitian, a therapist, an investment bank software engineer and a fire safety director. Others have experience in real estate, TV commercials, debt collection, social work and other fields.One has a high school equivalency degree. Others have master’s degrees. Some have served as jurors or grand jurors multiple times before; others, never.Hundreds of other potential jurors were excused for reasons ranging from language barriers to strong opinions about Weinstein – “the first word that came in my head was ‘pig’,” said one man who was soon let go.Those chosen were quizzed about their backgrounds, life experiences and various other points that could relate to their ability to be fair and impartial about the highly publicized case.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Would hearing that indicate that … Mr Weinstein must be guilty?” the defense attorney Mike Cibella asked one prospective juror on Monday. The woman, who ultimately was chosen, answered no.The prosecutor Shannon Lucey sought assurances that prospective jurors could put aside any position or feelings they had about the #MeToo movement.“Is there anyone who is going to think of the movement and think: ‘OK, that’s just something that I have to keep in the back of my mind when I’m deciding this case’? Everyone can put that aside?” Lucey asked a group of 24 possible jurors. All indicated they could do so.Weinstein’s rape and sexual assault retrial involves accusations from three women: an aspiring actor who said he raped her in 2013, and two women who made separate allegations of forced oral sex in 2006.

These voters were NOT watching black films?”Anonymous Oscar voters have previously admitted to not watching all the contenders in a category before voting in the final round.“I’m bummed because I haven’t seen The Substance or I’m Still Here yet,” one toldEntertainment Weeklyahead of the most recent ceremony. “The first Dune, I couldn’t get through; I’m not rushing for another three hours of Dune. There’s still time to re-evaluate, but I really struggled.”In this event, voters are expected to abstain in that category, however there is no enforcement for this, and category error and ignorance can persist.Other leaked ballots earlier this year suggested a widespread misapprehension among voters that Conclave’s Ralph Fiennes had already won an Oscar in 1994 for Schindler’s List. In fact he has never won, and this year lost out to Adrien Brody for The Brutalist.Other changes to the awards included an update to the international feature film category, to include “film-makers with refugee or asylum status”, and the clarification that the use of generative AI in a film would “neither help nor harm” their submission.Two of this year’s key nominees – The Brutalist and Emilia Pérez – were involved in minor controversies over their use of AI to enhance the voices of their leading actors.View image in fullscreenOlivia Colman in Tyrannosaur.Photograph: Album/AlamyMonday’s statement also provided further details on how the inaugural casting prize will be decided – the equivalent award was first introduced at theBaftasin 2020.Compulsory viewing was enforced by the British Academy as part of its radical overhaul of rules and regulations that same year, in response to the #BaftasSoWhite controversy.Stringent regulations are in force to ensure not only that voters view all the films in the categories for which they cast their ballot, but also that they watch 15 randomised movies participating in the first stage of voting. As with the strict gender quotas in force on the director longlist, and the inclusivity criteria necessary for inclusion in a number of key categories such as outstanding British film, this measure is to try to promote a more diverse spread of contenders.Speaking to theGuardian in 2018, ahead of her Oscar win for The Favourite,Olivia Colmansaid that she would always abstain from voting should she not have seen all films in consideration.The alternative, she said, “feels so naughty. I think maybe I’m just really square”. Colman went on to attribute her response to the fate of Paddy Considine’s 2011 filmTyrannosaur, in which she starred, and which was ignored by Bafta in its best film nominations: “Very few people watched it and it broke my heart a bit.”Preliminary voting for next year’sOscarsbegins in December, with the nominations announcement on 22 January ahead of the 15 March ceremony – an unusually long campaigning period. This year’s emcee, Conan O’Brien, will return as host.Explore more on these topicsOscarsAwards and prizesBaftasnewsShareReuse this content"

Titled Through the Valley, it demonstrated more clearly than ever that the show has two types of viewer: those who primarily know it as a television series and were stunned beyond belief by the violent, unheralded death of Pedro Pascal’s Joel at the hands of Kaitlyn Dever’s vengeful Abby; and those who have played the video game on which it is based.The Last of Us recap: season two, episode two – will this show survive that horrific death?Read moreThe very first scene in last week’s episode appeared to set up Abby’s tracking of him as a long arc, perhaps one spanning the entire season. This would make sense; after all if you have Pedro Pascal at your disposal, you want to get as much out of him as possible. But in the end it was a deliberate red herring, and now Joel is dead. More importantly, the star of the show – the man whose face is still on hundreds of Last of Us billboards around the world – is no longer on the show. Judging by the shocked reaction online (“Players knew this WHOLE TIME that Joel was gonna die and didn’t warn me?!?”), Joel’s death came as roughlyThe Red Weddingtimes a million.But, of course, many of us saw it coming. The second season of The Last of Us is based on the 2020 game The Last of Us Part II and, well, this exact thing happens in that too. Nor was it a closely guarded secret. The Last of Us Part II has sold more than 10m copies. It has won almost 50 awards. And, thanks to a hacking incident just before release, Joel’s death was announced to the world before anyone had even played it.View image in fullscreenDon’t say you weren’t warned … Pedro Pascal as Joel in The Last of Us.Photograph: HBOAs such, Joel’s death has been an open secret for many years now. In 2023, Pascal all but revealed that his days were numbered to Esquire,pointing out that“it wouldn’t make sense to follow the first game so faithfully only to stray severely from the path”. Don’t say he didn’t warn you.If you saw the climax to the first season, you will have known that this was probably on the cards. The story exists in a world where the human population has been laid waste by a fungus. Joel took charge of a young woman named Ellie, who revealed that she was somehow immune to the Cordyceps infection. Upon realising this, a group of strangers kidnapped Ellie, planning to use her to create a vaccine in an operation that would kill her. But Joel wouldn’t let this happen, going on a murderous rampage through a hospital to save her, even if it doomed the world.It was an act of love, but a selfish one that couldn’t go unpunished. A season of television where Joel and Ellie kept having adventures in the shadow of such violence would have been awkward and ungainly. And this is a story where violence begets violence. The Fireflies tried to kill Ellie, so Joel killed the Fireflies, and now the daughter of one of the dead has killed Joel. So it goes.View image in fullscreenViolence begets violence … Kaitlyn Dever as Abby in The Last of Us.Photograph: HBOThe question of which of Joel’s deaths is the worst is up for debate. With the TV series, the fact that so many people knew this was coming meant that it could build a sense of dread far more deliberately than the game did, making more of the missed connections between Joel and Ellie and filling the preceding scenes of violence with more resigned inevitability. On the other hand, the game has you briefly play as Ellie, racing to save Joel. When that ends in disappointment and Joel dies anyway, there’s a palpable sense of agency being ripped from you that can’t be replicated in something as passive as a television programme.‘When medieval times return, I’ll be ready’: Bella Ramsey on friendship, fashion and The Last of UsRead moreWhich brings me to one last spoiler for the non-players. The Last of Us is about to pull off its most audacious trick yet: making you root for Abby. It may be worth pointing out that The Last of Us Part II only semi-successfully achieved this – few games have received such a loud backlash from such a furious minority – so it will be interesting to see how the show chooses to do this. If The Last of Us can move on from Joel’s death and take the audience with it, it deserves to go down as a masterpiece.Explore more on these topicsThe Last of UsTelevisionPedro PascalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ve knownDonald Trumpfor a long time. My job is not to please the president of the United States. My job is to try and tell the truth when I can and when I have the opportunity. I am well aware of the idea that people will not like that.”He continued: “People will criticise that. Elon Musk has weighed in [about me]. That is their right. It’s my right to say the other side.”Trump’s attacks on Clooney renewed last summer, after the latter’s op-ed piece in the New York Times urging Joe Biden to step down for re-election. The actor wrote that Biden could continue with his work furthering democracy by allowing an alternative, younger Democratic candidate to run, who might stand a greater chance of beating Donald Trump.“So now fake movie actor George Clooney, who never came close to making a great movie, is getting into the act,” posted Trump. “He’s turned on Crooked Joe like the rats they both are.”‘I must say, mein Führer, I’m so thankful I came’: Larry David spoofs Bill Maher’s fawning White House visit with TrumpRead moreSpeaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper last week, Clooney said he felt it was his “civic duty” to champion an alternative nominee.“I don’t know if it was brave,” Clooney said. “It was a civic duty. When I saw people on my side of the street not telling the truth, I thought that was time to.”Reflecting on the backlash to his article, Clooney said: “The idea of freedom of speech is you can’t demand freedom of speech and then say, ‘But don’t say bad things about me.’”He continued: “That’s the deal, you have to take your stand if you believe in it. Take a stand for it and then deal with the consequences.”“I have to take that, that’s fair,” he concluded. “I’m OK with that, I’m OK with criticism for where I stand. I defend their right to criticise me as much as I defend my right to criticise them.”Clooney is currently starring onBroadway in a stage versionof his 2005 film Good Night, and Good Luck, about the conflict between veteran journalist Edward R Murrow and Senator Joseph McCarthy, who alleged that spies and Soviet sympathisers had infiltrated numerous US institutions, in particular the government, universities and the film and TV industry.Explore more on these topicsGeorge ClooneyDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She explains how her new album helped her surviveTue 22 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 12.14 EDTShareIn her living room in south London,Emma-Jean Thackraytriumphantly opens the gatefold sleeve of her new album,Weirdo, to reveal the liner notes inside. It’s a dizzying index containing the brass the UK jazz star is known for – trumpet, as well as flugelhorn, trombone and euphonium – along with vocals, guitar, drums, keys, production, mixing and art direction. Her name appears 123 times.“I thought it was funny, my name listed over and over,” she says. Similarly, in the video for new songWanna Die, Thackray plays every member of her band, introduced – in a send-up of the infamous Fast Show sketch Jazz Club – by a turtlenecked Gilles Peterson, her label boss. But Wanna Die is about deep depression, and the multiple Thackrays are a serious statement of intent. The album, she says, “is about survival. If I hadn’t made this record, I would not be here.”The West Yorkshire-born bandleader, 35, is often boxed in as “London-based trumpet player Emma-Jean Thackray,” she says with gentle defiance.“That annoys the fuck out of me, it feels reductive.” In actuality, she’s inspired as much byMadlibas she is Miles Davis; she’s a producer and musical polymath who uses the “jazz language” as a basis for her eclectic multiverse of broken beat, P-funk, spiritual jazz, hip-hop and beyond. Her 2016 debut EP, Walrus, signalled her unique grasp of groove, its rhythms intricately constructed from layers of brass and percussion. By the time she released her debut albumYellow in 2021, she had refined her complex arrangements into a cosmic jazz-funk sound that was ambitious yet jocular – referencing, as Sun Ra did, spiritual transcendence along with astronomy and weed.Yellow won a Jazz FM award and topped the UK jazz chart, and Thackray often gets grouped withthe young London jazz explosionof recent years. But despite having studied at Trinity Laban Conservatoire with many of the capital’s current players, including Moses Boyd and Nubya Garcia, she’s “always felt like I’ve been doing something different. I guess it is jazz. I guess I do live in London. I may know them, I may have even played on some stuff with them. But I’m not in the gang.“Every situation I’ve been in, I’ve felt as if I’ve not fitted in,” she says, including the brass bands she grew up playing cornet with, before she graduated to trumpet in her early teens. “I’d be like: I’ve done this arrangement of this 80s pop song that I think would be great to do! And then everyone’s like: ‘Why would we want to do that? We’re a brass band’.”Growing up, “I was a complete outsider. When I was a child, I didn’t know that I was neurodiverse.” She’s not spoken about it muchuntil recently, but Thackray is autistic and has ADHD. “I was constantly confused, thinking that everyone had been given a rulebook that I hadn’t been given,” she continues. “I’ve had the word ‘weirdo’ thrust upon me, as an insult. So I’ve tried to reclaim it now and to be proud; it makes my art different from anyone else’s.”Thackray started writing second album Weirdo in 2022 as an exploration of her neurodivergence, and a way of “embracing difficult mental health” after tour burnout. But its themes took a devastating turn the following year when, she says, “my life fell apart”.View image in fullscreenPlaying live in support of Kamasi Washington at Cardiff Great Hall, April.Photograph: Kara Thomas/Athena PicturesIn January 2023, Thackray’s partner of 12 years died suddenly of natural causes. She details the desperate lows she reached with piercing directness on songs like Save Me (“I’m not whole any more / Broken pieces on the floor”), and, more playfully, the George Clinton-channelling Black Hole, featuring the comedian-musician Reggie Watts (“I’m in a black hole of despair / Only the beat can pull me out”). The songs are like a grief diary, she says. “I felt so lost. I didn’t know who I was any more.”Thackray had previously believed “that there was no life and death”. She’s been a student of the east Asian philosophy of Tao since her teens – her 2020 EPUm Yang 음 양referenced the Taoist concept of duality and harmony and she has Tao symbols tattooed on her thumbs. “For me, energy is never destroyed, it’s only transferred through people; they live on and are always a part of you. And then you’re confronted with [loss], and the anger stops the philosophising. I thought: the universe is just this cruel, horrible thing. There’s no balance, only pain.”After “six months of doing nothing except playing Zelda and staring at the wall,” she summoned the strength to sing again, knowing that making music would be the way to “get back to myself”, to find “renewed trust in the purpose that I always had”. Weirdo was about the shift “from really not wanting to be here, and then finding my way back to music,” she says. “I’m not saying I don’t have really bad days, or weeks, months, whatever. But throughout it all, there was the want to make music. That’s the only way I can feel emotionally regulated.”We head upstairs to her home studio, a compact room with a back wall of records, percussion instruments from around the world, anda figurine of the 90s cartoon character Dariaon her desk, with whom she shares round spectacles and dry wit. “My studio is my safe space,” she says. “I can shut out all the sensory difficulties, and no one’s watching me.” Her neurodiversity is a “gift and a curse” when it comes to her attention span. “Either I’m banging my head against the wall, and I’m like, why can’t I send this email? And then sometimes I’m in the studio making music and I realise that it’s 10pm and I haven’t gone for a wee all day.”She credits her neurodiversity for her multi-instrumentalism and voracious stylistic approach.On Weirdo, there’s scarcely any trumpet. “Having had this sort of a death and rebirth, I feel like a completely different person to before,” she says, “so picking up the trumpet feels slightly alien now.” Instead, she’s singing far more and going heavy on guitar, too. The distortion and grunge sonics echo a childhood obsession with Kurt Cobain, her “special interest for a while before Miles Davis”, as well as Radiohead.She comes back to the Parliament-Funkadelic influence of Yellow, too, especially on Black Hole. “I love the silliness and the joy that comes with the P-Funk universe,” she says. “It’s not like free jazz; it’s Black liberation music for the masses.” Her interpretation of that sound as a white musician from Leeds, she says, “comes from love and celebration. You just have to hold that in you and know that that’s where it’s coming from. It’s never about co-opting or Columbus-ing and saying, ‘I invented this’.”View image in fullscreenCover art for Weirdo.Photograph: Brownswood RecordingsHer approach to genre, she says, is more “like that show The Three Stooges – three guys trying to get through a door frame all at once. That’s what my musical brain is like. It’s quite telling of someone that has attention difficulties.” Ordinarily that fight for space might sound clumsy or overly fussy, but Thackray has perfected the art of jazz fusion, where the fusion element can be any other sound she likes and the result is totally unique. “Hopefully people can come to think of the genre asme,” she says.The rebirth is well under way: Thackray has just supported saxophone megastar Kamasi Washington around the UK and Europe, has a new show onJazzFM and will embark on an in-store tour to launch Weirdo in May.“It’s been easy to write, and now it’s going to be difficult to do live,” she says, adding that she trusts her audience to be understanding, and that she hopes that “people are gonna find their own grief or struggles reflected” in the album.On the cover, Thackray appears in glam makeup in a pink bath – a proper pop-star moment. She’d wondered: “I’m being so vulnerable in the music. How can I show that visually?” – though her mother “wasn’t best pleased”, she says. She “called me one day and was like: ‘Are you actually naked or is it all done on computers?’” With her previous releases, Thackray had “always felt that I should be anonymous. I wanted people to listen rather than look.” But Weirdo’s striking cover art is apt for an album that is “my story, my life. It’s me doing everything.I made exactly what I wanted to make, exactly the way I wanted to make it.”Jungle, funk and 14th-century Arabic astronomers: piano virtuoso Pat Thomas on his journey through jazzRead moreOffsetting the glamour, a sinister toaster teeters on the edge of the tub. But for all its stark imagery and bleak themes, Weirdo is “about wanting to live”. The closing track, Thank You for the Day, is a classy gospel-soul bop and sublime vocal workout – Thackray’s voice at its fullest power – that underscores a feeling of hope. “That’s the message I wanted people to take,” she continues, going back to the vinyl pressing in her hands. “If you open up the record, I get out of the bath. I was in that dark place, but I made the record. And I’m still here.”Weirdo is released viaBrownswood/Parlophoneon 25 AprilIn theUKand Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

ForEmilyn Claid, that’s meant the leap from ballet dancer in Toronto to the squats of grungy 1969 New York (via Martha Graham’s garden), to pioneering the New Dance scene in 1970s London, to artistic director, academic and psychotherapist (not to mention mother, grandmother), and then in her eighth decade, full circle to being a performer again.It was after realising “I was leaving three-quarters of myself out” that Claid made 2022’s comeback solo showUntitled, appearing strong, sensual, funny and provocative, dressed in leather vest and a fur cloak. She put the work in to get back on stage at 72 (“A lot of press-ups and sit-ups”) but at the same time, she says, it was absolutely natural, like coming home. “Not being at home like a comfortable sofa,” she clarifies. “The excitement of knowing a whole world that’s familiar to me and yet is always constantly changing.”The dance world has changed plenty in the six decades that Claid has been working. When she stopped performing in the late 90s, “it was hard as a woman, as a lesbian, to make lesbian work”. Now Claid is being embraced by a new generation of queer artists. I visit an east London studio to find her rehearsing a “young and feisty” group of performers (Azara Meghie,Eve Stainton, Adrienne Ming, Orrow Bell and co-directorMartin O’Brien) for her new “live art ballet” The Trembling Forest. Claid is rangy and stylish, with cropped grey hair under a black cap. The group collaboratively work out a scene, veering from giggles to solemnity and back again. Later in the week, they’ll be joined by a bigger cast who are all going to be on stage covered in clay. We’ll come back to that.It’s a long journey from Claid’s suburban childhood in Wimbledon. She wasn’t very good at ballet, she insists, yet she was good enough to be accepted into the NationalBalletof Canada after joining their Toronto school at 16. But she was too tall, always in the background, never going to get further. “It’s a tricky one, ballet, because you get so addicted and so stuck into this [quest for] perfection and getting it right,” she says. “When you fail at it – when I failed at it – the shame is terrible. It takes years to get over that. But then when you get over you think, Oh thank God! It’s incredibly stifling. And for women’s bodies, unless you’re born that way, I think it’s very difficult.”View image in fullscreen‘Where did you feel most energised?’ … Emilyn Claid.Photograph: Henri TShe left for New York in 1969 with the aim of going to the Martha Graham school, turned up with no cash and her English accent, and offered to look after Graham’s garden in exchange for classes. “They thought, she’s English, she’s bound to know about gardens.” The planting of daffodils aside, this was scuzzy New York. “It was sex, drugs, dance, risky, wonderful,” says Claid. It was an introduction to many different worlds, discovering the gay scene and basement clubs with “naked men all dancing on LSD or whatever”. She was squatting in the East Village, or living in the apartment of any artist friend who was away. The kind of apartments with a bathtub in the kitchen and you’d put a table on top to eat dinner. “Tiny rooms with beaded curtains and cockroaches everywhere.” She was still a teenager. “But I always felt safe there.”Claid worked with dancers from the Graham company. Nobody had any money but they all seemed to get by. “There were a lot of patrons, I did a lot of modelling for artists.” She got into some dangerous situations, she admits – “I guess it’s a sort of fancy kind of prostitution really, isn’t it?” – but says, “I was tough.” At one point her parents sent someone over to New York to find her. They did, living in a squat behind a house in the East Village. “Not a great situation,” she admits. “My parents must have been freaked out, but there was nothing they could do. I’d left home at 16, I was totally independent.”By the time she came back to London a couple of years later, “I was pretty wrecked”, and suffering from osteoarthritis in her big toe joint. She’d been in pain since she was 11, but kept it hidden. She gave up dance and briefly became a secretary, but the call was too strong. Then Claid metJacky Lansley, Fergus Early and Maedée Duprès, who together founded the X6 Collective and the New Dance movement. There was a real sense of change, of undoing hierarchies, ripping up the rules, smashing ballet’s stranglehold, putting politics at the forefront (their 1977 work Bleeding Fairies blasted the image of the ethereal ballerina and other tropes). They found a home at Butler’s Wharf on the South Bank of the Thames, part of a wider experimental arts scene including Derek Jarman,sculptor Andrew Logan(who foundedAlternative Miss World) and theLondon Musicians Collective. They’d put on performances and festivals, all very DIY, no toilet in the building (“you had to go down to the river”), big warehouse doors open on the sixth floor with a sheer drop on the other side. People came and it was buzzing, but again there wasn’t any money. Most people were squatting and on the dole – that’s what was funding young artists then.What did Claid’s work look like? “I was so angry!” Her whole face breaks into a brilliantly appealing grin and silent laughter stops her talking for a moment. “Big, clumsy feminists doing angry work! It was very autobiographical. I had eating disorders, there’s all sorts of things we were dealing with.” She would speak to the audience, she would dance, “image making” is the term she uses, which could equally describe the work she’s making now.Some of the group went to perform in Lyon, “And I can remember the audience chucking food at us, telling us to get off. Lots of the work was radically, collaboratively devised. Collage rather than narrative. And of course that was not popular with audiences at the time.” As artistic director of Extemporary DanceTheatrefrom 1981 to 1990 she pushed radical work, but always tried to be entertaining, too. (Unlike, she says, the very abstract London Contemporary Dance Theatre who “put audiences off totally”.) Abandoning clear meaning and narrative is still fairly radical, I say. “I don’t ever want to give up on narrative,” she responds. “I just don’t want there to be only one narrative.” As a queer artist, Claid says she particularly embraces the idea of meaning not being fixed, singular or binary. Queerness, she says “is much more now about a movement rather than an identity; a constant process of unfixing normativity”.View image in fullscreen‘What we do with our bodies impacts on our minds’ … Emilyn Claid.Photograph: Chris NashShe’s calling The Trembling Forest a “live art ballet” because like live art “the body’s creating the material in the moment of the performance” based on tasks or a score she gives the collaborators. But “ballet” because there is a frame and structure, six scenes. The clay-covered bodies will be the forest (Claid might be one of these, she hasn’t decided yet), and they’re in what she calls “long time,” death, essentially, so-named because “we’re going to be dead for a lot longer than we’re alive”. And into the forest come the living, a “motley crew of messy, scribbly, scrabbly bodies”. They know they’re heading towards “long time” and these are their last rituals. “There’s the meta-narrative of hope and desolation, living and dying,” says Claid. Will the audience be able to read that? “I don’t mind if they do or they don’t. It’s great if people see different things.”In recent years Claid trained as a Gestalt psychotherapist and that’s influenced her choreography. The philosophy behind Gestalt is relational, we exist only in relation to each other. Claid talks about the narcissism of being a performer. “It’s all about, ‘How wonderful can I be for the audience?’” Now she’s more interested in “What am I going to share with the audience? What can we make together?” When she watches her dancers improvise, instead of thinking, “Which bits do I like?” She asks them: “Where did you feel most energised?” The result for us, the audience, she says, is that we see “something that is alive”.In 2021, Claid combined her work in dance and psychotherapy in the book Falling ThroughDanceand Life, on surrendering to gravity, and in a more existential sense, accepting the void we’re all on our way to. She does physical work with her therapy clients, and sees unequivocally the changes in their lives and relationships as a result. “What we do with our bodies impacts on our minds.”Career-wise, she’s faced the (metaphorical) fear of falling flat on her face. “I take it right back to ballet, the shame of failing”, Claid says, “and then recognising how that is actually a creative source rather than a dead-end.” She couldn’t – and wouldn’t want to – define what success means any more. In whose eyes? She quotes from a memorable decades-old review: “Emilyn Claid gets Dance Umbrella [festival] off to a bad start!” and breaks into another grinning laugh. Audiences weren’t ready for her then. Will they be ready now?The Trembling Forest is at Copeland Gallery, London, aspart of Ceremony festival, 23-24 April, and at Tramway, Glasgow, 10 May, as part ofDance International GlasgowExplore more on these topicsStageDanceTheatreBalletPerformance artinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Here are some absolutely spoiler-packed discussion points (seriously, multiple endings are spoiled!) for the film’s variety of layers, genres and readings.Sinners is a horror film about the highs and lows of the Black experience | Andrew LawrenceRead moreCrime drama vvampire horrorWhenever a movie has an unusual genre mix or bifurcated structure – and Sinners has both – there will be viewers who prefer one half to the other. Coogler’s film is a relatively leisurely crime-adjacent drama for its first half, following brothers Smoke and Stack (both Michael B Jordan) as they attempt to parlay their gangsters’ bounty into a juke joint for their Mississippi community. Then it turns into more of a horror movie, when vampires, apparently drawn out by the supernatural quality of the brothers’ musician cousin Sammie (Miles Caton), show up at the club and try to turn the patrons to their undead army. And the club scenes mean that the movie briefly resembles a performance musical on its way to the horror-action stuff.The temptation with this many genres in play is often to choose a team: why didn’t they get to the awesome vampire stuff faster? Or, why did they spoil that great character-building with a bunch of horrific action? Or, why wasn’t the whole thing a blues musical? But Coogler in his very form seems to reject the hard lines of separation that audiences sometimes want to impose on material like this – which is a particularly interesting technique for him, given the movie’s complicated portrayal of cultural blending. In a way, it feels like Coogler is reclaiming the mixed-and-matched genre space from his former (and possibly future) employers at Marvel, where movies often purport to belong to some highly specific (and sometimes nonexistent) genre, only to play primarily like those elements have been overstirred into a gray mush. I don’t think Coogler particularly meant Sinners as a rebuke to the Marvel Method, but it’s nonetheless inspiring to see how the movie lets its genres overlap while still allowing crucial elements – the flowing blood of horror, the ecstasy of the musical, the process of a crime picture – to stick out as conspicuously as possible.Seeing doubleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/APAs mentioned, Michael B Jordan plays two roles here –the latest actor to do so in 2025, after Robert Pattinson, as clones in the future; and Robert De Niro, as two completely different people in the past. (Is Warner Bros, the studio that released all three of these movies, simply taking their name too literally?) Jordan is a good actor and an even better movie star, and his double act depends more on the latter. Smoke and Stack are clearly different, but Jordan isn’t giving the type of dual performance where you can instantly recognize either one based entirely on mannerisms, vocal affect, or posture. (Neither was De Niro, in case you were curious about a far more misbegotten double-gangster turn.)Instead, Jordan and Coogler use the characters’ twinning in a more mythology-friendly way; in retrospect, it feels inevitable that one brother will be turned into a vampire and the other will remain human, a neat angel/devil separation that the movie, again, complicates in its final stretch (more on that in a moment). It’s this, far more than any specific acting tricks, that differentiate the two men; the respective fates that await Smoke and Stack are difficult to imagine reversed. One of them is bound for heaven even/especially after the vengeance he wreaks upon a group of Klansmen; one is bound to make the best of eternal hell on Earth. The double casting also serves as a canny workaround for Jordan’s charisma; Caton’s character eventually emerges as central, and while that could probably happen with Smoke and Stack recombined into a single character (Caton is very good), having two Jordans on hand is a way of ensuring the movie isn’t thrown off balance – that the audience doesn’t get antsy when Jordan is offscreen, because he rarely is.The magic of musicView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/APAbout halfway through the movie, Coogler stages a more impressionistic sequence, where the ecstasy of the music played by Sammie and veteran musician Delta Slim (Delroy Lindo) gives way to both fiery imagery and orgiastic visions of music past and future, including African and Asian dancers, a Funkadelic-style guitarist, and a DJ spinning records. Even in a genre-mixing, sprawling film, it’s a bold, extended gambit, bringing some Baz Luhrmann into a mix that includes more traditional horror/action/genre directors like John Carpenter and Robert Rodriguez. In what is already one of the year’s most talked-about shots, Coogler’s camera – capturing images popped out to full, towering 4:3 aspect ratio for those lucky enough to see it on a classic, gigantic Imax screen – snakes around the club, taking in the whirl of music, dance and color. As indulgent as it might seem (and it is indulgent, in the best, most crowd-levitating way), it’s also a form of shorthand for the earthly paradise this community experiences for one wild night, before it comes crashing down.Vampiric assimilationView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc./PAThe music at the center of Sinners is given a divine-like connection to the other side; it “pierces the veil” and seemingly attracts the attention of the lead vampire Remmick (Jack O’Connell), who’s quite steeped in music himself, of the Irish folk variety. Remmick and his recently vamp-converted fellow white folks (including Lola Kirke from Mistress America!) show up at the club not to menace everyone, at least not initially, but to politely ask for an invitation to join the party. (These vampires, like many others in other lore, can’t enter a building unless invited directly.) The community rebuffs them, but when Mary (Hailee Steinfeld), a mixed-race woman like kin to many of the Black folks on hand, reaches out to them, hoping for some possible patronage, they turn her; she, of course, is invited back into the joint, and thus begins the true havoc.This set-up evokes a variety of racial politics and potential readings. The most obvious one casts the white characters as a literalized version of cultural vampires, attracted by the undeniable allure of another group’s music and eager to suck the life from it. The fact that they attack the Black characters at night (like Ku Klux Klan members), only without masks, also has strong hints of institutional racism that would outlast the once-normalized hate groups (and come back around, nearly as virulent but inexplicably considered more respectable). But given that the community in question clearly welcomes non-Black members, and how plenty of non-white people are brought into the vampire fold, I read this rich metaphor as more to do with the process of assimilation in America. The vampires preach the value of, essentially, a hive mind that they claim offers equality for all – the drawback being, of course, that said hive mind is also controlled by its originator, not by the people absorbed into it. Sinners is bittersweet about how this process, whether through vampire-turned assimilation or simply the passage of time, can leave more self-supporting communities behind. We’re certainly relieved that Sammie escapes, defiantly holding on to the neck of his blues guitar, but it’s not lost on the audience that he’s the only one who makes it out. Well, almost.Choose your endingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures/APSinners could be said to have about four different endings, broken up by end credits. The stories of Smoke, Stack and Sammie seem to end one way, with Smoke killing the vampire version of Stack, then he and Sammie triumphing over Remmick – only to bring Smoke back into the violence the next morning as he’s mortally wounded while mowing down approaching (real) Klan members. Then a during-credits epilogue – another reappropriation of the Marvel Method! – offers a time jump that further elaborate on the fates of both Sammie and Stack, who Smoke has let live in exchange for leaving Sammie be, allowing him to escape and eventually become a Buddy Guy-like blues legend. (He is literally played by Buddy Guy.) But Stack lives on, as does Mary, and briefly reunites with his now-elderly cousin after the latter’s gig in 1992. And that’s still not all! After the rest of the credits roll, there’s a postscript where we see a younger Sammie briefly playing This Little Light of Mine, which has readings related to both Christianity and to 20th-century civil rights movements.As with the genre-pivoting, a movie with this many endings is “supposed” to be doing things wrong. But Coogler takes a lot of care with his movements through ending; I used the novelistic “epilogue” above, but maybe it’s more akin to a musical coda. Either way, it allows the audience to rethink the monstrousness of Stack (and, to perhaps a lesser extent, his vampire bride Mary), who seems to have freed himself from the assimilation of the head vampire and pursued his own form of immortality. Sammie goes about it the more old-fashioned way, achieving some kind of immortality through his music. What they both agree on is that before the vampire attack went down, that day and night at the juke joint was the best of their lives, reiterating a longing for a space that was truly their own, rather than some kind of compromise with the greater American world. Maybe that final bonus moment of Sammie singing a song of optimism (contrasting with the devil-raising bliss of the blues) is supposed to be a compromise, or maybe it’s a way of wresting the “devil’s music” back for humanity. Regardless, the multiple endings are thematically appropriate; even as he teases out a sense of sadness over what’s been lost, Coogler understands that there’s no one single way this story ends.Explore more on these topicsRyan CooglerNow you've seen itMichael B JordanHorror filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As a gardener, I can wholeheartedly affirm that one of the best ways to enjoy spring is to actively engage with it. Spring is fordoing: cutting back perennials; tying and training roses; pruning shrubs. Over the years, I have been leaving more and more of the garden tidy-up for spring, having once seen much of this off in autumn. Common horticultural practice now recognises the importance of leaving dead stems and seed heads standing over winter as shelter and forage for wildlife, so even my small garden requires a good deal of maintenance at this time of year. Plenty of material, then, to set12 pairs of secateurson.First off, the ornamental grasses – my scattered clumps ofMolinia,PennisetumandChasmanthium– needed cutting down to ground level, their new shoots beginning to mingle with the straw of spent stems. Perennials, includingAster,Agastache,HylotelephiumandEutrochium, with brittle, yellowing stems, were similarly due a chop.Next, the shrubs: a now vigorousBuddleiain our sun trap required fairly harsh treatment, reducing each limb in advance of new seismic growth; the black elder was also scaled back, and there was sculpting work to undertake on my two youngViburnums.Being surrounded by domestic fencing, our little garden depends on the ample coverage of climbing roses: these needed further deadheading and new string ties added to control the rapid new growth (cutting cleanly through string, I often find, separates the good secateurs from the dull).Shock of the newView image in fullscreenAfter almost two decades of using the same model of secateurs, I found a new favourite.Photograph: Clemmie Power CollinsThe great advantage of trying out a range of secateurs was the opportunity to consider new options. Due to their everyday utility, gardeners become very attached to certain brands and models – I definitely have. When I began my first ever gardening job, joining a garden maintenance company doing the rounds of upmarket London homes, the director urged new recruits to use a particular brand of secateurs, for the simple reason that a good pair saves time, money and plants; clean cuts in place of butchery.And so for almost two decades, I’ve used the same model, and thanks to their robustness and reliability, I’ve replaced them only once (after losing a pair down the leg of my pond waders …). Eager for change, I approached the testing with peak-geek scrutiny, registering their every quality as I went snipping beneath an extraordinarily blue spring sky: their comfort and feel, their cut and heft; how well they clasped and unclasped, and even how easily they could be spotted in the herbage if dropped (secateurs are notorious escapers whenever misplaced).My final task in the garden was to plant a new rose, a shrubby, semi-climbingRosaxodoratamutabilis, with blooms that change from apricot to ruby-red. As with all newly planted roses, I chopped its stems back to fresh buds (teaser: saving this privilege formy new favourite pair), and in doing so marked the unequivocal return of glorious, galvanising spring.This week’s picksSunscreen and snail slime: what skincare experts do – and don’t do – to their skinThe best espresso machines to unleash your inner barista at home, tested‘Has the texture of feta, but not much else’: the best (and worst) supermarket feta cheese, testedBeat brain rot: clear your mind with 55 screen-free activities, from birdwatching to colouring booksRainbow vases, vintage soap dishes and crystal bike bells: 15 colourful pick-me-ups to elevate your everydayEditor’s pickView image in fullscreenSpring cleaning isn’t only for inside the home.Photograph: Andy ShawIt’s hard to pay attention to the first beautiful blooms of spring if you’re distracted by the filthy state of your patio or decking.

The criminal gang behind the marijuana farm is thought to have fled after the grid operator cut off the stolen electricity used to power scores of LED lamps.“This was a proper setup,” said one engineer at the network operator Electricity North West, who took part in the raid. “It had a kitchen, television, several beds and even a treadmill. This [was] an incredibly professional set up on an industrial scale.”The engineer, who asked not to be named, is part of a team set up by the grid company to crack down on Britain’s billion-pound energy heist. Across the country about £1.5bn worth of gas and electricity is estimated to be stolen every year, piling an extra £50 a year on to the nation’s household bills.The team at Electricity North West began their investigation after fuses started blowing at a local power substation in the middle of the night. After the substation sensors showed that the power load was unusually high, and thermal imaging cameras confirmed buildings nearby were unusually warm, the police were called in.“It is a growing problem. Good honest folk in this country are paying for this theft,” a second energy engineer said. The engineer also asked to remain anonymous because they routinely work with police to enter homes and businesses suspected of stealing energy to replace the damaged metering equipment. At the moment, their employer responds to 900 calls a month.0:59Footage shows cannabis farm in Wigan – videoMany cases of energy theft involve desperate people struggling to pay their bills as energy debts in the UK rise to record highs. But there are also concerns that energy is increasingly being stolen by organised criminal gangs to power marijuana farms or the servers behind illegal bitcoin mining, loadingeven higher costson to bills that are paid.“The main focus around energy theft is the danger that it causes to people,” said the engineer. “While we’re seeing an increase in case numbers, and energy suppliers are losing revenue, the dangers to ordinary people are catastrophic. People lose their lives every year due to tampering.”Energy theft involves bypassing the energy meter used to charge a customer for the gas and electricity they use. This can range from tampering with a domestic meter, or digging up and re-routing underground cables directly from the local energy network.The rising figures suggest there is no shortage of skilled electricians willing to carry out this work for a fee. But there are also online tutorials which have prompted amateurs to carry out DIY interventions, with disastrous consequences.“We’re seeing increasingly dangerous situations. Our staff turn up in full fire-retardant clothing to deal with tampered meters. It looks quite dystopian. But anything in the house could be live with electricity. I’ve been in homes where people have rewired their meters using wire coat hangers, literally vibrating with electricity and no insulation,” the engineer said.Gas theft has also ripped through communities. David Garner, the director of safety at the gas network company Cadent, leads a team of engineers who investigate suspected gas theft.He said: “If you don’t know what you’re doing when you tamper with your pipework, you can create a gas leak which accumulates to an explosive level. All it takes to ignite this is a light switch, and you face devastating consequences for the whole community.“Two, maybe three years ago an explosion took place which not only impacted the house where the gas theft was taking place but also the adjoining property where, sadly, a young boy was tragically killed.”In late 2022, Darren Greenham wassentenced to 15 years in prisonafter pleading guilty to the manslaughter of a toddler killed by a gas explosion he had caused. An investigation showed Greenham had cut a gas pipe in his Lancashire property in order to sell the pipework, and had tampered with his meter in order to steal gas.“It was copper worth pennies, maybe a few pounds. And for that, a boy’s life,” said Garner. “It’s still something that I find personally difficult to think about. It hit us all hard as an industry. We take this stuff seriously, for obvious reasons.”‘Criminals are the most inventive, industrious people, aren’t they?’Last month, agroup of eight criminalswere jailed by a judge in Liverpool for cutting into the electricity mains and connecting power cables to nearby warehouses being used as marijuana farms by Albanian crime gangs.The men posed as workmen carrying out repairs to underground cables. But police reportedly became suspicious of them because one was wearing trainers rather than work boots.This case was far from unusual, according to Paul Dutton, the head of ENW’s gas theft team. “If someone turns up wearing a hi-vis and starts digging in the street then Joe Public wouldn’t really know that anything untoward was going on.”“We’ve seen people dig up their own streets or driveways to lay their own cables to bypass a meter and connect to the network directly. They might drive up in a van, with the usual barriers and equipment. It’s that brazen,” he said.Much of the network company’s work in tackling energy theft is driven by the activities of marijuana farmers, he added. “We’re not talking about a few plants under a UV light. It’s cannabis farming on an industrial scale: hundreds of plants, often growing in buildings in the most innocuous of places. People will walk past, day after day, and not have a clue about what’s going on behind the wall.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Engineers discovered the electricity meter had been bypassed in three locations, including the pavement outside.In another instance, the owners of a smallholding in Lancashire ran their own cable up the pole of an overhead power line to connect directly to a power transformer. They hadn’t been paying bills to their energy supplier, and had also begun farming marijuana.“Criminals are the most inventive, industrious people, aren’t they? They find ways of beating the system,” said Dutton. “We see both sides. Some [energy theft] is very professionally done. Others are very poor and can cause very serious problems.”Across the Midlands, a new source of energy theft has emerged: cryptocurrency miners.In 2021, West Midlands policeswooped on what they had presumed was a marijuana farmafter drones detected a considerable heat source consistent with plant heaters. Instead, they found about 100 computers wired together being used to “mine” bitcoin, a process in which computers use vast amounts of energy to solve complex mathematical puzzles. In Leicestershire, a cryptocurrency trader was jailed in the same year for stealing electricity worth up to £32,000 at two sites where he operated bitcoin mining machines.‘A rock and a hard place’“No matter what the reason behind energy theft is, it is a criminal act,” said Gavin Straughan, the vice-chair of the UK Revenue Protection Association (UKRPA), a trade association for companies involved in tackling energy theft.The group is hoping to raise awareness of the dangers of energy theft, while pushing the police to ensure prosecutions are aligned with the potential consequences of energy theft.“The cost of unidentified theft is borne by all. As energy theft increases, so will each and every honest billpayer’s costs,” he said.“There are also individuals gaining a financial benefit from exploiting the desperation that people are facing due to the energy crisis by providing misinformation and offering them scams but portraying them as a solution. Much of the time this is fuelled by social media,” he added.Peter Smith, the director of policy at the fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, urged anyone facing unmanageable energy bills to speak to their energy supplier before taking drastic measures.“Millions are already struggling to afford their energy bills, even before the price cap rises for a third consecutive time in April,” he said. “Nearly half of adults in Great Britain expect to ration their energy in the coming months, according to our recent polling.“Sadly, some people are resorting to electricity theft, which is not only illegal but also very dangerous. Anyone who is struggling to pay for their energy should speak to their supplier as soon as possible.”“This may sound trite but I don’t particularly care about recovering the money, I care about saving lives,” an industry source said. “I felt a huge sense of relief and achievement at the fact that we had saved someone.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryCannabisDrugsEnergy billsHousehold billsCrimeUK cost of living crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was a moment of breaking, of the body saying to the mind, enough.Hahn carried on working as a finance consultant, his severe sense of impostor syndrome “whittling away at me” and no idea why. After all, he was the son of a big-pharma business executive. “I had this idea I was a business guy, that this was what my path was.”His family had left their home in New Jersey when he was four. “We popped around all over the world – Hong Kong, Taiwan, Sydney”, where he was sent to “one of those all-boys boarding schools – the cane was not spared.” At 22, he got a job as a trader on the Sydney Stock Exchange, back when there was still a trading pit, a lot of yelling and loads of money.By his mid-20s, he was fully formed in a self he did not feel at home in. “I was one of these international business brats,” he says. Ten years later, “a bit of a nihilist, I got swept up in this world of bigger cars, bigger boats, private jets. I wasn’t feeling any meaning. And I was getting scared because, at some point, it is pretty hard to pack up and do something else.”He was also spooked by a sense of longing, he writes in his magical new book,Angels in the Cellar: Notes from a French Vineyard. A fan of Proust, with an avowed fondness for the 19th century, he recognised he was nostalgic, but this didn’t feel poetic. It felt dangerous, he felt “deracinated”, uprooted, and didn’t even know what he was longing for.“What do you really love?” he asked himself in an attempt to find out. “It’s a great question, isn’t it?” he says to me, smiling now that he knows the answer. “I thought, ‘What would a life look like where you worked where you lived, where your work was your life, where you enjoyed it to the extent that it didn’t seem like work, even though it may be difficult, and where you spent almost every day of your life outside?’”This all stemmed from his passion for wine, and Peter started taking wine classes in Paris, now his main work base, exploring wine cellars and working and walking in vineyard after vineyard. He realised that above all he loved being on the land, feeling the earth and the soil, tending the vines. And so, over two years, he went back to college part-time to study viticulture and enology (growing grapes and making wine). Here he met two younger organic farmers, Damian and Vincent, who taught him about the physiology of vines. Thanks to their mentoring and friendship, he decided to look for a smallholding to farm organically. The time had finally come for a new way of living.In 2002 he found a depleted four-hectare farm with a small Vouvray vineyard that no one wanted – only because the 400-year-old house came with it and needed “tons of work”.Since then, Peter, 60, has been making small-batch organic wine atLe Clos de la Meslerie, where he lives with his second wife, Juliette, and their 14-year-old daughter. His two older children by his first marriage are frequent visitors. Eschewing machine farming wherever possible, he and his fellow workers prune the vines and pick the Chenin grapes by hand. They are crushed on a 100-year-old hand press and naturally fermented, and his friend Philippe brings in work horses instead of tractors to till between the fragile 60 to 80-year-old vines.Work horses instead of tractors are used to till between the fragile old vinesOne day, Peter and Philippe were taking a break beneath a Judas tree in full, pink blossom. Peter ignored his beeping phone, before checking his messages. A friend from his “previous life” had sent some photos from a business lunch at the Ritz: Peter’s wine on the wine list (at over £100 a bottle), a liveried sommelier, ornate chandeliers.Peter admits to feeling momentary pride, perhaps even self-satisfaction – all fleeting. “What struck me was that, at one point, I would have been extremely excited about all that but now, it really didn’t make me particularly excited.“I wasn’t living my life as I did in finance and in many corporate worlds where you’re getting to the next level and you’re trying to get accolades from your bosses and clients. That had slipped away. It was a nice moment but I realised, God, I really don’t care. That was a sort of revelation.”He does care about the socio-economic aspect of the wine industry though. “Farmers get the short end of the stick,” he says. “The price that bottle was selling for at the Ritz or at any three-star Michelin restaurant anywhere in the world is probably 10 times the price I sold it for. There’s also a certain bitterness to seeing that,” he laughs.When Peter passed Philippe his phone, he simply shook his head, smiled and said: “Let’s just do the work.”The physicality of that work has seen off Peter’s anxiety and aligned him with the land he is regenerating. “I no longer feel like nature is separate from me, which is such a 19th- and 20th-century development of humanity.” Through his largely non-mechanised farming and viticulture, he has gone back in time, deliberately so.“I definitely don’t want to sound like some kind of weird New Age guru, butHomo sapienshave been traipsing around this world for 300,000 years, right? So for about 298,000 of those years we were living on the land and from the land. We were hunter-gatherers and farmers. When you are on your private jet or doing deals or working at Burger King,” he continues, “we lose sight of all that.”For him, coming to know the lay of his land, its topography, and the ecosystem within it, has enabled him to be in time – to learn from the past, live meaningfully in the present and shape the future for others.The deer I saw grazing in the vineyard this morning, it sounds like a Disney movie, but I’m part of this“The deer that I saw grazing in the vineyard this morning. The praying mantids that I found on the post. The insects around me when I am kneeling in the vines, pruning, the birds – it all sounds like a Disney movie. But I’m part of this; I’m not outside it.”The weather can be brutal but Peter leans into each season. “I don’t mind if it’s raining or hailing or freezing. You know that when nature throws a thunderbolt at you – hail damage, say, or frost damage – it’s not the same as when your client or your boss is bearing down on you, making you feel there is something wrong with you; it’s nature doing that to you. It’s not on purpose, it’s not personal.”But his relationship with each vintage he produces is personal, deeply so. He loves them as much – neither more nor less – than he loves his own children. “A lot of people don’t believe me when I say that, but it’s true! I don’t have favourites – children or vintages – and I would do anything for all of them.”It’s unusual to be in the company of someone who is entirely at ease, someone joyful, someone who could die happy – and a few years ago he very nearly did.He was out on the tractor, spraying the vines against fungal disease using minimal levels of copper and sulphur (less than one-third of the amount permitted for organic viticulture). It was a steep plot, the 400kg-sprayer shifting the centre of gravity.“I turned too quickly, felt the wheels losing traction,” Peter recalls. “I could feel the tractor going over. I was going down. How long do these things last? A second, half a second? The tractor flipped on its side and went over once.”He records his multiple thoughts in the book: “I’m going to die. I want to be with my wife and children. Who will finish spraying?… At least I will die in my vines.“I was remarkably calm,” he reflects now. “That really surprised me. The only explanation I can think of is, it was because I felt like my life was complete somehow. I felt, I am doing what I want to do, I don’t want to change anything, this is my life. If I die now, it’s not as though I am missing out on something else I want to do.”Angels in the Cellar: Notes from a French Vineyardby Peter Hahn is published by Little Toller Books at £20.

He soon realised he was in a race against time to save everyoneJonathan FranklinTue 22 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTShareJolted awake at 4.30am, Pedro “Peter” Niada was certain a meteorite had fallen near his seaside home, lifting it from its foundations and sending it flying through the air. He took two steps down the stairs, felt water splash his feet and realised the house was sinking.Nothing made sense. Why was the house tilting? Why could he hear what sounded like a waterfall outside? The sound of breaking timber led him to pull back the curtain at The Flying Fish (El Pez Volador), the 12-bed tourist lodge he had built by hand.It was 27 February 2010 and Niada was groggy from the end-of-summer celebrations in the village of San Juan Bautista on Robinson Crusoe Island, more than 600km off the coast ofChile. Staring into the moonlit night, he now saw the island 100 yards away as his house was swept out into the South Pacific Ocean. Only then did it occur to him that they had been hit by a colossal wave.“Tsuuuuuunaaaaaami!” he yelled.Fabiana Persia, his Argentinian partner, was asleep, entangled with Dante, their seven-year-old son, and Luz, their three-year-old daughter. Persia wasn’t up for practical jokes in the middle of the night. “Are you crazy?” she snapped.“There’s a tsunami!” Niada screamed.Persia pulled back the curtain. A kayak thumped into the window as the house continued to sink. Staring through the window, Niada and Persia watched as a whirlpool current sucked fishing boats, nets and entire homes into a swirling chaos. Screams tore the air as others who had been washed out to sea pleaded for help.Underwater, an eerie glow flashed as life preservers equipped with lights (designed to emit bright flashes upon contact with water) blinked from the ocean floor. Gas canisters ripped from homes hissed as they bobbed to the surface, then went silent as they disappeared into the deep.View image in fullscreenThe aftermath of the 2010 tsunami on the Juan Fernández islands.Photograph: Jorge Amengual/AFP/Getty ImagesA guest staying at the lodge leaped into action. Matthew Westcott, newly divorced, had travelled to the tiny archipelago known as the Juan Fernández Islands on a whim. An accomplished sailor, he forced open a window for a better look. Westcott surveyed the horizon and instantly crafted an escape plan.It wasn’t an easy scene to read but a small fishing boat 50 yards away was moving in the same direction as the house. Westcott told Niada he was going to take a chance and swim through the debris. That boat, he explained, was salvation.Westcott was on board the boat in less than two minutes. Niada then climbed through the window – now angled skyward – and instructed Persia to pass Luz to him. With his daughter tucked under one arm, Niada swam towards the boat, battling to keep his child’s head above water and worried they would be whacked unconscious by the whirling wreckage. When he reached the boat, Niada passed Luz to Westcott, then swung around and swam away from safety.Back at his half-submerged house, Niada said to Persia, “Pass me Dante!”, convinced he could ferry his son to safety. Persia refused to relinquish the child clinging to her neck. Nothing would separate mother and son. Together, the three swam towards the small boat. Niada attempted to clear a path through the mass of branches and shattered homes, all the while hearing the pleas of their drowning neighbours.Reaching the boat, Persia passed Dante to Westcott. She then flopped on board, followed seconds later by Niada. They began to spin. The boat twirled in the currents until a surge lifted the stern. Like a surfer atop the wave of a lifetime, the boat careened back towards the coast, slid over a rock-studded beach and ground to a halt, temporarily beyond the reach of the water. No one moved until Dante shook himself into action.“Now, Dad! Now, Dad!” he yelled. Seconds later they leaped on to land and headed away from the sea. An impromptu rescue squad on the beach, dragging survivors from the ruins, screamed at them: “Run! Run! Run!”They heard another wave approaching. Barefoot among nails and glass, completely naked from his abrupt awakening, Niada sprinted with Dante in his arms. Persia held Luz just steps behind. The path was slippery but someone pulled them forward. They climbed 100 metres, scrambling to escape the ocean. Another wave smashed the coast.“We had a cabin on the hill, with some clothes,” says Niada. “Nothing up there got hit. We put clothes on the kids and they went to sleep. We stayed up all night. Only in the morning, when the light broke, could we see. There was nothing left. Then we knew that people had died.”As emergency radio and telephone systems were activated, news arrived of a mighty earthquake that had tumbled homes for hundreds of kilometres along the central Chilean coast, killing 525 people. On the mainland, three minutes of brutal shaking left no doubts about what caused the destruction. But the 700 inhabitants of San Juan Bautista felt no tremor, had no warning that an earthquake measuring 8.8 on the Richter scale – the sixth most powerful ever recorded – had sent a vast wave roaring towards them from the south-east.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of the devastation.Photograph: Felipe Gamboa/EPA/ShutterstockNo one knows the exact speed of the tsunami but the gigantic sea swell covered more than 600km in 49 minutes. When Persia looked down from their perch high above the beach, she was stunned. “It was like an atomic bomb,” she says. “Houses were encrusted into the hillside.”The island’s only village was shredded, four out of five homes smashed to pieces. The police station, the school, the cemetery and nearly all vestiges of government had disappeared. So too had 16 people – a devastating loss to the small, tightly knit community.Niada volunteered for a gruesome search: diving for the dead. Bodies were mixed into wreckage, rarely intact and sometimes identifiable only by a ring on a finger, or the remnants of clothing. Survivors built a makeshift memorial, placing small wooden crosses, adorned with flowers, near the beach. Four victims were never recovered, including Dante’s best friend, a seven-year-old so small he was nicknamed Puntito (“Pinpoint”).Niada and Persia were in shock. This was the same bay where 11 years earlier, on board a small boat, they had held their marriage ceremony. Niada, the son of a professional diver, had been living his dream on the island. Even as a four-year-old, he had walked around the house wearing his dad’s flippers, sleeping with a diving mask, and telling anyone who would listen that he too would someday be a frogman. When he was a teenager, his mother gave him a waterproof Nikon camera, allowing him to combine a love of diving with his passion for documenting the ocean depths.Along with Persia, he practically lived underwater. For 15 years they brought tourist groups to the archipelago, where the inspiration for Daniel Defoe’s novel Robinson Crusoe, the Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, had been marooned for four years in the early 18th century. Now, at the age of 40, Niada had seen his entire life washed away.Flying off the island 10 days later, Niada was in shock. He had lost friends, his business, his home. “I built it myself, cut the trees, sawed the planks,” says Niada. “Everything was gone.”Diagnosed with depression and PTSD, he was given pills, but they didn’t help. He couldn’t sleep or think clearly when he took the medication. And they did nothing to quell the nightmares, as he’d sit up at night convinced his house was sinking. It would take minutes for him to orient his mind and understand that he was actually far from the sea.View image in fullscreen‘I built it myself, cut the trees, sawed the planks – but everything was gone.’Photograph: Sofia Yanjari/The GuardianHis depression continued as the family struggled to find a home. They briefly lived with his mother, had a stint with his father and new wife, and then, crossing the border to Argentina, moved to where Persia’s family had a home. Nothing felt like a place of their own, until a friend lent them a small apartment in the Chilean capital, Santiago. Having a home, Niada says, was the first step to rebuilding the life he had lost.He was eager to rekindle his relationship with diving. “I still loved the ocean but I wanted to go to a different place,” says Niada. He began organising ocean expeditions thousands of kilometres north of Chile, where he could photograph manta rays off the coast of Ecuador. “I needed to be in the water and dive as much as possible.” But any trip that involved leaving his children or wife felt risky. If he left, would he ever see them again?Persia, for her part, developed a more reluctant relationship with the ocean. If she could see the sea from her home, that was too close. Only if she was high on a hill was she able to sleep.Connecting with fisher friends back on the island, Niada built up a seafood business delivering fish, crabs and octopus to restaurants around Santiago. Except for the occasional knife cut, an occupational hazard for anyone regularly filleting fish, he faced little in the way of danger.Then the islands began to call.In December 2024, a team of German divers heading to the Juan Fernández islands were searching for an experienced underwater guide. Niada needed the work and figured he’d be able to handle the anxiety. “I was sad, nostalgic and nervous,” says Niada, who boarded a small twin-propeller Piper Cheyenne for the two-hour flight in February.I was trapped for 65 hours under 4,000 tons of rubble – and felt an amazing calmRead moreBack in Cumberland Bay, on the shore where San Juan Bautista sits, Niada saw a group of seal pups frolicking. It felt like the soft landing that he needed. But as he prepared the scuba gear by the ocean’s edge, he wondered why the small police force and the Chilean navy contingent were decked out in formal dress. When he asked, the answer stunned him. It was 27 February, the 15th anniversary of the tsunami.Leaving his clients, Niada quietly approached a semi-circle of people assembled before a preacher. When his eyes landed on Niada, he yelled: “Peter! What? When did you arrive?”Niada barely had time to respond before the preacher engulfed him in a bear hug. Other survivors – including many of his former neighbours – realised he had returned. Some cried on his shoulder, others lent their shoulder to the now-sobbing diver. Someone pressed fresh flowers into his hand, he joined the procession out to the pier, and they tossed the blooms into the ocean, an offering for all that they had lost.Explore more on these topicsTsunamisHow we surviveEarthquakesChileAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But when porridge doesn’t float your boat, it’s got to be bircher muesli or overnight oats. “I have always been a bit rude about overnight oats,” saysWill Bowlby, co-founder ofKricket, whose Shoreditch arm recently launched a breakfast menu. “But when the weather is warm, soaking oats in coconut water, mixing them with jaggery, then throwing in things like fresh coconut, rhubarb or raspberries is a really nice alternative to porridge.”And it’s those extras that will set your oats apart, says Nia Burr ofEstersin north London. “Flavour a big batch of yoghurt at the beginning of the week with honey and some kind of citrus, such as lime or blood orange, and make a rhubarb compote,” she says. “We then top it all off with a polenta-based crumb mixed with pumpkin seeds [though any nuts or seeds would be delicious.” Keep all the different elements separate, “so it doesn’t become stodgy”, then simply build your bowl in the morning. Alternatively, Bowlby would strain Greek yoghurt overnight (“it makes it really luscious”) and mixes with condensed milk and fresh vanilla. “Serve it with poached fruit and granola – we roast oats, almonds, cashews, barberries, coconut, orange juice and jaggery.”If you’ve got a few slices of bread, you’re also minutes away from breakfast. “The basehasto be sourdough or pitta toasted on both sides with a little oil,” says Hisham Assaad, author ofBayrut. When it comes to toppings, though, you have many options: “Labneh with sliced tomatoes, sumac and pomegranate molasses or balsamic vinegar; hummus ormuhammaratopped with a fried or poached egg, or a sliced boiled one.” And if you want to push the boat out at the weekend, Assaad makes his toast part of a platter, alongside chickpeas with yoghurt, tahini and garlic topped with toasted nuts, and perhaps a little parsley, paprika and cumin. “Or top hummus with fried mince, then mash and warm some fava beans and dress with olive oil, lemon juice and salt, then add some chopped tomatoes and parsley.”You can never have too many egg recipes up your sleeve, either, and Burr has been making a lot of frittatas of late, particularlykuku sabzito eat with yoghurt, za’atar and toast. That same Persian omelette is also good forusing upa glut of herbs. Guardian columnist Tom Hunt softens leeks and/or spring onions in butter or oil, then wilts 350g mixed herbs and greens (think parsley, dill, coriander, carrot tops, spinach, lettuce) – “If you’re short of fresh herbs, add a tablespoon or two of dried instead.” He then mixes six eggs with a teaspoon each of turmeric and baking powder, some chopped walnuts, a tablespoon of barberries and some seasoning, then combines with the greens. Cook in a hot frying pan until set, then pop under a hot grill for about five minutes, until set.Another cracking (sorry) idea is eggsbhurji, AKA masala scrambled eggs, says Bowlby. “Cook them with butter, cumin seeds, curry leaves, tomatoes and green chilli, then make a little green chutney by blending wild garlic, coriander, oil and lemon juice.” Spread the chutney on toasted sourdough, top with the eggs and finish with grated cheddar. Nowthat’sguaranteed to make your morning.Got a culinary dilemma?

First, she trained as a nurse, then tried her hand at politics; then banking. But having struggled at first to find her niche, Brown now leads a ready-meal business ranked as the country’s best place to work in food and drink, and is looking to help others find their way in the world of work.Last year, the co-CEO of the ethical frozen food business took over from shoe-mending-chain boss James Timpson as chair of the Employment Advisory Board network, a government-backed programme started by Timpson which works with more than 90 prisons.She says she “grew up thinking it was entirely normal to employ people with barriers to employment”.Brown’s parents were entrepreneurs who employed ex-addicts in their small cafe and bakery business. So when she joined Cook in 2000, three years after it was set up with one shop in Farnham, Surrey, by her brother Ed Perry (her co-CEO) and his chef friend Dale Penfold, she wanted to find a similar way to “make an impact” and approached three local prisons.“There’s great talent in prison, and great people. There’s a lot of trauma and difficult backgrounds and difficult lives that have led people into prison in the first place. The rates of reoffending are too high, and employment is the best way to stop [that]. So it’s great for society. It’s great for communities. It’s great for everybody, if we can do this.”She wants the government to incentivise more businesses to bring in ex-offenders through tax breaks, such as on employers’ national insurance contributions (Nics) or using apprenticeship levy funds to support extra training. “At the moment, companies that are doing it, like us, are doing it out of our own back pocket,” Brown says.Cook has recruited 250 people through a scheme called Raw Talent, which Brown launched a decade ago to help people into work after prison, homelessness or other challenges. Filling jobs in Cook’s shops and kitchens in Sittingbourne, Kent, the scheme’s graduates make up about 5% of Brown’s workforce.Helping ex-offenders is just part of the family-owned business’s ethical stance, which also includes sourcing all its meat in the UK, providing discounted food for community events, paying the real living wage (which it has done for a decade), offering a profit-share bonus to workers, and even providing access to a holiday home in nearby Deal.The business is primarily owned and run by family, and there’s no plans to change thatNot only is the company certified as a B Corp, but Brown’s other brother – James Perry, who is also chair of Cook – co-founded the UK movement behind the scheme, which requires businesses to meet ethical and environmental ­standards.“We have a very strong independent streak,” says Brown as she nibbles on flapjacks at the company’s headquarters.The group does not sell through supermarkets, preferring its own chain of about 100 shops. It also puts its own freezers in more than 1,200 independent outlets, sells online, and is pursuing new ideas such as vending machines for hospital workers. It plans about eight new shops this year and at least 100 more concessions, as well as expanding its online subscription service, which includes meal boxes for new parents – a key way of winning new fans.Brown says a shift to employee ownership one day has not been ruled out, but for now “the business is primarily owned and run by family, and there’s no plans to change that”. While they do have a few outside shareholders, they are not just focused on “delivering that number in the bottom right-hand corner of the spreadsheet”.Still, there is plenty to be pleased about on the spreadsheet at the moment. Business boomed during the pandemic as Cook benefited from the sudden surge in interest in home-delivered food. While other similar businesses have struggled since, Cook managed to draw in a whole new set of customers.Sales rose almost 13% to about £120m in the year to the end of March 2024, while pre-tax profits jumped to £2.5m – up almost 80% when excluding a hefty insurance payout linked to a cyber-attack in the previous year. The company’s shareholders, half of whom are the Perry family and the rest outside shareholders, paid themselves a £1.25m dividend.Last year, growth continued with sales up by about 10% again, according to Brown. The target for next year is to hit revenues of £150m.The meals are not particularly cheap, with a fish pie for two costing £11.50, slightly more than the Charlie Bigham equivalent – although you do get 125g extra from Cook. Cheaper options include a £7.60 vegetarian cottage pie or £4 Korean-style chicken wings, and there are deals such as 10% off for new parents. Still, the company has put up prices in the last two years, with the possibility of more increases this autumn.Brown admits the going is getting tougher, with cost increases on labour and ingredients, including a surge in the price of beef which will cost the business £1.1m more this year. Costs are also rising for eggs, lamb, cocoa and butter.Brown says that people are right to be concerned about the “state of British farming” and that she would “like to see more government leadership on the issue”.“I think food is pretty foundational to a healthy society. So, I would definitely love to see it getting more energy and focus,” she says.What we won’t compromise on is the handmade, skilled artisan bitShe adds that “the chancellor has made life a lot tougher for business and growth. They’ve said they want growth, but they’ve actually put a lot of barriers in the way of [it].”Brown says Cook won’t stint on the ethical sourcing of its ingredients or the wages of its workers, who stir up great vats of cheese sauce, hand-finish sausage rolls, and ensure every fish pie has the right mix of ingredients. However, the group is rising to the challenge of looking at how it can use more automation in its kitchens.“What we won’t compromise on is the handmade, skilled artisan bit. But there are bits, in sealing and packing, or wherever, where I think we could get more efficient.”The business has already survived tough times, including the “white-knuckle ride” of the pandemic, the cyber-attack, and the 2008 financial crisis, when sales fell 10%. “We squeezed our way through that,” Brown says. “We got really good at cash-flow management.”“I think it just focuses the mind,” she says of the current pressure from cost rises. “We don’t want to pass it all on to customers. We don’t want to take [them] for granted, so we’re having to get smarter.”CVAge49FamilyHusband; three sons aged 20, 18 and 15. “Dad lives with us too.” Two dogs, two cats.EducationMonkton Combe school.Last holidayGirls’ skiing break with cousins.Pay“We have a pay differential of no more than 12 times [higher than] the lowest paid.”Best advice she’s been given“Great relationships at work require three things: a shared goal, clarity on who is doing what, and appreciation for each others’ view and contribution.”Biggest regret“There are people issues I would deal with differently now I’m a bit older and wiser.”Phrase she overuses“Let’s look at the org charts!”How she relaxesWalking the dogs, writing a journal, TV and theatre, friends and family.This is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025.

They were ecstaticPamela Stephenson ConnollyTue 22 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 04.31 EDTShareI’m a thirtysomething woman who has been with the same mansince I was 21. I’ve always known I was queer but was monogamous with himuntil, during abriefseparation, I had my first intimate experiences with cisand trans women. They were ecstatic and affirming in the parts of me thatthey unlocked, as well as the agency I felt inseeking to fulfil desires I had long consigned to fantasy.I can’t imagine going through life never again experiencing the range of emotion I did in those moments.My partner and I are now back together and in some ways stronger than ever as a couple – more communicative and committed to the relationship. I’ve told himeverything written here and more, including my desire for an open relationship. Hehas said he needs time:he can imagine one day being OK with us exploring our sexuality together with a third person, but at present he does not want to have sex with anyone else and can’t conceive of what it would be like to know orsuspect that I am doing so.I love my partner, and I like having sex with him. I believe he’s my person, and I want us to stay together. But my desire for queer intimacy has become all-consuming. I think that pressing the conversation now would be selfish and ineffective. At the same time, it feels dishonest todeny (potentially for ever) what I have discovered isan important part of me. What do I do in the short and long term?You already know the answer: your desires for the heightened eroticism are fully understandable, but as your partner has already stated, this cannot be rushed. You have been clear to him about who you are sexually, which was a big step. Congratulations: it is one that many people shy away from. You also know that acting on your fantasies would be risky, so you have the common dilemma of having to weigh up the benefits of maintaining a relationship you cherish versus upsetting the applecart.Your tastes are advanced, and in order to accommodate them immediately you would have to find like-minded sexual partners who may not line up with your hopes for an all-round, fulfilling long-term relationship. But your partner has not entirely discounted the possibility of future “exploration” … so you have the option to be patient.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

Physical health had also significantly improved, the IMF found, as 70-year-olds displayed the same fitness as 56-year-olds did 25 years ago based on grip strength and lung functionality tests.The IMF warned that governments burdened with historically high levels of public debt could not afford to let growing numbers of older workers exit the workforce at a time when they were still healthy and able to work. Instead, it argued, governments could encourage workers to delay their retirement, slash early retirement benefits and increase pension ages to rebalance the increasingly precarious ratio of workers and retirees.We’d like to hear what people make of these findings and recommendations. Would you be willing and able to work until 70 or longer, or is that your plan anyway? How could you be personally affected by a push to keep older people in work for longer?Are there factors beyond cognitive and physical health that could make staying in the workforce longer impossible for you?

He is one of a lineup of independent commentators and journalists creating content on platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Twitch that people told us they are turning to for political information.While most respondents to our callout indicated they rely on a mix of social media and traditional media for news, influencers and experts have observed a “moral panic” about the increase in young online creators engaging in politics.3:19Abbie Chatfield interviews Anthony Albanese – videoFor at least 20 years, young people have been moving away from formal politics – such as joining a political party or a volunteering organisation – and towards “issues-based” politics, says Prof Philippa Collin from Western Sydney University. Collin researches the role of the internet in the political lives of young people.“It’s pretty common that it has been interpreted as young people not being interested or involved in civic engagement or political participation,” she says.But research points to an increase in participatory politics, where young people “feel a responsibility to do something about the issues that they see in the world, or that affect them directly”, Collin says.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter“They want to have more of a say, and to influence the world around them. They are facing a lot of really big issues, which they haven’t played any part in creating … Think about the housing crisis, or the climate crisis, or various conflicts, or the general state of the economy.”At the same time, young voters have grown up with the internet. Legacy media organisations are increasingly crafting and distributing media in new formats on new platforms, but there are already young creators on those platforms dedicated to particular issues – whether that be groups with a particular focus, such as sustainability and climate, or citizen journalists who “perhaps don’t even have a journalism background, but become important educators”, Collin says.Who is influencing young people, and what is their reach?Hannah Ferguson and her independent news commentary pageCheek Media Coand podcast Big Small Talk were collectively mentioned more than any other independent social media creators by people who responded to our callout.Her Instagram pages have a total of 271,200 followers. Cheek Media Co publishes short reels on politics that attract tens to hundreds of thousands of views. One reel from January that breaks down opposition leader Peter Dutton’s voting history on key issues such as housing affordability and Hecs indexation racked up 1.2m views, more than 40,000 likes and thousands of comments.Ferguson, who has recently interviewed Anthony Albanese and Adam Bandt, was one of a dozen content creators invited to the 2025 federal budget lockup, a move that wascriticised bypoliticians and traditional media organisations.Benjamin’s Punters Politics, Jordan Shanks AKA Friendlyjordies and Juice Media were also frequently named by respondents.Along with his Instagram page, Benjamin has almost 140,000 subscribers on YouTube, with videos on both platforms consistently reaching hundreds of thousands of viewers. He is known for critiquing big corporate industries, such as gas companies and supermarkets.View image in fullscreenJordan Shanks – AKA Friendlyjordies – posts to 1.38 million YouTube subscribers.Photograph: YouTube/FriendlyjordiesShanks, a comedian known for hispolitical commentary, continues to have the largest follower base and viewership on YouTube of the Australian creators mentioned by callout respondents. He posts to 1.38 million subscribers.Juice Media, known for its “honest government ads”, has more than1 million subscribers on YouTube, with videos consistently garnering half a million views or more.Pages such as Toilet Paper Aus on Instagram, Swollen Pickles on YouTube, and Purple Pingers on YouTube – whose creator Jordan van den Lamb is running for a Senate seat for the Victorian Socialists in this election – were also mentioned by callout respondents, as were journalists such as Antony Loewenstein, Jan Fran, former Guardian Australia political reporter Amy Remeikis, and Soaliha Iqbal.Abbie Chatfield, who was a reality TV contestant and host, and who now has half a million Instagram followers, is another name mentioned by callout respondents. Her interviewswith Albaneseand Bandt on her hitpodcast It’s a Lotwerecleared of wrongdoing by the Australian Electoral Commissionafter a complaint by the Liberal party. A snippet of her interview with the prime minister posted to Instagram reached more than 700,000 viewers.Chatfield has encouraged her followers to put the Liberal party last on ballot papers, and in response to the AEC investigation said “there’s moral panic about influencers in politics”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She says there is a paradox here: “On one hand, we have these discourses around young people not being interested in, not engaging in or caring about political issues.“Then, as soon as the media and actors in society who [young people] listen to and engage with start talking politics there is big concern about what is and isn’t appropriate.“This is just another classic moral panic around young people.”Freya Leach, who was the Liberal candidate for Balmain during the 2023 New South Wales election, posts conservative takes to just over 14,000 TikTok followers. Her videos on the upcoming election, frequently promoting Liberal policies to boost gas production and cut migration numbers among other things, have reached tens of thousands of viewers each.The Australian Olympic diver Sam Fricker interviewed Dutton on his YouTube channel, which has close to 6 million subscribers, in December last year. The hour-long video reached less than 7,000 views. Fricker also recently interviewed the billionaire Clive Palmer, and the energy minister, Chris Bowen, on his podcast.‘Talkback radio reincarnate’Benjamin doesn’t consider himself a journalist. He says independent creators are “in a lane of our own”.“I’m not uncovering new stories. I don’t have an editor … I don’t have a team of people making sure my facts are correct.”While he has the social media following of an influencer, Benjamin doesn’t use that moniker. He prefers “video creator”, and says he is a “communicator”.“You have scientists, you have journalists, you have economists.“I feel like creators like myself step into the gap and do a bit of filtering … ‘That’s a distraction’, ‘this makes sense’, ‘let me explain this complex thing in a way that we might be able to understand’.”Benjamin thinks Australians are looking for “authenticity” amid “the clinical way media presents information”.Collin says what unites Ferguson, Benjamin and Chatfield is that they relate to a younger audience.“They are disrupting the traditional discourse around young people and politics, and they are more likely to present as engaging in conversation and an exchangewiththeir audience than other forms of media and political actors who tend to speaktotheir audience.”Benjamin describes the phenomenon as “talkback radio reincarnate” and says the goal is to make politics accessible to “everyday Aussie punters”.The former high school teacher started Punters Politics because “it is getting harder and harder to do the very basic, simple things we are told to do”.“Millennials, Gen Z, are told to get a job, go to uni, work hard,” he says. As younger voters grow up, they end up hitting a wall – ‘Hang on, I’m never going to own a house’.”It is then that young people realise the system is broken, Benjamin says, and want to engage.This sentiment was frequently raised byyoung voterswho responded to the Guardian’s callout. Collin has observed it in her research as well. She says there is increasing fear and anxiety.“Many young people are losing hope that they can have a good life through effort and making good decisions,” she says.At the same time, her research shows young people are increasingly expressing a desire for “a more egalitarian and a more caring society, a society that cares about the people in it, as well as the environment, and also cares about Australia’s role in the world”.“I think there’s an interesting role that the kind of newer and more independent, unorthodox forms of media commentators or journalists are providing, and that is they’re connecting with that search for hope that things can be different.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian mediaAustralian politicsSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Dozens have lined up to be seen each day.As she waited in the queue, 35-year-old Patience Kahindo described the horror she had witnessed at the peak of the fighting. “For the first time in my life, I saw corpses lying on the ground for days,” she said. “Crows and other birds came to eat the human flesh. Sometimes, when I think of all this, I’m plunged into unprecedented sadness.“If someone licked my heart, they’d be poisoned.”View image in fullscreenHundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by the fighting.Photograph: Moses Sawasawa/APThe fighting in eastern DRC has roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide that targeted Tutsis. M23, one of dozens of armed groups fighting Congolese forces in the mineral-rich region, says its objective is to safeguard the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities, including protecting them against Hutu rebel groups who escaped to DRC after taking part in the genocide. DRC, the US and other countries say Rwanda is backing M23 in order to exploit the area’s natural resources.In January, M23 started a rapid advance against the Congolese military and its allied forces in eastern DRC, capturing the region’s largest cities –GomaandBukavu.The recent fighting has left a trail of destruction and exacerbated the humanitarian situation in the region.Thousands of peoplehave been killed andhundreds of thousandsdisplaced.Adding to that, peoplehave sustained serious long-term injuriesfrom shootings and bombings. And some Congolese displaced by previous rounds of fighting have been told by M23 to return their ruined home towns, where they arestruggling to make a living and rebuild their lives.“We have seen that since the clashes at the end of January, the population has been really stressed, and there has been a resurgence of mental health cases,” said Dr Neema Kahatwa, a psychiatrist from the neuropsychiatric hospital in Goma.When the hospital announced the scheme last month, the facility highlighted a number of symptoms that people could look out for and that could necessitate medical attention, including insomnia, difficulty in concentration, unexplained anger, extreme sadness, panic and loss of interest.As he queued to see a mental health specialist in one of four rooms at the facility, Jospin Kasereka, 42, described how he had lost his sister-in-law in the unchecked violence in Goma that followed its capture by M23 and how he saw Congolese soldiers throwing their weapons on the streets as they retreated.“Every day, I wonder of what use these weapons are to us. Perhaps, they were used to eliminate my sister-in-law,” he said. “Mentally, I’m cornered. I hope I’ll one day be at peace.”View image in fullscreenArmed rebels from the M23 group sit on a vehicle in Goma.Photograph: Brian Inganga/APObedi Alias, 47, has been out of work as a civil servant since rebels took over Goma. “I’ve got a big family to support, but there’s no work and I can’t find any money,” he said after his consultation. “I feel the pressure of carrying the whole world on my back. I feel helpless and fear for the future.”People who need to be checked first go to the reception, after which they are directed to the triage, where personnel check their vital signs. From there, they see psychiatrists, who prescribe additional tests and, if necessary, refer patients to psychologists for psychotherapy sessions.More than 300 people from Goma and its surroundings have gone through consultations since the campaign started. Stress, anxiety and depression have been among the conditions diagnosed.Although the consultations are free, the patients pay for other services, such as complementary examinations, laboratory tests and treatment.M23’s recent advance is the worst escalation in years of the conflict in eastern DRC. Attempts to end it through dialogue have failed.On Saturday the government suspended the former president Joseph Kabila’s political party and ordered his assets seized over accusations of supporting M23. The 53-year-old, who ruled from 2001 to 2019 and only stepped down after deadly protests against him, has said he wants to return to the country to help seek a solution to the war.There was no immediate response from Kabila, but Ferdinand Kambere, the secretary of his Party for Reconstruction and Democracy, called the suspension a flagrant violation of Congo’s constitution and laws.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoMental healthAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

For weeks, the separatist party in Canada’s francophone province had been campaigning hard to steal an electoral district in Montreal long held by the Liberals.When the trickle of votes finally stopped on that September evening, the Bloc’s Louis-Philippe Sauvé hademerged victorious by a narrow margin of 200 votes.Chastened by the loss, the then prime minister,Justin Trudeau, admitted his Liberals had “a lot of work to do”. The defeat reflected a governing party in tatters and a leader losing his grip on power.And to party faithful, the Bloc’s win reflected an excitement that the separatist movement was once again in ascendance.Six months later, as Canada finds itself in the middle of a federal election campaign, the heady days of the Bloc’s growing popularity are over. Donald Trump’s effort to trash his country’s relationship with Canada has led to a dramatic realigning of allegiances, with a swell in Canadian pride washing over regional differences.On a recent afternoon, the district of Verdun was bustling and the sun was shining on election signs for major political parties, including the Bloc’s “Je choisis le Québec” (I choose Quebec)posters as they fight for both Sauvé’s seat and the prospect ofQuebecsovereignty.Experts say those efforts are doomed to fail in the coming 28 April election.“Sauvé will get to put on his résumé that he was an MP for six months. And that’s great for him. But there’s no way the Bloc is holding that seat in the coming days,” said Philippe Fournier, a polling analyst at 338Canada. “Things were great for the Bloc months ago. Now, not so much.”The shift was largely the result of Trump’s repeated threats to annex Canada and his imposition of tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, prompting fears in Quebec that further actions from the White House could have devastating effects on its timber, mining and manufacturing industries.Chart showing pride in being Canadian, province by province and nationallyTrump’s efforts to damage Canada’s economy have had the unsurprising effect of unifying a diverse geography in a common cause. But a recent poll found that amid the surge in Canadian patriotism in the wake of Trump’s threats, one of the largest leaps is coming from Quebec – a region that in the last half-century has held two referendums over whether to leave Canada.Quebecers have long had a strained relationship with the rest of the country over recognition of its distinct culture. In the 1950s, powerful company bosses would speak only English to their workers – and often refuse to allow French to be spoken at all. Those dynamics helped spark theQuiet Revolution– the bloodless overthrow of Catholicism and the anglophone ruling classes in the province – and the beginnings of the Quebec separatist movement.October Crisis: 50 years after a bloody spasm that nearly tore Canada apartRead moreEfforts took a darker turn in the 1970s when the militant separatist Front de Libération du Québec(FLQ), inspired by socialist revolutionaries in Africa and Latin America, demanded both sovereignty for the province and an end to its capitalist system.Two high-profile kidnappings – of a British diplomat and a senior politician – ended with a grisly murder.In 1991, the Bloc Québécois emerged as a federal party to give Quebec a voice, serving as a corrective to the dominance of anglophone politics and culture in the rest of Canada. Four years later, in a provincial referendum, Quebec came close to seceding with 49.48% voting for independence.But Trump’s aggression has temporarily dampened separatism and invigorated Quebecers in a defence of Canada. That fervour was on display in February when Canada faced off against the United States in a closely watched ice hockey game.“I have never in my life heard people in Montreal sing the national anthem like they did, before booing the US anthem,” said Fournier. “I’m not an overly patriotic or partisan person, but I had shivers.”Even the Bloc’s founder, Lucien Bouchard, has signaled temporary support for Canada,telling La Pressethat “we are together” in the broader project of preserving Canadian sovereignty. Analysts say the waning sentiment among sovereigntists is simple calculation: an independent Quebec can only exist with an independent Canada.The rise of Canadian nationalism has largely benefited one figure: the prime minister,Mark Carney, an anglophone whose tenuous command of the French language might have weighed on his candidacy in any other election.But Quebec is a region of the country known for its unpredictable voters.“This is not a normal election, and I don’t think a unilingual anglophone would [normally] get this level of sympathy, but francophone voters see he’s making a sincere effort. That counts for something in a place where they’re used to seeing outside political leaders as uncaring about the French language. And second, he has probably the best résumé for prime minister in their lifetimes.”Carney, an economist and former central banker, has flubbed names and key events in the province’s past, an admission he made onTout le monde en parle(Everybody’s talking about it), an immensely popular weekly Radio-Canada program that draws one million viewers.“Obviously, my French is far from perfect,” he told the host and audience.Quebec’s apparent embrace of the Liberals foreshadows a grim reversal of fortunes for the Bloc, who once hoped to win as many as 50 seats in the province. Now, they’re staring down steep losses that could wipe the party out.“They’ve gone from thinking ‘We might be the official opposition’ to ‘OK, maybe we’ll hold the balance of power in a minority government’ to ‘Now we’re just fighting for survival,’” said Fournier.Quebec-centric parties have long experienced rapid ascents followed by perilous collapses. In the 2011 federal election, the Bloc went from 47 seats in parliament to only four. But a recentsurge in support for the provincial Parti Québécois– an expressly separatist party – had appeared to bode well for the Bloc’s political fortunes in this year’s federal vote.“The polling looked good. Everything was going well and there was a sense that voters appreciated the work being done by the Bloc. But then it all shifted,” said Kristina Michaud, a two-term Bloc MP who recently opted not to run for re-election. “It feels as though the Trump administration is calling the shots in this election. He owns the narrative. And with Canadian sovereignty and unity being defended and being talked about, people feel they’re better off with a party that can lead a country - and we know the Bloc cannot do that. But in times of crisis, there is a need for unity.”Michaud worries that an embrace of the Liberals and Carney comes at a cost, cutting out the opposition parties that serve as the “conscience” of the House of Commons and hampering the Bloc’s ability to be a voice for Quebec.“I was elected in 2019 being an advocate for the independence of Quebec, and when I arrived in Ottawa, I became even more certain of my values and that this was needed,” said Michaud. “I saw how different Canadian culture was from the one in Quebec.”To preserve that culture, Quebec’s governing party has passed controversial legislation in recent years that requires all provincial communication with immigrants to be in French and limits the use of English in the legal system. The law also aims to one day change Canada’s constitution to redefine Quebec as a nation, with its official and common languages being French.“There are times I feel like a stranger in my own country,” said Jacob Lamontagne, a business student from Sherbrooke. “We need these laws because if the English speakers have their way there’d be nothing. No culture. No language. We know because they’ve tried before.”But Lamontagne has also seen the surge in Canadian patriotism reflected among his friends and classmates as the threats from the US president persist.“The moment the threat subsides, so too will the patriotism,” he said. “When Quebecers love and are embracing Canada, all you need to know is that things are really shit.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaQuebecAmericasMark CarneyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This week, Google and Meta take legal beatings while Microsoft faces a “tipping point” over Gaza.Google’s big defeat and uncertain futureGoogle suffered another defeat last week in its clash with the Department of Justice, which has nowwon two separate casesarguing the company’s rise to power was aided by illegal and anticompetitive practices. The legal battles have placed the tech giant at the center of the government’smost significant antitrust actionin decades, and left one of the world’s most valuable companies facing an uncertain future.A US federal judge in Virginia ruled on Thursday that Google had illegally built a monopoly over the online advertising industry, marking the company’s second major loss in an antitrust case in less than a year. Days after Google’s loss in the ad technology case, the company’s lawyers were back in court this week to deal with the fallout of its other antitrust defeat – this one addressing howGoogle maintained an illegal monopolyover the online search industry.After losing the ad case, Google now faces not only a threat to its primary source of revenue but a growing chance that federal prosecutors may succeed in breaking up the company that has defined how we use the internet. It’s also part of a wider, years-long attempt to limit the power of big tech that has also targeted Apple, Amazon and Meta, forcing Silicon Valley’s most prominent companies into the courtroom.The trial, which began last year,saw prosecutors arguethat Google spent billions of dollars to acquire ad tech companies in order to create monopolies over how websites sell advertising space and advertisers buy it – allowing Google to take a cut of both transactions.Outlining her decision against the tech behemoth, Judge Leonie Brinkema wrote: “This exclusionary conduct substantially harmed Google’s publisher customers, the competitive process, and, ultimately, consumers of information on the open web.”Meanwhile, District of Columbia judge Amit Mehtabegan a three-week hearingon Monday to listen to arguments on whether Google should have parts of its search empire broken up. Mehta ruled last year that Google broke antitrust laws when it struck multibillion dollar deals with companies like Apple and Samsung to make it the default search browser on their devices. Government prosecutors in the case want Google to sell off its Chrome browser, the most popular in the world, which would be a huge blow to its dominance over online searches.Google has opposed prosecutors’ demands to break up the company as rash and harmful. In the search case, it’s arguing that Mehta should choose a more lenient remedy like limiting the type of contracts it can sign with device makers. Google’s lawyers said they will appeal the decisions in both trials.If Google is forced to divest Chrome, we may see a surprising winner surge: OpenAI, which is seeking to dethrone the tech giant as the portal through which everyone finds things on the web. OpenAI does not yet operate an ads business – it has reportedlytested out a social network– but anything that weakens the financial might of Google would be a boon to the maker of ChatGPT.The big question is what will happen next. The unsatisfying answer is that it will take a while to find out. Antitrust cases are notoriously messy and prolonged, as was the case in an effort over two decades ago to break up Microsoft that wound through the courts for years and ultimately ended with the company intact. There is only so long that Google can delay or appeal, however, and the past week has shown that time is running out, and so far trials have not returned the results they were looking for.Read more about Google’s defeat and the US judge’s ruling.And the US government isn’t just coming for Google: Meta’s on the hook tooView image in fullscreenPhotograph: 2020 Images/AlamyIn spite ofgenuflecting to Donald Trumpat the start of his term, Meta hasn’t been able to wriggle its way out of antitrust cases brought by the US government, either.While the threat Google faces is more severe, Meta’s trial – which began last week – is highly consequential as the Federal Trade Commission wants the company to restructure or sell off parts of its business, including Instagram and WhatsApp.The FTC is arguing that the tech conglomerate has created a monopoly on social networking by acquiring Instagram and Whatsapp. The definition of what market is being monopolized, which is key in antitrust regulation and litigation, is “personal social networking” from 2012-2020, online spaces where a user might share content with their family and friends.With this narrow guiding idea, Elon Musk’s X, as well as YouTube and TikTok are excluded because users there post publicly by default. Meta’s meaningful competition? Snapchat and something called MeWe. It’s so retrograde as to be laughable –what is MeWe?– but it has unearthed emails that indicateZuckerberg did worryabout the exact legal jeopardy he faces now. In 2018, he thought of spinning Instagram off from Facebook to skirt antitrust scrutiny. He also admitted that he thought Instagram was simply better at making a camera than Facebook at the time he bought it.Mark Zuckerberg has blatantly tried to make the trial disappear by sucking up to Trump, dining at Mar-a-Lago and visiting the White House tomake the explicit request to just drop it. Trump has talked a big game about being tough on big tech. When Silicon Valley billionaires began cozying up to him at the start of his term, though, it seemed that rhetoric might evaporate. With Meta’s anti-monopoly trial, Zuckerberg may be feeling he didn’t get what he bargained for. Google, on the other hand, has long been a target of Trump’s ire, so perhaps Sundar Pichai has been expecting a fight.Read more about the case that could break up Meta.This week in Elon MuskDoge unemployment ‘fraud’ discoveries are old finds from Biden era, experts sayDoge tried to embed staffers in criminal justice non-profit, says groupDoge cuts spark questions as employees supporting Musk space launches sparedTrump adviser Peter Navarro says ‘we’re great’ after Elon Musk calls him ‘moron’Microsoft faces ‘a tipping point’ over GazaView image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignMicrosoft is less of a political lightning rod in its home country than Meta and Google. Instead, its role in global politics, specifically in Gaza, is stoking the fires of employee discontent. Twice in the past month, Microsoft employees have disrupted executives speaking in commemoration of the company’s 50th anniversary.Timothy Pratt reports:Protesters picketing the events carry signs reading “Microsoft powers genocide” – a reference to Israel’s extensive use of the company’s AI and cloud computing services since 7 October 2023, as “the IDF’s insatiable demand for bombs was matched by its need for greater access to cloud computing services”,the Guardianreported.The rally and disruption were the latest of a growing number of protests in which employees at Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington state, have urged the company to cut ties withIsrael, after discontent over the issue among some of them simmered for a year-plus on company message boards, in emails and on calls with what the company calls “workplace conflict” team members.Taken together, the protests suggest that more will follow, as well as employees deciding to leave the company altogether, according to present and past employees who spoke to the Guardian.

Just a week after Mkwapatira returned to Blantyre he heard that his friend, a security guard for a church, had been murdered.“His name was Chikumbutso Masina and we used to chat almost every day. We looked alike and it was painful when people missed him because they used to ask me questions like, “Oh we heard that you had died?” It really touched me and I will never forget,” he says.Like his late friend, Mkwapatira, 49, lives with albinism, a genetic disorder marked by an absence of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes. A 2018census peggedthe number of people living in Malawi with albinism at 134,636, or 0.8% of the population. Stigma and a lack of reporting means the true number could be higher.People with albinism have been targeted, attacked and even killed for their body parts, which some believe bring luck and have healing properties. Since 2014, the country has recordedmore than 170crimes against people with albinism, including murders, abductions and grave tampering.There have been a few successful prosecutions, includinga much-publicised casein 2020 in which 12 people, including apriest, several police officers and a medical practitioner, were convicted over the 2018 murder and dismembering of 22-year-old MacDonald Masambuka. That case still has political ramifications after some of the suspectsalleged the involvementof senior politicians, but government inquiries into killings of people with albinism have been shelved.We realised that people were not disappearing but were being killed and abductedTonney MkwapatiraLast month, Mkwapatira, a school teacher, took a lone protest march through Blantyre demanding the release of the findings of at least two government commissions of inquiry instituted in the past few years, including one in 2019 by the then president, Peter Mutharika. Like many activists, he believes it could shed light on the origins of the violence against people with albinism.“We hope and believe that in that inquiry there are guidelines, resolutions and recommendations.”Mkwapatira was one of three siblings born with albinism in a family of nine children. “To be honest, we didn’t meet challenges while growing up,” he says. “I met some challenges for the first time while at secondary school, that’s when I realised my life and other people’s are different.”View image in fullscreenIn March, Tonney Mkwapatira went on a lone march through Blantyre.Photograph: Thoko Chikondi/The GuardianHe studied teaching, then started work at a primary school in a remote area in the Machinga region where he became concerned by the challenges that children with albinism were facing – including accessing health and skincare. He formed an organisation with two of his brothers called Albino Association of Malawi. “I was lucky that I was employed by the ministry of education immediately after passing the examination as a teacher.“When I was in Machinga, I was observing what children were going through and this reminded me of my own experience,” he says. “When I met them, some were on the edge of dropping out and that’s why I decided to set up the organisation.”He credits much of his passion as an activist to Cuthbert Kazingatchire, a teacher with albinism who inspired him to start working with schools across Malawi, dispelling stigma and myths.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

[The UN] found that this is mostly common as the country isheading to elections. And when we did our own investigation we found the same and that some political leaders were behind the attacks to assist them win elections,” he says.Malawi is due to hold a general election in September.“I think the reason why they are afraid to release [findings of the inquiries] is because of the names who were mentioned.”Bonface Massah, former executive director for Standing Voice, a charity for the rights of people with albinism, described the government’s failure to release the results of inquiries as “unfortunate” and commended Mkwapatira’s efforts.“We are dealing with a life and death situation. There is no point of an inquiry if the results are never shared to the victims and even never shared to the state,” he says.After his petition to the Blantyre district commissioner’s office, Mkwapatira received a letter of acknowledgment that “advised him” not to hold vigils at the office of the president.But he says, the struggle is far from over. “I feel pain that we haven’t reached the targets that we set. To educate people with albinism and to go to the root cause of the atrocities. We still don’t know where this is coming from.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentAlbinismMalawiAfricaGlobal educationGlobal healthHuman rights (Global development)featuresShareReuse this content"

Harvard is one of several institutions hit in recent weeks with huge funding cuts and demands they relinquish significant institutional autonomy.Foreign students sue Trump officials over revoked visas as 1,000 affectedRead moreThe signatories come from large state schools, small liberal arts colleges and Ivy League institutions, including the presidents of Harvard,Princeton and Brown.In the statement, the university presidents, as well as the leaders of several scholarly societies say they speak with “one voice” and call for “constructive engagement” with the administration.“We are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight,” they write. “However, we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses.”Harvard’s lawsuit comes after the administration announced it would freeze $2.3bn in federal funds, andDonald Trumpthreatened to revoke its tax-exempt status, over claims the university failed to protect Jewish students from pro-Palestinian protests. The suit and the statement, taken together, mark an increasingly muscular response from universities following what initially appeared to be a tepid approach.While some university leaders have in recent weeks criticised the administration and indicated they will not abide by its demands, the statement marks the first time presidents have spoken out collectively on the matter. The joint condemnation followed a convening of more than 100 university leaders called by the AAC&U and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences last week to “come together to speak out at this moment of enormity”, said Lynn Pasquerella, the president of the AAC&U.Pasquerella said that there was “widespread agreement” across a variety of academic institutions about the need to take a collective stand.Harvard faculty organize amid anxiety university will capitulate to TrumpRead more“Much has been written about this flood-the-zone strategy that’s being used in the current attacks on higher education, and it’s a strategy designed to overwhelm campus leaders with a constant barrage of directives, executive orders and policy announcements that make it impossible to respond to everything all at once,” she said, explaining why it has taken until now for a joint response. “Campus leaders have had a lot to deal with over the past few months, and I think that’s part of the reason, but it’s also the case that they are constrained by boards, by multiple constituencies who are often asking them to do things that are at odds with one another.”The Trump administration has issued a barrage of measures aimed at universities the right has described as “the enemy” – some under the guise of fighting alleged antisemitism on campuses and others in an explicit effort to eradicate diversity and inclusion initiatives. Billions in federal funds are under threat unless universities comply with extreme demands, such as removing academic departments from faculty control, “auditing” the viewpoints of students and faculty, and collaborating with federal authorities as they target international students for detention and deportation. Along with its actions against Harvard,it has threatened and in some cases withheld millions more from Cornell, Northwestern, Brown, Columbia, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania.Harvard is among the top recipients of federal fundingColumbia haslargely acceptedthe administration’s requirements to restore funding,including placing anacademic departmentunder outside oversight.The measures against the schools, which are already upending academic research, undermine longstanding partnerships between the federal government and universities, and are contributing to an atmosphere of repression, the statement’s signatories note.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a Labour leadership candidate he signed up to a pledge “that trans women are women”, and helater criticisedthe then Labour MP Rosie Duffield, who now sits as an independent, for saying only women could have a cervix.Asked by ITV West Country if he would repeat that trans women are women, Starmer replied: “I think the supreme court has answered that question.” Pressed on his view, he said: “A woman is an adult female, and the court has made that absolutely clear. I actually welcome the judgment because I think it gives real clarity. It allows those that have got to draw up guidance to be really clear about what that guidance should say.“So I think it’s important that we see the judgment for what it is. It’s a welcome step forward. It’s real clarity in an area where we did need clarity. I’m pleased it’s come about. We need to move and make sure that we now ensure that all guidance is in the right place according to that judgment.”SomeLabourMPs have expressed concern that the ruling could have serious consequences for transgender people.But earlier on Tuesday,Bridget Phillipson, who holds the equalities brief alongside her job as education secretary, argued that the ruling was necessary.Phillipson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Before I was an MP I managed a women’s refuge, so I know more than most how important it is that women, especially those who have experienced male violence, sexual violence and trauma, are able to access safe therapeutic spaces, and alongside that, that we make sure that everyone in our society is treated with dignity and respect.”Asked about differing opinions within Labour on the ruling, Phillipson said: “I speak for the government on this matter, and I can be crystal clear with you that we welcome the ruling.”2:07Equalities minister tells MPs the UK government will protect single-sex spaces – videoShe said the Equality and Human Rights Commission would work with ministers to create new guidance on how the ruling would work in practice.Court ruling on ‘woman’ at odds with UK Equality Act aim, says ex-civil servantRead morePushed on the specifics of which toilet a transgender woman would be required to use from now on, Phillipson confirmed that if only single-sex facilities were available it would need to be the male toilet – but she said it was important that “everyone has the ability to access services that are safe and appropriate and respect their privacy and dignity”.She added: “Of course, where it comes to provisions such as changing facilities, hospital facilities and others, there needs to be appropriate and available services there for all people, including trans people.”In terms of toilets, Phillipson said, many places provided unisex or self-contained facilities, and these could be used by transgender people. However, under changes to building regulations introduced under the last government and not changed since, new public buildings in Englandmust prioritise single-sex toilets, providing universal toilets only “where space allows”.Phillipson said that of greater importance was the impact on spaces where people spend long periods of time, such as hospital wards, rape crisis centres and women’s refuges.“I think it is important and welcome that the supreme court have put beyond doubt that providers can make sure that is done on the basis of biological sex,” she said. “I do believe it is important that when women have experienced male violence they are able to heal, that they are able to access the therapeutic support that is required.“What they have said consistently, and what campaigners have worked for over many decades, is to ensure that that provision does exist and can be single-sex. And the ruling has made that clear, and made it clear beyond any doubt.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerBridget PhillipsonLabourTransgenderWomenGenderEquality Act 2010newsShareReuse this content"

That was the question posed in a recent academic experiment. The answers mattered: real money was handed out as a result to some randomly chosen participants.The average person gave away about half the money and kept the rest. But what if you had been told beforehand that the vast majority of other people think climate action is really important? Might you have given more to the charity?That is what a second experiment tested. Before dividing the cash, these participants were told that 79% of people thought citizens should try to fight the climate crisis. This mattered, because in earlier questions people had significantly underestimated the proportion at just 61%. Being informed about the true level of support boosted the donations by $16 for each person.The experiment was in the US, but the illusion that climate action is not popular is global. So imagine dispelling that myth: such a shift, experts say, could be a gamechanger, pushing the world over a social tipping point into unstoppable climate progress.Such a communication campaign, low-cost and scalable, could be among the most powerful tools available to fight the climate crisis, they say. Decades of psychological research indicates that correcting such misunderstandings can change people’s views across a swathe of issues, from participating in protests to voting for Donald Trump.“We’re sitting on an enormous potential climate movement,” said Prof Anthony Leiserowitz, at Yale University in the US. “It’s latent. It hasn’t been activated or catalysed. But when you break through these perception gaps, you help people understand that they’re not alone and there is in fact a global movement.”Silent majorityThe research started with a simple goal, says Prof Teodora Boneva, at the University of Bonn, Germany, who with colleagues undertook the experiments: “We wanted to make a difference to the world. So we asked ourselves, as social scientists and economists: what kind of research can we do?”Their biggest result was a huge, globe-spanning survey that revealed the remarkable fact that people across the world are united in wanting action to fight the climate crisis but remain a silent majority, because theywrongly think only a minority share their views.Perception gap on the willingness to contribute income to fight global warming“Before, just like everyone else, we would have underestimated the support,” she says. “So when we saw the numbers coming in, we thought: ‘Wow!’ We had no idea we would find such consistent patterns in so many countries.”The team found 89% of people across the world wanted their national governments to do more to fight global heating. More than two-thirds said they were willing to give 1% of their income to fight the climate crisis. Crucially, however, they thought only a minority of other people – 43% – would be willing to do the same.The survey involved 130,000 people in 125 countries, which account for 96% of the world’s carbon emissions, and waspublished in the journal Nature Climate Change. People in China, the world’s biggest polluter, were among the most concerned, with 97% saying its government should do more to fight the climate crisis and four out of five willing to give 1% of their income. The world’s second biggest polluter, the US, was near the bottom, but still had three-quarters of its citizens saying its government should do more and almost half willing to contribute.A global average of 89% feel that their governments should do more to fight global warmingEven in the petrostates of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the vast majority – about 80% – were willing to give 1% of their income to climate action. How many of these wanted more government action is unknown: these countries did not allow the question to be asked.Those feeling the heat most directly had the strongest pro-climate views. Those in rich countries were significantly less willing to contribute 1%. And the countries where people most strongly wanted to fight the climate crisis had implemented significantly more climate policies, the researchers found. The more strongly people believed their fellow citizens would contribute their money to climate action, the more likely they were to give themselves, as Boneva’s experiments with the $450 pots showed.Citizens of wealthier countries are less willing to contribute 1% of their income to fight climate change“These positive interactions suggest that a change in one factor can unlock potent, self-reinforcing feedback cycles, triggering social-tipping dynamics,” the team concluded. “Our results suggest a concerted effort to correct these misperceptions could be a powerful intervention, yielding large, positive effects.”Deep desireA single survey, such as that by Boneva and colleagues, is fascinating – but perhaps you are thinking it could be a freak result. It is not. Many large studies have shown that the public desire for climate action is deep and global, and that the misperceptions that fuel a “spiral of silence” on climate are found wherever researchers look.A UN poll in 2024 – dubbed thePeople’s Climate Vote– questioned 75,000 people in countries representing 90% of the global population. It found 80% wanted their countries to strengthen their climate commitments. Another recentsurvey of 40,000 peoplein 20 of the world’s most polluting countries found that 86% of people thought the same.How the question is phrased can change, but people’s hunger for climate action does not. Asurvey of 140,000 people(pdf) in 187 countries and territories by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication asked how high a priority climate change should be for the government of their country: 89% of people said very high, high or medium, with 67% saying very high or high.The perception gaps are real too. A US study from 2022 found people thought onlyabout 40% of their fellow citizens supported climate policies: the real proportion was about 75%. An earlier study found thesame in China.Other commonly held beliefs have been revealed as false, including the idea that people in rich nations are unwilling to give money to poorer nations to help fight the climate crisis. Astudy testing support for the redistribution of moneyfrom a global emissions trading scheme from the rich to the poor found the scheme was backed by 76% of Europeans and 54% of those in the US.“There is a silent majority in favour of [action on] climate change,” said Dr Adrien Fabre, at the International Centre for Research on Environment and Development in France, who led the study. “Making people aware of this would help a lot and bring hope. I think a lot of people are self-censoring and not fighting or voting [for climate action] because they think that their ideas are not in the zeitgeist.”“There is also majority support for global redistribution policies, even among people in high-income countries who understand that they would have to pay for it,” said Fabre. “This is because people attach value to the human rights and wellbeing of fellow human beings and to a stable climate.”But is this huge support for climate action in surveys actually sincere, or is it just people saying what they think the researchers want to hear?Fabre, Boneva and other academics routinely test the reliability of information from surveys using numerous tools. These include comparing people’s answers with their real-world behaviour, for example, finding correlations between people’s stated willingness to pay money for climate action and their actual donations to climate charities.Other tests link their answers to real-world consequences, such as telling them their answers would be sent to the government, or by hiding the climate questions among others so the respondents cannot guess the “right” answer.In any case, Fabre said: “Polls are rarely wrong by more than 5%.” That can make a big difference in tight elections, but not when talking about large majorities such as the 89% wanting more climate action from their governments.Political illusionsDo you think politicians suffer under the same illusions about the popularity of climate action as the public? You might think their political antennas are finely tuned to public opinion, but they are not – sometimes wildly underestimating public views. And that matters, said Dr Niall McLoughlin, at Climate Barometer, which analyses climate opinions in the UK.The group found in 2024 that72% of the UK public supported onshore windbeing built in their areas, but only 19% of MPs thought a majority of their constituents did so. “That was a barrier to the approval and rollout of developments,” the analysts concluded. Similar results have beenfound in the US Congresson carbon regulations.Climate action is backed even by those who vote for political parties that are explicitly opposed to it, according to the UK’s More in Common thinktank. The rightwing populist Reform UK party recently labelled climate concern “hysteria” but 62% of thepeople who voted for the party in 2024said it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change.The apparent contradiction is explained by the fact that very few (4%) Reform voters said the party got their vote because of its environmental policies. Instead, 72% said it was because of its hardline anti-immigration policies.Boneva said: “Informing the policy debate on climate issues can be very helpful. If we make politicians more aware of what the people in their country want, they might actually act on the people’s preferences.”Social creaturesMost people are social creatures, highly influenced by what others do and say. That is why correcting mistaken beliefs about the views of your fellow citizens can make an impact on what you think and do. There is alot of researchshowing this can shift people’s views on a range of social justice issues.First, people are drawn towards “social norms”, the perceived standard of acceptable behaviour. “There is a really strong motive among people to try to adhere to what they think is socially desirable,” said Boneva. “This has been shown in many, many different contexts.”People are also “conditional cooperators”: they are more likely to contribute to the public good if they think others are doing the same. “This motive has also been studied very extensively,” Boneva said. “If everyone else in a shared home is cleaning the dishes, you will do it too. If everyone else is just leaving their stuff, you won’t bother either.”Studieshave shown thattelling peoplehow popular environmental action is with others can increase their own actions, for example insaving energyandgreen living. Correctingmisperceptions among US citizensabout the climate views of people in China increased support for a climate treaty.However, studies specifically on green issues are relatively rare to date and have shown mixed results, said Dr Sandra Geiger, at Princeton University in the US. Her soon-to-be published work in 11 countries did show asmall increase in people’s willingnessto talk about the climate crisis when they were told a majority agreed with them.That could be important, she said: “Correcting these misperceptions can disrupt thisspiral of silence. If you then believe that a majority agrees with you, you’re more likely to talk about the issue and this, in turn, corrects misperceptions in other people.”But correcting the misperception did not lead to people putting more priority on government climate action, or living greener lives themselves, Geiger said. Anotherrecent study in 63 countriesfound correcting misperceptions had no impact on people’s climate views, as did another on the acceptance ofcarbon taxes.The impact of dispelling mistaken views might depend on how it is corrected, for example, using stories rather than data, or correcting repeatedly not just once. “We haven’t really found out yet,” said Geiger.Other barriers might also remain, such as entrenched ideologies.But she highlighted one approach clearly shown to work: correcting people’s misperception about theproportion of climate scientiststhat agree that global heating is human-caused and a serious problem, which is extremely high.Despite the varying results to date, Geiger still backs campaigns to correct misperceptions: “People deserve to know, and campaigns are cheap and scalable.”Breaking the silenceWhy do these collective illusions about the level of support for climate action exist at all? What is the root cause? The answer remains uncertain but is likely to be a complex mix of human psychology – people tend to think worse of others than themselves, for example – and fossil-fuelled disinformation.“One reason is just fundamentally human, because we can’t easily read the hearts and minds of our fellow human beings,” said Leiserowitz. “It’s made doubly hard because climate change is an issue that is abstract and often cloaked in scientific information.”“A third critical reason is the existence of a very large, sophisticated, well-funded and longstanding misinformation campaign being driven by the fossil fuel industry and its allies, sowing doubt and division to maintain their profits,” he said.This campaign has acted as an “enormous megaphone” for the small but vocal minority that dismiss climate science – about 10% in the US – he said: “As a result, they tend to dominate the public square. Climate change has joined sex, religion and politicsas a taboo topicat the Thanksgiving Day table. So communicating social norms is one of the most powerful interventions you can make.”What about today’s rapidly changing geopolitics, with rising nationalism, Trump entrenching climate denial in the US, and the threat of trade wars and recessions? This makes the data on people’s real climate views more important than ever, said Cassie Flynn, the global director of climate change at the UN Development Programme, which ran the People’s Climate Vote.“People are actually very multilateral,” she said. “The result that always sticks with me is this: 86% of people thought that countries should put aside their differences on other issues and work together. People understand our fates are tied together when it comes to the climate crisis and they want world leaders to act on it.”And everyone can help break the “spiral of silence”,according toProf Cynthia Frantz, at Oberlin College in the US: “[Change] simply requires that people be exposed, over and over, from sources they trust or identify with, to the fact that they are not alone in their concern and their willingness to take action.”Frantz said: “The empowering truth is that every public statement counts, and the more diverse the voices, the more effective the message will be.”This story is part ofthe 89% project, an initiative of the global journalism collaborationCovering Climate Now.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisThe 89% projectGreen politicsClimate science scepticism and denialUnited NationsClimate scienceGreenhouse gas emissionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He substituted a plush apostolic apartment for a simple room within theVaticanwalls and, unlike his predecessors, did not spend his summers in Castel Gandolfo, an opulent 12th-century fortress close to Rome.These humble gestures set the tone for much of Francis’s 12-year papacy, with one of his final acts being to simplify papal funeral rites, breaking with longstanding Vatican tradition.Pope Francis delivers his first addressGuardian“If you think back to just a few years ago when [the former] Pope Benedict was buried, we saw all the pomp and circumstance of the Vatican on display,” said Chris White, the Vatican correspondent for National Catholic Reporter. “But Francis has done away with all of that.”Benedictabdicated in 2013, the first pope to do so in 600 years, but he was still given apapal funeral in 2022. His embalmed body, dressed in red papal mourning robes, was laid out on a casket covered with a gold cloth and raised on a pedestal in front of the altar in St Peter’s Basilica, where people could pay tribute.0:46Thousands queue to pay respects to Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican – videoTraditional papal funerals involved dead popes having three coffins – one made out of cypress wood, one of lead and one of elm, which are placed one inside the other before the body is placed inside and then buried in the Vatican grottoes beneath St Peter’s.But Francis shunned these rituals when he approved the simplified rules in April 2024. People will still be able to see his body in the basilica, but his remains will be placed in one simple coffin made of wood and lined with zinc, and will not be raised on a platform. The coffin will remain open until the night before the funeral.Conclave: the Vatican’s secret process for choosing a new popeRead more“Francis made it very clear that he didn’t want his body put on display, he didn’t want to be idolised, so there will be none of that sort of ritual,” added White. “I think he was very conscious, as he was throughout his whole papacy, of the theatrics of [the Vatican], and especially with a funeral, when all the eyes of the world are on the Catholic church – he wants to send a signal not of riches, not of wealth, but of simplicity.”The past two papal funerals, including that ofPope John Paul II in 2005, were held about six days after the death, and the same is expected for Francis.However, in an interview in late 2023, Francis said he would not be buried in the Vatican and had instead prepared his tomb at the Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome’s Esquilino neighbourhood, where he went to pray before and after trips overseas.The procession involving the transfer of his coffin from the Vatican to Esquilino, which would mean a journey of two or three miles through central Rome, would inevitably involve the Vatican’s Swiss Guards, the world’s smallest army, although it is unclear if a plan was drawn-up before Francis’s death. “We follow papal funeral protocol but we don’t know exactly what that might be until a pope has died,” said a source for the guards.However, White expected the procession to be “very scaled back”.“It won’t be a long, elaborate procession,” he said. “Past popes in decades and centuries gone by have had their body taken from village to village. Francis will have none of that, it will be a very simple ceremony.”Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismThe papacyChristianityVaticanReligionItalyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Originally published in Danish byPolitikenLine VaabenTue 22 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 17.19 EDTShareRené Damgaard, 67, lies in a hospital bed in the palliative care unit at Hvidovre hospital outside Copenhagen. It’s the first evening of May, and the window is open, letting mild air and the sound of a blackbird singing into the room.“This is the kind of weather you love the most. When you usually stand and fish at the sandbank,” says his niece, 53-year-old Mette Damgaard. She is leaning over the bed, her face very close to his. She has been sitting like this for a long time.René has his eyes closed, and his mouth is slightly open. The evening light falls across his gaunt face, and he looks as though he is sleeping. He is not; he is dying.“I will take care of you,” Mette whispers.He nods. She strokes his hand and squeezes it.“You can let go now, René.”There is a moment of silence. Then he whispers: “Remember to say goodbye to everyone from me.”“I will, René. I promise.”The way we die is a topic of a heated debate in Denmark, as in many other countries including the UK. The government wants to introduce medical aid in dying, and in 2023 set up a committee, which presented its various opinions in January this year. Palliative care is often highlighted as a counterweight to the offer ofassisted dying. To witness the treatment of terminally ill patients, I was given access to the palliative care unit, section 126, at Hvidovre hospital for 10 days in April and May 2024.Unlike the rest of the hospital, section 126 isn’t focused on cure but on relief. In this unit, terminally ill patients like René receive help to deal with their pain, nausea, and other symptoms from doctors and nurses specialising in palliative care. But the staff in this section don’t just administer morphine and methadone through IVs and injections. They also assist patients and their families with the grief of saying goodbye, the pain of leaving life and the fear of death.“Many of the patients we receive are referred due to physical pain, but they can also experience breathlessness, anxiety and existential suffering. We call this ‘total pain’,” says Dr Johan Randén. Originally from Malmö, he trained as a general practitioner in 1996 and has been working in palliative care for more than 10 years. He has encountered several patients who talk about assisted dying: “Some of them think, on receiving their diagnosis, that they want to end their life then and there, and might as well get it over with. But they can also live. And I find that when they receive the right support, they let go of that thought.”Sigrid Nielsen, 65, an experienced nurse, adds: “It’s healthy people who want to introduce assisted dying. But the patients we meet here want to live. They do not want to die.”Every morning in the palliative care unit starts with a meeting in the staff room at the end of the hallway. On this Monday in April, doctors, nurses, and the unit’s psychologist and social worker gather around a table to talk through the patients in their care. A middle-aged man is in such severe pain that he can barely be touched; another needs to be discharged to a hospice; a third patient requires a Polish-speaking interpreter; and then there’s a male patient who is in a very bad psychological state. He feels lonely, hasn’t slept all night and wants to hold hands all the time, says Nielsen. “He is really in a deep crisis.”The man is not psychotic or suicidal, but he needs someone who listens. “We can’t change his life circumstances, but I’ve told him: ‘You need to stay here until you feel safe’,” she says.The psychologist has made an appointment with him, and he has also been asked if he wants to talk to a priest. After half an hour, everyone gets up. An alarm flashes above the door, nurses are needed in several rooms and doctors are preparing for rounds. Some of them are going on home visits with the unit’s palliative mobile care team.A small sign outside each roomhas a handwritten message, name and a drawing. “Welcome René” it says outside room 14 next to a drawing of a tree.René was admitted on Monday morning. He came from the hospital’s pulmonary unit, where he had been for almost a month. René’s eyes look large in his hollow face, and his hair is a bit dishevelled. His bones are prominent at his shoulders and wrists, and his muscles have shrunk. He started having back pain before Christmas, and the doctor thought it might be a herniated disc. He also got tired a lot and felt cold. He was sent to a physiotherapist, who couldn’t help him, and one day in late March an ambulance brought him to the hospital with severe pain. The paramedics thought it was intestinal obstruction.“But then they found cancer everywhere,” he says. The disease had started in his lungs but had spread to his liver and bones.Nielsen enters the room and reminds him to drink more. He promises. “As long as it’s only water,” he says. He quit drinking in 1996, he tells Dr Randén. “Well done,” says Randén. He sits on the bed and asks how they can help him. He’s short of breath, lacks appetite, he says, and then there’s the pain, a burning sensation. It sits under his shoulder blade.View image in fullscreenRené Damgaard with his niece Mette.Photograph: Jacob Ehrbahn/Polfoto“I know what’s going to happen,” says René.“What’s going to happen?” asks Randén.“My life is coming to an end.”“What do you think about that?” asks Randén.“It’s too early, but it is not up to me to decide.”He was offered chemotherapy but declined. He doesn’t know if he has a week or a month left to live. “And chemo makes you really sick. I’d rather spend my time feeling good.”Randén understands, he says. “That’s not how you should spend your energy.”He explains that it’s important to speak up as soon as he feels the pain. “Pain is like fire. You can easily blow out a candle. But if the fire spreads and the whole kitchen goes up, it’s hard to extinguish. It takes time for the medicine to work, so you need to tell us as soon as you feel the first flame.”René nods. “I’ve never been good at asking for help,” he says.As soon as the pain is under control, he wants to move back to his flat, where he lives alone. His niece has rearranged his flat, and everything is ready for him to spend his final days there.“Do you have any children?” asks Randén.“I have a son,” says René.“Do you have a good relationship with him?”“No.”“Does he know you’re sick?”“No.”Out in the hallway, Randén stops and talks to Nielsen. “Maybe we should ask René if he wants to write a letter to his son,” he suggests.Randén says one of his mostimportant tasks is to listen to the patients.“You can run all kinds of blood tests and scans, but if you don’t talk to the patients about what they want, it’s pointless. You must talk to them. And touch them,” he says.It’s the experience of Randén and his colleagues in the palliative care unit that no one else in the healthcare system has talked to the patients about the fact that treatment could extend life yet diminish its quality, especially towards the end. “Many doctors shy away from talking about death. They keep treating the patients until the very last moment before they finally say: ‘Now there is nothing more we can do.’ But then there is no time left for the patient to prepare themselves for death,” says Randén.There are three things that are important for someone dying to get the opportunity to say to the right people, Randén says: “Forgive me. I forgive you. And I love you.”“Life is too short for bad coffee,”says Niels Abrahamsen, who is 63.He pours freshly ground coffee into a glass pot from a small bag his wife, Rikke, has brought. He smells the freshly ground beans and says: “Ahhh.” On his bedside table is a box of luxury chocolates. Life is also too short for bad chocolate.Abrahamsen often uses that phrase. He is a bon vivant. He was diagnosed with stomach cancer in January 2020, but even with a death sentence hanging over him for four years, he has not lost hope, he says. In February, he had a stomach bleed, and after radiation therapy to stop it, he experienced severe pain. In recent weeks there has been a buildup of fluid in his abdomen, and a few days ago he was admitted to the palliative care unit to relieve his discomfort.Abrahamsen’s approach to illness is holistic, he explains. On his bedside table are various “exquisite” dietary supplements, as he calls them. He does not like medication – especially not chemotherapy, of which he has had about 30 treatments. He likes the palliative unit compared with the gastro unit in the hospital where he was initially admitted and where everything was “complete chaos”. “They are more professional here, more experienced, and they have time to sit down and hold your hand,” he says.He has settled into his room with a yoga mat and a stack of magazines. He also unpacks a Bluetooth speaker his wife has brought so he can listen to good music. Because life is also too short for bad sound.View image in fullscreenDr Johan Randén with Niels Abrahamsen.Photograph: Jacob Ehrbahn/PolfotoThe doctor enters to check on him. His abdomen is swollen with fluid, and during the night he paces the hallway restlessly. Randén wheels in an ultrasound machine, sits on the edge of the bed, scans, and gently feels Abrahamsen’s stomach. They discuss whether to try to drain some of the fluid or wait a while.“We’ll take it step by step and see what we can do for you,” says Randén. He sits for a moment, quietly, patting his patient’s hand. Abrahamsen begins to cry.“What’s happening?” Randén asks.“It’s you, Johan. You are the most attentive doctor I have ever met,” says Abrahamsen. He covers his face with his hands as tears stream down.“It’s not easy, I know,” says Randén.The nurses move quicklydown the corridors, keeping an eye on the clock and the flashing alarms. However, when they enter the patients’ rooms, the pace is often different.They speak softly and take their time. Patients and relatives talk about a unique calm atmosphere in the unit – a stark contrast to the hospital’s other departments.One afternoon, a middle-aged man enters the corridor. In his hands, he holds two large boxes of cream puffs, which he places in the nurses’ office. His wife died in the unit a month ago. They were admitted together up until her death.“We had talked about her coming home to die, but she felt most secure here,” he says. Now he wants to say thank you. “I promised my wife that I would come back and properly say goodbye to the staff.” But it was difficult to walk through the door to the unit. “This is where I saw my wife for the last time,” he says.The man gets a cup of coffee and talks at length with two of the nurses. One of them places a hand on his shoulder. His eyes fill with tears.“We don’t just take care of the patients – we also take care of the relatives, their emotions and their grief,” says Nielsen later.She has saved some of the many thank-you cards and letters she has received over the years. There are also several memorial cards from patients’ funerals she has attended. “You don’t just distribute food, make the beds and give medication. You also embrace them and care for them,” she says.In room 11, Liv Simonsenis being visited by one of her three daughters and two grandchildren.The youngest crawls into her bed and cuddles up to her. The girl doesn’t say much but shows with her hand how old she is. Five fingers. On the wall of the room hangs a child’s drawing of a princess in a castle.Simonsen is 70 and had just retired from her job as a speech therapist when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020. She was declared cancer free in 2021. But in January she experienced back pain. “The doctor thought it was muscle pain and just wanted to give me pills,” she says.But when she was admitted to casualty with severe pain, they sent her for further examination. It turned out that the cancer was back and had spread to her spinal cord and bones. Now it is incurable. When Simonsen was admitted to the palliative unit last week, the pain was so intense she couldn’t get out of bed. She has never been able to sit still. Three months ago, she was swimming and playing volleyball and padel.“And now here I am,” she states quietly. She lives in a townhouse in Albertslund with her husband, Jens. Together they have five children and 10 grandchildren. He is also admitted in the room – his bed is placed close to hers.The oncologist’s plan is to keep the disease at bay with oral chemotherapy. But only if Simonsen recovers strength enough to move around. Otherwise they will have to stick to life-prolonging treatment, she explains. And first the pain must be under control.A nurse brings a small brown pill that Simonsen needs to take to muster the strength for later when her sister comes to visit. Randén prescribed the morphine-based drug oxycodone. Initially, she wouldn’t take it.“I freaked out when he mentioned it because I’ve heard on TV how people can become addicted to opioids.” Randén explained to her that it was for the pain. Not for fun. “And now I’m glad. It’s really nice not to be in so much pain.”But when the pain is under control, you start to think, she says. “And then you get sad. I told Sigrid earlier that if I start crying, it feels as if I can’t stop,” she says. “But when my grandchildren are here, I don’t cry.”Randén looks at the CT scansof René Damgaard on a computer.It looks like a map – his bones, lungs, and other internal organs depicted like islands in a sea of white and grey. Randén scrolls, zooms in and points to numerous small and large black spots and shadows. Cancer.“There, there and there. It’s everywhere and it’s causing him pain,” Randén says. Even though they can’t cure or treat the cancer, there is plenty they can do to give him relief, he says.In room 14, René has dozed off with a Crossword & Quiz magazine in front of him on the duvet. His niece, Mette, drops by straight from her job as a department head at a school nearby. She has brought a Popsicle for him called Champagne.“This is the only type of champagne we use to celebrate,” she says. They both laugh. She has big curly hair and smiles a lot. She is the daughter of René’s older brother, and there are only 14 years between uncle and niece.Her father died of cancer. “When René is no longer here, there won’t be anyone around any more who has known me my entire life,” says Mette.René worked in shipping, as a hospital porter and in IT. While he has been in the hospital, he turned 67 and is now officially retired. He was supposed to be spending all his time on his hobby: fishing. Instead, he is scheduled to be discharged on Monday to die at home, and his niece has applied for care leave so she can be with him as much as possible.“You can sit by the window and see the new leaves on the beech hedge, and we’ll eat good food. I’ve stocked up on frozen meals,” she says. She has arranged home care from the municipality up to 12 times a day. Still, she worries about her uncle being in pain.For the doctors and nurses in the unit, it’s important to prepare the family and the patients for death so it doesn’t end in helplessness and chaos. But it’s not always possible, says Randén. The patients hardest to handle are those who don’t want to talk about death and do everything they can to avoid facing it. “Especially young people, and mothers with small children. They fight with everything they have – understandably,” he says.Even though most dying people want to be at home, patients and relatives can become uncertain or overwhelmed in the final days and hours. And then the dying person gets admitted to hospital, stabilised and perhaps sent home again, only to end up in the hospital again a few days later.“Sometimes it ends up in what I call ‘blue-light deaths’, where a patient is rushed in by ambulance, dies on the way, is resuscitated, and maybe doesn’t regain consciousness and never gets a chance to say goodbye. That’s not a dignified death,” says Randén.During the night just before the weekend, René gets a fever. He wakes up with chattering teeth. The next morning his skin is still sweaty. Randén examines him first thing.“I think you have pneumonia. So take it easy – no dancing today,” the doctor says, prescribing antibiotics. “We need to get you back on your feet. You still want to go home on Monday, right?”René struggles through a handful of pills with the help of a protein drink. Nielsen arrives.“I’ll open the curtains so we can get some sunlight in. It’ll make the day a bit better,” she says.She starts preparing everything for his discharge so he will get all the help and care he needs for his final days. Wound care for his bedsores; a form to say his condition is terminal so all medication is free of charge. She also notes down the phone number for the emergency nurse so he and his niece have someone to call. But Nielsen doubts he will make it until Monday morning. Pneumonia is serious in his condition.“He might die over the weekend,” she says, adding: “I’m just being realistic.” The most important thing is that he is not in pain.“We are chasing the good days.”For Liv Simonsen in room 11, it’s a bad day after several good ones.She feels nauseous and sits up in bed with a small plastic pill cup of medicine in front of her and a smoothie beside her bed. She can’t get either of them down because she has an upset stomach. It started last night.“I threw up and got really tired. Like I was hit with a hammer,” she says.Three small pills remain. Randén enters and sits down on the edge of the bed. He listens to her stomach with a stethoscope.“Nausea can have many causes. Sometimes it’s an imbalance in the body. Sometimes it’s the medication. Sometimes it’s anxiety. It all feels the same,” he says.Nielsen has joined them. She wants Simonsen to get out of bed. “You need to get up and brush your teeth, and then we’ll get you in the wheelchair and wrapped up so you can sit on the terrace in the sunshine. It’s better for your appetite, and your mood,” she says firmly. Simonsen is grateful for the way she is treated. That Nielsen constantly reminds her to make the most of the time she has left.Niels Abrahamsen has hadtrouble sleeping. He usually stays active by doing exercises but hasn’t had the energy in recent days.He is increasingly worried that the fluid in his abdomen is due to the cancer spreading. He has asked for a CT scan. He keeps up with music – both big stars and new names – and he has tickets for a Bruce Springsteen concert in July and a local music festival in August. He also bought tickets for the Euros in Germany, which he hopes to attend with his 19-year-old son, who graduates from high school in a couple of months. “It’s going to be huge. I must be there,” he says.However, he knows he can’t travel in his current condition. He takes more morphine than he’d like. “And then my stomach gets constipated, and I get sluggish and forgetful,” he says.View image in fullscreenAbrahamsen doing his daily exercise routine.Photograph: Jacob Ehrbahn/PolfotoHe takes a walk on the grass outside the hospital and performs an exercise routine in his socks among daisies and bushes. He does this every day, all year round, at home in his own garden, he says.“Now I feel almost reborn,” he says afterwards.René is scheduledto be discharged on Monday morning, but that doesn’t happen.Over the weekend, he gets delirium – a condition with hallucinations that often affects the dying and very sick. He has seen visions of his mother and father, and when Nielsen arrives, he is crying.Nielsen doesn’t think he’s well enough to go home.“What are you afraid of? Are you afraid to die?”The way she says it sounds like a mix between a question and a statement. Damgaard doesn’t respond.“I will make the decision for you now. I can’t send you home when you’re in this state,” she says.René cries so hard the bed shakes. He raises his hands to his face. “Bullshit,” he finally says.“It’s good for you to cry. It’s OK to let it out,” says Nielsen, stroking his short grey hair. A little later she gives him a shot of sedative and makes a call to cancel the transport home. She also gets hold of his niece, Mette.René was supposed to get a visit at home from his son, whom he hasn’t seen in years. Mette arranged it. She promises to make sure the son pays a visit to his father at the unit instead.Randén has just arrived. He hasn’t even taken off his backpack when he goes in to see René. He is still crying and upset about having to cancel the transport home. The doctor explains the hallucinations. About 80% of dying patients experience them. It feels like dreaming while you’re awake. Sometimes the patients see people from their past. It can be frightening.The room is quiet. Randén holds his patient’s hand and just sits there. For a long time. Eventually René calms down. The medicine is working. Nielsen walks down to the nurses’ office with the bag of medication René was supposed to take home.“I had packed everything. But things never go as planned here,” she says.She talks about a young female patient who was severely troubled by hallucinations before she died. “It was very scary. She saw shadows that wanted to take her. They surrounded her in the room.” Nielsen moved her patient’s bed into the hallway and lay down with her, holding her. “It was the only thing that helped. She was terrified.”Every Monday, a musical duovisits the unit to play for the patients.It consists of a guitarist and a singer who knock on each door and ask if they can come in to sing a song. They are welcomed into three rooms. They play Somewhere Over the Rainbow to an 80-year-old woman who has been in the ward for a few days. She appears to be asleep, and 20 minutes after the musicians leave, she takes her last breath.Later that day René’s niece, Mette, arrives. He feels better after the decision has been taken about staying in the ward. He has eaten two cups of yoghurt, and in a few hours his 39-year-old son, whom he hasn’t seen in four years, is coming to visit.Now that the meeting is approaching, he is worried that his son might be angry with him. “But he wouldn’t come if he was very mad, I guess,” he says. Although he has been sober since 1996, many things remain unsaid between them. “And I know I was a jerk at some point,” he says.“But a lot of good things have happened since,” Mette reminds him.René’s son arrives precisely at the agreed time. Randén and nurse Nielsen greet him at his father’s bed. When they leave, Nielsen shows that she has goose bumps on her arm. Randén takes off his glasses and wipes away a tear. He and Nielsen hug.“They get to say goodbye, and it’s good for the son and good for René. He can leave at peace with himself,” Randén says. He often finds himself crying.René’s son stays for a long time. When darkness falls, he is still there.View image in fullscreenNurse Sigrid Nielsen (left) and Dr Johan Randén in the palliative care unit at Hvidovre hospital.Photograph: Jacob Ehrbahn/PolfotoLiv Simonsenin room 11has felt better over the weekend. The pills are working, reducing her nausea.She has been out on the hospital’s roof terrace in a wheelchair several times. She has eaten ice-cream and had many visitors. “When the pills work I become weightless,” she says.Randén and Nielsen want to persuade Simonsen to accept a temporary stay at a hospice facility where she can regain more strength before possibly going home. They sit down in her room.“Last week, we talked about apathy. You were very sad, but it seems like you’re in a different place now,” says Randén.“Yes, it was a low point. But I feel better. I can talk about the future,” she says. Her home is not set up to provide the necessary help yet, so she accepts the suggestion of receiving care at a hospice facility.Randén walks towards his office to write the referral. As he makes his way down the hallway, he performs small, joyful dance steps.The next day,René’s condition has worsened. His hallucinations have intensified during the night, and now he is crying again, feeling frightened.After a conversation with Randén and Nielsen, he agrees to a combination of sedatives and painkillers that might cause him to fall asleep and not wake up.“We talked to him about the possibility that he might not see Mette and his son again. But he was completely at peace. He wants to go to sleep now,” says Nielsen afterwards.This process is known as palliative sedation, when terminally ill patients are given medication to relieve pain and reduce anxiety and distress, with the possible side-effect of shortening life and causing loss of consciousness.“He shouldn’t have to experience what he went through last night again. It’s too cruel,” says Nielsen as she prepares the mixture in the medication room. She sets up a pump by René’s bed that will provide him with a continuous dose. She inserts a drip into his upper arm just above a tattoo of the logo from FC København – the silhouette of a blue lion’s head. The muscle and the lion have shrunk.René opens his eyes. She strokes his hair.“Are you in pain?”He shakes his head and points to his mouth.“But your lips are dry … ”Nielsen fetches small sticks with foam tips, which she dips in water and uses to moisten his lips and tongue.He says something. It’s hard to hear. He repeats it in a barely audible whisper: “I’m sorry.”“No need to apologise. Now sleep,” she says.Nielsen calls his niece and explains what is happening. On his way home, Randén passes by René’s room. “The frown line on his forehead is gone,” he says.After a few frustrating daysof waiting, Niels Abrahamsen finally gets the CT scan he requested.It takes place in the hospital basement. He performs stretching exercises against the machine before lying down on the bed and being rolled into the scanner tube.“Soon I’ll find out if it’s the worst case scenario. If the cancer has gone wild. Or if it’s just fluid accumulation,” he says when he gets back to his room.The next day, Abrahamsen is informed that the cancer has spread. He is offered a place at a hospice facility, which he accepts.Just before midnight, the night nurse assesses that René doesn’t have much time left. She calls Mette, who along with her husband arrives at the hospital and sits by her uncle’s bed. René’s breathing rattles slightly, but otherwise the room is quiet, with only a single lamp lit.“There’s not much left of you,” says Mette, stroking his bony hand.A few days ago, they had talked about the funeral. Mette suggested that her uncle’s ashes be scattered over the sea at the sandbank where he used to fish. “So you’ll be out there when we swim and sail,” she said. He liked the idea. She reminds him again. She tells him to imagine fishing at sunrise – the water shimmering like gold.“And you’re in your boat sailing towards the sun,” she says.Time passes in silence. René’s breathing is bubbling and rasping, but behind his chest, his heart is still pounding hard. He has trouble letting go, Mette thinks.“Yesterday, he said he would miss all of us.”‘My death is not my own’: the limits of legal euthanasiaRead moreRené dies just after sunrise at 5.57am. Afterwards, he lies peacefully in bed with a slight crooked smile. The morning light shines into the room.Randén stops by to say goodbye before he is taken away. He stands for a long time, looking at René with his head bowed.“He was a wonderful man,” he says.Mette cries as she hugs the doctor. “You have been so fantastic,” she says.Mette’s sister has also arrived, and they stand side by side as the porter takes their uncle to the chapel. He has been dressed in his FC København jersey. Between his hands they have placed roses and gerberas.René Damgaard was buried on 15 May. Niels Abrahamsen died at the hospice on 31 May. Liv Simonsen returned home after a stay at the hospice.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsDeath and dyingThe long readDenmarkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What was his legacy and who will take his place?Catherine PepinsterreportsPope Francis was working until the end. On Easter Sunday, the 88-year-old head of the Catholic church offered an Easter greeting to the crowds in St Peter’s Square who had gathered for mass. By the next morning, after months battling pneumonia and bronchitis, he had passed away.From the beginning, the first Latin American pope wanted his papacy to be different.Catherine Pepinster, the former editor of the Tablet, says one of his first notable actions was to go to a prison, rather than a church, to wash people’s feet in the traditional Maundy Thursday rite. It was typical of a pontiff who refused many of the luxuries of his predecessors – from giving up an apartment in the papal palace to only wearing simple leather shoes.Michael Safihears how Pope Francis tried to take a different approach to some of the Catholic church’s controversies – especially the treatment of LGBTQ+ Catholics. “Francis spoke about love frequently,” says Pepinster. Yet on this and other issues, from female priests to abuse scandals, many people thought he did not go far enough. Now the church is preparing to choose his successor, with all the ceremony and tradition that entails. But, says Pepinster, it is clear Pope Francis has changed the institution in the eyes of many of the church’s followers. “A lot of Catholics feel that the church is, in many ways, a more compassionate place.”Photograph: Andrew Medichini/APExplore more on these topicsPope FrancisToday in FocusCatholicism"

The director and three other people present were later arrested.A spokesperson for the Imo State Police Command, Henry Okoye, confirmed the incident and said an investigation into the cause of the deaths had begun. “The command is aware of the unfortunate incident of unnatural death,” he said. “I can confirm that two people were pronounced dead while two were hospitalised.”In his Instagram post, Rollas credited God with the death toll in Owerri not being four – the same number, he said, as “last year in Asaba”.He continued by saying that he had organised a prayer programme before concluding with a caution to those who might sign up to work on productions without union representation.“This is a bad trend. These people camp themselves in an unhealthy, unverified environment making content,” wrote Rollas. “Content creators have to be licensed.RIP 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭”Rollas has served as AGN president since 2017. In a 2019 speech, he said his organisation had more than two million registered members across 36 states and is the largest actors’ association inAfrica.Explore more on these topicsFilmNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Dozens have lined up to be seen each day.As she waited in the queue, 35-year-old Patience Kahindo described the horror she had witnessed at the peak of the fighting. “For the first time in my life, I saw corpses lying on the ground for days,” she said. “Crows and other birds came to eat the human flesh. Sometimes, when I think of all this, I’m plunged into unprecedented sadness.“If someone licked my heart, they’d be poisoned.”View image in fullscreenHundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by the fighting.Photograph: Moses Sawasawa/APThe fighting in eastern DRC has roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide that targeted Tutsis. M23, one of dozens of armed groups fighting Congolese forces in the mineral-rich region, says its objective is to safeguard the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities, including protecting them against Hutu rebel groups who escaped to DRC after taking part in the genocide. DRC, the US and other countries say Rwanda is backing M23 in order to exploit the area’s natural resources.In January, M23 started a rapid advance against the Congolese military and its allied forces in eastern DRC, capturing the region’s largest cities –GomaandBukavu.The recent fighting has left a trail of destruction and exacerbated the humanitarian situation in the region.Thousands of peoplehave been killed andhundreds of thousandsdisplaced.Adding to that, peoplehave sustained serious long-term injuriesfrom shootings and bombings. And some Congolese displaced by previous rounds of fighting have been told by M23 to return their ruined home towns, where they arestruggling to make a living and rebuild their lives.“We have seen that since the clashes at the end of January, the population has been really stressed, and there has been a resurgence of mental health cases,” said Dr Neema Kahatwa, a psychiatrist from the neuropsychiatric hospital in Goma.When the hospital announced the scheme last month, the facility highlighted a number of symptoms that people could look out for and that could necessitate medical attention, including insomnia, difficulty in concentration, unexplained anger, extreme sadness, panic and loss of interest.As he queued to see a mental health specialist in one of four rooms at the facility, Jospin Kasereka, 42, described how he had lost his sister-in-law in the unchecked violence in Goma that followed its capture by M23 and how he saw Congolese soldiers throwing their weapons on the streets as they retreated.“Every day, I wonder of what use these weapons are to us. Perhaps, they were used to eliminate my sister-in-law,” he said. “Mentally, I’m cornered. I hope I’ll one day be at peace.”View image in fullscreenArmed rebels from the M23 group sit on a vehicle in Goma.Photograph: Brian Inganga/APObedi Alias, 47, has been out of work as a civil servant since rebels took over Goma. “I’ve got a big family to support, but there’s no work and I can’t find any money,” he said after his consultation. “I feel the pressure of carrying the whole world on my back. I feel helpless and fear for the future.”People who need to be checked first go to the reception, after which they are directed to the triage, where personnel check their vital signs. From there, they see psychiatrists, who prescribe additional tests and, if necessary, refer patients to psychologists for psychotherapy sessions.More than 300 people from Goma and its surroundings have gone through consultations since the campaign started. Stress, anxiety and depression have been among the conditions diagnosed.Although the consultations are free, the patients pay for other services, such as complementary examinations, laboratory tests and treatment.M23’s recent advance is the worst escalation in years of the conflict in eastern DRC. Attempts to end it through dialogue have failed.On Saturday the government suspended the former president Joseph Kabila’s political party and ordered his assets seized over accusations of supporting M23. The 53-year-old, who ruled from 2001 to 2019 and only stepped down after deadly protests against him, has said he wants to return to the country to help seek a solution to the war.There was no immediate response from Kabila, but Ferdinand Kambere, the secretary of his Party for Reconstruction and Democracy, called the suspension a flagrant violation of Congo’s constitution and laws.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoMental healthAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Conservatives have gained one point in the last two weeks, according to the CBC data.Carney, a 60-year-old who previously led the central banks of Canada and Britain, says his global experience managing economic crises makes him the ideal candidate to guide Canada through a trade war brought on by Trump’s tariffs.How Trump’s Canada threats dampened Quebec separatist movement – for nowRead morePoilievre, meanwhile, says that lacklustre growth under ex-premier Justin Trudeau’s decade in power left Canada vulnerable to Trump and the country cannot afford a fourth consecutive Liberal government.Most Canadian elections are multi-party battles with the leftwing New Democratic party and Quebec separatist Bloc Quebecois playing crucial roles in the makeup of parliament.This year, polling points to a two-party Liberal-Conservative race, with smaller parties facing significant setbacks.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, the supreme court panel reviewed charges against the second group, which Gonet said held managerial roles.Is coup trial ruling the beginning of the end for Bolsonaro and his supporters?Read moreThe second group includes the former presidentialforeign affairs adviser Filipe Martins, retired Gen Mario Fernandes, former federal highway police director Silvinei Vasques, former presidential aide Col Marcelo Câmara and two federal police officers, Fernando Oliveira and Marilia Alencar.These individuals coordinated actions planned by the core group, Gonet said in the indictment. These included mobilizing police officers to support the alleged coup, monitoring authorities and drafting a document intended to justify a state of emergency.Bolsonaro and his allies have repeatedly denied wrongdoing. The former president says that he is being politically persecuted. He has been hospitalized for more than a week, recovering from bowel surgery. On Monday, from his hospital bed in Brasília, he gave an interview to the local television network SBT and said that his trial was not technical, but political.Under Brazilian law, a coup conviction alone carries a sentence of up to 12 years, but when combined with the other charges, it could result in a sentence of decades behind bars.

But on Monday, the Vatican confirmed thatPope Francis, the first Latin American leader of the Roman Catholic church, had died.“It was a privilege when he came here to us,” said Juan Ramón Congo, a 60-year-old cook, speaking at the Virgen de los Milagros de Caacupé parish church in Villa 21-24.Ramón Congo was confirmed by Pope Francis – then an archbishop – in the late noughties, he said, flicking through photos of the pair shaking hands. “He would walk around, listen to us, it helped us a lot. I miss him being here, eatingchipás[cheesy buns], and sharingmate[an Argentine tea].”Bergoglio was born in 1936 in the working-class barrio of Floresta to a family of Italian migrants: his grandparents had emigrated on the steamer Giulio Cesare in 1929 for new opportunities, and also to escape the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini.In his youth, Bergoglio was a “mischievous child”, according to his autobiography, but he also felt a calling to the church. When he was 16, he said he felt compelled to enter the Basilica of St Joseph in Buenos Aires, saying it was as though “someone grabbed me from inside”.As a young man, Bergoglio initially found work as a bouncer and janitor, before later graduating in philosophy. After 13 years of study, in 1969, Bergoglio became a priest, and in the following decades he was placed in charge of the Jesuits of Argentina, became an auxiliary bishop and then archbishop of Buenos Aires. In 2001 he was created cardinal, and in 2013 made history by becoming the first Latin American pope.Father Lorenzo de Vedia, known as Padre Toto, first met Bergoglio when he was still a young priest. “He would come into the villas and listen to everyone,” he said. “The people of the villa have always felt very marginalised, underlooked, cast aside. But his presence, and the way he treated them, gave them dignity.”View image in fullscreenPadre Toto, who first met Francis when he was a young priest.Photograph: Harriet Barber/The GuardianToto remembered how Bergoglio “would wash the feet of the people, kiss the feet of the people”, adding: “He wouldn’t just come for the ceremonies. He would stay afterwards, and listen.”But most importantly, Toto said, Bergoglio acted too.“After a big storm crushed someone, and the insurance did not pay out, he secured assistance for the family. After another storm destroyed the roof of a sports centre, he helped get it fixed. He always had a smile, but beyond that he made tangible changes,” he said.“His qualities – his humanity, his humility – surprised the world when he became pope, but it did not surprise those of us who knew him,” he added.Sitting in the church pews, Sebastian Morales, aged 37, said the pontiff had helped “build up the community”.“I started coming here 10 years ago, when I was a drug addict, and the priests – led by the pope’s messages – helped me,” he said. “A few decades ago, there was none of this, but he helped us grow a community.”But the pope’s followers were disappointed, too, that the 88-year-old had not returned to his homeland since becoming head of the Catholic church in 2013 – despite making dozens of other international trips.“I don’t know why he has never come back. Perhaps because of politics, perhaps because Argentina legalised abortion,” said Bogarin.During his papacy, Argentina has suffered various economic crises and political volatility.In September, the popetold reportershe had wanted to return to Argentina, saying “they are my people”, but that “various matters had to be resolved first”.View image in fullscreenPope Francis outside Auschwitz-Birkenau in 2016.Photograph: Kacper Pempel/ReutersJimmy Burns, author of the 2015 biography Francis, Pope of Good Promise,told Reutersthat he believed Francis did not want to be seen siding either with the left-leaning Peronists or the conservatives. “Any visit would try and be exploited by one side or the other, and he would unwittingly fuel those divisions,” he said.The current government is led by hard-right president Javier Milei, who during election campaigning said the pontiff was “always standing on the side of evil”.Francis also criticised Milei’s government, accusing it ofpreferring to use pepper sprayagainst protesters than pay for social justice. The pope did, however, welcome Milei to Rome last year, where the pair exchanged gifts.“Despite differences that seem minor today, having been able to know him in his kindness and wisdom was a true honor for me,” Milei wrote on social media on Monday. “As president, as an Argentine, and, fundamentally, as a man of faith, I bid farewell to the Holy Father and stand with all of us who are today dealing with this sad news.”Many Argentinians say they would like to welcome Francis home, regardless of recent political challenges. They are now preparing to hold special services for the pope, to honour and celebrate their fellow countryman.The Argentinian government has declared seven days of national mourning.“Even though he was not here, we always felt his closeness,” said Toto. “We always will.”Additional reporting by Casey WetherbeeExplore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismReligionChristianityThe papacyArgentinaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At a time when New Zealanders were struggling with the cost of living, job losses and a health system in crisis, this was not a priority, he said.Fifty years on, New Zealand’s tribunal upholding Māori rights faces a turning pointRead moreThe legislation the bill intends to amend sets out how terms and words commonly used in other legislation should be interpreted, such as “de facto partner”.The bill was lodged by a member of parliament – not the government – making it less certain that parliament would allot time for it to be debated.The proposed lawfollows a ruling by Britain’s highest courtlast Wednesday that only biological and not trans women meet the definition of a woman under equality laws. It was a landmark decision greeted with concern by trans supporters but welcomed by the government as bringing clarity.The British ruling centred on whether a trans woman with a gender recognition certificate (GRC), a formal document giving legal recognition of someone’s new gender, is protected from discrimination as a woman under Britain’s Equality Act.Transgender rights have become a highly political issue in many countries, with some critics saying the conservative right has weaponised identity politics to attack minority groups, while others argue that liberal support for transgender people has infringed on the rights of biological women.In the United States, legal challenges are under way after President Donald Trump issued executive orders that include barring transgender people from military service.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Prices have gone up, so I’m always looking for cheaper options.”In the week to 6 April, Japanese supermarket rice prices reached an average of ¥4,214 ($30/£22) for 5kg – more than double the same period a year earlier.The trend has forced the Japanese government to take the unusual step of dipping into its vast rice reserves. In March itbegan releasing 210,000 tonnes of stockpiled ricein an attempt to arrest price rises caused by a combination ofrecord summer heat, panic buying and distribution problems.Japan unveils first plan to evacuate 100,000 civilians from islands near Taiwan in event of conflictRead moreJapan had previously dipped into its rice reserves in the aftermath of natural disasters or crop failures, but this was the first time it had intervened over distribution issues.The measure has had little impact, however.Last week the agriculture ministry said “logistical problems” meant only a tiny quantity of the released rice had reached shops.About 142,000 tonnes of stockpiled rice were released in the first auction held in mid-March, but as of the end of the month just 426 tonnes, or 0.3% of the total, had reached supermarkets and other outlets, the ministry said, blaming the bottleneck on a shortage of delivery vehicles and the time needed to prepare the grain for sale.Japan’s rice stockpiles had already depleted after record-breaking temperatures affected the 2023 crop. Stockpiles shrank again last year, partly due to a rise in consumption caused by record numbers of tourists. Supplies were also hit bypanic buyingin the wake of typhoon and earthquake warnings, forcing some retailers to restrict sales.Explore more on these topicsJapanSouth KoreaAsia PacificRiceFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

If chosen he would be the first pontiff from Asia, the region with the fastest-growing Catholic population.View image in fullscreenAn image of Pope Francis is displayed on the altar while people pray at the Minor Basilica and National Shrine of Jesus Nazareno in the Philippines.Photograph: Lisa Marie David/Getty ImagesEven in the world’s largest Muslim-majority country,Indonesia, which Francis also visited last year, the pope is fondly remembered.During his stop in Jakartathe pope visited the country’s largest mosque andattended an interfaith dialogue, which was seen as a powerful show of religious tolerance and bridging inter-faith divides.“The pope’s message of simplicity, pluralism, benevolence to the poor and concern for others will always be an example to us all,” said the Indonesian president, Prabowo. “Farewell, Pope Francis. Your message to defendbhinneka tunggal ika[unity in diversity] will always remain in our hearts.”In neighbouring Papua New Guinea, the prime minister said the late pope’s visit to his country’s capital and a jungle outpost last year left an “indelible” impression.James Marape extended his Pacific nation’s “deepest condolences” for the pontiff’s death,praising a tripin which Francis held a mass for tens of thousands in Port Moresby and then travelled to meet the faithful in the jungle-clad coastal community of Vanimo.The visit was “a moment of immense spiritual significance for our country”, Marape said.More than 90% of Papua New Guinea’s 12 million residents call themselves Christian, and about a quarter of those are Catholic.“His engagements with our young people and church leaders left an indelible impression on all who witnessed them,” Marape said.The country is set to have its first saint after Pope Francis approved the canonisation of local preacher, Peter ToRot this April.Born at Rakunai village in 1912, Peter ToRot led a Catholic mission during the Japanese occupation in the second world war, where the Vatican said he carried out his apostolate in secret, fully aware that he was risking his life.With AgenciesExplore more on these topicsAsia PacificPope FrancisCatholicismTimor-LestePhilippinesReligionIndonesianewsShareReuse this content"

I think, with the growth of authoritarian powers, with the war in Ukraine, with the changes in the Indo-Pacific region, with the Trump administration moving deeper into an ‘America first’ perspective and position, we need to be able to defend ourselves.”On Wednesday morning, the deputy prime minister and defence minister,Richard Marles, condemned the opposition defence’s announcement as unreliable, and a “pathetic whimper”.“I just don’t think you can trust the Liberals when it comes to anything they say in respect of defence,” he told the ABC.“There are some reports that the 2.5% is a target, there’s no explanation of how they’re paying for this, where the money’s coming from, or really is there an explanation of where the money is being spent on?”He said the Labor government had engaged in the biggest peacetime increase in defence spending since the second world war and said the government’s commitments were “not a target … not an aspiration” but funded and in the budget.“What we have here is not really a defence policy from the Liberals. It is a pathetic whimper.”The US president, Donald Trump, has consistently lectured allies about the need for America’s allies to spend more on their own defence, rather than relying on the protection of the US military umbrella.Australians could be waiting more than 70 years for affordable housing if prices follow path pushed by major partiesRead moreTrump has demanded Nato allies lift their spending to 5% of GDP, far in excess of the 2% Nato countries have agreed to, and the 3% the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, has urged those countries to reach.Trump told a campaign rally he had even threatened one Nato ally the US would disregard Nato’s collective defence imperative in the face of Russian aggression for countries who had not spent enough on their own defence forces.“‘You didn’t pay? You’re delinquent?’”Trump recounted telling a Nato member representative.“‘No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay. You gotta pay your bills.’”The US under-secretary of defence policy, Trump’s No 3 man at the Pentagon, Elbridge Colby, told a Senate hearing the US wanted Australia to reach a 3% defence spending threshold.“The main concern the United States should press with Australia ... is higher defence spending. Australia is currently well below the 3% level advocated for by Nato secretary general [Mark] Rutte, and Canberra faces a far more powerful challenge in China.”with Australian Associated PressExplore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025CoalitionAustralian politicsPeter DuttonLabor partyRichard MarlesnewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t want to see a situation where Labor crashes the economy and somebody who’s paid $750,000 for a house today is worth $600,000 in 18 months’ time under an Albanese-Bandt government – that would be a disaster,” the opposition leader said.Anthony Albanese in a radio interview dodged the question of whether he wanted home prices to drop.“Look, historically in Australia … prices tend to rise. What we want to do is to make sure that people have accessibility for home ownership,” the prime minister said.View image in fullscreenPeter Dutton and Anthony Albanese have been spruiking their housing policies on the campaign trail.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPLeery of advocating for falling house prices, politicians have instead backed the concept of “sustainable” price growth – where affordability is eventually restored by incomes growing faster than property values.But according to independent economist Saul Eslake: “This might sound nice, but it’s actually a con.”A simple analysis shows why.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterAt the end of last year, the median price for a house in a capital city at $933,000 was 12.8 times the average adult Australian’s annual income of about $73,000.In comparison, at the turn of the century, the median house price of $178,000 was 6.5 times the average income of $27,600.While not a perfect measure of affordability, this doubling in the house price-to-income ratio shows how property has become far less affordable over time.Graph showing Australian homes have become less and less affordableAssuming home values from here climb in line with the Reserve Bank’s inflation rate target of 2.5%, and wages grow by 3.5% a year, it will take 70 years for this “sustainable growth” path to push the house price-to-income ratio back down to 6.5.In other words, the bipartisan approach to solving unaffordable housing is: waiting until the end of this century to return affordability to where it was at the close of the last.Even then, factoring in house price growth of 2.5% a year is a heroic assumption.Over the two decades to 2024, the price of the median capital city house has almost tripled to $933,000, according to CoreLogic.That’s equivalent to compound annual house price growth of 5.4%.The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, also has a version of the sustainable growth solution to housing affordability, even as he touts more ambitious policy measures than the major parties.“We think having house prices stay the same for a while to give wages a chance to catch up is a reasonable compromise that will give first home buyers and renters some hope,” Bandt said.But even in this more hopeful scenario – where house prices stagnate and wages grow by 3.5% – it would take 20 years to return the affordability measure to where it was at the start of 2000.Similarly, it would take 11 years if home values dropped by 2.5% a year. And it would still take eight years if prices dropped by an extraordinary 5% annually.An unsustainable trajectory for house pricesEslake said rapid house price falls in the order of 20% would be disruptive, have wider economic consequences, and probably be triggered by a rapid rise in unemployment.Witness the experience such as Spain, Ireland and the US after the global financial crisis.“But what would be wrong with a 5-10% fall in house prices over a three-year period? That would do more to boost affordability than anything any government has done in the past 60 years,” Eslake said.Such a result was difficult to engineer via government policy, but Eslake said governments should at least not actively work to stem falling prices, as they have repeatedly done in the past.Ironically, this has been done via first homeowner grants – the same type of measures the two major parties are offering now as a cure for high prices.Cameron Kusher, an independent property expert, said the question of whether house prices should fall was a fraught one.“We have created this housing system where most of our wealth is held in residential property, especially when you exclude super,” Kusher said.Excuse my cynicism, but after 25 years of the same housing policies, could Australian leaders try something else? | Greg JerichoRead more“We’ve become accustomed to the idea that the way you get wealthy in Australia is you buy and hold property, and get wealthier over time.“It will take a big shift in mindset to change that.”Kusher said the most likely answer was to create more homes at lower price points, most obviously via a big lift in the number of apartments. This is something Auckland achieved via a massive rezoning of land that led to lower prices and rents than in the rest of the country.This, however, would demand another major shift in mindset: letting go of the dream of a standalone house.This article was amended on 23 April, 2025. A previous version said house prices had almost doubled, not tripled, over the past two decades. A previous version also said that was equivalent to annual average house price growth of more than 9%, rather than a compound annual house price growth of 5.4%.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025HousingAustralian politicsAustralian economyanalysisShareReuse this content"

It also suggests that whoever forms government after 3 May could be forced to respond to a drastically weaker economy than anticipated.More RBA rate cuts are on the cards – for first home buyers that could be a blessing and a curseRead moreThe 25 March budget forecast Australia’s economy would grow by 2.25% in 2025 – substantially more than the IMF expected.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterThe pre-election fiscal outlook (Pefo) was released on 7 April, the Monday after Trump’s “liberation day” trade announcements, butdid not flag any substantial changes to the budget estimates.On the same day as Pefo, Jim Chalmers released updated Treasury modelling which showed only a “modest” impact on Australia from US tariffs, even as thelocal share market plungedand financial markets around the world convulsed.The IMF’s World Economic Outlook, however, implied Treasury officials may have been too sanguine about the risks.Chart showing the IMF is more pessimistic on the impact of Trump’s trade warIt lent credence to the Coalition’s claims that a failure to properly account for the economic fallout from tariffs may lead to major budget downgrades, especially if prices for key commodities – iron ore and coal – fall more quickly than expected.In a statement, Chalmers said the IMF report “confirms that trade tensions are weighing heavily on the global outlook and putting upward pressure on inflation around the world”.“We’re not immune from the turmoil in the global economy but the progress we’ve made together puts us in good stead,” he said.“Under the Albanese government, inflation is down substantially, real wages are up, unemployment is low, growth is rebounding solidly and interest rates have started to come down.”That “solid rebound”, however, may be in jeopardy.The new outlook also foreshadowed a major growth downgrade in the Reserve Bank’s next set of economic forecasts, which will be released in tandem with the next monetary board policy meeting on 19-20 May.The IMF’s chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, said the US president’s increase of import duties represented a “major shock”, and that it was difficult to judge the severity of the consequences.“The global economic system under which most countries have operated for the last 80 years is being reset, ushering the world into a new era,” Gourinchas said.“Existing rules are challenged while new ones are yet to emerge,” he said, warning of a collapse in mutually beneficial international arrangements as countries are pushed to a zero-sum world of “winners and losers”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The only future security guarantees for Ukraine will be provided by a UK-French 30-country coalition of the willing to provide a “reassurance force”, but this will not include the US.It had been hoped that Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, would attend the talks, but the state department said on Tuesday that would no longer be possible and that Keith Kellogg, the White House’s Ukraine envoy, would be present instead.The meetings in London take place amid European scepticism that the Russian leader is seriously willing to end the war, reinforced by events over Easter weekend, whenUkraine reported of thousands of violations of a short truceannounced by Russian president Vladimir Putin.John Healey, the defence secretary, told the Commons that the UK agreed with Ukraine that the Russian leader’s public pledges were not borne out by military reality.“Despite President Putin’s promise of a 30-hour pause in fighting, I can confirm that Defence Intelligence [an MoD unit] has found, and I quote ‘no indication that a ceasefire on the frontline was observed over the Easter period’,” he told MPs.“So, while Putin has said he declared an Easter truce – he broke it. While Putin says he wants peace – he rejected a full ceasefire. And while Putin says he wants to put an end to the fighting – he continues to play for time in negotiations.”On Tuesday, Zelenskyy said that Russia had continued to bomb the frontline with first-person view drones over Easter, though he said that the attackers had scaled back the number of operations and did not use long-range weapons.Healey also said he would meet Ukrainian defence minister, Rustem Umerov, “as the government is bringing together US, UK and European ministers and national security advisers to discuss next steps”.Ukrainian sources indicated that foreign secretary Andrii Sybiha was expected in London to meet Lammy, Kellogg and delegations from France and Germany at meetings expected to last throughout the day.Healey said the meetings in London would include discussion of “what a ceasefire might look like and how to secure peace in the long term”. Despite nearly three months of talks led by the White House there has until now been no breakthrough in ending the war.European officials had believed Moscow is not ready to agree to a ceasefire because Putin has not abandoned his efforts to dominate Ukraine while talks between the Kremlin and the White House continue.Russia has been demanding that Ukraine hand over the entirety of four eastern and southern regions its forces only partly occupy. That would include Kyiv ceding Kherson, which its forces recaptured in November 2022, and Zaporizhzhia city, proposals Ukraine would not be able to accept.But the FT reported on Tuesday thatthe Kremlin would soften its demands in direct discussions with the US, and would accept a freezing of the conflict on the frontline if the US agreed that Crimea, seized by Moscow in 2014, belonged to Russia.However, Zelenskyy ruled out recognising Crimea as Russian territory. “There is nothing new to mention or discuss. Ukraine will not recognise the occupation of Crimea,” he said, pointing out that it would be incompatible with Ukraine’s constitution.No details of any revised peace plan had been formally shared with Kyiv, Zelenskyy added. He said discussions should take place in the London format, rather than through the media, with the UK, France and the US as participants.According to one report in the Telegraph, Russia would hand over control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest in Europe, not to Ukraine but to the US – though it is unclear how Kyiv would respond to this.Putin floated on Tuesday that he wasopen to direct negotiations with Ukraine, which would be the first time the two countries had held peace discussions since spring 2022. This could involve discussing the issue of not striking civilian targets, his spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, later added.The US is expected to relay Ukraine’s response to Putin after the London meetings. Steve Witkoff, who is a close friend of Donald Trump and his informal envoy, is set to visit Moscow later this week. Witkoff has held three in-depth meetings with Putin, and his apparently warm relationship with the Kremlin has raised concerns in Ukraine that he may be amplifying Russian narratives.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyDavid LammyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Its main focus will be telecommunications, cybersecurity and buying military equipment.“The enemies of Europe are not just using missiles – as we have seen in Ukraine over the past three years,” he said. “They’re also using unmanned drones and paramilitary forces to sabotage supply chains and to cut gas lines and underwater cables. They’re using social networks to issue disinformation and to polarise people and spread disaffection towards democratic institutions. They’re using AI cyber-attacks and quantum computers to compromise out telecommunications, our supply networks, and our public services in order to target our way of life.”The prime minister – who pointed out that his administration was finally making good on the 2% commitment pledged by its conservative predecessor in 2014 – said the new plan would help reinforce European security in record time.“In a world that’s dominated by uncertainty, Europe is hope and it is certainty – and that certainty must be protected by strengthening our security and defence systems because given what’s going on, it’s obvious that only Europe will know how to protect Europe,” he added. “AndSpainwill contribute to protecting Europe.”Sánchez said Vladimir Putin’s “neo-imperialism” was a threat to European security, no matter how far any EU member state was from the frontlines of the conflict in Ukraine.“The security and stability of Ukraine, of eastern Europe and the Baltic and Nordic countries, is also the security and the safety of Spain,” he said. “The people who live in those countries know that Putin is serious – and that his words are backed by deeds – and that’s why they look to Europe for protection. They’re looking for something important, and that is unity. Spain will not be indifferent to that demand. Ukraine resists, Europe responds and Spain fulfils its obligations.”Sánchez also repeated his assurances that the additional spending would not lead to increased taxes, raids on the welfare state budget, or deficit increases. The plan has faced criticism from coalition partners in the leftwing Sumar platform, who described the plans as “incoherent” and “absolutely exorbitant”.In January, Donald Trump increased pressure on Nato, claiming the US had shouldered the global defence burden for too long and saying he would ask all Nato members to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP.The Nato secretary-general, Mark Rutte, has urged member states to use the threats from Washington as an incentive to take unilateral action on raising defence contributions. Last month, Rutte said the pressure was already paying off in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Italy.“I tell them that, well, now I am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2% by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2% because we have to spend much, much more than 2% but now I am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from Washington on the line if you don’t listen to me,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSpainPedro SánchezNatoGlobal economyEuropeEconomicsEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

She wrote: “I am confronted with the devastating effect certain images and or messages carried by social media such as those on #skinnytok can have on the mental and physical health of our young people.“These videos, often seen by adolescents, promote unrealistic body norms and encourage dangerous eating habits such as restrictive diets, excessive exercise or starvation behaviour.”On TikTok, a #SkinnyTok search brings up dozens of videos encouraging young women and girls to restrict their eating. “If you cannot control what you put in your mouth, what can you control?” reads one. Another says: “Skinny, but not skinny enough.”Up to 40,000 people in France are believed to suffer from anorexia nervosa, 90% of them adolescents. It is the deadliest psychiatric illness in the country.TikTok said it had deleted a number of posts and had strict rules against online body shaming “and dangerous behaviour linked to weight loss”.

On Sunday, after a 38-day hospitalisation, Pope Francis greeted crowds in St Peter’s Square and wished them a happy Easter. At 7.35am yesterday,he died at the age of 88, of a stroke and subsequent heart faillure.“He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favour of the poorest and most marginalised,” said Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is tasked with running the Vatican’s day-to-day affairs until a new pontiff is chosen. “With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul ofPope Francisto the infinite merciful love of the One and Triune God.”Francis was widely seen as one of the most consequential popes of recent times: an unpredictable leader who took office at a time of crisis, and unafraid of upsetting traditionalists – but also far from the simplistic progressive figure sometimes portrayed in secular accounts. And as preparations begin for the conclave that will elect his successor, it remains to be seen whether his outlook on the church’s role in the world solidifies into an enduring legacy.For today’s newsletter, I spoke toAnna Rowlands, a political theologian and professor of Catholic social thought at Durham University, about a figure who often defied his portrayal by progressives and traditionalists alike – and whether the changes he sought in the church will survive him. Here are the headlines.Five big storiesBenefits| Ministers areprivately ruling out scrapping the two-child benefit capdespite warnings from charities that a failure to do so could result in the highest levels of child poverty since records began. Government sources said charities and Labour MPs hoping for a change are “listening to the wrong people”.Israel-Gaza war| Humanitarian agencieshave rejected the findings of an Israeli military investigationthat concluded the killings of 15 Palestinian medics and rescue workers last month were caused by “professional failures”. Jonathan Whittall, the UN’s humanitarian chief for Gaza, said the report represented a lack of “real accountability”.Ukraine| Vladimir Putin has said for the first time in years that he isopen to bilateral talks with Ukraine– having previously demanded that Volodymyr Zelenskyy be replaced before it could happen. Zelenskyy, whom the Russian ruler has falsely called an illegitimate president, meanwhile said Kyiv was prepared for any discussion to halt attacks on civilian targets.US universities| Harvard Universityhas filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging it is trying to “gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard”. The move comes in response to a freeze on billions in federal funding over the university’s refusal to accept demands including an attempt to enforce “viewpoint diversity” in teaching.UK news| Almost 250 peoplehave been imprisonedfor breaching antisocial behaviour injunctions since 2020, with people being jailed for sleeping rough, begging, feeding birds and making a noise. Analysis by academics at York and Coventry universities found that more than half of people jailed had no legal representation at their hearings.In depth: ‘He didn’t see himself as progressive or conservative – he just believed that he was doing what was in the gospel’View image in fullscreenCatholics in New Delhi commemorate Pope Francis following his death.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAnna Rowlands was personally appointed by Pope Francis to a two-year governance role at the Vatican; in their first extended conversation, he teased her about the tribulations of her football team, Manchester United. Still, she said wryly, he was always sceptical of theologians like her. “A theologian was the worst thing you could be,” she said. “The idea of spending a lot of time debating abstract ideas that made very little difference in reality – he thought that was the antithesis of how you changed the world.”That practically minded outlook defined his papacy. At the same time, Rowlands said, “he was deeply convinced of certain metaphysical truths. He believed that most of the core truths of life are simple, that they can be communicated simply, and that mercy, forgiveness, and the joy of faith could bring transformation.”What were the expectations of his papacy?When the Argentinian cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio became Pope Francis in 2013, the first non-European to be chosen in more than 1,200 years and the first-ever member of the Jesuit order, his selection was seen as evidence of the church’s understanding that its future lay in the global south, where most Catholics live.He was viewed as a steely administrator and reformist who might help deal with the administrative and moral crises that beset the Vatican under his predecessor, Benedict XVI – the first pontiff to resign in almost 600 years. (Julian Coman’sexcellent analysisexplains the cliques, corruption, and “bunker mentality” that had taken hold in Rome as Benedict defined the church through “hostility to ongoing secularisation and alleged relativism in the west”.) Even against that backdrop, few observers understood quite how significant a figure Francis would turn out to be.There were signs right away. AsPeter Stanford’s truly fascinating obituarynotes, he was the first pontiff “to take on the name of the radical saint from Assisi who had turned his back on privilege and status in this world, and lived with and for the poor”. He wore simple white robes instead of a fancy cape, and relinquished the gilded papal apartment in favour of a simple two-room residence.As Stanford also writes: “On the day after his election … he slipped away on foot to collect his suitcase and settle the bill at the modestpensionewhere he had been booked in before the conclave began.” All of that was echoed in his will, which specified that he should be laid to rest in a tomb that is “simple, without particular decoration”. Popes are traditionally buried in three nested coffins of cypress wood, lead, and elm; Francis will be buried in a simple coffin of wood lined with zinc.What approach did those gestures signify?The symbolism of those steps was followed through in practice. “He turned out to be more radical than anyone anticipated,” Rowlands said. “Other recent popes have been quite conflict-averse. He was unafraid of conflict, and he understood the difference between tension that could lead to transformation and conflict that had nothing productive about it.”She places him alongside John XXIII, who instituted major changes through the Second Vatican Council (or Vatican II) in the early 1960s in an attempt to modernise an increasingly out of touch church – but whose reforms, from decentralising power away from Rome to prioritising pastoral care over dogma, were left incomplete.“He is a bookend figure with John XXIII,” she said. “He had this sense of urgency about completing the reforms that John had set in motion. He understood that if you wanted to implement Vatican II, you had to upend the pyramid, and start with the grassroots. He wanted people to feel empowered as ordinary Catholics – to know that they didn’t need to wait for Rome to take action.”Was he a liberal figure?There is something unintentionally hilarious about the way Francis was co-opted as a political liberal in some quarters: for a while, his every step was viewed through the prism of a reductive kind of progressivism that wanted to understand him as a straightforward ally, to take his place alongside former supreme court president Lady Hale and former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern in the imaginaryFBPEAvengers. That was never likely to hold true: “Is the Pope Catholic?” is a rhetorical question, after all.“There were real reasons that progressives got excited,” Rowlands said. “He supported the rights of migrants, he said ‘Who am I to judge?’ when asked about gay Catholics, and he met with transgender people at the Vatican. He wasn’t doctrinaire.”He made his first pastoral visit outside Rome to the Italian island of Lampedusa, where refugees were arriving in vast numbers, and saw their plight as inextricably linked to the climate crisis. “And when he wrote his environmental cyclical, Laudato Si’, which was the most read cyclical since the one about the Cuban missile crisis, a lot of people thought: Wow, this isourpope, we can embrace him.”But even if those were all important parts of his papacy, “he still maintained a position of recognisably Catholic doctrine”, she said. As Catherine Pepinsterwrites in this piece, he refused to countenance women becoming priests; meanwhile, he did not change the church’s stance that homosexual acts are “intrinsically disordered”, or that priests should not marry. And the church is, unsurprisingly, still opposed to abortion as a grave sin.How did he appear to conservatives in the church?Traditionalists were disappointed, too, Pepinster notes: after he decided to let parish priests make individual decisions about whether divorced Catholics who remarried should be allowed to receive communion, “his fiercest opponents published an unprecedented document – adubia, or expression of doubt, about his teaching”.“Conservatives felt he was at war with them, almost,” Rowlands said. “One of the most political battles was over his decisionto limit the use of Latin mass– they couldn’t understand why he was taking away something that they felt to be precious and countercultural. Some of them felt persecuted. They didn’t see all the other ways that he very much was a conservative.” Some even viewed him as illegitimate, saying that Benedict’s resignation was illegal, and that he remained the “true” pope.To Francis himself, none of his stances had a straightforwardly political valence. “He didn’t see himself as progressive or conservative,” Rowlands said. “He was always confused by these kinds of criticisms, because he just believed that he was doing what was in the gospel. In a way, that was part of what made him a pope of his time: he arrived as these kinds of labels were breaking down in lots of other spheres, and the church had its own version of that.”What kind of a legacy does he leave?When we talk about US presidents, we’re accustomed to the idea that they make change in two ways: the aggressive and short-term, often through executive orders, that can be swiftly reversed by their successors; and the cumulative, consensus-driven reforms that come through legislation, which are very much harder to unpick. It is the latter form that usually leads us to conclude that a president was truly consequential.The analogy is obviously imperfect, but something similar applies to popes: do they make an impact through bold statements from the pulpit, or do they set about lasting reform? Francis’ greatest achievement, Rowlands said, was to pursue the second kind of change. She points, above all, to his chewily named “synod on synodality”: a mass listening exercise that canvassed the views of Catholics around the world on an unprecedented scale.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While some viewed its outcome as underwhelming, she classes it as “the cleverest thing he did – almost the pope as community organiser. It included women as full voting members, and it gathered up the views of every parish and religious order and grassroots community and moved them upwards so that any decision in Rome was loyal to what they said.”Now the question is whether the changes that Francis began – from reforms to finances and safeguarding to a more active role for women in governing the church – will endure after the college of cardinals picks his successor. (You can read more about the conclave, a little different from the one in the movie,in Harriet Sherwood’s piece here, and seesome potential candidates here.)“There’s always a degree of factional rivalry,” Rowlands said. “While it’s not like having a single new executive who can just change everything, these changes are fragile.” But the implementation phase of the synod continues until an ecclesial assembly in 2028, which will include women and lay people alongside bishops. “That is very significant,” Rowlands said. “It will be very difficult for another pope not to remain loyal to what it says.”What else we’ve been readingView image in fullscreenLiv Simonsen with one of her granddaughters.Photograph: Jacob Ehrbahn/PolfotoLine Vaaben was granted access to apalliative careunit at Hvidovre hospital outside Copenhagen for ten days last year.Her tremendously moving long readfinds an alternative to assisted dying that is not a relentless pursuit of a cure at any cost, but an attempt at preparation for the inevitable.

The area was expanded last May to cover a larger area in south-west Gaza, including Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah and al-Mawasi.Up to January, the humanitarian zone had been marked on maps that were posted online and dropped from the air by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). More than a million people had flocked to the areas as a result.The humanitarian zones were not entirely safe. Official figures showed they were hit by at least 28 Israeli strikes before January andan investigation by the BBCput the number as high as 97, with 550 people killed. The IDF accused Hamas militants of using the zones as protection and as a launchpad for attacks on Israeli troops.Despair in Gaza as Israeli aid blockade creates crisis ‘unmatched in severity’Read moreMention of the humanitarian zones has disappeared from maps since Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas collapsed in March. The IDF has resumed its airstrikes and seized swathes of land as a “security buffer zone” and the UN estimates that 70% of Gaza is now under either an evacuation order or is a “no-go zone”.In meetings with aid agencies, the IDF and Cogat – the Israeli government unit coordinating policy in Gaza – have sidestepped questions about humanitarian zones, according to a senior international official who asked not to be named in order to speak freely.The source added: “[The Israeli authorities] have not indicated if they will reinstate some of the humanitarian zone designations. There’s a logic there: if they don’t reinstate the humanitarian zones, they therefore can’t guarantee security of movement within that zone for aid workers or civilians.”The IDF did not respond to questions on the issue.Tens of thousands of Palestinians have continued to flock to al-Mawasi, a sandy area with few buildings, many in the belief it is still a protected zone. But the area has been hit by 23 airstrikes since the ceasefire ended, according to the UN.Last week, two Israeli missiles struck refugee camps in al-Mawasi, setting fire to dozens of tents, many with women and children inside. The attacks killed at least 16 people and wounded many more. “Images of children burning while sheltering in makeshift tents should shake us all to our core,” said Catherine Russell of Unicef.Nasser, a father of four, sought sanctuary with his family at al-Mawasi after their home in Deir al-Balah was wrecked last year.“Mawasi was not really better,” said the 35-year-old accountant. “The conditions were crowded, hot, and dirty, there was nowhere to wash or have any privacy. Sometimes there were airstrikes on al-Mawasi when we were displaced there and they set the tents on fire. The Israelis told us to move again even inside the camp.”The family went back home when the ceasefire was declared but Nasser said it was now clear to everyone in Gaza that nowhere was safe.“We don’t know what to do,” he added. “I spent all day looking for clean water and firewood to make a fire to boil wastewater. But Mawasi is dangerous too, it has been targeted 20 times in the last month and there were many martyrs.”The UN warned on Tuesday that Gaza was facing famine after more than 50 days of a total Israeli blockade on aid entering the territory. Also on Tuesday, Israel airstrikes killed 17 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, described Gaza as a “land of desperation”.“Hunger is spreading and deepening, deliberate and manmade,” said Lazzarini on Tuesday. He said the 2 million people of Gaza were “undergoing collective punishment” and he charged Israel with using humanitarian aid as “a bargaining chip and a weapon of war”.His comments were echoed by Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, who told reporters on Tuesday: “It is true that right now is probably the worst humanitarian situation we have seen throughout the war in Gaza.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Due to the area’s lack of road access, helicopter services were deployed to evacuate the wounded.Describing the scene, a local tour guide told the AFP news agency he reached the scene after hearing gunfire and transported some of the wounded away on horseback.“I saw a few men lying on the ground looking like they were dead,” said Waheed, who gave only one name.A female survivor told the PTI news agency: “My husband was shot in the head while seven others were also injured in the attack.”Omar Abdullah, the region’s top elected official, wrote on social media: “This attack is much larger than anything we’ve seen directed at civilians in recent years.”Government officials said the dead included tourists from the Indian states of Karnataka, Odisha and Gujarat and two foreign nationals. At least six others were wounded.India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, decried the “heinous act” cut short a visit to Saudi Arabia.“Those behind this heinous act will be brought to justice ... they will not be spared. Their evil agenda will never succeed. Our resolve to fight terrorism is unshakable and will only grow stronger,” said Modi,who met with Vance the day before.Donald Trump expressed his “full support” to India in a call with Modi late on Tuesday, Delhi’s foreign ministry said.The scene of the attack was cordoned off as police launched an operation to track down the attackers.According to local police officials, two to three gunmen opened indiscriminate fire on tourists in the area, which is accessible only by foot or on horseback, before fleeing the scene.A witness speaking to India Today said: “The shooting occurred right in front of us. At first we thought it was just firecrackers, but when we heard others screaming we rushed out of there to save ourselves.”Another witness, who also did not reveal his name, said: “We didn’t stop running for 4km … I’m still trembling.”Protests erupted in several areas of the Indian-administeredKashmircondemning the attack, with a rally led by rightwing vigilantes in the city of Jammu blaming Pakistan.A militant group identifying itself as “Kashmir Resistance” has claimed responsibility for the attack in a social media message. The group cited anger over Indian settlement of over 85,000 “outsiders”, which it said was driving a “demographic change” in the region.The mountain region is claimed in full but ruled in part by both India and Pakistan, and has been riven by militant violence since the start of an anti-Indian insurgency in 1989.Tens of thousands of people have been killed, although violence has tapered off in recent years.Indiarevoked Kashmir’s special status as an autonomous state in 2019, splitting the state into two federally administered territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.Quick GuideKashmirShowWho controls Kashmir?The region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute sinceIndiaand Pakistan came into being in 1947.Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world's most heavily militarised borders: the \"line of control\" based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.How did the dispute start?After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \"princely states\" across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.What was Kashmir’s special status?Kashmir’s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir’s special status. The government argued that the provision had only ever been intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan – which quickly called India’s actions illegal – and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.What do the militants want?There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed withextreme forcein 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.For Indians, control of Kashmir – part of the country’s only Muslim-majority state – has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists.Michael Safi and Rebecca RatcliffeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.This also allowed local authorities to issue domicile rights to outsiders, allowing them to get jobs and buy land in the territory.Authorities have described the attack as targeted and intended to spread terror among the tourists visiting Kashmir.Tuesday’s attack seems to be a major shift in the regional conflict where tourists for many years have largely been spared from violence despite a spate of targeted killings of Hindus, including immigrant workers from Indian states, after New Delhi ended the region’s semi-autonomy in 2019 and drastically curbed dissent, civil liberties and media freedoms.The Baisaran area attracts tens of thousands of Indian tourists daily, especially during the summer months, when temperatures in mainland India soar.Indian army and paramilitary forces have been deployed to the area to search for the attackers. In recent years, militants have increasingly targeted security forces in the region’s mountainous and forested areas.Kashmir remains one of the most heavily militarised zones in the world and is claimed in full by both India and Pakistan, although each controls only a part. The two countries have fought multiple wars over the region.Explore more on these topicsKashmirIndiaSouth and central AsiaJD VancenewsShareReuse this content"

The reports equated to 7,644 images and a small number of videos, reflecting the fact that one URL can contain multiple examples of illegal material.The largest proportion of those images was “category A” material, the term for the most extreme type of child sexual abuse content that includes penetrative sexual activity or sadism. This accounted for 39% of the actionable AI material seen by the IWF.The governmentannounced in Februaryit will become illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to generate child sexual abuse material, closing a legal loophole that had alarmed police and online safety campaigners. It will also become illegal for anyone to possess manuals that teach people how to use AI tools to either make abusive imagery or to help them abuse children.The IWF, which operates a hotline in the UK but has a global remit, said the AI-generated imagery is increasingly appearing on the open internet and not just on the “dark web” – an area of the internet accessed by specialised browsers. It said the most convincing AI-generated materialcan be indistinguishablefrom real images and videos, even for trained IWF analysts.The watchdog’s annual report also announced record levels of webpages hosting child sexual abuse imagery in 2024. The IWF said there were 291,273 reports of child sexual abuse imagery last year, an increase of 6% on 2023. The majority of victims in the reports were girls.The IWF also announced it was making a new safety tool available to smaller websites for free, to help them spot and prevent the spread of abuse material on their platforms.The tool, called Image Intercept, can detect and block images that appear in an IWF database containing 2.8m images that have been digitally marked as criminal imagery. The watchdog said it would help smaller platforms comply with the newly introduced Online Safety Act, which contains provisions on protecting children and tackling illegal content such as child sexual abuse material.Derek Ray-Hill, the interim chief executive of the IWF, said making the tool freely available was a “major moment in online safety”.The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said the rise in AI-generated abuse and sextortion – wherechildren are blackmailedover the sending of intimate images – underlined how “threats to young people online are constantly evolving”. He said the new image intercept tool was a “powerful example of how innovation can be part of the solution in making online spaces safer for children”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)SextortionChild protectionChildrenInternetComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

However, given the Gambling Commission’s decision, and my understanding of what will follow, this is likely to be a lengthy process that may not be resolved by May 2026.“In the circumstances, I feel I have no alternative but to withdraw my candidacy for next year’s Senedd elections so that I can focus on fighting to clear my name.“I will of course continue to serve the people of Montgomeryshire to the very best of my ability.“I am grateful for the many messages of support that I have received in recent days, particularly from constituents.”Among others facing charges are: Craig Williams, the former MP for Montgomeryshire; Nick Mason, a former chief data officer for the party; Laura Saunders, the Conservative candidate for Bristol North West last July; and Tony Lee, the Conservatives’ campaigns director, who is married to Saunders.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is a government that will support the rights of our most vulnerable now and always.”She faced questions from a series of Labour MPs about what they said was a climate of fear generated by the ruling, particularly the practical impact of consequences such as transgender people potentially being obliged to use the toilets of their biological sex.Sarah Owen, the Labour MP who chairs the women and equalities committee, said: “Far from this ruling providing clarity, trans intersex and non-binary people are instead anxious and unsure about where this ruling leaves them, legally and practically, as they go about their lives.”Another Labour MP, Meg Hillier, raised the concerns of a constituent who transitioned to becoming a woman in the 1970s and had “used female toilets now for more of her life than she ever did any other toilets”, asking if she would now start to use male toilets.Other Labour backbenchers, including Emily Thornberry and Catherine Fookes, said they had been contacted in alarm by LGBTQ and trans organisations, with Fookes saying they were “really concerned and frightened about the potential implications of this judgement”.The Liberal Democrat equalities spokesperson, Christine Jardine, said that while she accepted Phillipson’s argument about women’s spaces, this “should not be at the cost of the human rights and security of another vulnerable group in society”.Phillipson also faced calls from Tory MPs to set out how the ruling would affect provision on hospital wards for transgender patients. She said she recognised the concerns and promised to meet MPs and others. However, she gave no answers to practical concerns, beyond saying that the updated code of practice from equalities watchdog the Equality and Human Rights Commission would take these worries into account.Earlier on Tuesday, Downing Street struggled to explain the seeming contradiction between Phillipson and other ministers suggesting trans people could use unisex or gender-neutral toilets in public spaces when updated building regulations inherited from Badenoch’s tenure as equalities minister set out that new buildings should prioritise single-sex facilities.“I’m not aware of those specific building regulations,” Starmer’s spokesperson said, adding:“It’s not for the government to tell businesses how to to run their premises.”With Starmer most likely being quizzed on the subject at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, some Labour MPs say they are concerned over the current position.“Toilet policing is not where we need to be in 2025,” one senior backbencher said. “No 10 needs to act. I don’t think we can leave this to a venue being taken to court because there’s no unisex toilet. I wish they hadn’t said it brings clarity, but had said we need to think about what happens next.”Also on Tuesday, theScottish government saidit would abandon plans to change legislation on gender recognition, saying it “fully accepts” the ruling of the supreme court.The case was prompted by long-running legal action brought by the campaign group For Women Scotland against Scottish ministers.Explore more on these topicsGenderTransgenderEquality Act 2010UK supreme courtLabournewsShareReuse this content"

I know how important it is, and always want survivors to have single sex spaces, based on biology – places of safety after trauma, time in a sanctuary which allowed them therapeutic support, healing from unimaginable male violence and fear.Phillipson says the government will continue to protect single-sex spaces, based on biological sex.And it will protect “the rights of all people with protected characteristics now and always”.Phillipson explains the background to the supreme court ruling.The people who brought the legal challenge (gender critical feminists) were “not always been treated with the respect that they deserve”, she says.She says the government supports freedom of speech. But, referring to the protests at the weekend against the judgment, she says “there can be no excuse for defacing statutes and feminist icons, no excuse for threats, no excuse for harassment”.ShareUpdated at12.41 EDT"

Musk’s remarks came as the company reported a massive dip in both profits and revenues in the first quarter of 2025 amid backlash against his role in the White House.On an investor call, Musk said the work necessary to get the government’s “financial house in order is mostly done”.“Starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to Doge will drop significantly,” he said.That said, he expects to spend one to two days a week continuing to do what he referred to as “critical work” at Doge “for as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it is useful”.Musk is scheduled to leave Doge on May 30, a strict 130-day cap on his service as a special government employee.Tesla saw a 9% drop in revenue year over year in the first quarter of 2025. The company brought in $19.3bn in revenue, well below Wall Street expectations of $21.45bn. The company reported an earnings per share of 27 cents, also well under investor expectations of 43 cents in earnings per share.Tesla profits also slid 71% to $409m compared with $1.39bn in net income the previous year.The companysuffered a 13% drop in vehicle deliveries, making it the company’s worst quarter since 2022.Teslaclosed the quarter with 336,681 vehicles delivered.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators protest against Elon Musk and Doge cuts outside of a Tesla dealership in Kansas City, Missouri, on 12 April.Photograph: Charlie Riedel/APThough Musk has acknowledged there have been “rocky moments” of late, he remained optimistic about the company’s future.“The future for Tesla is better than ever,” he said. “The value of the company is delivering sustainable abundance with our affordable AI-powered robots. If you say, what’s the ideal future that you can imagine, that’s what you’d want. You’d want abundance for all in a way that’s sustainable, that’s good for the environment. Basically this is a happy future, this is the happiest future you can imagine.”That “happy future” includes the company’s plans for fully self-driving cars, said the billionaire CEO as he laid out an ambitious timeline for when he expects the vehicles to hit US roads in some cities – “by the end of the year”. Tesla hashistorically struggled to meettimelines Musk has publicly set for the launch of new products, especially when it comes to self-driving.“The acid test is, can you go to sleep in your car and wake up in your destination and I’m confident that will be available in many cities in the US by the end of this year,” he said.This would be on top of the Robotaxi service the company plans to roll out in June. “I predict that there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year,” Musk said.Despite missing Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom line, initial analyst reactions are optimistic given many had significantly lowered their expectations after the company reported a massive dip in vehicle deliveries.“Against the backdrop of catastrophic expectations, with everything from sales to margins projected to continue the slump, the less-than-bad numbers have been received as welcome news by Tesla investors,” said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst atInvesting.com.“In a curious turn of events, it’s as if numbers show that even at the worst moment, Elon and the team’s operation can still bring a robust $19.3bn in revenue, with total revenue partly making up for the huge drop in auto revenue.“If this is the worst it gets for Tesla, then certainly there must be some upside for the stock once tailwinds, such as the highly awaited cheaper model and the Robotaxi, finally hit the market later this year,” Monteiro continued.Analysts attribute the company’s overall difficulties to a number of factors, but ultimately concludeMusk’s role in the White House has caused a branding crisis for Tesla. The company is at a major crossroads, analysts say, that will only be remedied if Musk leaves his role in Doge and returns to Tesla as CEO full time.Doge cuts spark questions as employees supporting Musk space launches sparedRead moreIn addition to a drop in sales, a 50% dip in share prices, existing Tesla owners are looking to sell their vehicles in droves, Teslas have been vandalized across the country and in response to ongoing protests of the automaker, the Vancouver International Auto show removed the electronic carmaker from its March lineup. The company also recalled 46,000 Cybertrucks – nearly all that had been sold.Musk said that the drop in demand is due to the macro economic trends – not branding. “Tesla is not immune to the macro demand for cars,” Musk said. “When there is economic uncertainty, people generally want to pause on doing a major capital purchase like a car. Absent macro issues we don’t see any reduction in demand.”Analysts are not convinced.“If Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage…but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO to drive the vision and the long term story will not be altered,” read a Wedbush Securities analyst note. Wedbush remained bullish on the company’s chances of turning its financials around. “IF Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow.”The company declined to provide forward-looking guidance for the next quarter citing “shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains”.“While we are making prudent investments that will set up both our vehicle and energy businesses for growth, the rate of growth this year will depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts, production ramp at our factories and the broader macroeconomic environment,” the earnings report reads. “We will revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”The company did warn, however, that “changing political sentiment” could meaningfully impact short-term demand for Tesla products.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

We’re going to start informing Americans about what they’re eating,” he said.Meanwhile, he did not talk about vaccines or vaccinations at the press conference, but itwas reportedby Politico, citing sources familiar with departmental discussions, that Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, was considering removing the Covid-19 shot from the official federal list of recommended inoculations for children.The outlet quoted an HHS spokesperson as saying a final decision on whether to continue recommending coronavirus vaccines for children had not been made.In the food discussions at the press conference, Kennedy talked about various dyes. Health advocates have called for the removal of artificial and petroleum-based dyes from foods, with some studies suggesting a link to neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children, although aconclusive linkis still contested.The Biden administration previously moved to ban Red No 3 food dye, citing cancer risks in animal studies. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has consistently maintained that the approved dyes are safe.Following Biden’s directive, Red No 3 must be removed from foods by 2027 and from medications by 2028. Kennedy aims to remove the remaining petroleum-based dyes, health officials said.“American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals,” the FDA commissioner, Marty Makary, said. “These steps that we are taking means that the FDA is effectively removing all petroleum based food dyes from the US food supply.”The move could mark a major step in Kennedy’s broader campaign against potentially harmful food additives. But some are still questioning how successful this campaign will be, especially regarding the Trump administration’santi-regulatory stancetowards industry giants.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump has placed tariffs on several dozen countries, causing the stock market to stumble and interest rates to increase on US debt as investors worry about slower economic growth and higher inflationary pressures.Details of Bessent’s remarks were confirmed by two people familiar with the remarks who insisted on anonymity to discuss them.“I do say China is going to be a slog in terms of the negotiations,” Bessent said, according to a transcript obtained by the Associated Press. “Neither side thinks the status quo is sustainable.”The S&P 500 stock index rose 2.5% after Bloomberg News initially reported Bessent’s remarks.Trump acknowledged the increase in the stock market in comments to reporters after the ceremonial swearing-in of Paul Atkins as the Securities and Exchange Commission chair on Tuesday.However, Trump avoided confirming if he, too, thought the situation with China was unsustainable, as Bessent had said behind closed doors.“We’re doing fine with China,” Trump said.Despite his high tariffs, Trump said he would be “very nice” to China and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping.“We’re going to live together very happily and ideally work together,” Trump said.The US president said that the final tariff rate with China would come down “substantially” from the current 145%.“It won’t be that high, not going to be that high,” Trump said.The Trump administration has met for talks with counterparts from Japan, India, South Korea, the European Union, Canada and Mexico, among other nations.But Trump has shown no public indications that he plans to pullback his baseline 10% tariff, even as he has insisted he’s looking for other nations to cut their own import taxes and remove any non-tariff barriers that the administration says have hindered exports from the US.China on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the United States that could negatively impact China.“China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests,” China’s commerce ministry said in a statement.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration has received 18 proposals from other countries for trade deals with the US, adding: “Everyone involved wants to see a trade deal happen.”The uncertainty over tariffs in the financial markets has also been amplified by Trump calling on the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate, with the president saying he could fire Fed chair Jerome Powell if he wanted to do so.Trump later saidhe wanted Powell to “be early” in lowering rates and that he has no intention of firing the Fed chair, despite previously suggesting that he would.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsUS economyChinaUS foreign policyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The chancellor, who will meet her US counterpart, Scott Bessent, for the first time, is expected topress the UK’s case for reduced tariffs. She said she would be “defending British interests and making the case for free and fair trade”.Publishing the latest edition of its World Economic Outlook, the Washington-based IMF cut its forecast for global GDP growth to 2.8% for this year – 0.5% weaker than it was expecting as recently as January.The IMF said that while its forecasts had been prepared on the basis of current trade policy, “intensifying downside risks dominate the outlook”.Its forecasts show every major economy being hit, with the UK expected to grow by 1.1% this year, down from 1.6% predicted in January. The IMF expects a sharper deterioration for the US, from 2.7% to 1.8%.It said that although tariffs and the uncertainty created would weigh on the economy in the UK, “domestic factors” were mainly to blame for the downgraded growth forecast. These included increased government borrowing costs and weaker consumer spending in response to higher UK inflation, partly driven by rising energy bills.US to impose tariffs of up to 3,521% on south-east Asia solar panelsRead moreResponding to the UK downgrade, Reeves highlighted the fact that the IMF still expected it to be the “fastest-growing European G7 economy” in 2025.As its spring meetings kick off, the IMF said that even after Trump’s “pause”, which suspended punitive “reciprocal tariffs” on a string of countries, trade barriers were at the highest level in a century.Given the lack of clarity about the future direction of the policy, it predicted that companies throughout the global economy were likely to respond by cutting spending.“Faced with increased uncertainty about access to markets – their own but also those of their suppliers and customers – many firms’ initial reaction will be to pause, reduce investment, and cut purchases. Likewise, financial institutions will re-evaluate their credit supply to businesses,” it said.“The combined increased uncertainty and resulting tightening of financial conditions are a global negative demand shock and will weigh on activity.”The IMF added that emerging economies may be hit especially hard, as “unfavourable global financial conditions” make it harder for them to service their debts – a situation that could be exacerbated by overseas aid cuts.The UK recently announced ahistoric cut to its aid budget, to fund defence spending, and Trump is battling court action as heattempts to dismantle USAID.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is unclear what role the US could take in any such discussion, however, given its commitment to an “America first” approach.The IMF expressed concern in the report about the shock waves unleashed in financial markets by Trump’s trade policies – and said worse may be to come.In particular, it points to the risk of “strong volatility” in currency markets, which “may be difficult to navigate, especially for emerging market economies”.The dollar was up 0.5% on Tuesday after earlier hitting aa three-year low, as Trump issued further criticism of Jay Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, calling him “Mr Too Late” for failing to cut interest rates.Wall Street shares rose on Tuesday after the US treasury secretary suggested a trade war with China was unsustainable and that the world’s two largest economies would have to find a way to de-escalate.Bessent made the comments at a closed-door investor summit, according to Bloomberg. US shares had already opened higher and picked up after the comments were reported, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 both up by more than 2%.The IMF said the probability of a recession in the US had increased to nearly 40%, higher than its forecast of 25% made in October, the month before Trump’selection victory.Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyTrump tariffsInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)EconomicsTariffsUS economyEconomic growth (GDP)ShareReuse this content"

Musk’s remarks came as the company reported a massive dip in both profits and revenues in the first quarter of 2025 amid backlash against his role in the White House.On an investor call, Musk said the work necessary to get the government’s “financial house in order is mostly done”.“Starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to Doge will drop significantly,” he said.That said, he expects to spend one to two days a week continuing to do what he referred to as “critical work” at Doge “for as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it is useful”.Musk is scheduled to leave Doge on May 30, a strict 130-day cap on his service as a special government employee.Tesla saw a 9% drop in revenue year over year in the first quarter of 2025. The company brought in $19.3bn in revenue, well below Wall Street expectations of $21.45bn. The company reported an earnings per share of 27 cents, also well under investor expectations of 43 cents in earnings per share.Tesla profits also slid 71% to $409m compared with $1.39bn in net income the previous year.The companysuffered a 13% drop in vehicle deliveries, making it the company’s worst quarter since 2022.Teslaclosed the quarter with 336,681 vehicles delivered.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators protest against Elon Musk and Doge cuts outside of a Tesla dealership in Kansas City, Missouri, on 12 April.Photograph: Charlie Riedel/APThough Musk has acknowledged there have been “rocky moments” of late, he remained optimistic about the company’s future.“The future for Tesla is better than ever,” he said. “The value of the company is delivering sustainable abundance with our affordable AI-powered robots. If you say, what’s the ideal future that you can imagine, that’s what you’d want. You’d want abundance for all in a way that’s sustainable, that’s good for the environment. Basically this is a happy future, this is the happiest future you can imagine.”That “happy future” includes the company’s plans for fully self-driving cars, said the billionaire CEO as he laid out an ambitious timeline for when he expects the vehicles to hit US roads in some cities – “by the end of the year”. Tesla hashistorically struggled to meettimelines Musk has publicly set for the launch of new products, especially when it comes to self-driving.“The acid test is, can you go to sleep in your car and wake up in your destination and I’m confident that will be available in many cities in the US by the end of this year,” he said.This would be on top of the Robotaxi service the company plans to roll out in June. “I predict that there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year,” Musk said.Despite missing Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom line, initial analyst reactions are optimistic given many had significantly lowered their expectations after the company reported a massive dip in vehicle deliveries.“Against the backdrop of catastrophic expectations, with everything from sales to margins projected to continue the slump, the less-than-bad numbers have been received as welcome news by Tesla investors,” said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst atInvesting.com.“In a curious turn of events, it’s as if numbers show that even at the worst moment, Elon and the team’s operation can still bring a robust $19.3bn in revenue, with total revenue partly making up for the huge drop in auto revenue.“If this is the worst it gets for Tesla, then certainly there must be some upside for the stock once tailwinds, such as the highly awaited cheaper model and the Robotaxi, finally hit the market later this year,” Monteiro continued.Analysts attribute the company’s overall difficulties to a number of factors, but ultimately concludeMusk’s role in the White House has caused a branding crisis for Tesla. The company is at a major crossroads, analysts say, that will only be remedied if Musk leaves his role in Doge and returns to Tesla as CEO full time.Doge cuts spark questions as employees supporting Musk space launches sparedRead moreIn addition to a drop in sales, a 50% dip in share prices, existing Tesla owners are looking to sell their vehicles in droves, Teslas have been vandalized across the country and in response to ongoing protests of the automaker, the Vancouver International Auto show removed the electronic carmaker from its March lineup. The company also recalled 46,000 Cybertrucks – nearly all that had been sold.Musk said that the drop in demand is due to the macro economic trends – not branding. “Tesla is not immune to the macro demand for cars,” Musk said. “When there is economic uncertainty, people generally want to pause on doing a major capital purchase like a car. Absent macro issues we don’t see any reduction in demand.”Analysts are not convinced.“If Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage…but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO to drive the vision and the long term story will not be altered,” read a Wedbush Securities analyst note. Wedbush remained bullish on the company’s chances of turning its financials around. “IF Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow.”The company declined to provide forward-looking guidance for the next quarter citing “shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains”.“While we are making prudent investments that will set up both our vehicle and energy businesses for growth, the rate of growth this year will depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts, production ramp at our factories and the broader macroeconomic environment,” the earnings report reads. “We will revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”The company did warn, however, that “changing political sentiment” could meaningfully impact short-term demand for Tesla products.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

They accused Chinese companies with factories in Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam of shipping panels priced below their cost of production, owing to unfair state subsidies.However, critics, including the Solar Energy Industries Association trade group, have said tariffs would harm US solar producers because they would raise prices on the imported cells that are assembled into panels at American factories.Separately, the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, outlined concerns about the future of energy security ahead of a60-country summitin London on Thursday and Friday that he is hosting with the UK energy secretary, Ed Miliband.It will be attended by ministers from the US, Japan, France, Germany and India, and oil-producing states including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, along with the bosses of big oil and gas companies and renewable energy companies. Russia is excluded, andChina will be absentbecause of a diary clash, in a blow to the summit.Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sparked international sanctions, the loss of Russian gas from Europe, a spike in wholesale energy costs and a rush to secure alternative energy supplies.Birol told the Financial Timeshe thought the “lessons from Ukraine have not yet been fully understood”, adding that there were three golden rules for energy security: diversification of supplies, sufficient political predictability to allow companies to make long-term investments, and global cooperation.Europe remains heavily reliant on imported gas and markets have been volatile, amid changes to energy subsidies and regulations, and the trade war unleashed by Donald Trump’s frequent tariff announcements.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They alleged that the corporation dispensed millions of unlawful prescriptions and later sought reimbursement for said substances through Medicare and other federal healthcare programs, a violation of the False Claims Act.The complaint also alleged Walgreens “systematically pressured its pharmacists to fill prescriptions, including controlled substance prescriptions, without taking the time needed to confirm their validity”. This practice allegedly continued for more than a decade, between August 2012 and March 2023.“These practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores,” the statement added.The prescriptions included substances such as opioids and “trinity”, referring to the often abused combination of opioids, benzodiazepine and muscle relaxants.“This lawsuit seeks to hold Walgreens accountable for the many years that it failed to meet its obligations when dispensing dangerous opioids and other drugs,” said the former principal deputy assistant attorney general Brian M Boynton, head of the justice department’s civil division, in a statement.A Walgreens spokesperson, Fraser Engerman, said in a statement to the Guardian that the company “strongly [disagrees] with the government’s legal theory and admit no liability”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I can, however, confirm that we are closing the redundancy consultation without action. Since the government passed its legislation on Saturday, we have been working day and night to ensure we are able to stabilise our operations.British Steel must now join the modern economy, not be a prisoner of the old | Will HuttonRead moreBritish Steel said that ensuring continued supply of coking coal to the plant hadavoided the need for a so-called “salamander tap”, a process in which a hole is drilled in the bottom of the blast furnace to let out, or tap, molten metal and slag.Tapping Queen Bess would have effectively paused its operations, allowing the limited remaining raw materials available to be diverted to keep Queen Anne burning as normal. In theory, Bess could have been restarted but in practice this is not cost-efficient for furnaces that are nearing the end of their lives.The industry minister, Sarah Jones, said: “The action this government took on 12 April, and the measures we’ve taken since, matter greatly for this country, and are of huge importance to thousands of steelworkers and their families. We will always stand up for our steel industry.“Now, thanks to our decisive action to protect steelmaking at Scunthorpe, British Steel has cancelled the redundancy consultations started by its owners Jingye, bringing certainty for thousands of hard-working staff for the long term.”TheUniteunion said: “Unite are pleased that British Steel have come to their senses and realised that job losses are not the way to ensure Britain remains an industrial power.“This should be just the first step to begin the process of nationalisation. The government now needs to implement a wholesale overhaul of its energy policy with a commitment to invest in renewables to lower energy prices for heavy industry like steel production.”Alun Davies, the national secretary for steel at the Community Union, said: “We welcome these positive developments, which follow constructive discussions between steel unions, the Labour government and British Steel management.“We look forward to continuing these productive relationships going forward. Through this collective effort, backed up by the commitment and resolve of the workforce, Scunthorpe steelmaking was saved from a disastrous cliff edge.“We will now continue to work tirelessly to ensure the business gets the bright future it needs and deserves.”Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelSteel industryIndustrial policyUniteJob lossesManufacturing sectorTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

ForManchester City, Pep Guardiola showed sheer delight at a late, late victory that lifts them to third on 61 points, four ahead of Chelsea in sixth. Across from him, Unai Emery felt despair as Aston Villa were down in seventh, the Spaniard’s next job to lift his men for their FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace on Saturday.Nunes’s far-post strike from Jérémy Doku’s cross from the left also disappointed Nottingham Forest, Newcastle United and Chelsea in the race for the top-five berth that secures a Champions League place.‘So important’: Pep Guardiola delight after last-gasp strike stuns Aston VillaRead moreUntil Nunes’s intervention, Marcus Rashford, chosen at No 9 by Emery, was the star turn, scoring Villa’s goal – from the spot – as he menaced City’s backline until his removal on 75 minutes: 17 seconds were all the 27‑year‑old forward needed to splay City. The champions’ midfield slumbered, Youri Tielemans made a mug of Josko Gvardiol and found Rashford, who twisted Rúben Dias’s blood and shot: the ball bounced from the base of Stefan Ortega’s left post and the game remained scoreless.Not for long. City have lacked speed this term, in thought and execution, and this was precisely how Omar Marmoush undid the visitors. The Egyptian swooped around Matty Cash and fired in a cross from the left that deflected into Bernardo Silva; the Portuguese unloaded and a weak Emiliano Martínez parry only pushed the ball in.For his United connection Rashford was booed each time he collected so, when roaring along the left in the move that led to the penalty, he could chuckle. The ball came to Jacob Ramsey, Dias barged him over, and Craig Pawson initially refused the spot-kick. It seemed obvious so there was scant surprise when the VAR, John Brooks, ordered the referee to the monitor. To Guardiola’s fury Pawson gave the penalty and Rashford, via a slow boot-shuffle, fooled Ortega and rolled the ball in, to the goalkeeper’s left, and his delight.View image in fullscreenEmiliano Martínez is beaten by David Silva’s shot as Manchester City take an early lead.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersFor the rage directed at the assistant referee, Guardiola was booked – provoking disgust – his anger having ratcheted up when the incident was replayed on the stadium screen before Rashford’s penalty. So, we had a contest that bubbled. An on‑loan United man had registered the equaliser, City felt swindled (wrongly), and Pawson fielded jeers each time he failed to give them what they wished: basically, every decision.Martínez’s self-proclaimed “all powerful” on-field persona nearly took another battering moments later. A poor clearance from the Argentinian went straight to Silva, who headed it back into the area for Marmoush to take aim. But rushing out, Villa’s No 1 smothered the ball, so he and Villa escaped.Rashford, in for Ollie Watkins as one of five Emery changes, was near unplayable. Lucas Digne was found on the left, the Villa No 9 fashioned a curving sprint that kept him onside, shredded City’s rearguard and took him in behind. What ensued was a clumsy touch – a Rashford achilles heel – and an attempted dink above the advancing Ortega that was fluffed – his finishing another weakness.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Guardiola’s two changes were James McAtee and Mateo Kovacic for Savinho and Nico González but at the close of an invigorating period it was Rashford, again, who was the key factor among the fresh personnel.

The Villa forward went down under Josko Gvardiol’s attentions, but Pawson was not interested. On show was a bout between two foes who parried, jabbed and counterpunched and City did the latter, launching a raid that claimed a free-kick that pushed Villa back.McAtee’s delivery, from an inside‑left channel, was scrambled out by Onana for a corner and City had three in succession: one from the right, the others from the left, all taken by Kevin De Bruyne, all failing to breach Villa.Guardiola spoke of McAtee, who was City’s nominal No 9, having special qualities required for this game. When De Bruyne passed to him and he took aim, here was a chance to show finishing – but, while the lob over Martinez was audacious, it flew wide to the keeper’s left. The Catalan puffed his cheeks, the crowd “oohed” and, soon, Rashford caused a similar reaction when barrelling in and rounding Ortega, the effort, from an angle on the right, missing.In City’s last home match McAtee scored – against Crystal Palace – while spurning several chances and a further miss when Nico O’Reilly delivered from the left again suggested he may not be as lethal as required. Towards the end Marmoush put the ball in the net but was rightly ruled offside. Next came Nunes’s priceless moment of glory.“I am overall proud of everything we are doing,” Emery said.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Biles will be 31 when the LA Olympics start: theoldest all-around female gymnastics championis Maria Gorokhovskaya, who won gold at the age of 30 at the 1952 Games.“I’m really trying to enjoy life, to spend time with my husband [NFL player Jonathan Owens)], go support him at his games, live my life as a woman,” she said in an interview with French sports daily L’Equipe published on Tuesday. “I’ve accomplished so much in my sport. For me to come back, it would really have to excite me.”Simone Biles’ coach says gymnast suffered from ‘twisties’ before 2016 OlympicsRead moreBiles, the most decorated gymnast of all time, says many fans underestimate the time taken in preparing for the Olympics. “A lot of people think it’s just a one-year commitment but it truly is the four years leading up to the Olympics,” she said. “It’s in LA it’s back in the States, which is so exciting. But if I’m going to compete again, I’m not so sure.”Biles said she will attend the Games in LA, but is unsure in what capacity. “Whether on the [gymnastics] apparatus or in the stands, I still don’t know that,” she told L’Equipe. “But 2028 seems so far away, and my body is aging. I felt it in Paris.”Biles won three gold medals and a silver at the Paris Olympics, taking her career tally to seven Olympic golds and 11 medals overall. But she says her body suffered under the strain.“I went back to the [Olympic] village, I took the elevator and my body literally collapsed. I was sick for 10 days,” she said, before recounting another experience. “The other day, we were sprinting in the garden with friends, I had aches and pains for three days. So, I honestly don’t know. We’ll see.”She praised her rival, Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, for recovering from injury and for “pushing me beyond my limits,” but also said gymnastics no longer needs both of them.“It only needs one of us, no? Especially since [Andrade] will not be alone,” Biles said. “A young generation will knock at the door and everything will start again.”The interview took place before Monday’s Laureus Awards in Madrid, where Biles was named sportswoman of the year. Swedish pole vaulter Armand Duplantis, the double Olympic champion and world record holder, was named sportsman of the year.Whatever she decides regarding her career, Biles says she will continue to speak about mental health. Biles withdrew from several events at the Tokyo Olympics, partly because she wanted topreserve her mental health.“I am very proud of the work accomplished to reach this point,” she said, “and I will continue to be the voice of the voiceless.”Explore more on these topicsSimone BilesGymnasticsLA Olympic Games 2028Olympic GamesUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump bought the property in 2014 and has spent £200m upgrading the resort’s courses.Reopening of Trump-owned golf course delayed after damage by pro-Palestine groupRead moreIn 2021, after the 6 January attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters, theR&A said it would not stage championshipsat Turnberry “until we are convinced that the focus will be on the championship, the players and the course itself and we do not believe that is achievable in the current circumstances.”But on Tuesday, Darbon said the body’s main concerns over returning to the venue are logistical rather than political.“At Turnberry, there are definitely some logistical and commercial challenges that we face around the road, rail and accommodation infrastructure,” Darbon said. “We’re doing some feasibility work around what it would look like to return to that venue and the investment that it would require.”Turnberry is a 30 minute drive from the nearest large town, Ayr, although there is limited rail service to nearby Girvan, a 10 minute drive from the course and hotel.The 153rd edition of the Open, one of golf’s major championships, will take place from 13-20 July at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland, with the R&A announcing on Tuesday that a record attendance of 278,000 fans is expected at the event.“The last time we were there [Turnberry], I think we had just over 120,000 people,” Darbon said. “We’ve just announced that this summer we’re going to welcome nearly 280,000 people [at Royal Portrush]. A modern Open Championship is a large-scale event.

It’s not hard to disprove his theoriesJacob UittiTue 22 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 09.30 EDTShareWhen Tarik El-Abour was in middle school, his teacher asked him and his classmates a simple question.What do you want to be when you grow up?When it was time for him to answer, El-Abour gave a reply that thousands of children have said before. He wanted to be abaseball player. But his teacher shot back with something less than encouraging: “You’d better have a Plan B.” El-Abour, who was diagnosed with autism at the age of three, remained undeterred. Rather than listening to his pessimistic instructor, he distanced himself from her.He thought that if he continued to talk to her, she might convince him he was unable to achieve his goal. In the end, he was right, and the teacher was wrong. El-Abour grew up to become a baseball player after receiving a degree in business administration from Bristol University in California. He first played professionally in the Empire League, where he was named rookie of the year in 2016 and was an All-Star in 2017. Then, in 2018, he signed a deal with the Kansas City Royals, a franchise then just three years removed from winning the World Series. He played outfield in the minor leagues duringthe 2018 season, flourishing under the mentorship of JD Nichols of World Wide Baseball Prospects and Reggie Sanders of the Royals, becoming the first recorded autistic player in MLB history.RFK’s statements prove autistic people and their families everywhere should fear Trump and his allies | John HarrisRead moreAll of this will be news to the US health and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr,who said earlier this month that: “Autism destroys families, and more importantly, it destroys our greatest resource, which is our children … These are kids who will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”El-Abour chooses to let Kennedy’s comments slide off him.“When it comes to politics,” the 32-year-old tells the Guardian, “I’m so used to crazy stuff being said by people. I’m just in a spot where it doesn’t really get to me. I get that’s just how some things are. The way I look at it, the only things I care about are the things I have control over – like baseball and those I care about most.”El-Abour, who is now playing in the Zone 22 scouting league in Los Angeles and hoping for another shot at the majors, says he doesn’t know what it’s likenotto be autistic. But he explains that the way his brain works helps him focus and embrace repetition – both valuable qualities for a ballplayer. “Baseball requires a lot of repetition to be good at it,” he says. “And people with autism tend to be repetitive. I guess that’s maybe where it benefits me.”Kennedy, a fan of doing his own research, may want to note that El-Abour is not the only autistic professional athlete in the US. Nine-year NBA vet Tony Snell,who also has two autistic sons, was diagnosed with autism. “Learning I have [autism] helped me understand my whole life,” said Snell in arecent interview. “This is why I am the way I am.” Joe Barksdale, who revealed in 2022 that he was diagnosed with autism, played eight years in the NFL. And Nascar driver Armani Williams also stated publicly he is autistic. Of course, there aremore autistic athletes coming up in the ranks, too.“It was a surprise when the [Kennedy] news came out last week,” El-Abour’s mother, Nadia, tells the Guardian. “I wanted to post something then Tarik said, ‘No, the [media] will take care of it.’ Tarik started laughing. He goes, ‘Oh, wow, why did he [Kennedy] choose baseball?’”She says that, unlike some politicians today, her son is very logical. Many autistic people, she explains, don’t attach emotion to the truth. Something simply either is true or it isn’t. “They can’t understand why we don’t accept the truth,” Nadia says. It’s the same reasoning El-Abour employed when flouting his middle school teacher’s “Plan B” idea. In fact, he bristled at it so much that he didn’t even want to be around the energy of the school building, often crossing the street rather than walk near it.“He doesn’t see obstacles,” Nadia says of her son. “He doesn’t think of ‘I can’t.’ He just thinks, ‘How … how can I do that?’”El-Abour, who was non-verbal until he was about six years old, started playing baseball later in life than most pros, starting around 10 years old. At first, he was unsure if he liked the game, which his father signed him up for. But when he got into the batter’s box,something happened. He even gave up his spot as pitcher on the team because he was told pitchers don’t bat in the pros. From then on, he arranged his whole life around things that would make him be a better player. He painted an X on the garage to practice his throwing accuracy. He took fly balls into the night with his coaches. Rather than being something unattainable, as Kennedy would have us believe, baseball helped El-Abour blossom.Indeed, El-Abour’s life is a far cry from the picture Kennedy Jr and others have tried to paint. But despite any number of ignorant comments, El-Abour says he’s grateful for who he is and proud of what he’s achieved so far in his life. He says “it’s an honor” that people ask him about his autism and he’s glad he can add to the conversation. “It’s very humbling,” El-Abour says, “to be possibly making an impact. Baseball really gave me something that I enjoy and love doing. It always gives me something to be motivated for and to be better at each day throughout my life. And that’s really good.”Explore more on these topicsBaseballMLBUS sportsRobert F Kennedy JrAutismUS politicsKansas City RoyalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s worth considering other optionsOliver ConnollyTue 22 Apr 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 11.45 EDTShareThere is something funky about the draft being one of the NFL’s marquee events. At root, it’s a man stepping to the podium,being booedand reading names. The NFL still dominates Sundays … and Mondays … and Thursdays … and playoff Saturdays during the season; the draft allows the league to gobble up the offseason months too. But as interest continues to grow, there has been relatively little pushback from those who make the draft work: the prospects, particularly those slated to go at the top of the first round.Think about it. Your reward for being one of the best college athletes in the country is to wind up on one of the worst rosters in theNFL, typically one beset by mismanagement at the top, iffy coaching or a third-rate roster. Quarterbackscanwin with teams that draft them No 1 overall – Peyton Manning and Troy Aikman are a couple of examples – but more often than not, the top quarterbacks end up in a spot where they’re likely to fail. There is a reason that Sam Darnold and Baker Mayfield found successafterthey were let go by the teams that selected them in the top three. Environment is king – having no say over where they start their career puts the best prospects at the whims of blundering franchises. Is there a system that can maintain the interest and parity the league craves, while handing some agency to players over their careers – or at least not reward floundering franchises?No system is perfect: all the ideas below have flaws. But they’re at least worth thinking about.NFL scouting is broken. Colorado’s Shedeur Sanders is all the proof you need | Andrew LawrenceRead moreFlip-flop the draft orderRather than have teams slotted 1-32 based on their record the year before, those at the bottom of the league standings would not be rewarded with the earliest picks. Instead, the teams closest to the playoffs would “earn” the top draft choices.The 14 teams that make the playoffs would still hold picks No 18 through No 32, but the non-playoff teams would be rewarded for how close they came to making the postseason. In that scenario this year, Seattle would hold the No 1 overall pick as the team with the best record to miss the playoffs in 2024. The Titans, who had the worst record in 2024, would pick at 18.Flipping the order would ding the league’s sense of parity, making it tougher for failing franchises to quickly reboot. But it would make the end of the league’s regular season spicier, as teams fight to get closer to the playoff race. Rather than hand a top prize to the league’s weakest franchises, it would encourage rebuildingteams trying to chase the postseason.There would be obvious downstream effects. Would a team tank out of a playoff spot to try to snag the No 1 overall pick? Would terrible teams be mired in futility forever without a top-five selection? But no system is perfect – and this one would encourage teams to be more aggressive chasing in-season moves, and put more top prospects on teams with solid foundations.A draft lotteryA more palatable solution: a lottery system for all non-playoff teams. The NBA, NHL and MLB allemploy weighted draft lottery systems, with the franchises with the weakest records given the best odds of landing a top pick. The NBA instituted its lottery in 1985 to fend off teams from tanking for top picks, and then flattened its weighting in 2019 to curb the latest efforts of franchises tolose their way into a franchise-altering player. Unlike the NBA or NHL, the NFL has not been a victim of serious tanking efforts (although some have tried). The season is too small. Careers are on the line. The lack of guaranteed contracts makes every rep an audition for fringe and rotational players looking for a new deal. One player, even a gifted quarterback prospect, cannot change an NFL franchise the way someone likeVictor Wembanyama can in the NBA. Not since Andrew Luck have multiple franchises tried to chuck a season away for a top quarterback prospect. But there remains some late-season chicanery as teams jockey for position. And with the prospect of Arch Manning on the horizon, franchises who are out of the playoff picture by Thanksgiving will probably start maneuvering to select the Texas quarterback No 1 overall next season.A lottery would give the leagueanother showcase event in the draft cycle, and tilt the odds that some well-run franchises would leap up the draft board. Imagine the pandemonium if the 49ers or Seahawks snagged the top spot this season, with Travis Hunter waiting in the wings.Good for league parity? Possibly. Handing the players some say in their destination? No. A chance that Mel Kiper melts into a puddle on set? Absolutely. For the drama alone, it’s worth the league investigating.View image in fullscreenNFL teams could stash young players like Arch Manning under a tweaked format.Photograph: Aaron E Martinez/USA Today SportsWaiving the eligibility ruleNFL rules state that a player must be three years removed from high school to be eligible for the draft. According to the league, the game is too physically and mentally demanding for an 18-year-old to cope with. But the unspoken part of the NFL’s criteria is that it gives teams more time to evaluate players, using college football as an effective minor league. In thepre-NIL era, when student-athletes were working for free, it was a grim spectacle. With players now able to earn money in college, the system is less grotesque.But the eligibility rules can still be reworked, potentially formalizing college football as the pipeline system to the pros. There are multiple ways of tinkering. One: to have all players eligible to be drafted, but not eligible to play until they’re three years removed from college. In that world, franchises would decide whether it’s worth drafting, stashing and developing a player until they can see the field, or select a prospect they know can play as a rookie.In a recent Pro Football Focusall-eligible mock draft, five playersnoteligible for this year’s class were selected in the top 10. Some of those players will inevitably fade away by the time they are eligible to be picked in real life. Injuries could sap some potential, or weaknesses could be exposed. But why should those players not be able to cash in on their draft stock today?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAs college football becomes increasingly professionalized, players should be able to choose when to test the NFL waters. Franchises should decide whether to select a talented player a year or two before they are eligible to play on Sundays.The league could either allow teams to select players and make them a part of their practice squad until they can play, or have teams retain the draft rights of a player while they’re still in college. If the players are being paid in college, there is no downside to them being on the NFL’s books. It would be up to the player to decide when they want to leave school and enter the pros, rather than arbitrarily operating on the league’s timeline. And it would be up to teams to decide if they would rather takeArch Manning No 1 overall this seasonand sit him for a year or wade into this year’s eligible crop of quarterbacks.Shifting the requirements would hand some say to players over their careers and give them a chance to earn off their talent before a potential injury robs them of their opportunity to earn a pro contract. It would also end the non-stop moaning from the league’s executives that college football is not adequately developing players.Salary poolIf you were starting from scratch, a salary pool makes more sense than a traditional draft. Remove yourself from the big boards and mock drafts, and you’re left wondering why players have no say over where they work. After all, Starbucks does not accept top applicants and then send them to its worst outlet.Built different: Is the 6XL, 464lb Desmond Watson too large for the NFL?Read moreA salary pool would be an augmented version of the traditional draft. The team with the worst record would receive the largest pool of cash, descending to the Super Bowl champions, who would get the least. Let’s say this year, the Titans get $60m in rookie money and the Eagles get $30m. From there, teams and prospects are free to negotiate as they see fit. A team could splurge all its money on a generational prospect, or spread the wealth across 15 intriguing rookies.The idea of an “auction” draft is unsavory, at best.The sinister undertonesdo not need describing in more detail. But by implementing a negotiated system rather than a highest-bidder scheme, players would be given as much power as owners by having the opportunity to balance the best contract they can sign with the right environment. Maybe Travis Hunter would leave some money on the table to line up with Patrick Mahomes or Josh Allen, or maybe he would like to make gobs of money from the Giants or Browns. It would be his choice.By tiering the pool available to each franchise, the teams at the bottom of the standings would still have an upper hand in negotiations, allowing them to chuck more money at the top prospects or share the money across several second-tier prospects to rebuild. Baseball has moved to asimilar salary poolfor young, overseas rookies.The idea will probably never pass muster with the league. It would remove the tension of draft night, robbing viewers of televisual drama, and the league of attention. But it could lead to a frenetic, weeks-long process, akin to free agency, with teams waiting on the top dominoes to fall. Plus, every fanbase would know they have a chance at the premium prospects. By making it a negotiation rather than a selection process, players would have some control over where they play, and basing the salary pool on a team’s record from the year before would help maintain a sense of parity.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, those five haven’t played together yet, and the star combo of Davis and Irving shared fewer than three quarters together because of injuries to both players.“We feel that’s a championship-caliber team and we would have been winning at a high level and that would have quieted some of the outrage,” Harrison said. “And so unfortunately we weren’t able to do that, so it just continued to go on and on.Harrison said he believed the Mavs will get a good player in the first round of this year’s draft, where they are slated to pick 11th. He also didn’t rule out changes in free agency. But when asked what Dallas needed to become a contender again, Harrison said, “Really, we just need to get healthy. I think the team we’re bringing back is a championship caliber. We fully expect to have Kyrie back with us next year when he gets healed from his injury. And we believe we’ll be competing for a championship.”Harrison said repeatedly last week that “defense wins championships” while defending the trade.

Farke is a little too unconventional, a little too resistant to groupthink, to always do the expected and his club’s owner, the San Francisco‑based 49ers Enterprises, is poised to reap the benefits.The German’s unusual amalgam of high emotional intelligence and advanced numeracy have helped to provide the framework for the freshly secured promotion to the Premier League that Leeds so narrowly missed out on last May.Burnley rise again but will Parker’s battlers buck trend of recent history? | Will UnwinRead moreAs the stars of that campaign – Crysencio Summerville, Archie Gray and Georginio Rutter – departed and Elland Road regulars despaired, Farke held his nerve. With English football’s spending rules complied with, the manager reconstructed a slimmed-down squad in a manner befitting his former roles as an economics student and the sporting director of the German club Lippstadt.In, among others, came Ao Tanaka for £3.5m from Fortuna Düsseldorf, Jayden Bogle for £5m from Sheffield United and the Tottenham loanee Manor Solomon. While Japan’s Tanaka proved one of the second tier’s best anchoring midfielders, Bogle shone as an increasingly outstanding attacking right‑back and Israel’s Solomon impressed on the left wing.Farke had never really wanted to be a coach. As a third-tier player in Germany he studied economics and became more interested in contracts, taxes and balance sheets than tactics. His dream was to remain in football as a sporting director and it came true at Lippstadt, where he oversaw the construction of a new stadium.Fate intervened when Farke, temporarily combining that job with training the team, secured nine wins in 10 games. An offer to coach Borussia Dortmund’s second string scuppered a subsequent plan to take a sabbatical travelling the world, and the experience of working alongside his friend Thomas Tuchel, then Dortmund’s first-team manager, helped to persuade him he was not too shabby at tactics after all.Three promotions from theChampionship, the first two with Norwich, have ensued, the most recent showcasing the 48‑year‑old’s ability to create a Leeds side arguably exceeding the sum of its parts. If Tanaka, Bogle and, should he stay, Solomon have the ability to hold their own in the top tier, so too do the Welsh trio Ethan Ampadu (Farke’s excellent captain), Joe Rodon and Daniel James.View image in fullscreenKarl Darlow has been first choice for Leeds during the run-in but Daniel Farke has also shown a lot of trust in Illan Meslier.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAThis time last year Farke said his team would have been promoted had Patrick Bamford stayed fit but 12 months later the Championship has been escaped despite an injury‑plagued Bamford kicking far fewer balls than his manager would have liked. Much of that is down to Joël Piroe’s 19 goals but the limitations of Piroe’s all-round game dictate that a centre‑forward – along with a No 10 and, quite possibly, a goalkeeper – seems to be a transfer priority.If Bamford undoubtedly retains the quality to excel at Premier League level his fitness record leaves question marks, and Illan Meslier’s goalkeeping talent has been undermined by a creeping susceptibility to making mistakes under pressure, particularly at set plays. Meslier is far too gifted – his footwork is top-drawer – for the Frenchman’s career to be written off but he quite possibly needs a change of scene. Farke, bravely, replaced Meslier with Karl Darlow during the run-in but, although the former Newcastle No 2 proved solidity personified, the manager’s long-running persistence with Meslier suggests he may not quite trust Darlow at the highest level.As Leeds enjoy the moment, such decisions remain for the future. “Don’t stress me with the Premier League right now,” Farke said after confirmation of his team’s promotionon Monday night. “We want to become an established Premier League side but lots of work, lots of ambition, is needed.”It perhaps does not help that Elland Road’s much-admired chief executive, Angus Kinnear, is leaving for Everton this summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That latter figure is relatively modest by Premier League standards, dictating that staying within profitability and sustainability rules will remain an issue next season.“The domestic transfer market’s overpriced,” Farke said recently. “That means we have to be creative and think outside the box; we’re increasingly looking outside Europe.”Matters are complicated further by the need for 49ers Enterprises to invest significant funds in updating and expanding an outdated Elland Road, with a formal planning application due for imminent submission to the city council.It appears Farke may soon need to draw heavily on the emotional balance and original thinking that shine through during his invariably sure-footed yet always interesting media addresses. Club officials say his dressing-room persona is little different but it will be intriguing to see whether a manager uncomfortably aware that last season’s cohort of promoted clubs are coming straight back down will take into account the height and physique of new signings.If a possession-dominant, technically accomplished Leeds are, by common consensus, the Championship’s best side, they are comparatively diminutive. At a time when athleticism and physicality are increasingly prized top-flight attributes, that matters.“In the past 21 years this club has spent only three seasons in the Premier League but that’s where Leeds belongs,” Farke said. “My job was to get us there – now it’s keeping us there.”Explore more on these topicsLeeds UnitedChampionshipanalysisShareReuse this content"

And on top of that, he’s obviously an unbelievable player. In this situa­tion, I’m sure that he would have ­absolutely zero idea of anything. That’s just the way life goes – sometimes there’s mistakes.“In terms of actually how I feel about him as a person, I think it’s important for people to know and recognise that the guy’s very, very kind-hearted and a good human being. So he doesn’t deserve any of the hate that he gets.”Last week, after flying home following his difficultthird-round defeat against Alejandro Davidovich Fokinain Monte Carlo, the British No 1 returned to Monaco for a three-day training block with Sinner. Draper is the first top player to train with the Italian as he plots his return.The pair played on indoor clay atTennisClub de Beaulieu, which ­generated some attention since an ITF Junior event was being played at the same venue, and at the Monte Carlo Country Club, the venue of the Masters 1000 event.“I was looking for practice for the week and I knew that Jannik was availa­ble and in Monte Carlo on the clay so I organised with his team to go out there for three or four days and to train with him,” he said. “I mean, look, if you can train with anyone, it’s got to be probably the best in the world, right? He’s obviously had a bit of time off, but he’s playing at an incredible level still. I’m looking forward to having him back on the tour, because I think his presence has been missed. It was great to be with him for a few days and get some good sparring.”View image in fullscreenJack Draper has been working to improve his game on clay.Photograph: Manon Cruz/ReutersSinner is now in the final stretch of his three-month ban arising from his testing positive in March last year for the banned substance clostebol and he will return on home soil at the ­Italian Open next month, which will be a ­significant event for one of his country’s most prominent athletes.Shortly before the US Open in August last year, Sinner received a judgment of no fault or negligence and no suspensionat a first-instance ­hearing. The World Anti-Doping Agency thenappealed against the decisionto the court of ­arbitration for sport. The hearing had been sche­duled to begin last week but Wada and ­Sinner’s teamagreed in February on a case resolution ­agreement– essentially a settlement – with the two parties agreeing on a three‑month ban.According to Wada rules, Sinner had been banned from all officially sanctioned tournament venues for the first two months of his ­suspension but he was allowed to return to ­training at ­official venues and with his colleagues from one month before his return to competition.Draper and Sinner, both 23, played each other in doubles as juniors and have become friends during their time in the professional circuit. ­Sinner sent Draper messages of encouragement during his injury problems and even once taught the Englishman how to cook pasta. Since Sinner’s case was made public before the US Open in August, Draper has been supportive. In New York, days after the case had come to light, Draper stressed that he believed Sinner did not intentionally cheat. ­Privately, Draper has sent ­Sinner messages of encouragement, telling the world No 1 that he has been an inspiration in his own career.As both players prepared for their tournaments in the coming weeks, Draper attempting to make progress on clay and Sinner looking towards his return, their time on court was all business. “I didn’t speak to him too much to be honest,” Draper said.“On the court always, Jannik is very professional. He’s No 1 in the world for a reason. He’s very consistent, playing great. [That] hasn’t changed that at all. Maybe a bit rusty in some areas but, at the same time, he’s improving every day. The more points we played, the more he was getting better.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Draper sits one spot beneath Sinner in the ATP Race at No 4.Seeded fifth in Madrid, Draper has received a first-round bye and he will begin his tournament against either Tallon Griekspoor or a qualifier. Cameron Norrie, meanwhile, will face Martín Landaluce and has been joined in the main draw by Jacob Fearnley, who qualified with a 7-5, 6-1 win against Hugo Dellien.In the women’s draw, Emma Raducanu will face Suzan Lamens of the Netherlands, who recently defeated Katie Boulter in the Billie Jean King Cup.

Boulter’s appearance at the WTA 1,000 tournament is only the fifth time she has competed in the main draw of a tour-level clay event.Fellow Briton Fran Jones qualified for the main draw with a 7-6 (3), 3-6, 6-1 win over Spain’s Cristina Bucsa.Explore more on these topicsTennisJack DraperJannik SinnernewsShareReuse this content"

After internal discussions this morning, it turns out that it was our goalkeeper Vic Chambaere who kicked the ball on to the pitch,” said a statement. “This is an action that Union strongly disapproves of and which does not reflect our values or those of our supporters. Union will always fight to the bitter end on the pitch, but above all, we advocate respect and fair play, both on and off the pitch.“This morning, our management spoke with our technical staff and player Vic Chambaere. We also wish to apologise to the match referee and our opponent on Sunday afternoon for throwing the ball onto the pitch in the final minutes of the match.”The result allowed Club Brugge to move top of the standings with a two-point advantage to set up a close three-way contest for the title with four rounds of matches left. The 22-year-old Chambaere, who joined from Genk at the start of the season, was handed a four-match ban and fined €5,000 (£4,300) at a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday while Fadili was given a two-match ban for “misleading the referee” and fined €2,500.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballLa LigaBarcelonaMallorcaValenciaEspanyolLigue 1newsShareReuse this content"

They are at their best when they are playing and they have consistency in their performances.”A fixture rearranged because of Palace’s presence in the weekend’s FA Cup semi-finals hands Arteta five days to get ready for the first leg at home to Paris Saint-Germain, in pursuit of the club’s first European Cup. “It gives us more time to prepare for the game,” Arteta said. “Very unusual but we take it. We’re very short in numbers at the moment. That little break will be good for us.”Arsenal, on course to come second for the third season in succession but unable to maintain a sustained title challenge, have found Europe a welcome balm, though Arteta stands by his belief that injuries and ill fortune have affected this season’s domestic campaign. He said: “We are very clear about how we are doing in thePremier Leaguewith everything that happened. So I don’t think we have to make up for anything.” If Arsenal lose at home to Palace, Liverpool will be champions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t want to complain about fixtures but I think it’s not the best choice from the Premier League.“Villa play tonight and we play tomorrow – fair would be if both teams were playing on the same day, on Tuesday or on Wednesday.

If someone believes they have to save their energy for Saturday then it would be quite easy, but they said ‘no’ and want to show our style, identity and who we are by giving our best.

United could get a higher fee if Rashford were sold to another club.Pundits’ showy partisanship reflects football’s embrace of fan-centric populism | Jonathan LiewRead moreRashford earns about £365,000 a week and will have three years on his contract in the close season. His transfer would release about another £56m in saved salary, giving United close to £100m to finance the deal for Cunha.The Brazilian is thought to earn about £90,000 a week, so if he agreed terms for five years with a considerable salary increase, offloading ­Rashford should allow United to finance most of the purchase.Rashford is minded that he will not play again competitively for United while Amorim and this executive are at Old Trafford, owing to a breakdown in the relationship.Jadon Sancho, Antony, Casemiro and Rasmus Højlund are other players whose departure would boost United’s transfer budget. Amorim’s first-choice signing at centre-forward is Liam Delap, who has a £30m release if Ipswich are relegated, which is all but guaranteed.Sancho is on loan at Chelsea, who have an obligation to buy the forward for £22m-£25m but can pay United £5m if they decide to send him back. If he returns to Old Trafford his asking price would be a minimum of £20m. Offloading Sancho would source most of Delap’s cost.Antony has proved a success at Real Betis since moving on loan in January and United would hope to recoup at least £30m for the forward, who cost £81.5m in the summer of 2022.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Carter dug deep after O’Sullivan missed a long red to the top corner in the final frame of the day, gradually reeling in a 51-point deficit and nervelessly clearing the colours to cut his deficit to 5-4.John Higgins fights through emotional turmoil to ignite Crucible challengeRead moreBefore Carter’s impressive recovery, respective breaks of 107 from both men had proved the highlights of an error-strewn affair. The sluggish display on the table was mirrored by relative serenity off it as the pair, who have engaged in a long-running and highly publicised feud over the course of their respective careers, shared a warm handshake before the opening frame.O’Sullivan and Carter barged shoulders during Carter’s 13-9 win in the second round in 2018 and recriminations flewafter O’Sullivan’s Masters final winlast year, with Carter accusing his rival of “snotting” all over the floor and O’Sullivan responding by saying Carter should “get a life”.After sharing the first two frames on Tuesday, O’Sullivan took the third when Carter failed to punish him for leaving a red dangling over the pocket – O’Sullivan’s subsequent century then put him in command at 3-1.Carter once again reduced the deficit but missed the simplest of straight reds on a break of 60 in the sixth and allowed O’Sullivan to clear up and regain his two-frame lead.For all his evident rustiness, O’Sullivan was clearly still capable of keeping a misfiring Carter at bay and a knock of 85 in the next sent him three frames clear. However, Carter responded with a 107 of his own then seized his chance in the final frame of the day with a fine clearance.“I didn’t really expect much today,” O’Sullivan told TNT Sports. “I thought if I could get a few frames off Ali and make it a little bit competitive, I’d be happy with that.”View image in fullscreenJudd Trump plays a shot during his first-round match against Zhou Yuelong.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAAsked about some wayward shots, he said: “I’ve had four years of it to be honest with you, hitting the ball all over the place. I’ve just got to try and tried to stay in the moment and play my way through it.”Judd Trump made steady progress towards the second round after establishing a 6-3 overnight lead against China’s Zhou Yuelong. The world No 1, still anxious to add to hissolitary 2019 title, threatened to overwhelm his opponent as he fired a break of 117 en route to a 5-1 lead.But the 35-year-old was dragged into a more attritional affair later in the session and Zhou was rewarded for an attacking start to the last frame with a break of 95 to give him a glimmer of hope ahead of Wednesday night’s conclusion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That helped him to narrow the deficit to 7-6 and then 8-7 before the Chinese player’s experience told and consecutive breaks of 116 and 75 took him through.Ding’s compatriot Si Jiahui, a surprise semi-finalist two years ago, repelled back-to-back centuries from David Gilbert to turn a 6-3 overnight lead into a 10-6 win.Shaun Murphy made a strong start to his attempt to win a second world title 20 years after his first as some heavy scoring secured a commanding 7-2 lead against Daniel Wells.

Ben Youngs, who made a record 127 appearances for his country, has confirmed he will be retiring from professional rugby in June after more than 500 senior games forLeicester, England, the Barbarians and the British & Irish Lions in a career spanning 18 years.Youngs has been a one-club man since his Tigers debut as a 17-year-old in 2007 but, at 35, will hang up his boots at the end of the current Premiership season. A five-timesPremiership winnerand three times a runner-up, he has played 332 matches for Leicester to date. In an England jersey he appeared in four World Cups and toured Australia in 2013 with the Lions, alongside his brother Tom. He was chosen for the 2017 Lions squad as well but withdrew from the tour of New Zealand for family reasons.The Breakdown | Just for kicks, the top 10 rugby union sharp shooters of the past 30 yearsRead moreIt has been some journey, one that has taken him from the family farm in north Norfolk to the world’s biggest stadiums without diminishing his love for the game. His father, Nick, also represented Leicester and England and, between them, the Youngs family have made 692 appearances for the Tigers.Youngs’ class can be gauged by the dozens of rival scrum-halves who struggled to dislodge England’s “squadfather” from his starting role. After his debut as areplacement on the wing for Ugo Monyeagainst Scotland in 2010 – Martin Johnson was the England head coach at the time and Steve Borthwick was captain – he enjoyed a lengthy duel with Danny Care and only ceased to be England’s first-choice No 9 in 2023.It was all a far cry from his distant age-group days when Joe Simpson was picked ahead of him, only for the latter to earn just one senior cap, while Youngs pushed on well into three figures. It has not always been easy, physically or mentally, but at no stage for club or country has Youngs ever let his teammates down.There is still a possibility of one more trophy withLeicester’s recent resurgencehaving enhanced their chances of a playoff spot, particularly if they beat Harlequins at Welford Road on Saturday. “It’s a bittersweet feeling really,” Youngs said. “Obviously I’m sad at the thought it’s coming to an end but I’m excited about the rest of this season [and] what this group can do.“That’s the strange part. I’m using the ‘r’ word [retirement] but it isn’t over, there is still plenty of rugby left this season and that’s what is at the front of my mind. I’m not done, let’s not write the obituary just yet. The time will come to thank everybody who has helped me achieve what I have but that’s for when it comes to an end. For now it’s about finishing this chapter of my life with some more success.”View image in fullscreenBen Youngs photographed for the Guardian in 2010.Photograph: David Sillitoe/The GuardianDespite speculation that he might have been tempted to conclude his career abroad, Youngs said playing for any club other than Leicester would have felt wrong. “It’s all I have known in club rugby, the green, red and white, and all I’ve wanted to know. The idea of playing against this club wasn’t ever an option for me. To be able to finish a one-club player will be one of my greatest achievements.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Musk’s remarks came as the company reported a massive dip in both profits and revenues in the first quarter of 2025 amid backlash against his role in the White House.On an investor call, Musk said the work necessary to get the government’s “financial house in order is mostly done”.“Starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to Doge will drop significantly,” he said.That said, he expects to spend one to two days a week continuing to do what he referred to as “critical work” at Doge “for as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it is useful”.Musk is scheduled to leave Doge on May 30, a strict 130-day cap on his service as a special government employee.Tesla saw a 9% drop in revenue year over year in the first quarter of 2025. The company brought in $19.3bn in revenue, well below Wall Street expectations of $21.45bn. The company reported an earnings per share of 27 cents, also well under investor expectations of 43 cents in earnings per share.Tesla profits also slid 71% to $409m compared with $1.39bn in net income the previous year.The companysuffered a 13% drop in vehicle deliveries, making it the company’s worst quarter since 2022.Teslaclosed the quarter with 336,681 vehicles delivered.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators protest against Elon Musk and Doge cuts outside of a Tesla dealership in Kansas City, Missouri, on 12 April.Photograph: Charlie Riedel/APThough Musk has acknowledged there have been “rocky moments” of late, he remained optimistic about the company’s future.“The future for Tesla is better than ever,” he said. “The value of the company is delivering sustainable abundance with our affordable AI-powered robots. If you say, what’s the ideal future that you can imagine, that’s what you’d want. You’d want abundance for all in a way that’s sustainable, that’s good for the environment. Basically this is a happy future, this is the happiest future you can imagine.”That “happy future” includes the company’s plans for fully self-driving cars, said the billionaire CEO as he laid out an ambitious timeline for when he expects the vehicles to hit US roads in some cities – “by the end of the year”. Tesla hashistorically struggled to meettimelines Musk has publicly set for the launch of new products, especially when it comes to self-driving.“The acid test is, can you go to sleep in your car and wake up in your destination and I’m confident that will be available in many cities in the US by the end of this year,” he said.This would be on top of the Robotaxi service the company plans to roll out in June. “I predict that there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year,” Musk said.Despite missing Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom line, initial analyst reactions are optimistic given many had significantly lowered their expectations after the company reported a massive dip in vehicle deliveries.“Against the backdrop of catastrophic expectations, with everything from sales to margins projected to continue the slump, the less-than-bad numbers have been received as welcome news by Tesla investors,” said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst atInvesting.com.“In a curious turn of events, it’s as if numbers show that even at the worst moment, Elon and the team’s operation can still bring a robust $19.3bn in revenue, with total revenue partly making up for the huge drop in auto revenue.“If this is the worst it gets for Tesla, then certainly there must be some upside for the stock once tailwinds, such as the highly awaited cheaper model and the Robotaxi, finally hit the market later this year,” Monteiro continued.Analysts attribute the company’s overall difficulties to a number of factors, but ultimately concludeMusk’s role in the White House has caused a branding crisis for Tesla. The company is at a major crossroads, analysts say, that will only be remedied if Musk leaves his role in Doge and returns to Tesla as CEO full time.Doge cuts spark questions as employees supporting Musk space launches sparedRead moreIn addition to a drop in sales, a 50% dip in share prices, existing Tesla owners are looking to sell their vehicles in droves, Teslas have been vandalized across the country and in response to ongoing protests of the automaker, the Vancouver International Auto show removed the electronic carmaker from its March lineup. The company also recalled 46,000 Cybertrucks – nearly all that had been sold.Musk said that the drop in demand is due to the macro economic trends – not branding. “Tesla is not immune to the macro demand for cars,” Musk said. “When there is economic uncertainty, people generally want to pause on doing a major capital purchase like a car. Absent macro issues we don’t see any reduction in demand.”Analysts are not convinced.“If Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage…but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO to drive the vision and the long term story will not be altered,” read a Wedbush Securities analyst note. Wedbush remained bullish on the company’s chances of turning its financials around. “IF Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow.”The company declined to provide forward-looking guidance for the next quarter citing “shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains”.“While we are making prudent investments that will set up both our vehicle and energy businesses for growth, the rate of growth this year will depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts, production ramp at our factories and the broader macroeconomic environment,” the earnings report reads. “We will revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”The company did warn, however, that “changing political sentiment” could meaningfully impact short-term demand for Tesla products.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The singer of Ordinary, the longest-running No 1 of the year, talks about his journey to breakout successTue 22 Apr 2025 11.21 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareAt 18, Alex Warren was homeless, sneaking into the gym of a gated community in his home town of Carlsbad, California, to shower for job interviews and filmTikTokvideos of himself singing in the bathroom. Six years later he is one of pop’s next potential superstars. His bombastic ballad Ordinary has been No 1 in the UK charts for five weeks, the longest-running chart leader this year, and entered the US Top 10 last week. As soon as he heard the finished version, he was “freaking out – my wife and I listened to it on repeat for our entire drive home, for 45 minutes.”Ordinary may be Warren’s breakout hit but he’s been famous for a long time. He gained notoriety on social media in his teens by making hugelypopular videoswith titles such as “BROTHER WAKES UP IN MIDDLE OF LAKE PRANK!” In 2019 he co-founded the Hype House, a shared house of content creators (including the D’Amelio sisters and Addison Rae) known for Covid-era internet videos, as well as at least one controversial facemask-free influencer party and, eventually, a $300,000 (£226,000) lawsuit – which Warren wasn’t named in – which alleged property damage and unpaid rent.I hated who I was becomingHe was also one of the stars of Netflix’s subsequentHype Houseshow, in which Warren goes to increasingly deranged lengths to film his prank videos, eventually staging a fake wedding with his now real wife, influencer, Kouvr Annon. He calls Hype House his “college experience: that’s what I did when I was 19. I wouldn’t be here without that time in my life.”Warren is speaking by video from Tennessee – an income-tax-free state, and therefore an increasingly popular influencer haven. One of Warren’s sisters lives nearby, and it felt like a spot where Annon could “feel safe” while he’s on tour. The chic new home he moved into last week – I spy vaulted ceilings and a large yard as he paces back and forth – matches his nice new life, miles removed literally and spiritually from the Hype House, and from his difficult youth.He is one of four children born to a “very successful” real estate father and a stay-at-home mother. He was raised Catholic, which he attributes to his father, who was diagnosed with terminal kidney cancer before Warren was born. “You tend to have a more religious standing” when you’re dying, Warren says, “because you know what’s coming”.Warren grew up listening to worship music – and arguably Christian-rock-adjacent acts such as Coldplay – which he says has been a strong influence on the music career he has pivoted to. He has “always loved a pop ballad”, but admits he’s no music nerd. “Everyone’s always asked me [what music] I know, and I’m like, ‘I have no idea who these people are and I wish I did.’ So I’ve been really trying to put myself out there and like other music. I’ve been listening to a lot of albums – that’s something I wasn’t doing before.” He cites the latest LP from Hozier, whose soulful vocal delivery is similar to Warren’s, and Charli xcx’s Brat. “I liked it a lot. I was like, ‘Wow, I’ve never listened to music like this before,’ from start to finish. It’s been interesting.”As Warren grew up, he began to question his faith. His father died when he was nine, leaving his mother with an immense amount of debt in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash. She descended into alcoholism and was unable to hold down a job. “She was a troubled person who didn’t have it all there in her head, and she suffered a lot her entire life,” he says. “We were on food stamps, and my mum lost everything my dad built for us.”Warren describes his mother as abusive as a result of her alcoholism. When he turned 18, she kicked him out, leaving him homeless and sleeping on the street or in cars – an experience he describes as “sick” in a positive sense. “I’m not gonna say it wasn’t,” he says. “I felt free – I think anyone who’s been in an abusive situation knows once you’re out of it, no matter the circumstance, it is the most freeing feeling in the world, knowing you don’t have to look over your shoulder and worry.”View image in fullscreen‘These songs are helping people’ … Warren.Photograph: Jimmy FontaineDuring this period Warren was introduced to Annon on Snapchat. She moved from her family home in Hawaii to Carlsbad to live with him, initially in his friend’s car. Warren began making money from social media videos, and later found his way back to the church. I ask how he feels about certain pranks that scan as particularly wasteful, or perhaps unchristian – such as the video in which he crushes Annon’s car, before surprising her with a new one.“There are things I did that I definitely cringe at,” he says. “But you also have to remember, I was a kid who was just previously homeless, coming out of an abusive household. I was just doing what I thought was the cool thing at the time. Yes, I’m not happy with who I was and what I did, but I had to do those things to appreciate who I am today.”Warren released his first original song,One More I Love You, in 2021, and started to move away from his comedy videos. “I love the vlogs, but I stopped vlogging because people would make jokes like, ‘Oh, Alex is going to film his wedding, Alex is going to film when he has a baby’, and I was like, ‘Why would I actually do that?’ Then I started thinking, ‘Oh, maybe I might.’ I hated who I was becoming.”But he did film his wedding – I refer to a clip he posted recently of Annon and him reciting their vows. “That’s like, my wedding video. That’s not, like, me vlogging it. Everyone films their wedding,” he says, scowling. And what about the music video you filmed at it? “I wrote that songformy wedding,” he says. Our conversation has become tense, and a publicist informs me our time is nearly up.For all that he has already endured in his life – his mother died in 2021 – there will be sceptics about Warren’s pivot from fame-obsessed prankster to God-fearing pop star. His manager Brian Sokolik works for a company that promises to empower content creators to “diversify their businesses and produce projects across music, merchandise, books, podcasts, television, touring and more”. Adam Yaron and Cal Shapiro, two of the songwriters who co-wrote much of Warren’s debut album You’ll Be Alright, Kid (Chapter One), mainly work with social media stars and TV singing competition contestants looking to move beyond cover versions.But Warren seems to be setting himself apart, at least in the sense that very few content creators have had a song as successful as Ordinary. He hopes his songs about love and grief can help his new fans through their own emotional struggles. “I’ve realised after playing live shows that these songs are helping people,” he says. “I think that’s important.”Explore more on these topicsPop and rockYouTubeTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And not, in my opinion, for the better. To great fanfare, Tuvalu – an entirely cash-based society – hasunveiled its first ever ATM, marking its move towards financial modernisation. But while the 10,000 people living in that country may be celebrating no longer having to queue at the bank, I fear their happiness will be short-lived. It’s the start of the slow erosion of human contact that heralds the dehumanisation of yet another society.Theworld’s first ATMwas introduced in Britain in 1967, butfor me the tyranny of machines that promise convenience but erode human contactreally began about 20 years ago, in the form of self-checkouts in our local Sainsbury’s. Having watched the Terminator movie franchise during my formative years, I railed prophetically against them, aware that it was just a small slippery slope from “unexpected item in the bagging area” to the extinction of the human race. I wrote about my fear of these machines with their Dalek-like commands and even started a short-lived and extremely unpopular Facebook campaign against them. But like a modern-day Cassandra, I was doomed to be ignored.To be clear: I’m no luddite. While I admit I am not an early adopter, I do have the latest iPhone, spend far more time than is wise on social media and can frequently be heard barking orders at an Alexa device. I’m also well aware that technology can make life easier, simpler, quicker and more efficient. The problem is, it has insidiously crept into areas of life where it has no purpose other than to replace human interaction. And that has left society poorer and far more miserable.Today, automated checkouts have not only taken over supermarkets (where often they’re the only option unless you want to buy a scratchcard or cigarettes), they have also appeared in pharmacies and clothes retailers. Customer services departments have been decimated, helplines substituted with AI chatbots, and local bank branches replaced by apps.It’s easy to see why. Machines make model employees. They don’t have rights or belong to unions, and they don’t require sick pay or holidays. A rise in the minimum wage or employer’s national insurance rates are irrelevant to them. If they break, you fix them or simply replace them. Never mind those who most need this type of work – school-leavers, the unskilled, disabled people. And forget elderly shoppers, for whom a chat with a cashier might be the only human contact of the day.Retailers claim customers love dealing with machines. Do we? Asurvey by the Belonging Forumfound nearly half of UK adults (48%) are more likely to return to shops where they’re served by a person rather than a self-checkout.The other day, when I had to contact my bank, it took lots of Googling to find its (well-hidden) customer services number. When I finally got through to someone, I expressed my preference for talking to a person over using an app because I have fat thumbs, and because it’s so much more pleasant and efficient. “I’m old school,” I stated. The young woman responded kindly by offering to send me information on “courses to improve your digital skills”. She might as well have suggested a blue rinse and a freedom pass to boot. For the record, my digital skills are fine, dear. My middle-aged pride, on the other hand, is rather wounded.Age does appear to be a big factor in our attitude towards technology. In 2017, asurvey by LivePersonfound that 69.4% of gen Z and millennial respondents would choose a messaging app over a phone app if they could keep only one. But we also know how much reliance on technology and lack of human contact aredamaging young people’s mental health. And employers frequently complain that young new recruits come to them unable to make a simple phone call or converse with colleagues or customers.Loneliness is now an epidemic. In 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it to bea global health threat, with its mortality effects equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Human contact isn’t just more pleasant, it’s also essential.AI promises to free up time. But what if it spares us from learning, writing, painting and exploring the world? | Joseph EarpRead moreThere are signs that the tide may be turning. A supermarket chain in the Netherlands, Jumbo,introduced slower checkoutsin 2019 for any customers who prefer to chat to a human being. The initiative aims to tackle loneliness, particularly in elderly customers.Hell, it turns out, is not other people. It’s being caught in the ninth circle of an automated telephone answering service, which can’t understand your commands and takes you back to the same menu again and again. But here’s a little tip for you: if you scream “human being” when asked which option you’d like, it usually works. For now, at least.Hilary Freeman is a journalist and authorExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionLonelinessSupermarketsBankingSmartphonesTuvaluSocial exclusioncommentShareReuse this content"

When the most sober of global institutions, the International Monetary Fund, abandons its usual technocratic calm to sound the alarm on the political roots of global financial instability, it’s time to pay attention. The IMF iswarningof a non-negligible risk of a $1tn hit to global output, as Donald Trump’s erratic “America first” agenda – part oligarchic enrichment scheme, part mobster shakedown – collides with a perfect storm ofglobal financial vulnerabilities.Such a shock would be equivalent to a third of that experienced in the 2008 crisis. But it would be felt in a much more fragile and politically charged environment. This time, the crisis stems not just from markets but from the politics at the heart of the dollar system. The IMF’s latestGlobal Financial Stability Reportsees the danger in Mr Trump’stradepolicies, especially his “liberation day” announcements, which have pushed up America’s effective tariff rate to the highest in over 100 years.The IMF put investors on notice that Trumpian volatility was taking place as US debt and equities – especially tech stocks – were overvalued. It cautions that hedge funds have made huge bets that have gone sour, requiring them to sell US treasuries for cash and potentially deepening the chaos in bond markets. Ominously, the IMF draws the comparison, first made by the analystNathan Tankus, with the “dash for cash” in March 2020 during Covid, when the Federal Reserve rescued US treasury markets directly. Developing nations, already grappling with the highest real borrowing costs in a decade, may now be forced to take on even more expensive debt – the IMFwarns– just to cushion the blow from Mr Trump’s new tariffs, risking a dreaded “sudden stop” in capital flows.At the heart of this chaos stands the US, the very country meant to uphold the global financial architecture. Just over a week ago,Adam Tooze of Columbia Universitywondered if markets had begun to “sell America” after US long-maturity bond prices fell precipitously. He thought that markets were no longer just responding to economic fundamentals but to politics as a systemic risk factor. In this case: Mr Trump’s tariff threats and his increasing political pressure on Fed’s chair,Jerome Powell. In essence, Prof Tooze gave us the theory; the IMF just confirmed the data.The US president’s continued attacks on the Fed chair over the weekend have only added to a flight from US equities, bonds and the dollar itself. The money is fleeing to safe havens such asgold. Some of the loss has beenclawedback, but at what cost? Investors aren’t just jittery about inflation or growth – they’re hedging against political chaos. That might explain the seemingly divergent IMF messaging: blunt systemic warnings in its report versus the soothing market-facingcommentsfrom a senior official at the fund’s press conference. This is central bank diplomacy. The institution is signalling that it is worried while trying not to spark a self-fulfilling panic in treasuries and the dollar.The real concern here is not technical dysfunction intreasury marketsor the mechanics of the Fed, which are the bedrock of the global financial system. It’s about the politicisation of the monetary-fiscal nexus under a Trumpian regime that is fundamentally hostile to the norms of liberal-democratic governance. When even the dollar is no longer a safe haven, what – or who – can be?Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But getting rid of him would only invite more chaosTue 22 Apr 2025 12.16 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareUS stock markets, Treasury bonds and the dollar itself are sliding amid the tariff turmoil and Donald Trump needs a soft target. It was probably only a matter of time before heintensified his attacks on Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve. It is an easy narrative to blame the dull central banker with orthodox worries about anchoring inflation expectations. Nor is Powell able to engage in tit-for-tat soundbites. Unlike Trump, he must measure the impact on markets of his every word.The open question is how far Trump intends to push things. Monday’s reaction in financial markets was strong because it seemed for the first time that the presidentcould be serious about removal. “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” declared Trump, which was several notches beyond his usual whine about urging the Fed to hurry up with cuts in interest rates.Yet the first effect of firing Powell should be obvious. Financial markets would tank, possibly to the extent of making the current upset over tariffs look like a mild tantrum. You do not mess with central bank independence lightly – especially not in today’s circumstances. If loose monetary policy were thrown into an already unstable inflationary and tariff mix, the dollar would fall further, the flight from US assets would accelerate and long-term borrowing costs for the US would increase.Under a tame Fed chair Trump might get his desired immediate cut to interest rates, but only at the cost of wrecking confidence in US monetary policymaking further. Credibility would be gone. The real cost of long-term borrowing for businesses and consumers would rise.Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at the thinktank CapitalEconomics, takes a slightly more optimistic view that ditching Powell “might not end up being a full-blown disaster for the markets” if a“relatively-qualified replacement” could be swapped in immediately – candidate A being Kevin Warsh, who was on the Fed board of governors from 2006 to 2011. But Ashworth also makes the critical point that the saga would not end there.Warsh, or anybody else, would have only one vote on the policymaking committee, so could not guarantee to deliver what Trump wants. Indeed, the chair of the Fed board has to be confirmed as chair of the policymaking committee, so the other members might not play ball if they take their independence seriously.“At this point, Trump would be forced to go all-out and fire the rest of the Fed board too,” suggests Ashworth. “Sometimes it is not enough just to cross the Rubicon, you have to march on Rome too.” Cue mayhem in markets as Trump, presumably, would try to pack the Fed with a full line-up of poodles. “The Senate might still be willing to vote down overtly political picks, in an attempt to maintain some of the Fed’s credibility, triggering more chaos,” adds Ashworth.None of which means Trump won’t attempt such a manoeuvre, of course. But you’d think even he would conclude that throwing insults at Powell, whose term ends in May next year anyway, is simpler business than acting on them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Being a half Palestinian, wholly homosexual freelance writer based in the US isn’t currently looking like the most stable situation. Either my livelihood is going to get obliterated by AI, or I’m getting shipped to a detention centre for thoughtcrimes and gender treachery. It’s anyone’s guess which comes first.Having mulled over the various directions my future could take (dog-cloning saleswoman, astronaut,head of sanitationfor the city of Philadelphia), I have finally decided what I want to be when I grow up. And I’m going to exclusively reveal the result in this column. I’m … going into politics!Once upon a time, the fact that I have zero experience in politics may have been an impediment. In a country run by a reality TV star turned convicted felon, however, the criteria for what qualifies one for office have drastically changed. The fact that I am a permanent resident rather than a US citizen would also normally pose a problem, but the beauty of Trumpworld is that all the silly old laws from the past are getting ripped up. Anything – even Republican congresswoman Arwa – is possible if you abandon your principles and play your cards right.And I intend to play my cards perfectly. I have done extensive research and devised a cunning plan for how to make it in modern American politics. Study it carefully and you too can be as successful as I am obviously going to be.1. Become a billionaire and buy yourself a roleAmbassadorships have, in effect, always beenpay-to-playin the US but, thanks to theself-proclaimed“GREATEST FRIEND THAT AMERICAN CAPITALISM HAS EVER HAD!”, the entire government is now for sale. You can seemingly buy yourself everything from anice little foreign policyto acabinet position. Never has democracy been so democratised: anyone with enough cash can participate. The only snag to this strategy is that I do not, in fact, have enough cash. Like many a feckless millennial I squandered all my “political influence” money on avocado toast.2. Become a billionaire’s special little boyIf you can’t become a billionaire yourself, find one you can sell your soul to: it’s what I call the JD Vance manoeuvre. The vice-president would still be writing about hillbillies were it not for tech billionairePeter Thiel’s mentorshipand piles of money.3. Achieve notoriety through whatever means possibleShould you be unable to locate a billionaire who wants to useyou as an avatarto advance theirdystopian accelerationist agenda, you will have to master the dark arts of the trollitician. John Fetterman (nominally a Democrat) and far-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene both seem to have advanced their careers by modelling themselves on internet trolls. Fetterman wanders around in basketball shorts,chumming it upwith accused war criminals, and praising Trump for his “God-tier level trolling”; Greenespreads conspiracy theoriesabout governments controlling the weather. Meanwhile, a Republican candidate for governor of California, clearly hoping to achieve name recognition through virality, has proposed that migrant women can stay in the country if they “marry one of our Californian incels”.4. Harness the potential of “A1” technologyDuring a recent panel discussion, former wrestling mogul turned education secretary Linda McMahon – who may or may not be in that position because she donated handsomely to Trump’s campaign – repeatedlyreferred to AI as A1. “Now let’s see A1 and how can that be helpful,” McMahon mused at one point. Food for thought.5. Share your top-secret plans inmultiplegroup chatsThe Trump administration, we keep being told, is themost transparent in history. If you want to get ahead, you’ll have to embrace that ethos. For more information, go find Pete “nobody’s texting war plans” Hegseth on Signal – he’ll fill you in on all the deets.Along with his brother, lawyer, wife, and some random dude he once met in a bar.6. Finally, sit back and watch your net worth riseGetting your foot in the door is the hard part. Once you’re in, the job’s a breeze: cancel allyour public eventsand ignore your constituents, stat. Like Marjorie Taylor Greene, focus onmaking extremely well-timed tradesin the stock market. If you bump into a pesky constituent, post a video of yourself ranting at them in the skincare aisle, asSouth Carolina congresswoman Nancy Mace just did. Most importantly, remember JFK’s famous quote: “Ask not what you can do for your country, but what your country can do for you.” That’s how it goes, right?Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsRepublicansDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

No surprise he’s targeting NPR and PBSMargaret SullivanTrump’s anti-media diatribes are part of the authoritarian playbook. Congress must reject his planned cutsTue 22 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 14.35 EDTShareIt was entirely predictable thatDonald Trumpwould go after public media in America. Harming the reality-based press – in every form, whether public or private – is a central part of his playbook for controlling the political narrative as he moves the country toward an authoritarian model of government.For Trump, the message is all, and anything that gets in the way should be portrayed as an evil to society and stamped out.Like every would-be autocrat, Trump has an anti-media playbook. His includes disparaging journalists, calling them the enemy of the people, suing news organizations and tightly controlling access to newsmakers.All of that is well under way in the first three months of Trump 2.0, as is the effort to dismantle the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, which are funded by the federal government.Now, cue up the attack on National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System.“Radical left ‘monsters’,” as Trump characterized them in a social media post a few weeks ago.Then another shoe dropped. Last week,NPR itself reportedthat the Trump administration was drafting a memo to call for eliminating federal funds for public media.It reportedly involved a “rescission” – the blocking of more than $1bn that’s already been approved by Congress for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which administers the federal funding for public broadcasting. The memo, in theory, would give Congress 45 days to approve the cut or keep the funding.Though the funds have already won approval, Trump is fond of acting as though his every whim will become law. Hisrecord-setting barrage of executive ordersincludes many that are being challenged in federal lawsuits.This entire subject, of course, is political theater at its finest. Witness, for example, the president’s ever-loyal ally in Congress, the far-right Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has helped to lead the charge against public media.“You can hate us all on your own dime,” Greene insisted at a congressional hearing in late March. The facts belie the theatrics to a large extent. NPR receives only about 1% of its funding directly from the federal government; however, the many small “member stations” in communities throughout the country are much more dependent on federal money. The loss would be devastating for them – and for the public, which often has no other form of news in communities that, increasingly, are becoming “news deserts”.Congress should send Trump’s plan packing and continue to provide funding – not because NPR and its member stations are perfect, not because PBS always gets it right in its overall excellent NewsHour program that airs each evening, but because, on balance, they are a critical part of the fact-based news ecosystem necessary to democratic self-governance.That’s especially true at a time when media companies increasingly are owned by large corporations or by individual billionaires, all with their own financial agendas. Disney owns ABC News. Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post. Warner Bros owns CNN. Most local newspapers now are owned by big chains or by private equity companies. (The Guardian, thankfully, is different; it is owned by the Scott Trust, which operates like a non-profit, not a corporation.)Public funding – at least in theory – should provide some distance from corporate ownership by the rich and powerful.Should taxpayers really be paying for news? I think it’s reasonable – legitimate news is, after all, a key element of our democracy. And throughout western Europe, according to aPew Research study, public media is not only more dominant but much more trusted than private news organizations.NPR and its member stations do a lot that’s right. They correct their errors – a litmus test for legitimate news organizations. They also continue to have an ombudsman or public editor to serve as the readers’ representative and to consider complaints.When I interviewed NPR’s chief executive, Katherine Maher, on stage at TribFest last year in Austin, I asked if she would commit to keeping a public editor – unlike many news organizations, including the Times and the Washington Post, which have eliminated the role. She publicly pledged to do so for as long as she is in charge.NPR also boasts many excellent journalists, who are dedicated to the facts and to getting stories right. In my own area of specialization – journalism and the news industry – there’s no American media reporter I respect more than David Folkenflik, whose work is characterized by energetic, unbiased reporting and frequent scoops.I was not convinced by the over-the-top complaints of the former NPR business editor Uri Berliner, who railed last year against his longtime employer’s leftward drift. Neither was Erik Wemple of the Washington Post, who took a deep look at NPR’s reporting on Trump’s relationship with Russia, following Berliner’s broadside.Wemple’sapt conclusion: NPR is no hive of lefty ideologues, as Berliner would have it, but rather is a singular news organization, one “driven by old-fashioned journo-principles, an aversion to offending anyone, and a steady propensity to annoy listeners”.Imperfect, certainly. But just as certainly, important to the overall news ecosystem – and worthy of having Congress stand behind it, regardless of Trump’s bullying, now and in the future.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionNewspapersRadio industryNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

But the climate crisis is the real inflation riskMark Blythand Nicolò FraccaroliAs temperatures rise and countries back off their decarbonization efforts, we must confront a reality central banks can’t correctTue 22 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 12.29 EDTShareInflation is, at base, a tax on consumption – and it hits the poor the hardest, since they consume more of their incomes and the rich consume less.That’s one reason for concern over Donald Trump’s tariffs, which will disproportionately affect the poor. When the 90-day pause on the tariffs expires, it is reasonable to expect prices to rise, and by a lot.That’s because, first, intermediate goods – rather than finished ones – dominate trade, crossing borders and being tariffed multiple times along the way, which makes them highly inflationary. Second, while the tariffs of the first Trump administration could be more easily absorbed by exchange rates and producers, there is no way tariffs of this magnitude can be absorbed. Producers and consumers must take a hit, and that means rising prices. It looks like the poor, once again, will suffer the most.But if Trump’s tariffs were to disappear for good, would we return to a world of stable prices? Insights from our forthcoming book,Inflation: A Guide for Users and Losers, suggest that is sadly not the case, for three reasons.The first is how we think about inflation and how we respond to it. We identified four distinct ways that the public and central banks have talked about the causes and effects of inflation in the past few years. The first story is the textbook idea that “the government spends too much money”. The second focuses on wages pushing up prices – a labor market story. These two stories both see inflation as coming from demand outpacing supply. Consumers demand too much because governments put too much money in their pockets, and workers ask for higher wages despite no significant improvements in productivity. If production can’t keep up with the surge in demand, then the inevitable consequence will be rising prices.The two other stories we identified see inflation the other way around. It’s the supply side of the economy that generated inflation. There’s the “supply shocks” story, where unexpected events such as Covid or the Ukraine war push up prices and they stay up until the economy adjusts. And finally, there is the story of corporations in concentrated markets using inflation as cover to raise prices.There is evidence for (and against) all four causal stories. But what policymakers tended to focus on were the first two. As a result, central banks raised interest rates, which can be effective in reducing inflation when it is demand-driven but cannot do much if inflation comes from an exogenous shock, such as Covid or a war.What is interesting about the 2020s inflation was that the latter two stories – supply shocks and opportunistic corporations – turned out to be just as, if not more, important than the first two.But is that all there is to future inflation? No, and that brings us to reason number two.The Trump administration has recently declared a war on climate change research inside the federal government and in the wider US research community, as well as a doubling down on carbon-based business models. But wishing the problem away won’t make it disappear. The real drivers of future inflation are not just tariffs, but the climate crisis and states backing off their decarbonization efforts.The climate crisis is already affecting prices. The first driver for this is insurance markets. A combination of massively rising damage costs from droughts, wildfires and floods has seen insurance costs soar in many countries. Some insurers have moved to cut coverage in US states such asCaliforniaandFlorida, with the result that the state there is on the hook for damages it can never cover. Recognizing this, reinsurers – the companies that protect insurance firms – are pulling their coverage from insurance writers, creating a long-term rise in prices. The effects spread well beyond insurance markets. In the US you cannot get a mortgage or build without insurance. Housing is already in critically short supply. Prices can only go up.The climate crisis is also having long-term effects on what we eat. The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and the European Central Bank have produced the firstsystematic assessmentsof how much climate change will impact inflation through impacts on food supplies. Assuming temperature increases projected through 2035, which are probably understated, food inflation will increase by 0.92 to 3.23% per year, while headline inflation will rise between 0.32 and 1.18% per year. US wildfires and Europe’s recent and persistent droughts and crop failures are really just the thin end of this inflationary wedge.Finally, there is the question of how everyone else responds to the US breaking the current global order. The UK’s nationalization of a primary steel company, the move to expand Heathrow airport, and more spending on defense all suggest that our attempts to decarbonize our economies are being put on hold in the name of adjusting to these new realities. The US has effectively given up trying to do anything about it and has decided instead to “drill, baby, drill”.The EU’sGreen Dealwas already in trouble electorally, and Trump’s decisions have moved the drive for rearmament to the top of the priorities queue. Meanwhile, China’s decarbonization model depends upon everyone else buying its green tech, which itself is built with enormous coal input. Any long-term financial bonus we might get through the lower costs of more installed renewables and lesser climate damage will be much less than anticipated, even a few years ago, as we backpedal on decarbonization.In short, viewing tariffs as a source of inflation is probably a good idea. But in doing so we should not miss the underlying forces that no amount of central bank tinkering can accommodate – and that we refuse to fully confront.Mark Blyth is a political economist and professor at Brown University.

Optimists point to the larger-than-expected numbers (larger than expected by many police departments for sure); theyenthusiastically recalla famous social scientificfindingaccording to which a non-violent mobilization of 3.5% of a population can bring down a regime. Pessimists, by contrast, see protests as largely performative. Both views are simplistic: it is true that protests almost never lead to immediate policy changes – yet they are crucial for building morale and long-term movement power.Earlier this year, observers hadrushed to declareresistance “cringe” and a form of pointless “hyperpolitics”, a “vibe shift” (most felt by rightwing pundits, coincidentally) supposedly gaveDonald Trumpa clear mandate, even if he had won the election only narrowly. Meanwhile,Democratswere flailing in the face of a rapid succession of outrageous executive orders – many of which were effectively memos to underlings, rather than laws. But taken at face value, they reinforced an impression of irresistible Trumpist power.Trump is creating a selfish, miserable world. Here’s what we can do | Michael PlantRead moreAs we now know from theCrowd Counting Consortium– a joint project by Harvard University and the University of Connecticut – this sense of defeatism was always more felt at elite level rather than on the ground: already in the first weeks of Trump 2.0, there werefar more proteststhan during the same period in the first administration. What seemed to be missing was a massive event serving as a focal point: now the more than 1,000 gatherings, with 100,000 showing up in DC alone, have provided one.The enthusiasm about large and astonishingly diverse crowds has also revived a tendency, though, to focus on what has become an almost totemic number, a kind of social science Hallmark card for protesters: according toErica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan, civil, non-violent resistance that mobilizes 3.5% of a population has overwhelming chances of success (whereas violent action is actually more likely to fail or be outright counterproductive).Three and a half per cent would mean 11 million people on the streets – even the Women’s March, generally seen as highly successful, mobilized “only” four or so million people. The first Earth Day event in 1970 – generally seen as the largest single-day demonstration in US history – brought out “only” 20 million.As Chenoweth hascautioned, the 3.5% number was not some hard social scientific law, let alone a prescription. Many movements have been successful with fewer participants. Plus, what might best be described as a “historical tendency” was measured at a time when no one was conscious of it. Things might be different if one specifically tries to mobilize in light of a 3.5% goal; conversely, power-holders might now be determined to prevent resisters reaching a particular threshold at all costs.In any case, protests and resistance are not the same: the former, by definition, accepts existing authorities and asks for change; the latter does not necessarily recognize the legitimacy of the powers that be – and it was the latter that Chenoweth and Stephan were looking at. Protest rarely leads to immediate policy change; in fact,according to the writer and activist LA Kauffman, perhaps the only clear example of a direct result is a protest that in fact did not happen. In 1941, the civil rights leader A Philip Randolph threatened Franklin D Roosevelt with a protest against racial discrimination in the defense industry and the military; before a march on Washington took place, Roosevelt conceded and issued anexecutive orderbanning discrimination in the defense industry.Yet immediate policy change is not the only metric of success. Especially in light of the defeatist elite stance earlier this year, people coming out and seeing each other can be a major morale booster. What is so often dismissed as performative – music, drums, people parading with handmade signs to have their photos taken by others – is not a matter of collective narcissism; rather, it has been recognized by many modern thinkers, starting withRousseau, as an important part of building community. Politically inspired and inspiring festivals are not some frivolous sideshow; they allow citizens to experience each others’ presence, their emotional dispositions (many are seething withanger!), and their commitment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Many of the protests that took place during the past decade wereultimately unsuccessfulbecause rapid mobilizationvia social mediahad not been preceded by patient organizing and the creation of effective structures for continuous engagement. By contrast, what remains the most famous protest in US history – the 1963 March on Washington – was a capstone march after years of difficult, often outright dangerous organizing. The march was flawlessly executed and produced celebrated images; it is less well-known that it was coordinated with the Kennedy administration and very tightly controlled by civil rights leaders (only approved signs were allowed; there wasan official recommendationfor what lunch to bring: peanut butter and jelly sandwiches).At the end of the march, participants repeated a text read out by none other than A Philip Randolph: they promised they would not “relax until victory is won”. It matters whether those who expressed anger earlier this month can stay engaged, building on the easy connections during spontaneous encounters at a protest. Even by itself, though, what civil rights leaders called the “the meaning of our numbers” will be not go unnoticed by politicians and, less obviously, courts hardly insensitive to public opinion.Jan-Werner Müller is a Guardian US columnist and a professor of politics at Princeton UniversityExplore more on these topicsProtestOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsDemocratscommentShareReuse this content"

Yes, it is peculiar, you might even call it chilling, that you can now be ejected from America for not having sorted your accommodation before you arrived. The experience itself – handcuffs, strip-searches, body scans, prison uniforms, a night in a cell – sounds pretty harrowing. But at least they were only detained for one night. They could have been held for 12 days, like theCanadian actress Jasmine Mooney; or 16 days, likeLucas Sielaff, also German, who was driving from Mexico with his American fiancee, and says he still has nightmares about it.Marco Rubio has reassured the world that: “If you’re not coming to the United States to join a Hamas protest, or to come here and tell us about how right Hamas is, or … stir up conflict on our campuses and create riots in our streets and vandalise our universities, then you have nothing to worry about.” And in a funny sort of way, that is quite reassuring; because it makes travel to America a non-decision. Previously, you might have been on the horns of a dilemma. How authoritarian must a country become before it’s morally unacceptable to go there for leisure purposes? Is it bad enough that people are being lifted off the streets and deported to El Salvador with no due process? Or can you turn a blind eye and still go to Disneyland? Rubio’s statement makes it plain that the border authorities will have a problem with anyone who doesn’t like their politics, and even if you had no plans to vandalise anything, that pretty much makes the decision for you.As hard as I try to focus on what this means for the new world order, there’s a self-soothing voice going, “This is not the end of the world – because you know where else is really nice? Canada.” I mean, obviously don’t fly there if you’re not nearish already, but it’s got all the same vastness and majesty, plus you’ll be able to afford eggs.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationOpinionMarco RubioGermanyMexicoDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

So it goes forPope Francis, now lauded by leaders and media outlets that were complicit in the very evils he condemned. “Pope Francis was a pope for the poor, the downtrodden and the forgotten,” said Keir Starmer, a prime minister who stripped the winter fuel payment from many vulnerable pensioners before launching an assault on disability benefits predicted to driveup to 400,000 Britonsinto poverty. “He promoted … an end to … suffering across the globe,”wrote Joe Biden, enabler of Israel’s genocidal assault on Gaza.Indeed, the fate of Gaza seemed to preoccupy the pope’s final years. In hislast Easter address, he condemned the “death and destruction” and resulting “dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation” – a powerful sermon that hardly any western media outlets covered. Indeed, you will struggle to find much prominent coverage of any of his courageous statements on Gaza, such as: “This is not war. This is terrorism.” In hisfinal published piece,the pope reiterated his support for a Palestinian state, declaring: “Peace-making requires courage, much more so than warfare.”Starmer noted Pope Francis’s work with “Christians around the world facing war, famine, persecution and poverty”. He made no reference, however, to how the pope rang Gaza’s only Catholic church every day to offer solidarity and prayers – or how he rightly feared for a Christian community that faces erasure after having lived in Gaza for more than 1,600 years.Islamophobia has served a pivotal role in Palestinian life being stripped of any worth or meaning. But that dehumanisation also transcends religion, because there was little western outrage over the Israeli attack on Gaza’sSaint Porphyrius church, or the recent strike on the Anglicanal-Ahli Arab Baptist hospital, or the slaughter of many Christians, among them the elderlymother and her daughterwho were shot dead by an Israeli sniper in the Holy Family church on the eve of Christmas 2023. That was the church the pope rang each day;its school was attackedby the Israeli military last July.Britain was no idle bystander.The “death and destruction” deplored by the pope includes the bombs that rained down on Gaza from F-35 jets – and Britain supplies theircrucial components. In his final book, thepope noted: “According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide.” Yet the UK government refuses to describe a single Israeli obscenity as a “war crime” – recall when foreign secretary David Lammy wasreprimanded by No 10for simply stating that Israel had broken international law.The passing of public figures is invariably politicised in one of two ways. In cases like that of Margaret Thatcher, the death entrenches political divisions, and critics are treated as indecent and disrespectful if they draw attention to dire legacies. If the dead were respected figures who dissented from the status quo during their lifetimes, then they face instead having their views posthumously sanitised. That was the fate of Nelson Mandela, who famously declared: “We know too well thatour freedom is incompletewithout the freedom of the Palestinians.” Again, those who point to the authentic beliefs of the deceased risk being denounced as seeking to cause division at a time of grief.In a perverse way, there is something almost refreshing about the honesty of far-right US politician Marjorie Taylor Greene,who tweeted, in seeming reference to the pope: “Today there were major shifts in global leaderships. Evil is being defeated by the hand of God.” An astonishingly offensive thing to say. But how much more disrespectful is it than skirting around the substance of the pope’s beliefs and courageous stands, instead offering generalised platitudes?Political and religious leaders around the world pay tribute to Pope FrancisRead moreIndeed, this was why the pope’s role was so important. The west is in the grip of the most extreme assault on free speech since McCarthyism in the 1950s, with those who speak out against Israel’s genocide being deplatformed, threatened, sacked, expelled from universities, assaulted by police officers, arrested, imprisoned and now evenfacing deportationfrom countries including Germanyand the US. In this environment, Pope Francis was a remarkable exception to the rule – and you cannot cancel the pope. Instead, political and media elites have sought to airbrush his record in death as in life – another plank of a strategy of eradicating scrutiny and accountability for this crime of historic proportions.This was an unusual pope who denouncedunbridled capitalismand a “new colonialism”. Yet he was riddled with contradictions, offeringmore acceptancefor LGBTQ+ people than his predecessors while denouncing what he called “gender ideology” as the “ugliest danger” of our time. Popes, after all, are not democratically accountable: those of us who are non-believers hold that their selection is arbitrary rather than God’s will. Like any powerful figure without a democratic mandate, whether a pope is sympathetic to justice or otherwise is a matter of chance. And a benevolent pope does not negate the need for critiques of the Catholic church for, to take two examples, its treatment of child abuse and its opposition to contraception during the HIV/Aids pandemic in Africa.But what matters is this. If you believe a monumental crime is happening in front of our eyes, then you should expect anyone with power and influence to take a stand. Let history record that this pope took a stand against one of the great horrors of our time.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

At not living up to my own expectations. The faces of my patients would keep me up. Who would check their sodium level? Who would convey their scan results? Who would explain the cancelled surgery? If 500 oncology appointments were being deferred, how would I face my patients again? Amid their own challenges, was it even ethical to expect them to understand mine?I spent months in hospital, relying on the public health system. I have seen how badly we are failing our healthcare workers | Juliette McAleerRead moreThis is the unwritten code of healthcare. Other professionals strike, doctors don’t. Until now.It is no secret that public hospital conditions are overstretched. What is clear is that the willingness of public hospital doctors to keep the system functioning at a high personal cost has finally reached its limit – here, in theUK,South Korea,New Zealandand elsewhere.Private practice is far more lucrative (albeit with its own considerable headaches).To avoid being“the absolute worst” paidpublic hospital doctors in the country, the striking doctors want a 30% pay rise, which the NSW government finds untenable. After offering a 10.5% rise over three years, it has also failed to explain its$11bn price tagto repair the healthcare system, most of which is related to infrastructure improvement and not doctors’ pay.Still, the government may have found some sympathy for its stance until it condemned the doctors for jeopardising lives, which predictably opened a Pandora’s box ofrevelations about the realitiesof being a public hospital doctor.One doctor recounted seeking advice from an exhausted specialist, who then called back five minutes later because they couldn’t recall whether they’d spoken. Another operated all night and was expected to turn up to the “regular” day shift two hours later or risk the ignominy of cancelling a list. Another received a phone call on average every seven minutes over a 24-hour period. And in a truly upsetting case, one doctor describes being told to return to the floor immediately after witnessing a confronting death.Would you want to be treated by any of these hungry, thirsty, distressed, sleep-deprived doctors? Not if you could help it. For their sake, and ours, we would want these doctors to be well rested and better treated but the government has so far even rejected their call to be guaranteed a minimum 10-hour break between gruelling shifts.1:03'Our health system is broken': hospital doctors on three-day strike in NSW – videoThe strike is about payandconditions but the government is conceding neither.If you find the latter part inexplicable, it isn’t. If public doctors were afforded only better working conditions (sick leave without guilt, mandatory breaks between shifts, scrupulously paid overtime, no surreptitious administrative work), hospitals would struggle – and those in charge know it.It takes up to eight years of university to qualify as a doctor, depending on whether the medical degree is an undergraduate or postgraduate undertaking. A final year student works on the wards as an unpaid intern. When that student becomes an actual intern, the pay in NSW is AUD $38.44 an hour, abase salary of about $76,000.In the same state, it takes a brisk eight months post high school to become a police constable. The first half of training can be completed online. In the second half, students are paid $1360 a week plus allowances. The starting constable salary in NSW isabout $81,000(set to increase to more than $97,000 by 2027).Five years later, the constable is well into his career, while the doctor is still forging a career path,paying many thousands of dollars in exam feeson the decade-long quest to become a specialist. Along the way, obtaining a four-year full-time PhD, a degree many public hospital appointments require, involves getting by on an abject annual stipend ofabout $33,000.Police and doctors both serve the public valuably and there is a shortage of each. The point is not to compare their relative value to society but to illustrate the power of different unions, earning one group a “historic” pay rise and another a threat to be reported to the medical board for professional misconduct.More bulk billing will ease the cost of living. But what Australia’s health system really needs is genuine reform | Stephen DuckettRead moreWhen Australian doctors last took strike action more than 25 years ago, medicine was considered a noble profession. One thing you could always count on is that the doctor would stay back to serve the patient, no matter what. But today, withan estimated 10 administrators for every doctor in the US, the altruism of doctors has been wrung out.Yet, there has never been a greater need for a strong public hospital system that attracts the best talent whose mission is to care for all the people all the time.By condemning public hospital doctors for wanting better pay and conditions to help their patients, the costliest move might turn out to be an own goal.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

These weapons might at least keep staff and inmates safeAlex South is a former prison officerTue 22 Apr 2025 08.21 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareIt was a hot day in Texas when I visited in 2018. Hotter still inside the walls of the Eastham Unit, the men’s prison near Huntsville where I spent a few hours. My hands were sweaty enough as it was, as I focused my attention on the target board in front of me and practised firing rounds from a small silver pistol.The men and women with me were wardens at the Eastham Unit. “I wouldn’t do this job without a gun for no amount of money,” said one. These were experienced correctional officers who knew the Texas prison system well. And they were baffled that, as an English prison officer, I didn’t carry a gun. But I felt differently. There were plenty of things that I would have changed about our prison system, but introducing weapons wasn’t one of them.Afteran attack on three guardsat HMP Frankland, which left two of them seriously injured, the Prison Officers Association (POA)is demandingthat prison staff be equipped with electric stun guns. Instinctively, I object to this. To me, the suggestion seems at odds with what the UK is supposed to want from our prisons: the rehabilitation of the men and women inside. We want them to be released as better citizens, neighbours, colleagues. It’s hard to imagine how the use of stun guns would help to achieve that.I have spent a considerable chunk of my life in prisons; in high-security establishments,young offender institutionsand Victorian-era jails in the UK, and in mother and baby units in Melbourne and death row in Texas. My time as a prison officer taught me how to read a room, and how to use words, humour and compassion to navigate my way out of challenging situations. The idea of giving weapons to prison staff feels like a backwards step – and a scary one. The risk is obvious – if officers are given weapons, could prisoners get hold of them too? When I was an officer working in a category A men’s establishment, a particularly violent individual overwhelmed a team of four officers who had entered his cell with the intention of relocating him. Staff retreated from the cell, leaving behind the six-foot riot shield the prisoner had taken. Not an easy job for the next team sent in.Over the decade I spent in the job, I was involved in some serious violent incidents. I have seen weapons fashioned from toothbrushes, ironing boards and sharpened chicken bones. Apples adorned with razor blades and thrown at staff. But I haven’t been in the position of those three officers at Frankland. A man with a 55-year tariff and nothing to lose hasn’t come at me with cooking oil and an assortment of weapons. The prison landscape has changed now. Such incidents are not anomalies. Prison officersare assaulted almost hourly. The safety of both prisoners and officers must come first.That’s why, although I hate the idea in principle, I can see the sense in the POA’s proposals that designated response teams – not all officers – should carry stun guns. It’s a risk that has been taken on and managed by police forces, in which certain specially trained officers can use weapons. And it’s a risk that has become necessary in our seriously depleted prison system. The same week that staff at Frankland were assaulted, a prisoner at HMP Whitemoor wasarrested on suspicion of the murderof another inmate. We can’t rehabilitate prisoners who don’t feel safe to come out of their cells. Further, many prisoners face makeshift weapons, dilapidated buildings, a lack of staff, rats, sentences with no release dates andwaits of up to a yearto get mental health treatment. Our prisons are full of angry prisoners and exhausted, fed-up staff.Most officers already walk a difficult line. They must balance compassion with discipline, rules with grey areas and empathy with the word “no”. There is real skill involved – a strong relationship can be the thing that stops an argument from turning into violence or a bad day from becoming a person’s final day. The dynamic between officers and inmates is delicate, but powerful too. Adding a stun gun to an officer’s belt complicates that even further. And so, I don’t want stun guns to be allowed into prisons. But I also do not want to read that another of my former colleagues has been stabbed five times in the abdomen or had their face slashed. Physical injuries are one thing, but the psychological damage is impossible to measure.I say all this as someone who is out of the job now. As someone who had 10 years’ experience and all the lessons, interactions and insight that come with that length of time. Experienced staff count for a lot. As do positive relationships, a safe and hygienic environment, time out of cells and a decent, stimulating regime. The lack of those has made our prisons dangerous. Prison officers have already been stripped of their most effective tools. Maybe a stun gun is the next best thing.Alex South is a former prison officer and the author of the memoirBehind These DoorsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here’s why the evidence is inconclusiveNathalie Cabrol is director of the Carl Sagan Center at the Seti InstituteTue 22 Apr 2025 06.39 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 11.52 EDTShareAstrobiology has entered an exciting new phase in recent decades. Since the 1990s, but accelerating in recent years, researchers have begun confirming the existence of exoplanets – that is, planets outside our own solar system – and studying their properties. We now know that planets are common, and a sizeable fraction orbit in the habitable zone of their parent star – suggesting they could have the conditions to sustain biological life.Studies have also revealed entirely new classes of worlds we had no idea could exist. Hycean planets are unknown in our solar system, and are possibly some of the strangest planets discovered to date. They may be ocean-covered worlds with hydrogen-rich atmospheres and, as such, are promising candidates for the detection of biosignature gases – chemical products we associate with living things. But this is not the only possibility. Their discovery has expanded our concept of habitability and challenged our notions of what kinds of environments can sustain life – both as we know it and as we might not.Against this backdrop, the recentJames Webb space telescope observationsof K2-18b, a planet orbiting a red dwarf star 124 light years from Earth, stand out. The latest study, published last week in Astrophysical Journal Letters by a team led by Nikku Madhusudhan, reports a tentative detection of dimethyl sulphide (DMS) or dimethyl disulphide (DMDS), which are gases that we know to be produced by living organisms. While the media tends to focus on the exciting possibility of thepresence of life on a distant planet, it seems unlikely that this will be the lasting contribution of this study. As the authors acknowledge, the signal that was detected suggesting the presence of the gases is modest, and other studies may contradict some of its claims.But first, let’s understand why these results could be exciting. Astrobiologists consider DMS and DMDS plausible biosignature candidates, or signs of life, especially on planets with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. On Earth, marine micro-organisms are the primary producers of DMS. Researchers often cite its presence in theoretical models of sulphur-based biospheres: places where life might thrive in a high-sulphur environment. But there are also known abiotic pathways (not involving life) that could produce the gases. One is the photolysis or electric discharge in hydrogen-sulphide and methane-rich environments, where light or electrical energy could drive the formation of these gases. These pathwayshave been confirmed by experiments, although they do not produce much DMS or DMDS, and the resulting molecules tend to have a short atmospheric lifetime.The study argues that the inferred abundance of these gases on K2-18b would be difficult to sustain abiotically without strong sources or specific atmospheric conditions. According to the study, the lack of detection of the compound hydrogen sulphide (H2S) makes it harder to explain the presence of sulphur-based gases like DMS by nonbiological processes, since H2S is often a necessary ingredient in the abiotic chemical pathways. On the other hand, scientists can’t fully rule out non-living sources, since they have in the past detected DMS on a lifeless comet.The reported detection of DMS or DMDS, while intriguing, is certainly not definitive. The data cannot distinguish between the two molecules due to their similar infrared features: to the detection instruments, both signals look very similar. The detection level remains within the realm where researchers cannot rule out false positives or error introduced by the experimental equipment. There is another significant caveat: additional information essential to accurately interpreting the data is missing, in particular the planet’s environmental characteristics. Other studies still question whether K2-18b even has a surface, water, or is completely barren.Are we alone? New discovery raises hopes of finding alien lifeRead moreSuch contextual information is always critical to proper data analysis. Life co-evolves with its environment, and so if we don’t know much about the environment on a planet, it’s hard to say whether a potential signal of life makes sense. This is difficult in the solar system and even more difficult for exoplanets, because we can only access them through distant observation. For this reason, chemical signals in the form of atmospheric pollutants might actually be the most solid candidates for the presence of life in an exoplanet. Some pollutants are a byproduct of industrial processes or specific technological activities that are not expected to occur naturally in significant quantities on a planet. But DMS and DMDS do not fall into that category; and with them, we are left with the vexing ambiguity that accompanies most of our potential biosignatures.Nevertheless, this study achieves something important beyond its speculations about life. It proposes a methodology that pushes the limits of what can be done with our current technology (some will say too far) in studying exoplanets. It also helps us determine what steps we must take next to refute or validate its findings. For instance, arguments that abundance of DMS or DMDS inferred in the atmosphere by the study is difficult to sustain by non-living processes calls for developing new research that can theoretically, empirically and experimentally seek the existence of these potential nonbiological pathways. To their credit, the authors call for a “dedicated community effort”.But until we can prove the absence of abiotic sources, it is premature to suggest from these molecules that there is life on K2-18b.While the paper repeatedly stresses the preliminary nature of the findings and the need for further data, public statements by the lead author have at times conveyed a stronger sense of confidence than the published evidence supports. When this happens, we miss the critically important opportunity to understand that science progresses carefully, incrementally, and with eyes wide open to its strengths and limitations. There is always room for extraordinary conclusions, but these must be backed by compelling evidence. We are all excited at the prospect that one day soon, we will find unambiguous evidence of life beyond Earth. We are not there yet. But we should celebrate how far we have come, and how each additional bit of knowledge takes us that much closer to a definitive answer.Nathalie Cabrol is director of the Carl Sagan Center at the Seti Institute, and author of The Secret Life of the Universe: An Astrobiologist’s Search for the Origins and Frontiers of LifeExplore more on these topicsAlien lifeOpinionAstronomySpacecommentShareReuse this content"

And not, in my opinion, for the better. To great fanfare, Tuvalu – an entirely cash-based society – hasunveiled its first ever ATM, marking its move towards financial modernisation. But while the 10,000 people living in that country may be celebrating no longer having to queue at the bank, I fear their happiness will be short-lived. It’s the start of the slow erosion of human contact that heralds the dehumanisation of yet another society.Theworld’s first ATMwas introduced in Britain in 1967, butfor me the tyranny of machines that promise convenience but erode human contactreally began about 20 years ago, in the form of self-checkouts in our local Sainsbury’s. Having watched the Terminator movie franchise during my formative years, I railed prophetically against them, aware that it was just a small slippery slope from “unexpected item in the bagging area” to the extinction of the human race. I wrote about my fear of these machines with their Dalek-like commands and even started a short-lived and extremely unpopular Facebook campaign against them. But like a modern-day Cassandra, I was doomed to be ignored.To be clear: I’m no luddite. While I admit I am not an early adopter, I do have the latest iPhone, spend far more time than is wise on social media and can frequently be heard barking orders at an Alexa device. I’m also well aware that technology can make life easier, simpler, quicker and more efficient. The problem is, it has insidiously crept into areas of life where it has no purpose other than to replace human interaction. And that has left society poorer and far more miserable.Today, automated checkouts have not only taken over supermarkets (where often they’re the only option unless you want to buy a scratchcard or cigarettes), they have also appeared in pharmacies and clothes retailers. Customer services departments have been decimated, helplines substituted with AI chatbots, and local bank branches replaced by apps.It’s easy to see why. Machines make model employees. They don’t have rights or belong to unions, and they don’t require sick pay or holidays. A rise in the minimum wage or employer’s national insurance rates are irrelevant to them. If they break, you fix them or simply replace them. Never mind those who most need this type of work – school-leavers, the unskilled, disabled people. And forget elderly shoppers, for whom a chat with a cashier might be the only human contact of the day.Retailers claim customers love dealing with machines. Do we? Asurvey by the Belonging Forumfound nearly half of UK adults (48%) are more likely to return to shops where they’re served by a person rather than a self-checkout.The other day, when I had to contact my bank, it took lots of Googling to find its (well-hidden) customer services number. When I finally got through to someone, I expressed my preference for talking to a person over using an app because I have fat thumbs, and because it’s so much more pleasant and efficient. “I’m old school,” I stated. The young woman responded kindly by offering to send me information on “courses to improve your digital skills”. She might as well have suggested a blue rinse and a freedom pass to boot. For the record, my digital skills are fine, dear. My middle-aged pride, on the other hand, is rather wounded.Age does appear to be a big factor in our attitude towards technology. In 2017, asurvey by LivePersonfound that 69.4% of gen Z and millennial respondents would choose a messaging app over a phone app if they could keep only one. But we also know how much reliance on technology and lack of human contact aredamaging young people’s mental health. And employers frequently complain that young new recruits come to them unable to make a simple phone call or converse with colleagues or customers.Loneliness is now an epidemic. In 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it to bea global health threat, with its mortality effects equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Human contact isn’t just more pleasant, it’s also essential.AI promises to free up time. But what if it spares us from learning, writing, painting and exploring the world? | Joseph EarpRead moreThere are signs that the tide may be turning. A supermarket chain in the Netherlands, Jumbo,introduced slower checkoutsin 2019 for any customers who prefer to chat to a human being. The initiative aims to tackle loneliness, particularly in elderly customers.Hell, it turns out, is not other people. It’s being caught in the ninth circle of an automated telephone answering service, which can’t understand your commands and takes you back to the same menu again and again. But here’s a little tip for you: if you scream “human being” when asked which option you’d like, it usually works. For now, at least.Hilary Freeman is a journalist and authorExplore more on these topicsTechnologyOpinionLonelinessSupermarketsBankingSmartphonesTuvaluSocial exclusioncommentShareReuse this content"

Metal poles were erected around a housing association property next door to me, owned by the social housing provider Peabody, to allow for external refurbishment work to be carried out. But today, that scaffolding still stands – and those repair works have never been carried out.“This is yet another example of Peabody’s casual neglect of their residents. They do not respond to emails from me or senior council officers and have also ignored an enforcement notice served on them by planning officers,” the chair of Islington council’s planning committee, Martin Klute,recently toldthe Islington Tribune.Peabody ownsmore than 5%of Islington’s nearly112,000 properties. And it has wellbelow average performanceon every key indicator of landlord services. Inaction on dealing with hazardous cladding, damp, rodent infestation or broken-down lifts, and failure to tackle neighbour nuisance or other forms of antisocial behaviour, are typical of the concerns that Peabody tenants raise regularly.And Peabody, while it is one of the worst offenders, is not unique. Ask any councillor or Citizens Advice worker in any of our largest cities about their housing caseload, and they will tell you the same story. Yet locally elected representatives are often powerless to act.In the shadow of Grenfell, tenants are living with damp, mould and rats – there’s no faith in politics without a safe home | Joe PowellRead moreBefore 2010, the Audit Commission, of which I was chief executive, routinely inspected housing associations. But for the Regulator of Social Housing, created by the Tories, the main preoccupation was with their financial viability; tenant services were no longer their focus. Since theGrenfell Tower fire, this has begun to change. However, social housing remains the least accountable of all our public services. In England, providers are not even subject to the Freedom of Information Act.And the housing ombudsman, which madefour findingsof severe maladministration against Peabody last year, has also been unable to drive change. In one of last year’s findings, involving dangerous cladding, the ombudsmannotedthat it had taken 24 emails and an intervention by the local MP before Peabody responded to the issue.. In another case, Peabodyrefusedto look beyond the last six months at a problem that had persisted for eight years, even though it had previously admitted that its property was in“a very dangerous stateMy neighbours, who have suffered from dark, damp and neglect for longer than the duration of the second world war, would no doubt empathise. Klute, the critic from Islington council clearly has a point.Asked to respond to the many criticisms, Peabody says it spends £1m a day on maintaining residents’ homes with teams in each local area and that it seeks to listen to residents to improve “the basics”. In this case, Peabody says it regrets how long the scaffolding has been up. The building is listed and it says that means any changes must involve the council, English Heritage and everyone who lives there. “This has all taken longer than we would have liked and we’re very sorry. We’re aiming to do the work as soon as possible.”Residents would welcome that. But the real problem is bigger than Peabody. Housing is now the responsibility of the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner. She is commendablyincreasing the rightsof tenants in private rented property. But her renters’ rights bill does not address the growing crisis in the experience of social housing tenants. And as Labour promises yet another quango cull, housing associations will lobby for even greater deregulation than has so far been suggested. For building the additional homes the country desperately needs, they may have a point. But their tenants need more protection, not less.This does not mean reintroducing inspection, which is costly and can be ineffective. Instead, Rayner’s many options include giving local authorities a clear role in the accountability of the sector. For instance, she could permit councils to require attendance at public scrutiny meetings by associations felt to be neglecting their charitable roots. She could allow the housing ombudsman to considersuper-complaintsfrom councils, which would act like a class action in law. She could extend the Freedom of Information Act, as proposed by the Labour MP Andy Slaughter in 2019. She could also give existing regulation more bite, with stiffer penalties and a new duty on housing providers to be good neighbours, requiring them to keep communities informed.In my own particularcase, Peabody has never provided any information about its plans for the properties adjoining my home, despite erecting scaffolding which extends across my windows.Hundred-year wait for family-size social housing in parts of England, study findsRead moreBut one change, above all others, would compel all housing associations, not just Peabody, to give their responsibilities as landlords the same focus that they now devote to development activities. The law permits councils to order the repair of some properties in very poor condition. However, the powers, provided by the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, convey only trivial penalties for non-compliance. It is possible for councils to then undertake the necessary work themselves – yet they are not able to recover the cost of doing so immediately, by billing the delinquent providers. Instead, they must place a charge on the property that is recoverable only if, and when, it is sold.No cash-strapped council will take such a step lightly. To remedy this imbalance, the offenders should be compelled to pay immediately on completion of the repairs. And if they then challenge council invoices in court, the onus should be on the provider in each case to show that it had taken reasonable steps to avoid direct action by the council on behalf of vulnerable tenants.Before Margaret Thatcher, when social housing was mostly provided by local government, disaffected renters could vote against their landlord. That is often no longer the case, so it is vital that we find other ways to empower social tenants and make politics relevant to their concerns.Meanwhile, Peabody’s chief executive, who has failed to respond to the letters my neighbours and I have written to him about his organisation’s failings, will soon become chair of the group of London’s largest housing associations. As such, he will arguably be the most influential person in the sector. When they meet, Rayner should tell him to first put his own house in order. And should he fail, that she will enable councillors to put things right.Steve Bundred is a former Audit Commission chief executiveExplore more on these topicsSocial housingOpinionHousingEnglandAngela RaynerRenting propertycommentShareReuse this content"

We’re going again this yearTue 22 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 10.03 EDTShareYouth might not be wasted on the young, but for the longest time I thought Interrailing was. When I was a student, as the 1980s became the 1990s, many of my friends took the opportunity to discoverEuropeby train and they all returned with amazing stories of discovery. But for long-forgotten reasons, it was something I was always going to do but never actually got round to. And then suddenly I was in my late 20s and reluctantly resigned myself to never doing it, having been reliably informed by so many people that it was an opportunity only open to those under the age of 26.Fast forward a few decades to spring 2023 and I’m trying to decide where to take my teenage children for our first holiday in five years – a gap caused largely, but not wholly, by the pandemic. My most memorable childhood holiday had come in 1981 when, over the course of a few days, my dad drove my family and our caravan from Nottingham to Pisa. I still remember the incredible feeling of my horizons broadening overnight. I’d love to give my children a similar experience, except I don’t drive.And then I start to see excitable posts from a Facebook friend about his family Interrail trip from Edinburgh to Slovenia and back. “But … but … he’s too old for that,” I thought to myself, before the penny belatedly dropped and I hastily checked out theInterrail(Eurail for non-European residents) website. And there,30 years late, I finally discovered the truth: theage restriction is long gone. And nobody had thought to tell me! People older than 26 can still go Interrailing! Yes, it’s marginally more expensive, but hardly prohibitively so. So I cobbled together an itinerary and a few weeks later my two sons and I set out on a voyage of discovery. It was such a success that we did it again (to different places) in summer 2024.In short, Interrailing was a revelation – for me and for my children. Any doubts I may have had about travel broadening the mind were quickly dispelled when, on the first day of our first trip, I saw my elder son’s sheer amazement at the way the departure boards on the metro in Brussels differed from those on London’s tube, or – a few days later – my younger son’s delight at seeingBerlin zoo’s giant pandas.View image in fullscreenPhil Mongredien’s elder son on a family Interrailing tripPhotograph: Phil MongredienThere were mishaps along the way: some homesickness in Vienna; a spectacular inability to read a weather forecast and then dress accordingly in Prague; a poorly child in Bergen necessitating a tour of the city’s chemists rather than a nearby national park. But more often, what initially seemed to be a major problem turned out to be an opportunity to discover fresh wonders.When I was too spontaneous with our travel plans for Deutsche Bahn’s liking and realised that I’d left it too late to book us on to the Hamburg-Kolding train, I was terrified that we might not get to Legoland Denmark, very much the jewel in the crown of my younger son’s trip. This would have been a dereliction of duty I feared might be unforgivable. But there was a slower, moresedate alternativeto the Hamburg-Copenhagen express – which proved to be an absolute delight, wending its way across the hypnotically flat Schleswig-Holstein countryside and necessitating briefly changing on to seemingly the world’s tiniest train in Tønder,Denmark’s answer to Gretna Green. It took us several hours longer, but seeing parts of northern Germany and western Denmark that were far off the beaten (railway) track felt like an adventure in itself.That ability to glimpse Europe’s more obscure spots is one of the massive advantages Interrailing has over air travel, where you’re whisked from one interchangeable airport to another, going from your home city to the tourist destination of your choice and skipping all that lies in between – the beautiful, the bleak, the places that understandably don’t appear in guidebooks, the messy thrill of actual real life – and seeing only the sanitised endpoints. And so, unlike air travel, where the transit element of a holiday is at best a soul-sapping chore in consumerism hell, the actual journeys were as much a part of the holiday as any of our destinations, whether we were on theOslo-Bergen line, which is habitually – and rightly – described asone of the most scenicin Europe, or theZutphen-Hengeloline in the eastern Netherlands, which is not, but did have the bonus of a garrulous passenger keen to know my children’s views on Brexit (they had many) and the state of Belgium’s roads (they had none). (For the record, he was a fan of neither.)That slower pace of travel brings other benefits, too: it’s hard to get a grip on how vast and varied Europe is when you can fly over it in the time it takes to digest an airport sandwich. By train it can take almost a full day just to cross Germany. That pace affords a greater connection with your surroundings. As a series of trains gradually took us north from Calais to Oslo last summer, we could watch as the architecture of churches and houses changed; as oak slowly gave way to beech to spruce to white birch; as cedillas on signs were replaced by umlauts and then overrings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Australia, by comparison, seemed less polarised, but newresearchhints that something’s starting to shift – slowly, unevenly and with plenty of caveats – among young Australians too.But let’s not jump the gun – because the story is more complicated than it first appears, andframing“young men” as a purely reactionary force isn’t going to get us anywhere helpful.For starters, we don’t evenagree onwhat “progressive” or “conservative” means. Some surveys measure ideology in vague terms, others zoom in on specific issues. And younger generations often defy neat ideological labels – they can be inclusive and tolerant in some areas, but more traditional in others.Australia’s gen Z men more likely to hold sexist views, data shows, as ‘manosphere’ influences take holdRead moreAnalysisof 2001–2023 Hilda survey data by the e61 Institute found that, in 2023, young gen Z men were more conservative on gender roles than millennial or gen X men. In fact, 15 to 24-year-old men were more conservative than every other male group, bar over-65s, and their more progressive female peers.But the data also suggests that as people age, they often mellow out a bit – or in this case liberalise. A panel of 15 to 24-year-olds surveyed in earlier waves became more progressive as they moved into the 25 to 34 group – just as the last batch did. This pattern, if it holds, could mean today’s young men might follow a similar trajectory to the last batch.Another important nuance missing in headlines is a small but notable conservative nudge among young women. In 2023, 15 to 24-year-old women were more likely to agree with traditional gender roles than both 25 to 34-year-olds and their own cohort five years earlier. A UKstudylast year found similar vibes: young women between 16 and 29 were slightly more likely than older women to say feminism has “done more harm than good”.In Australia, ANUpoll/EMSS datashowsthat between 2022 and 2025, the share of men who think we’ve “gone too far” on gender equality doubled from 14% to 28%. That headline has been doing the rounds. But the same view nearly doubled among women too, from 6% to 11%. And the share of women who think we still haven’t gone far enough fell from 71% to 61%.So yes, women are still more pro-equality than men – but it seems edges are fraying (perhaps because of a generational fad – more below).Whether these shifts are meaningful or lasting is hard to say. In political science nerdland, we call it the age-period-cohort problem. Are young people like this because they’re young? Because of the current cultural moment (think Trumpism, Tate machoism)? Or because something about their generation is genuinely different and durable? These effects are difficult to untangle, especially when we’re looking at a generation still in its most impressionable years.For instance, in my analysis of the Australian Election Study (1996–2022), I found that gen Z men are still, on the whole, more progressive than older men – even when accounting for education, religion, familial socialisation and so on. And when it comes to left-right vote choice, gender differences largely disappear. Now, it’s unlikely that something happened to gen Z men in one year between the two surveys (AES in 2022 and Hilda in 2023) but that much depends on the questions used and how we define generations – some use five-year cuts, others 10 or 15 – which partly explains why different studies show different patterns.But whichever way you slice it, something’s clearly up with gen Z – men and women.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My researchshowsgen Z has drawn the short end of the stick: rising costs, mounting debt, insecure work and a polarised online world. When public discourse seems to spotlight women’s issues, some young men feel side-lined. This generation isn’t just living through teenage angst – their environment monetises and amplifies it. Social media algorithms feed frustration and resentment.Add economic status anxiety and influencers blaming feminism for their struggles, and you’ve got fertile ground for backlash.Let’s not forget – both young men and women are navigating gendered pressure to be emotionally fluent, socially conscious, successful, attractive and everything in between. For boys especially, there’s a tug-of-war between traditional masculinity and newer expectations to be emotionally self-aware and sensitive. Some may lean conservative not because they hate women – but because it seems less exhausting than figuring all that other stuff out.And sometimes social conservatism may look likerebellion. Rejecting hookup culture, embracing trad gender roles, or finding refuge in religion can feel edgy, even cool. In Australia, nearly 40% of young men under 28 nowidentify as Christian, compared with under 30% of women. Meanwhile, gen Z women are veering left – more progressive, more vocal and morefrustratedat the lack of like-minded romantic options. Some are even datingolder, looking for ideological compatibility.So, Australia’s gen Z are on track to followtrendslike in the US where young people overall are dating less, having less sex and delaying the whole marriage-and-kids shebang. But it’s not just about prudence or the cost of living – there’s a deeper emotional current here. Without relationships or real-world experiences that challenge their views, many young men are stuck in echo chambers. Romantic friction, the kind that sharpens empathy and shifts perspective, just isn’t happening.As my 31-year-old partner bluntly put it: “Relationships exposed me to different perspectives and changed some ideas I held as a younger man. Today, many young guys aren’t getting that chance – social media and influencers are telling them it’s fine to stay as they are. And the dude brain loves a simple answer.”So it’s not that these young men are monsters in the making – many just feel short-changed. On the supply side, populist politicians and media exploit this frustration and influencers such as Rogan, Tate and their ilk offer validation and belonging – especially as mainstream institutions fail to address disorientation.So instead of alarmism or shaming, we need to create spaces where young men feel heard, challenged and supported. Schools, media, research and politics – they all have a role inacknowledging male grievancesand showing boys that they can question old norms without feeling as if they’re losing something.If we don’t step in, others will – and not always with good intentions.Dr Intifar Chowdhury is a youth researcher and a lecturer in government at Flinders UniversityExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionGenderPsychologyMental healthAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The singer of Ordinary, the longest-running No 1 of the year, talks about his journey to breakout successTue 22 Apr 2025 11.21 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 21.30 EDTShareAt 18, Alex Warren was homeless, sneaking into the gym of a gated community in his home town of Carlsbad, California, to shower for job interviews and filmTikTokvideos of himself singing in the bathroom. Six years later he is one of pop’s next potential superstars. His bombastic ballad Ordinary has been No 1 in the UK charts for five weeks, the longest-running chart leader this year, and entered the US Top 10 last week. As soon as he heard the finished version, he was “freaking out – my wife and I listened to it on repeat for our entire drive home, for 45 minutes.”Ordinary may be Warren’s breakout hit but he’s been famous for a long time. He gained notoriety on social media in his teens by making hugelypopular videoswith titles such as “BROTHER WAKES UP IN MIDDLE OF LAKE PRANK!” In 2019 he co-founded the Hype House, a shared house of content creators (including the D’Amelio sisters and Addison Rae) known for Covid-era internet videos, as well as at least one controversial facemask-free influencer party and, eventually, a $300,000 (£226,000) lawsuit – which Warren wasn’t named in – which alleged property damage and unpaid rent.I hated who I was becomingHe was also one of the stars of Netflix’s subsequentHype Houseshow, in which Warren goes to increasingly deranged lengths to film his prank videos, eventually staging a fake wedding with his now real wife, influencer, Kouvr Annon. He calls Hype House his “college experience: that’s what I did when I was 19. I wouldn’t be here without that time in my life.”Warren is speaking by video from Tennessee – an income-tax-free state, and therefore an increasingly popular influencer haven. One of Warren’s sisters lives nearby, and it felt like a spot where Annon could “feel safe” while he’s on tour. The chic new home he moved into last week – I spy vaulted ceilings and a large yard as he paces back and forth – matches his nice new life, miles removed literally and spiritually from the Hype House, and from his difficult youth.He is one of four children born to a “very successful” real estate father and a stay-at-home mother. He was raised Catholic, which he attributes to his father, who was diagnosed with terminal kidney cancer before Warren was born. “You tend to have a more religious standing” when you’re dying, Warren says, “because you know what’s coming”.Warren grew up listening to worship music – and arguably Christian-rock-adjacent acts such as Coldplay – which he says has been a strong influence on the music career he has pivoted to. He has “always loved a pop ballad”, but admits he’s no music nerd. “Everyone’s always asked me [what music] I know, and I’m like, ‘I have no idea who these people are and I wish I did.’ So I’ve been really trying to put myself out there and like other music. I’ve been listening to a lot of albums – that’s something I wasn’t doing before.” He cites the latest LP from Hozier, whose soulful vocal delivery is similar to Warren’s, and Charli xcx’s Brat. “I liked it a lot. I was like, ‘Wow, I’ve never listened to music like this before,’ from start to finish. It’s been interesting.”As Warren grew up, he began to question his faith. His father died when he was nine, leaving his mother with an immense amount of debt in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash. She descended into alcoholism and was unable to hold down a job. “She was a troubled person who didn’t have it all there in her head, and she suffered a lot her entire life,” he says. “We were on food stamps, and my mum lost everything my dad built for us.”Warren describes his mother as abusive as a result of her alcoholism. When he turned 18, she kicked him out, leaving him homeless and sleeping on the street or in cars – an experience he describes as “sick” in a positive sense. “I’m not gonna say it wasn’t,” he says. “I felt free – I think anyone who’s been in an abusive situation knows once you’re out of it, no matter the circumstance, it is the most freeing feeling in the world, knowing you don’t have to look over your shoulder and worry.”View image in fullscreen‘These songs are helping people’ … Warren.Photograph: Jimmy FontaineDuring this period Warren was introduced to Annon on Snapchat. She moved from her family home in Hawaii to Carlsbad to live with him, initially in his friend’s car. Warren began making money from social media videos, and later found his way back to the church. I ask how he feels about certain pranks that scan as particularly wasteful, or perhaps unchristian – such as the video in which he crushes Annon’s car, before surprising her with a new one.“There are things I did that I definitely cringe at,” he says. “But you also have to remember, I was a kid who was just previously homeless, coming out of an abusive household. I was just doing what I thought was the cool thing at the time. Yes, I’m not happy with who I was and what I did, but I had to do those things to appreciate who I am today.”Warren released his first original song,One More I Love You, in 2021, and started to move away from his comedy videos. “I love the vlogs, but I stopped vlogging because people would make jokes like, ‘Oh, Alex is going to film his wedding, Alex is going to film when he has a baby’, and I was like, ‘Why would I actually do that?’ Then I started thinking, ‘Oh, maybe I might.’ I hated who I was becoming.”But he did film his wedding – I refer to a clip he posted recently of Annon and him reciting their vows. “That’s like, my wedding video. That’s not, like, me vlogging it. Everyone films their wedding,” he says, scowling. And what about the music video you filmed at it? “I wrote that songformy wedding,” he says. Our conversation has become tense, and a publicist informs me our time is nearly up.For all that he has already endured in his life – his mother died in 2021 – there will be sceptics about Warren’s pivot from fame-obsessed prankster to God-fearing pop star. His manager Brian Sokolik works for a company that promises to empower content creators to “diversify their businesses and produce projects across music, merchandise, books, podcasts, television, touring and more”. Adam Yaron and Cal Shapiro, two of the songwriters who co-wrote much of Warren’s debut album You’ll Be Alright, Kid (Chapter One), mainly work with social media stars and TV singing competition contestants looking to move beyond cover versions.But Warren seems to be setting himself apart, at least in the sense that very few content creators have had a song as successful as Ordinary. He hopes his songs about love and grief can help his new fans through their own emotional struggles. “I’ve realised after playing live shows that these songs are helping people,” he says. “I think that’s important.”Explore more on these topicsPop and rockYouTubeTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A growing number of event organisers across the UK are putting their own spins on literature readings – and there are queues out the doorSinéad CampbellTue 22 Apr 2025 08.21 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 12.37 EDTShareOn a Saturday evening in London’s Notting Hill, a large crowd of moderately tipsy young people are spilling into a tailor’s shop on Portobello Road. A passerby could easily assume they were walking past a fashion pop-up attracting a stylish herd of fanatics. But they’d be wrong. The buzzing crowd is here for a live reading event, and they’re eager with energy and anticipation.Soho Reading Seriesbegan in the summer of 2023 and was founded by Tom Willis, a writer and PhD student. He wanted to make a “scene where anyone could turn up, party, and have a killer time with literature as the centre,” he tells me over an extra-dry martini a couple of hours before one of the events.Live literature readings are, of course, nothing new. Salons, bookshop readings, poetry slams and open mics have been fixtures of literary cultures for decades. However, lately this tradition has been revitalised, with events like the Soho Reading Series cropping up all over the country.Willis was inspired by the cultural heyday of Soho in the 80s and 90s, an era when writers and literary types coalesced in the boozy backrooms of private members’ clubs. Unlike its name, the Soho Reading Series migrates with each event to different venues across the city – from a Grade II-listed pub in Harringay to a Victorian Anglican church on Ladbroke Grove.“If you’re a published writer, you might go to your publishing house’s Christmas party, and everyone just knows each other there. That’s the professional literary scene, and then we’re theunprofessionalliterary scene.” Willis says with a smile.Some people come for a party. Some people come for readings. People end up staying for the thing they didn’t come forSophie Barshall“Scene” is a word used by many of the event’s attendees – but only ever while miming air quotes. I guess this is because the word implies an air of pretentiousness and exclusivity. In reality, these events are unassuming and attract a diverse and expanding crowd. There’s no immovable barrier, secret password or even a ticket to enter – anyone can walk in.“It’s a party of like-minded people who care about literature. So that’s why it’s such a good party, because everyone cares about the same thing, and everyone’s not there for their career. They hang out with people who like books and have something nice to share,” says Willis.Soho Reading Series is just one vein in a growing web of live reading events. The audience is young compared with the average literature festival crowd and it attracts a devout congregation of both literary and party-curious individuals.View image in fullscreenToye Oladinni reading at the Soho Reading Series.Photograph: Isobel Landell Mills“Some people come for a party. Some people come for readings. People often end up staying for the thing that they hadn’t planned to come for,” saysSophie Barshall, editor of London-based quarterly DIY arts and culture newspaperThe Toe Rag, which also hosts popular live readings.Inside the tailor’s shop on Portobello Road, the readings begin an hour late. There is no microphone; each reader flicks through printed sheets of paper or scrolls through the notes app on their phone, attempting to project their voice over shuffling, mumbles, momentary laughter and heckling. The shop – usually populated by people shopping for cashmere socks – is full to capacity. The audience has leaked out on to the pavement, and a young woman next to me is FaceTiming a friend outside so they can hear what’s going on.What is being read aloud is unrestricted by theme or genre. The readings jump from excerpts of short stories published in Granta magazine to a five-star Google review of the 2007 Pixar film Ratatouille.Most of the people I speak to have“never been to something like this before but came across the event through social media or a writer’s Substack and decided to give it a try. Avid readers and amateur writers make up around half of those in attendance, but a significant portion of people tell me they are there purely because they like the idea of being considered literary.As the reading ends and we move from one local pub to the next, a young man drunkenly confesses that “he doesn’t even enjoy the readings that much” – he just comes to “meet the types of people whowouldenjoy it”.“It’s probably not for everyone,” Willis says. “It’s boring unless you’re really engaged in it. It’s free and open to everyone, but it does self-select. But that’s the scene – that’s why literature is so good for scene making.”View image in fullscreenA Waterwings live reading event, featuring artwork by Gabriella Day.Photograph: Eden Bø DowerIn Glasgow, a number of reading series such asthi wurdand Shrill have emerged in recent years.Waterwings Press, which has been hosting live reading events in the city’s south side since 2020, was set up by Leo Bussi, who moved to Glasgow wanting to discover its art scene and meet different people. “I thought the best way to do that is to message someone on Instagram and say, ‘Hey, do you want to read for my reading?’” he says.Each Waterwings event is made up of readings by five writers: some are seasoned performers, others are first-time readers. Contemporary poetry is the most represented genre alongside what Bussi loosely defines as “art writing” – a mixture of autofiction, art and literary criticism.“It’s like taking a piece of spaghetti and throwing it against the wall to see if it’ll stick,” he says. “There’s an improvisation to the evening, which can be incredibly stressful but also gratifying because when it works, it really works.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Because so many publishing staff members “come from the same background”, they “picture the reader as someone like them and people they know,” says Rachel Connolly, a writer and regular on the London live reading circuit.Connolly co-hosts a series calledNew Workalongside her friend and writer, Isis O’Regan, a dedicated space for fiction writers to litmus-test new, unpublished work with an audience. The series debuted last July; previous readers include authors Eliza Clark, Gabriel Smith and Nicole Flattery.“Our ideal reader is really good at writing, funny, sexy and a bit weird, a bit out there. In the digital age, writers probably know each other online from Twitter and Instagram, but it’s way nicer to come and meet people and listen to their work, hear their voice and actually put a body to the impression that you have of someone,” Connolly says.“But maybe people are also trying to get laid,” she adds, half jokingly.This seems to be a common theme – Willis often begins a Soho Reading Series event by jokily suggesting that audience members get with someone they find attractive – and is another reason that attending them feels more like going to a music gig than a literature fixture.“It’s meant to be enjoyable,” says poet and musician James Massiah, whose east London reading seriesAdult Entertainmentis all about “party poetry”. His nights typically begin with audiences sitting on the floor listening to performances by poets and rappers, before a DJ takes to the decks and the dancing begins.‘Reading is so sexy’: gen Z turns to physical books and librariesRead more“What do people like at parties? They like dancing, they like meeting someone they fancy, they like hearing some tunes and they like getting it on,” he says. “I want the writing to reflect that, and I want the mood to reflect that as well.”“Any live literature event is about bringing work into the world and sharing it with others,” agrees Joey Frances, a poet and organiser of the long-running reading seriesPeter Barlow’s Cigbased in Manchester, named after the chainsmoking character from Coronation Street.“You’re hearing one another, you’re feeding back from one another, you’re hanging out, you’re having fun.”Fun is the key to the success of these events, Massiah thinks. “It’s not a lecture. It’s like the spirit of dance or dub sound systems where people congregate for the music. It’s like that, but people are congregating for the words.”Explore more on these topicsBooksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here are some absolutely spoiler-packed discussion points (seriously, multiple endings are spoiled!) for the film’s variety of layers, genres and readings.Sinners is a horror film about the highs and lows of the Black experience | Andrew LawrenceRead moreCrime drama vvampire horrorWhenever a movie has an unusual genre mix or bifurcated structure – and Sinners has both – there will be viewers who prefer one half to the other. Coogler’s film is a relatively leisurely crime-adjacent drama for its first half, following brothers Smoke and Stack (both Michael B Jordan) as they attempt to parlay their gangsters’ bounty into a juke joint for their Mississippi community. Then it turns into more of a horror movie, when vampires, apparently drawn out by the supernatural quality of the brothers’ musician cousin Sammie (Miles Caton), show up at the club and try to turn the patrons to their undead army. And the club scenes mean that the movie briefly resembles a performance musical on its way to the horror-action stuff.The temptation with this many genres in play is often to choose a team: why didn’t they get to the awesome vampire stuff faster? Or, why did they spoil that great character-building with a bunch of horrific action? Or, why wasn’t the whole thing a blues musical? But Coogler in his very form seems to reject the hard lines of separation that audiences sometimes want to impose on material like this – which is a particularly interesting technique for him, given the movie’s complicated portrayal of cultural blending. In a way, it feels like Coogler is reclaiming the mixed-and-matched genre space from his former (and possibly future) employers at Marvel, where movies often purport to belong to some highly specific (and sometimes nonexistent) genre, only to play primarily like those elements have been overstirred into a gray mush. I don’t think Coogler particularly meant Sinners as a rebuke to the Marvel Method, but it’s nonetheless inspiring to see how the movie lets its genres overlap while still allowing crucial elements – the flowing blood of horror, the ecstasy of the musical, the process of a crime picture – to stick out as conspicuously as possible.Seeing doubleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/APAs mentioned, Michael B Jordan plays two roles here –the latest actor to do so in 2025, after Robert Pattinson, as clones in the future; and Robert De Niro, as two completely different people in the past. (Is Warner Bros, the studio that released all three of these movies, simply taking their name too literally?) Jordan is a good actor and an even better movie star, and his double act depends more on the latter. Smoke and Stack are clearly different, but Jordan isn’t giving the type of dual performance where you can instantly recognize either one based entirely on mannerisms, vocal affect, or posture. (Neither was De Niro, in case you were curious about a far more misbegotten double-gangster turn.)Instead, Jordan and Coogler use the characters’ twinning in a more mythology-friendly way; in retrospect, it feels inevitable that one brother will be turned into a vampire and the other will remain human, a neat angel/devil separation that the movie, again, complicates in its final stretch (more on that in a moment). It’s this, far more than any specific acting tricks, that differentiate the two men; the respective fates that await Smoke and Stack are difficult to imagine reversed. One of them is bound for heaven even/especially after the vengeance he wreaks upon a group of Klansmen; one is bound to make the best of eternal hell on Earth. The double casting also serves as a canny workaround for Jordan’s charisma; Caton’s character eventually emerges as central, and while that could probably happen with Smoke and Stack recombined into a single character (Caton is very good), having two Jordans on hand is a way of ensuring the movie isn’t thrown off balance – that the audience doesn’t get antsy when Jordan is offscreen, because he rarely is.The magic of musicView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/APAbout halfway through the movie, Coogler stages a more impressionistic sequence, where the ecstasy of the music played by Sammie and veteran musician Delta Slim (Delroy Lindo) gives way to both fiery imagery and orgiastic visions of music past and future, including African and Asian dancers, a Funkadelic-style guitarist, and a DJ spinning records. Even in a genre-mixing, sprawling film, it’s a bold, extended gambit, bringing some Baz Luhrmann into a mix that includes more traditional horror/action/genre directors like John Carpenter and Robert Rodriguez. In what is already one of the year’s most talked-about shots, Coogler’s camera – capturing images popped out to full, towering 4:3 aspect ratio for those lucky enough to see it on a classic, gigantic Imax screen – snakes around the club, taking in the whirl of music, dance and color. As indulgent as it might seem (and it is indulgent, in the best, most crowd-levitating way), it’s also a form of shorthand for the earthly paradise this community experiences for one wild night, before it comes crashing down.Vampiric assimilationView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc./PAThe music at the center of Sinners is given a divine-like connection to the other side; it “pierces the veil” and seemingly attracts the attention of the lead vampire Remmick (Jack O’Connell), who’s quite steeped in music himself, of the Irish folk variety. Remmick and his recently vamp-converted fellow white folks (including Lola Kirke from Mistress America!) show up at the club not to menace everyone, at least not initially, but to politely ask for an invitation to join the party. (These vampires, like many others in other lore, can’t enter a building unless invited directly.) The community rebuffs them, but when Mary (Hailee Steinfeld), a mixed-race woman like kin to many of the Black folks on hand, reaches out to them, hoping for some possible patronage, they turn her; she, of course, is invited back into the joint, and thus begins the true havoc.This set-up evokes a variety of racial politics and potential readings. The most obvious one casts the white characters as a literalized version of cultural vampires, attracted by the undeniable allure of another group’s music and eager to suck the life from it. The fact that they attack the Black characters at night (like Ku Klux Klan members), only without masks, also has strong hints of institutional racism that would outlast the once-normalized hate groups (and come back around, nearly as virulent but inexplicably considered more respectable). But given that the community in question clearly welcomes non-Black members, and how plenty of non-white people are brought into the vampire fold, I read this rich metaphor as more to do with the process of assimilation in America. The vampires preach the value of, essentially, a hive mind that they claim offers equality for all – the drawback being, of course, that said hive mind is also controlled by its originator, not by the people absorbed into it. Sinners is bittersweet about how this process, whether through vampire-turned assimilation or simply the passage of time, can leave more self-supporting communities behind. We’re certainly relieved that Sammie escapes, defiantly holding on to the neck of his blues guitar, but it’s not lost on the audience that he’s the only one who makes it out. Well, almost.Choose your endingView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures/APSinners could be said to have about four different endings, broken up by end credits. The stories of Smoke, Stack and Sammie seem to end one way, with Smoke killing the vampire version of Stack, then he and Sammie triumphing over Remmick – only to bring Smoke back into the violence the next morning as he’s mortally wounded while mowing down approaching (real) Klan members. Then a during-credits epilogue – another reappropriation of the Marvel Method! – offers a time jump that further elaborate on the fates of both Sammie and Stack, who Smoke has let live in exchange for leaving Sammie be, allowing him to escape and eventually become a Buddy Guy-like blues legend. (He is literally played by Buddy Guy.) But Stack lives on, as does Mary, and briefly reunites with his now-elderly cousin after the latter’s gig in 1992. And that’s still not all! After the rest of the credits roll, there’s a postscript where we see a younger Sammie briefly playing This Little Light of Mine, which has readings related to both Christianity and to 20th-century civil rights movements.As with the genre-pivoting, a movie with this many endings is “supposed” to be doing things wrong. But Coogler takes a lot of care with his movements through ending; I used the novelistic “epilogue” above, but maybe it’s more akin to a musical coda. Either way, it allows the audience to rethink the monstrousness of Stack (and, to perhaps a lesser extent, his vampire bride Mary), who seems to have freed himself from the assimilation of the head vampire and pursued his own form of immortality. Sammie goes about it the more old-fashioned way, achieving some kind of immortality through his music. What they both agree on is that before the vampire attack went down, that day and night at the juke joint was the best of their lives, reiterating a longing for a space that was truly their own, rather than some kind of compromise with the greater American world. Maybe that final bonus moment of Sammie singing a song of optimism (contrasting with the devil-raising bliss of the blues) is supposed to be a compromise, or maybe it’s a way of wresting the “devil’s music” back for humanity. Regardless, the multiple endings are thematically appropriate; even as he teases out a sense of sadness over what’s been lost, Coogler understands that there’s no one single way this story ends.Explore more on these topicsRyan CooglerNow you've seen itMichael B JordanHorror filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As in both the lowercase, technical meaning – the sequestration of cardinals to elect a new pope with a two-thirds majority – and the capital-C film of the same name from last year, which allowed viewers to vicariously participate in a process long shrouded in secrecy and reverence. (And premiering during the US vote, toexperience election thrillswithout grim disappointment.)The film, directed by Edward Berger, luxuriated in process both sacred and profane – the orderly processions and cafeteria run-ins, the ceremonial burning of paper votes and security screenings, the white smoke and the complimentary toiletries bags. The hallowed halls of the Vatican and the gossip that flits among them, especially as different factions compete to see their vision cemented by the most powerful religious leader in the world. As a deft and highly entertaining thriller on the furtive process of electing a new pope, well, you can expect people to considerConclaveas close to documentary as laypeople can get to the action. But how accurate is it?Conclave: the fun, exciting Vatican thriller is perfect election escapismRead moreAccording to experts, more spot-on than not, and at the very least meticulously researched. “They got a lot of the details right,” said Kathleen Sprows Cummings, a historian of Catholicism at Notre Dame who closely followed the election ofPope Francisin 2013. “The movie did a really good job of balancing the human – people, men who are ambitious, who have very strong feelings about what the church needs – and the Holy Spirit” that Catholics believe guide the proceedings.“It gets a lot of the details right,” agreed Bill Cavanaugh, a professor of Catholic Studies at DePaul University. “Certainly the mise-en-scene of the movie, they take pains to be very accurate on that.” Berger, screenwriter Peter Straughan and the production team have spoken at length, as part of the film’s awards campaign – it was nominated for the Oscar and won the Bafta – about the film’smeticulous research process, which did not directly involve the Vatican, to avoid undue influence. Instead, the team interviewed numerous cardinals on general details, toured the Vatican, and recreated the Sistine Chapel at the Cinecittà Studios in Rome. Religious advisers consulted on archaic proceedings not officially confirmed but passed down through the centuries, such as the process for removing and destroying the dead pope’s ring. “It was remarkable the way that they took something that’s secret and really got a lot of it right,” said Cummings.View image in fullscreenStanley Tucci in Conclave.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyThe film, she added, “got a sense of the types of conversations that happen before a conclave”, during what is called the general congregation, where all cardinals – including so-called “kingmakers” over age 80 who are too old to vote – travel to Rome for conversations and meetings about the future of the church. (“You’re not going to call a movie ‘general congregation’, that’s too boring,” she joked.) The unofficial chatter around the election began in earnest in February, when Francis fell gravely ill with pneumonia. But as of this week, the action depicted in the film will more or less get under way. “They’ll be having dinners, they’ll be gathering in apartments,” she said. “There will be: ‘who’s supporting who? Is there a clear majority going in? Is there a clear front runner going in?’ That’s all happening.”The film delineates those conversations along clear factions headed by archetypes: Cardinal Goffredo Tedesco (Sergio Castellitto), an Italian reactionary, represents the church’s conservative wing opposed to relaxing strictures. Cardinal Aldo Bellini (Stanley Tucci), the leading liberal candidate, seeks to reform the church in the lane of the late pope. Nigerian cardinal Joshua Adeyemi (Lucian Msamati) stands for the large percentage of practicing Catholics in the Global South; he would become the first Black pope, as well as a staunchly homophobic one. Cardinal Joseph Tremblay (John Lithgow) is a savvy and transparently ambitious Canadian keen to power. And Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (Fiennes, whose uncle Nicholas Lash was one of England’s most renowned Catholic theologians) operates as the moderate, tradition-bound peacekeeper nonetheless tempted by personal ambition and sympathies to the liberal wing.This factionalism loosely maps onto a Church grappling with liberal and conservative visions, but the politicking is likely “a little bit exaggerated”, said Cavanaugh. “Cardinals don’t fall neatly into progressive and conservative camps … in general, it’s much more of a mixed bag.”“They’re caricatures, certainly, but they also capture something that’s real,” said Cummings. “There are certainly people who are traditionalist, who think Pope Francis went too far in meeting people on the margins. There are people who want his legacy to continue in just exactly the same way.” How those visions play out in an election featuring 135 cardinals, the vast majority appointed by Francis, is more complicated.Both Cavanaugh and Cummings noted some inaccuracies, such as the influential presence of Cardinal Benitez (Carlos Diehz), a Mexican cardinal appointed archbishop of Kabul in secret (“in pectore”) by the pope before his death, who emerges as a dark horse contender and ultimately – spoiler alert! – the newly elected pope. “The idea that a cardinal in pectore could just like roll up to the conclave and say: ‘Hey, I’m here to vote’ – that actually could not happen,” said Cummings. “A cardinal doesn’t get the privileges of being a cardinal until he’s publicly announced as such.” Fiennes’s role as the dean of the College of Cardinals was conflated with that of the camerlengo – the key dignitary tasked by the pope with overseeing the transition. (The film is correct that the role of camerlengo does not disqualify a cardinal from being elected pope, though it is unusual. According tothe Times, only two camerlengos have ever been elected pope: Gioacchino Pecci, as Pope Leo XIII in 1878, and Eugenio Pacelli, as Pope Pius XII in 1939.) As the college is truly sequestered, it’s unlikely Isabella Rossellini’s nun would be poking around at night. There has never been evidence of a cardinal buying votes, as alleged against Cardinal Tremblay. And the logistics of a bomb blowing out the windows of the Sistine Chapel, in a terrorist attack roughly akin to the Vatican’s “October surprise” was, according to Cummings, highly unlikely. But “procedurally, they got it right,” she said. “The aesthetics were absolutely stunning.”View image in fullscreenIsabella Rossellini in Conclave.Photograph: Courtesy of Focus Features. © 2024 Focus Features/APTechnical inaccuracies aside, Cummings pointed to one moment that captured some emotional truth about a papal election: when the upstart Cardinal Bellini asks Lawrence what his papal name would be. Lawrence demurs, claiming that he never thought about it. But later, he admits it would be John. “I just love that, because of course, if you’re a Cardinal, you have a papal name in mind,” said Cummings. One of the film’s best gags, which played out in memes for weeks, was the cardinals’ persistent front of not wanting to be pope, while accusing others of wanting to be pope. “Of course no one says theywantto be pope,” said Cummings. “I thought that captured really the humanity of the cardinals.”‘We create gods because the world is chaos’: Ralph Fiennes, John Lithgow and Stanley Tucci on celebrity, sin and papal thriller ConclaveRead moreAlso true was the inherent mystery around how someone would act as pope. “Once you elect somebody, you don’t exactly know who they’re going to turn out to be,” said Cavanaugh. Pius IX, for example, was elected in 1846 as a progressive, but became an arch conservative once he was forced to flee Rome by the revolutions of 1848. John the 23rd was elected as a peacekeeper in 1958, but ended up calling the Second Vatican Council modernizing the Church. And Pope Francis himself surprised many with (relatively) progressive stances on homosexuality and social justice.InConclave, Benitez, the newly elected pope, reveals to Lawrence in the Room of Tears – the customary last stop before publicly taking on the weight of a 2,000-year-old institution, lushly imagined in the film as a nook of blood red – that he was intersex, thus challenging the church’s rigid conceptions of gender and who can be pope. The twist, on top of the bombing, is “a little far-fetched”, said Cavanaugh, “but the idea that you never know exactly who you’re getting when you elect a pope, I think it nails that”.Ultimately, those of us outside the Vatican will almost certainly have to speculate on what goes down in Casa Santa Marta and the Sistine Chapel. “We are not supposed to know how the cardinals vote,” said Cavanaugh. “That is supposed to remain a secret forever.” And yet, rumors fly – it was widely known that Jorge Mario Bergoglio, aka Pope Francis, was the runner-up to Joseph Ratzinger, soon to be Pope Benedict XVI, in 2005. The desire to talk, after all, is quite human. If there’s one thing Conclave captured, it’s the unpredictability of living, breathing, emotional people within an institution – or, as Cavanaugh put it, “the balance between the solemnity and sanctity and seriousness of what’s going on, and the fallibility of the humans that are doing it.”This article was amended on 22 April 2025. An earlier version misnamed the character of Joseph Tremblay and stated that he was American; in fact, he is Canadian. Also, Ralph Fiennes played the dean of the College of Cardinals, not the camerlengo.Explore more on these topicsConclavePope FrancisCatholicismChristianityReligionThe papacyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He hopes it will upend lazy ideas around Muslim girls – and bring new audiences to the theatreTue 22 Apr 2025 06.01 EDTShareAsif Khan first heard about Lena, Maysa and Ameya – thethree Muslim skateboarding sistersfrom Hull who became social media stars in 2022 with their skills – from his mother-in-law. “She does this a lot. She’ll send me an article and say: ‘You could write a play about this,’” laughs Khan. But there was something about this particular story that piqued his interest. “They all wore the hijab, lived with their mum and had an Instagram account where they did their own raps and filmed skateboarding tricks … I immediately thought: Oh OK, this is a good premise for a play.”So, he set about adapting it for the stage. He contacted the girls’ parents and had a “good, long hour’s chat”. “They were excited that someone was interested in doing a play about them,” says Khan, 44, who also works as an actor. The result of those chats is Sisters 360, a play about two Bradford-based hijab-wearing, skateboarding stepsisters, Fatima and Salima, aimed at audiences between the ages of eight and 12.This is not the first time Khan has written for children. His 2021 play Jabala and the Jinn tells the story of a girl coming to terms with the loss of her mother, while his first play for adults, Combustion, earned him an Asian Media award for best stage production. Sisters 360 is slightly different from Lena, Maysa and Ameya’s reality. “It is inspired by them, but the story is completely made up,” says Khan. To “represent a diversity of Muslims”, Khan reimagined the girls as stepsisters from different cultural backgrounds; Fatima is British Somali, while Salima is British Pakistani. But, despite not being blood relatives, they unquestionably see themselves as best friends and family. “They absolutely feel like real sisters,” says Khan.Together, Fatima and Salima play with their favourite toys, Batgirl and Batman; obsess over their favourite Olympic medallist, Hope Black – inspired by the real-life OlympianSky Brown– and, most importantly, skateboard. When Sisters 360 begins, they’re preparing for the big competition, Tiny Is Mighty. But as tensions rise between their parents over Fatima’s mum relocating from Bradford to London for work, their close-knit world starts to unravel.View image in fullscreenBoard silly … Sisters 360.Photograph: Polka TheatreThe script deals with big themes and emotions; there are separations, changing friendships and cultural identities. How does he make his work suitable for an audience full of children? “I think we underestimate kids sometimes,” he says. “They can watch things that are engaging and entertaining but also have a certain level of meaning about our lives and what we go through as humans.”Khan’s play is certainly not all gloom, though. On stage, Fatima and Salima – played in this production by Sara Abanur and Farah Ashraf – share their different languages and cultural traditions. Dressed in colourful patterns, hats and knee pads, the girls come alive in each other’s company. Skateboarding is at the core of their friendship. They spend hours at the skate park, practising and perfecting tricks. “It’s not what people associate in their minds with Muslim girls,” Khan says.This play is about two British girls who have a dream – the Muslim part is not important“Skateboarding is generally seen as more of a boys’ thing,” he continues. “It breaks down those stereotypes of girls taking part in the sport.” Khan likes to think of the skateboard as “another limb” that you hand trust over to. “You have to be really brave, it is not something I could do,” he admits. “It’s a sport but there’s also an artistic element to it. It gives people the space to express their individuality and represent themselves.”Certainly, this is true of Fatima and Salima in Sisters 360.When I see it during its run at Wimbledon’s Polka theatre, I’m struck by how different it feels to other plays for children I’ve seen; I don’t think I’ve seen another where young Muslim girls and their everyday experiences are so central. Khan agrees that it is still rare to find Muslim stories on the British stage. “I’ve had people comment that this is a very ‘unusual’ play and I think that’s a strange way to frame it,” he says. “It’s true we don’t often see Muslim girls on the stage, but there’s nothing unusual about it.”View image in fullscreenSkate expectations … Sisters 360.Photograph: Polka TheatreKhan is also keen that people see the play is about much more than a Muslim story: “This play is just about two 10-year-old British girls who have a dream and want to achieve it; the Muslim part is not really the important bit,” he says. Particularly at the moment, whenIslamophobia is at a record highin the UK, Khan thinks it is more important than ever for his community to be represented accurately. “I think the whole Muslim community feels very isolated … I feel like we’re always the villains.“It is tiresome and very, very hard to be a Muslim person in the UK right now,” he continues. But writing Sisters 360brought him“a bit of joy”.Theatre, he believes, has a unique power to tell stories; “it is a really powerful medium”. Khan fell in love with drama during his childhood in Bradford. He was 15 when he knocked on the door of Theatre in the Mill on the University of Bradford’s campus and met its then artistic director, Andrew Loretto, for the first time. “Everything I know is from there,” Khan explains. “Once I got involved I learned more and more doors opened.” He later went on to get a place at Rada.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

People normally have a misconception about it but it is a beautiful, friendly place.” Every time he begins writing a new script, Khan imagines his characters as being from Bradford, or at least having some connection to the city. “It’s the place I know best, I know the people really well.”Bradford is UK City of Culture in 2025, but Khan still thinks that his community are not traditionally a theatre-going audience. “It’s one of the things I want to change,” he says. “When people think about theatre, they think white, middle-class people watching Shakespeare … once they see two 10-year-olds from Bradford, wearing hijabs, that might change.”Young people are the start of forming this new pattern. “If they enjoy coming, they’ll come back,” says Khan. “They should have the question in their head: shall we go to the cinema or should we go to the theatre?” Things are starting to change, but slowly, and Khan still thinks theatres are afraid of taking risks when it comes to programming work about Islam. “[They’d rather] find safer stories which no one will find controversial in any way.”As a writer, he sometimes feels the burden of trying to represent everyone, he admits. But, ultimately, Khan wants Muslims to be reflected in all their complexity and variety. “I want to be able to write about my community honestly and truthfully, the good and the bad sides,” he says. “I want to challenge them as well.” And Sisters 360 is only the beginning: “My head is bursting with ideas, I just want to put them on the stage.”Sisters 360is at Leeds Playhouse, 7 to 10 May.Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreinterviewsShareReuse this content"

These voters were NOT watching black films?”Anonymous Oscar voters have previously admitted to not watching all the contenders in a category before voting in the final round.“I’m bummed because I haven’t seen The Substance or I’m Still Here yet,” one toldEntertainment Weeklyahead of the most recent ceremony. “The first Dune, I couldn’t get through; I’m not rushing for another three hours of Dune. There’s still time to re-evaluate, but I really struggled.”In this event, voters are expected to abstain in that category, however there is no enforcement for this, and category error and ignorance can persist.Other leaked ballots earlier this year suggested a widespread misapprehension among voters that Conclave’s Ralph Fiennes had already won an Oscar in 1994 for Schindler’s List. In fact he has never won, and this year lost out to Adrien Brody for The Brutalist.Other changes to the awards included an update to the international feature film category, to include “film-makers with refugee or asylum status”, and the clarification that the use of generative AI in a film would “neither help nor harm” their submission.Two of this year’s key nominees – The Brutalist and Emilia Pérez – were involved in minor controversies over their use of AI to enhance the voices of their leading actors.View image in fullscreenOlivia Colman in Tyrannosaur.Photograph: Album/AlamyMonday’s statement also provided further details on how the inaugural casting prize will be decided – the equivalent award was first introduced at theBaftasin 2020.Compulsory viewing was enforced by the British Academy as part of its radical overhaul of rules and regulations that same year, in response to the #BaftasSoWhite controversy.Stringent regulations are in force to ensure not only that voters view all the films in the categories for which they cast their ballot, but also that they watch 15 randomised movies participating in the first stage of voting. As with the strict gender quotas in force on the director longlist, and the inclusivity criteria necessary for inclusion in a number of key categories such as outstanding British film, this measure is to try to promote a more diverse spread of contenders.Speaking to theGuardian in 2018, ahead of her Oscar win for The Favourite,Olivia Colmansaid that she would always abstain from voting should she not have seen all films in consideration.The alternative, she said, “feels so naughty. I think maybe I’m just really square”. Colman went on to attribute her response to the fate of Paddy Considine’s 2011 filmTyrannosaur, in which she starred, and which was ignored by Bafta in its best film nominations: “Very few people watched it and it broke my heart a bit.”Preliminary voting for next year’sOscarsbegins in December, with the nominations announcement on 22 January ahead of the 15 March ceremony – an unusually long campaigning period. This year’s emcee, Conan O’Brien, will return as host.Explore more on these topicsOscarsAwards and prizesBaftasnewsShareReuse this content"

ForEmilyn Claid, that’s meant the leap from ballet dancer in Toronto to the squats of grungy 1969 New York (via Martha Graham’s garden), to pioneering the New Dance scene in 1970s London, to artistic director, academic and psychotherapist (not to mention mother, grandmother), and then in her eighth decade, full circle to being a performer again.It was after realising “I was leaving three-quarters of myself out” that Claid made 2022’s comeback solo showUntitled, appearing strong, sensual, funny and provocative, dressed in leather vest and a fur cloak. She put the work in to get back on stage at 72 (“A lot of press-ups and sit-ups”) but at the same time, she says, it was absolutely natural, like coming home. “Not being at home like a comfortable sofa,” she clarifies. “The excitement of knowing a whole world that’s familiar to me and yet is always constantly changing.”The dance world has changed plenty in the six decades that Claid has been working. When she stopped performing in the late 90s, “it was hard as a woman, as a lesbian, to make lesbian work”. Now Claid is being embraced by a new generation of queer artists. I visit an east London studio to find her rehearsing a “young and feisty” group of performers (Azara Meghie,Eve Stainton, Adrienne Ming, Orrow Bell and co-directorMartin O’Brien) for her new “live art ballet” The Trembling Forest. Claid is rangy and stylish, with cropped grey hair under a black cap. The group collaboratively work out a scene, veering from giggles to solemnity and back again. Later in the week, they’ll be joined by a bigger cast who are all going to be on stage covered in clay. We’ll come back to that.It’s a long journey from Claid’s suburban childhood in Wimbledon. She wasn’t very good at ballet, she insists, yet she was good enough to be accepted into the NationalBalletof Canada after joining their Toronto school at 16. But she was too tall, always in the background, never going to get further. “It’s a tricky one, ballet, because you get so addicted and so stuck into this [quest for] perfection and getting it right,” she says. “When you fail at it – when I failed at it – the shame is terrible. It takes years to get over that. But then when you get over you think, Oh thank God! It’s incredibly stifling. And for women’s bodies, unless you’re born that way, I think it’s very difficult.”View image in fullscreen‘Where did you feel most energised?’ … Emilyn Claid.Photograph: Henri TShe left for New York in 1969 with the aim of going to the Martha Graham school, turned up with no cash and her English accent, and offered to look after Graham’s garden in exchange for classes. “They thought, she’s English, she’s bound to know about gardens.” The planting of daffodils aside, this was scuzzy New York. “It was sex, drugs, dance, risky, wonderful,” says Claid. It was an introduction to many different worlds, discovering the gay scene and basement clubs with “naked men all dancing on LSD or whatever”. She was squatting in the East Village, or living in the apartment of any artist friend who was away. The kind of apartments with a bathtub in the kitchen and you’d put a table on top to eat dinner. “Tiny rooms with beaded curtains and cockroaches everywhere.” She was still a teenager. “But I always felt safe there.”Claid worked with dancers from the Graham company. Nobody had any money but they all seemed to get by. “There were a lot of patrons, I did a lot of modelling for artists.” She got into some dangerous situations, she admits – “I guess it’s a sort of fancy kind of prostitution really, isn’t it?” – but says, “I was tough.” At one point her parents sent someone over to New York to find her. They did, living in a squat behind a house in the East Village. “Not a great situation,” she admits. “My parents must have been freaked out, but there was nothing they could do. I’d left home at 16, I was totally independent.”By the time she came back to London a couple of years later, “I was pretty wrecked”, and suffering from osteoarthritis in her big toe joint. She’d been in pain since she was 11, but kept it hidden. She gave up dance and briefly became a secretary, but the call was too strong. Then Claid metJacky Lansley, Fergus Early and Maedée Duprès, who together founded the X6 Collective and the New Dance movement. There was a real sense of change, of undoing hierarchies, ripping up the rules, smashing ballet’s stranglehold, putting politics at the forefront (their 1977 work Bleeding Fairies blasted the image of the ethereal ballerina and other tropes). They found a home at Butler’s Wharf on the South Bank of the Thames, part of a wider experimental arts scene including Derek Jarman,sculptor Andrew Logan(who foundedAlternative Miss World) and theLondon Musicians Collective. They’d put on performances and festivals, all very DIY, no toilet in the building (“you had to go down to the river”), big warehouse doors open on the sixth floor with a sheer drop on the other side. People came and it was buzzing, but again there wasn’t any money. Most people were squatting and on the dole – that’s what was funding young artists then.What did Claid’s work look like? “I was so angry!” Her whole face breaks into a brilliantly appealing grin and silent laughter stops her talking for a moment. “Big, clumsy feminists doing angry work! It was very autobiographical. I had eating disorders, there’s all sorts of things we were dealing with.” She would speak to the audience, she would dance, “image making” is the term she uses, which could equally describe the work she’s making now.Some of the group went to perform in Lyon, “And I can remember the audience chucking food at us, telling us to get off. Lots of the work was radically, collaboratively devised. Collage rather than narrative. And of course that was not popular with audiences at the time.” As artistic director of Extemporary DanceTheatrefrom 1981 to 1990 she pushed radical work, but always tried to be entertaining, too. (Unlike, she says, the very abstract London Contemporary Dance Theatre who “put audiences off totally”.) Abandoning clear meaning and narrative is still fairly radical, I say. “I don’t ever want to give up on narrative,” she responds. “I just don’t want there to be only one narrative.” As a queer artist, Claid says she particularly embraces the idea of meaning not being fixed, singular or binary. Queerness, she says “is much more now about a movement rather than an identity; a constant process of unfixing normativity”.View image in fullscreen‘What we do with our bodies impacts on our minds’ … Emilyn Claid.Photograph: Chris NashShe’s calling The Trembling Forest a “live art ballet” because like live art “the body’s creating the material in the moment of the performance” based on tasks or a score she gives the collaborators. But “ballet” because there is a frame and structure, six scenes. The clay-covered bodies will be the forest (Claid might be one of these, she hasn’t decided yet), and they’re in what she calls “long time,” death, essentially, so-named because “we’re going to be dead for a lot longer than we’re alive”. And into the forest come the living, a “motley crew of messy, scribbly, scrabbly bodies”. They know they’re heading towards “long time” and these are their last rituals. “There’s the meta-narrative of hope and desolation, living and dying,” says Claid. Will the audience be able to read that? “I don’t mind if they do or they don’t. It’s great if people see different things.”In recent years Claid trained as a Gestalt psychotherapist and that’s influenced her choreography. The philosophy behind Gestalt is relational, we exist only in relation to each other. Claid talks about the narcissism of being a performer. “It’s all about, ‘How wonderful can I be for the audience?’” Now she’s more interested in “What am I going to share with the audience? What can we make together?” When she watches her dancers improvise, instead of thinking, “Which bits do I like?” She asks them: “Where did you feel most energised?” The result for us, the audience, she says, is that we see “something that is alive”.In 2021, Claid combined her work in dance and psychotherapy in the book Falling ThroughDanceand Life, on surrendering to gravity, and in a more existential sense, accepting the void we’re all on our way to. She does physical work with her therapy clients, and sees unequivocally the changes in their lives and relationships as a result. “What we do with our bodies impacts on our minds.”Career-wise, she’s faced the (metaphorical) fear of falling flat on her face. “I take it right back to ballet, the shame of failing”, Claid says, “and then recognising how that is actually a creative source rather than a dead-end.” She couldn’t – and wouldn’t want to – define what success means any more. In whose eyes? She quotes from a memorable decades-old review: “Emilyn Claid gets Dance Umbrella [festival] off to a bad start!” and breaks into another grinning laugh. Audiences weren’t ready for her then. Will they be ready now?The Trembling Forest is at Copeland Gallery, London, aspart of Ceremony festival, 23-24 April, and at Tramway, Glasgow, 10 May, as part ofDance International GlasgowExplore more on these topicsStageDanceTheatreBalletPerformance artinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, can it really achieve the impossible … and make us root for the killer?Stuart HeritageTue 22 Apr 2025 06.12 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 06.14 EDTShareThis article contains spoilers for theThe Last of Usseason two. Please do not read unless you have seen the first two episodes.When is a twist not a twist? This is a question many people will be asking after this week’s brutal episode ofThe Last of Us. Titled Through the Valley, it demonstrated more clearly than ever that the show has two types of viewer: those who primarily know it as a television series and were stunned beyond belief by the violent, unheralded death of Pedro Pascal’s Joel at the hands of Kaitlyn Dever’s vengeful Abby; and those who have played the video game on which it is based.The Last of Us recap: season two, episode two – will this show survive that horrific death?Read moreThe very first scene in last week’s episode appeared to set up Abby’s tracking of him as a long arc, perhaps one spanning the entire season. This would make sense; after all if you have Pedro Pascal at your disposal, you want to get as much out of him as possible. But in the end it was a deliberate red herring, and now Joel is dead. More importantly, the star of the show – the man whose face is still on hundreds of Last of Us billboards around the world – is no longer on the show. Judging by the shocked reaction online (“Players knew this WHOLE TIME that Joel was gonna die and didn’t warn me?!?”), Joel’s death came as roughlyThe Red Weddingtimes a million.But, of course, many of us saw it coming. The second season of The Last of Us is based on the 2020 game The Last of Us Part II and, well, this exact thing happens in that too. Nor was it a closely guarded secret. The Last of Us Part II has sold more than 10m copies. It has won almost 50 awards. And, thanks to a hacking incident just before release, Joel’s death was announced to the world before anyone had even played it.View image in fullscreenDon’t say you weren’t warned … Pedro Pascal as Joel in The Last of Us.Photograph: HBOAs such, Joel’s death has been an open secret for many years now. In 2023, Pascal all but revealed that his days were numbered to Esquire,pointing out that“it wouldn’t make sense to follow the first game so faithfully only to stray severely from the path”. Don’t say he didn’t warn you.If you saw the climax to the first season, you will have known that this was probably on the cards. The story exists in a world where the human population has been laid waste by a fungus. Joel took charge of a young woman named Ellie, who revealed that she was somehow immune to the Cordyceps infection. Upon realising this, a group of strangers kidnapped Ellie, planning to use her to create a vaccine in an operation that would kill her. But Joel wouldn’t let this happen, going on a murderous rampage through a hospital to save her, even if it doomed the world.It was an act of love, but a selfish one that couldn’t go unpunished. A season of television where Joel and Ellie kept having adventures in the shadow of such violence would have been awkward and ungainly. And this is a story where violence begets violence. The Fireflies tried to kill Ellie, so Joel killed the Fireflies, and now the daughter of one of the dead has killed Joel. So it goes.View image in fullscreenViolence begets violence … Kaitlyn Dever as Abby in The Last of Us.Photograph: HBOThe question of which of Joel’s deaths is the worst is up for debate. With the TV series, the fact that so many people knew this was coming meant that it could build a sense of dread far more deliberately than the game did, making more of the missed connections between Joel and Ellie and filling the preceding scenes of violence with more resigned inevitability. On the other hand, the game has you briefly play as Ellie, racing to save Joel. When that ends in disappointment and Joel dies anyway, there’s a palpable sense of agency being ripped from you that can’t be replicated in something as passive as a television programme.‘When medieval times return, I’ll be ready’: Bella Ramsey on friendship, fashion and The Last of UsRead moreWhich brings me to one last spoiler for the non-players. The Last of Us is about to pull off its most audacious trick yet: making you root for Abby. It may be worth pointing out that The Last of Us Part II only semi-successfully achieved this – few games have received such a loud backlash from such a furious minority – so it will be interesting to see how the show chooses to do this. If The Last of Us can move on from Joel’s death and take the audience with it, it deserves to go down as a masterpiece.Explore more on these topicsThe Last of UsTelevisionPedro PascalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The director and three other people present were later arrested.A spokesperson for the Imo State Police Command, Henry Okoye, confirmed the incident and said an investigation into the cause of the deaths had begun. “The command is aware of the unfortunate incident of unnatural death,” he said. “I can confirm that two people were pronounced dead while two were hospitalised.”In his Instagram post, Rollas credited God with the death toll in Owerri not being four – the same number, he said, as “last year in Asaba”.He continued by saying that he had organised a prayer programme before concluding with a caution to those who might sign up to work on productions without union representation.“This is a bad trend. These people camp themselves in an unhealthy, unverified environment making content,” wrote Rollas. “Content creators have to be licensed.RIP 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭”Rollas has served as AGN president since 2017. In a 2019 speech, he said his organisation had more than two million registered members across 36 states and is the largest actors’ association inAfrica.Explore more on these topicsFilmNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I cannot wait to bring this story to a magical conclusion.”The most recent season broadcast in 2024 and ended with the main characters having sex for the first time. A synopsis for the film suggests that the couple are concerned about whether they can sustain a long-distance relationship once Nick goes to university.Since its debut three years ago, Heartstopper has won considerable acclaim for its sensitive, light touch and teenage-friendly depiction of LGBTQ relationships. The first season was a runaway hit, appearing in Netflix’s Top 10 chart within two days of launch.Although unusual, the conclusion of a long-running series as a feature film is not unprecedented. In 2017, Netflix wrapped up the Wachowskis’ sci-fi drama Sense8with a film, after cancelling the show after its second season cliffhanger, to the annoyance of fans.Timeless, CSI and Deadwood also finished as films, while Steven Knight’s Peaky Blinders movie is due on Netflix later this year. HBO pioneered the format with two Sex and the City movies purporting to bring the long-running series to an end after six seasons.But after a hiatus of 11 years, the majority of original characters returned for a spin-off show, And Just Like That.Explore more on these topicsFilmKit ConnorAlice OsemanNetflixComics and graphic novelsnewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve knownDonald Trumpfor a long time. My job is not to please the president of the United States. My job is to try and tell the truth when I can and when I have the opportunity. I am well aware of the idea that people will not like that.”He continued: “People will criticise that. Elon Musk has weighed in [about me]. That is their right. It’s my right to say the other side.”Trump’s attacks on Clooney renewed last summer, after the latter’s op-ed piece in the New York Times urging Joe Biden to step down for re-election. The actor wrote that Biden could continue with his work furthering democracy by allowing an alternative, younger Democratic candidate to run, who might stand a greater chance of beating Donald Trump.“So now fake movie actor George Clooney, who never came close to making a great movie, is getting into the act,” posted Trump. “He’s turned on Crooked Joe like the rats they both are.”‘I must say, mein Führer, I’m so thankful I came’: Larry David spoofs Bill Maher’s fawning White House visit with TrumpRead moreSpeaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper last week, Clooney said he felt it was his “civic duty” to champion an alternative nominee.“I don’t know if it was brave,” Clooney said. “It was a civic duty. When I saw people on my side of the street not telling the truth, I thought that was time to.”Reflecting on the backlash to his article, Clooney said: “The idea of freedom of speech is you can’t demand freedom of speech and then say, ‘But don’t say bad things about me.’”He continued: “That’s the deal, you have to take your stand if you believe in it. Take a stand for it and then deal with the consequences.”“I have to take that, that’s fair,” he concluded. “I’m OK with that, I’m OK with criticism for where I stand. I defend their right to criticise me as much as I defend my right to criticise them.”Clooney is currently starring onBroadway in a stage versionof his 2005 film Good Night, and Good Luck, about the conflict between veteran journalist Edward R Murrow and Senator Joseph McCarthy, who alleged that spies and Soviet sympathisers had infiltrated numerous US institutions, in particular the government, universities and the film and TV industry.Explore more on these topicsGeorge ClooneyDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But he agrees to dine with the Führer because he “concluded that hate gets us nowhere. I knew I couldn’t change his views, but we need to talk to the other side”.The dinner proves an eye-opening success, with the author much tickled by Hitler’s jokes, struck by his warmth and humanity and impressed by his skills as an agony uncle. As he leaves, he tells Hitler he’s pleased he came. “‘Although we disagree on many issues, it doesn’t mean that we have to hate each other.’ And with that, I gave him a Nazi salute and walked out into the night.”The late-night pundit Bill Maher had dinner with the president on 31 March, and many predicted it would have been a combative meeting. Both men have been frank about this dislike of each other, with Trump calling Maher a “lowlife” and his show “dead”.But on the 11 April episode of his show, Real Time, Maher described the president as “gracious” and “much more self-aware than he lets on”.“Everything I’ve ever not liked about him was – I swear to God – absent, at least on this night with this guy,” said Maher. “He mostly steered the conversation to, ‘What do you think about this?’ I know: your mind is blown. So is mine.”He added: “A crazy person doesn’t live in the White House. A person who plays a crazy person on TV a lot lives there, which I know is fucked up. It’s just not as fucked up as I thought it was.”In his essay, David closely mirrors Maher’s tone, saying that one of his own jokes “amused him to no end, and I realised I’d never seen him laugh before. Suddenly he seemed so human. Here I was, prepared to meet Hitler, the one I’d seen and heard – the public Hitler. But this private Hitler was a completely different animal. And oddly enough, this one seemed more authentic, like this was the real Hitler. The whole thing had my head spinning.”He details a joke Hitler makes about his dog having diarrhoea, as well as an even more amusing follow-up: “Then a beaming Hitler said, ‘Hey, if I can kill Jews, Gypsies and homosexuals, I can certainly kill a dog!” That perhaps got the biggest laugh of the night – and believe me, there were plenty.“But it wasn’t just a one-way street, with the Führer dominating the conversation. He was quite inquisitive and asked me a lot of questions about myself.”David’s essay was accompanied by an article by New York Times deputy opinion editor Patrick Healy, who confirmed the origins of the spoof.“Larry listened to Bill Maher talk about his recent dinner with Trump,” Healy wrote. “Bill, a comedian Larry respects, said in a monologue on his Max show that he found the president to be ‘gracious and measured’ compared with the man who attacks him on Truth Social. Larry’s piece is not equating Trump with Hitler. It is about seeing people for who they really are and not losing sight of that.”David has previously written several spoof articles concerning Trump for the New York Times, including anaccountof his meeting with Russian agents in June 2016, and a 3amconversationbetween Trump and his wife, Melania, about the future of Ukraine.David has also made multiple guest appearances on Saturday Night Live as the independent senator and one-time presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, to whom it emerged he was distantly related.This article was amended on 22 April 2025. Bernie Sanders is an independent senator, not Democratic as an earlier version stated.Explore more on these topicsLarry DavidDonald TrumpNew York TimesAdolf HitlerNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesUS press and publishingnewsShareReuse this content"

But this Francophone drama just goes to prove that, given enough moody lamplit street scenes, well-designed stunts and chase sequences and a bit of imagination, any city will work. It’s even more impressive a feat in that it is co-writer-director Michiel Blanchart’s first feature, and yet it feels confident, inventive and as grippy as duct tape throughout.The protagonist is Mady Bala (Jonathan Feltre, displaying impressive subtlety and physical prowess), a young, independent locksmith who stays up all night on call in case he’s summoned to help a customer break into their own home. In order to ensure he’s not being used to commit a crime, Mady usually asks to see a callout client’s ID, or at least get paid 250 euros in advance. On the night this all takes place, he lets these precautions slide for Claire (Natacha Krief), a pretty girl who shares his taste for an old chanson he hums while working, who says her money and her wallet are inside the flat. Of course, that’s a big mistake and soon Mady is ensnared by a gang hunting down a stolen fortune, one led by icily efficient boss Yannick (Romain Duris), assisted by thugs Remy (Thomas Mustin) and Theo (Jonas Bloquet). The latter turns out to have just a smidge more humanity, or at least a weak spot, that gives Mady a chance to survive.Blanchart has mentioned Michael Mann’s Collateral as an influence, and that’s certainly evident, especially in the way the plot turns on a schlubby ordinary guy discovering the capacity within himself to fight back. He even finds the chutzpah to do a little betraying of his own when required, which adds a certain realism. Blanchart keeps the beat steady with a tight rhythm of tension and release, interspersing talky tense bits with bravura action, like a bike ride down the steps of an underground station. It’s all heady enough to keep you distracted from thinking about how this could have all been prevented all this from happening if someone had just paid Mady his 250 euros right at the start.Night Call is on digital platforms from 28 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCrime filmsBelgiumRomain DurisEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s set inManchesterand tells the story of a heroin user fresh out of prison and struggling to sort himself out. That might sound like a pretty standard beginning for gritty British social-realism, but with maturity and what looks like solid research, Evans turns his film into an examination of mental health issues. It’s not for the faint-hearted though, with some scenes in which people hurt other people very realistically.Ex-Emmerdale actor Joe Gill plays Danny, who is released from prison into supported living after a short stretch for theft. Danny starts using again immediately, and he says in voiceover that he takes heroin to feel normal; it manages his OCD and intrusive thoughts (“I feel fucked up for even thinking them”). We are shown the intrusive thoughts that pop into his head: sitting opposite the manager of his supported housing, out of nowhere Danny pictures himself punching her repeatedly in the face. It’s brutal, and there are more scenes like this – realistic-looking and photographed with cold intensity by cinematographer Sam Cronin. I watched it clenched and tense – which is presumably the point, to show what it feels like to live like Danny, uncomfortably alert with adrenaline.Gill gives a very good performance, his eyes telling the story of Danny’s shame and humiliation. One night, on his way to meet his dealer, Danny bumps into Laura (Becky Bowe), a mate from school, now pregnant and a sex worker pimped out by her controlling boyfriend. Smile-on-her-face cheerful, Laura is the least interesting character here; whatever she is thinking about her situation, we don’t get to know about it. It’s a shame, particularly in a film with an otherwise unwavering stare. This really is a tough watch.Treading Water is in UK cinemas from 25 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsManchesterDrugsMental healthHealthGreater ManchesterreviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet Karen Solie’s wildly unpredictable collectionWellwaterflips the script. In this blazingly honest catalogue of human-made hazard and harm, we celebrate instead the contemporary landscapes refusing to be tamed.Solie, who teaches at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, in western Canada, where vast prairies supply much of the world’s pulse crops. This fertile expanse inWellwater, however, seems tired of endless service. The poem Red Spring witnesses how “weeds jump up unbidden, each year a little smarter”. They are trying, almost courageously, to outwit what Solie condemns as “zombie technology”, whose genetically modified “terminator seeds” sprout terrifying plants that are “more dead than alive”.Any last echo of picturesque expectations splinters with post-industrial horrorThere is some flicker of peace in less apocalyptic pastoral scenes, as when the “white-tailed fawns sleep inside wild chokecherry/in hollowed-out rooms” and drought-soothing rain falls like confetti from “the mansions of the skies”. But for much of this poetry, as in Pines, the landscape writhes “in distress”. The pages reek of fungicide and glyphosate, a weedkiller that is linked poignantly by the poet to a case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma: “ask the crew boss who cleared the nozzle of my sprayer/by blowing through it,” Solie insists, “they can’t go back.”This shocking correlation, examined squarely,inspires a refreshing honesty as the poet acknowledges her own flaws: “I don’t know how to make this beautiful”, she confesses. “Can we go back? Meet each other in the old knowledge?” If only we could, is the tragically bitter aftertaste of these poems – a sweet life on the prairie with braids, bonnets and beauty could not be more distant if Solie tried.In Bad Landscape and the trembling aftershock of fracking and radiation, each word hangs thrillingly from a “low hum of menace”. Any last echo of picturesque expectations splinters with the post-industrial horror – it spills out with the oil and the sea’s treasure chest of toxic waste.It’s not just “bad landscapes” that burst violently into view. Solie also eats “bad sandwiches” in bad flats. The worst of these hellish boltholes are the “windowless and the bug-ridden”, which are spectacularly reimagined in Toronto the Good as “tiny museums of illegality”. It is here where the real gem ofWellwatersparkles into sight, reinforcing a striking foundational premise: we are all bad landlords of the planet we call home. Or rather, collectively, we are instead bad tenants, as her condemnation of “greed and neglect” encourages us to more humbly concede.In Basement Suite the image of childhood as a room with barred windows is fascinating, as are the doors between dimensions that creak open in Antelope. Occasionally, you wish Solie would linger a moment longer, lifting the latch to fully let us in. Some ideas remain tantalisingly locked, but her flourishing imagination in The Trees in Riverdale Park stuns – our vegetal cousins somehow “thrive like understandings”. So while some of these gems feel uncut, their intended meanings left unresolved, the raw candour of her reflections leaves us captivated nonetheless.There is surprising depth, too – profound observations in Orion explain how the “dead can be kinder/than the living,/if you are not related to them”, and in The Bluebird how “Good and bad don’t always line up opposite”. What does line up clearly, however, is the conceit and the content, framingWellwaterin the image of its intriguing namesake – dark and deep, rippling secrets and surprise.Wellwaterby Karen Solie is published by Picador (£12.99).

There are twists in the style of David Cronenberg and Walerian Borowczyk, with (maybe inevitably) echoes of Carrie and Alien. In one scene, there could even be a nod to Picnic at Hanging Rock.Cynical widow Rebekka (Ane Dahl Torp) remarries a well-heeled widower somewhere in 18th-century central Europe; he then makes her a widow for the second time by fatally gorging on cake at the wedding breakfast. As a result, Rebekka is left financially embarrassed with her plain daughter Elvira (Lea Myren), Elvira’s kid sister Alma (Flo Fagerli) and a new stepdaughter Agnes (Thea Sofie Loch Naess), a beautiful young woman who haughtily resents the ugly Elvira. Instead of paying for a funeral for her late husband, Rebekka lets his body rot somewhere in the house while spending money on bizarre cosmetic treatments for Elvira – brutal nose- and eyelash-remodelling – in the hope that Prince Julian (Isac Calmroth) will choose her for his bride at his forthcoming ball. But Elvira rashly swallows a tapeworm to allow her to indulge a passion for cakes (Ozempic not being available in those days) and calamity approaches.Amusingly, Blichfeldt upends expectations about which of the two female leads truly is the cruel and vain stepsister, and which therefore has the authentic inner beauty. As with the original version, there is a plot hole with regard to the trying-on-the-slipper scene: surely the Prince can see from faces who is, and is not, his true love. Or … maybe it isn’t a plot hole? Perhaps the body-appendage fetishism taking precedence over facial recognition is the point. This is a movie hyper-aware of the sexual and patriarchal imagery of Cinderella, a film in the post-feminist tradition of Angela Carter and, unlike Michael Pataki’s lowbrow 1977 porn-musical version, it avoids the obvious sexual symbolism of the foot in the slipper. Blichfeldt has made an elegant debut.The Ugly Stepsister is in US cinemas now, and UK and Irish cinemas from 25 AprilExplore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsRomance filmsPeriod and historical filmsNorwayFilm adaptationsEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Orphaned in a plane crash (yes, eagles use planes), young Goldbeak is from a prominent political family and, naturally enough, he comes to realise he doesn’t exactly fit in with the hens and roosters with whom he is living. Notably, chickens are not known for their prowess at flying, and so he finds his literal wings metaphorically clipped, though he is desperate to soar above his contemporaries.Thematically, this is vaguely reminiscent of 1970s publishing hit Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a short allegorical fable about a frustrated gull who refuses to accept the limitations of his community and yearns to go beyond the limits of what seems possible. Here, though, Goldbeak’s exceptionalism is firmly rooted in biology, so maybe he’s more like a kind of avian Superman. This is not a story that really bears much close analysis, with a cast made up of a hodgepodge of character types you’ve seen in family animations a million times before.Indeed, Goldbeak is an object lesson in how much the actual animation matters in these films. You can get away with stock characters and a plot we’ve seen before if the animation is charming and unique. However, there is something draining about cheap, by-the-numbers animation that feels especially unlovely – particularly compared with low-budget live-action films whose lack of money often contributes to the charm. Goldbeak will probably keep the kids amused, or at least distracted, for the length of time it’s on screen but, honestly, there’s a whole world of films out there – Wallace & Gromit! The Wizard of Oz! Jason and the Argonauts! – so there’s really no need to resort to this kind of thing in the name of killing time.Goldbeak is in UK and Irish cinemas from 25 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFamily filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

He learns how he is related to Polish pianist Władysław Szpilman (portrayed by Adrien Brody in The Pianist) and later makes his way to the Getty museum in LA, where an art discovery moves him to tears.HROur Welsh Chapel Dream8pm, Channel 4A big renovation often means making sacrifices, but potter Keith Brymer Jones and his partner Marj Hogarth are understandably fed up with sleeping in a shipping container. Thankfully, their ongoing conversion of a careworn 19th-century chapel has reached the stage where the vestry can be transformed into a very boho master bedroom.Graeme VirtueJules and Greg’s Wild Swim8.30pm, BBC TwoJulie Wilson Nimmo and Greg Hemphill head to the River Tay to meet Sally, who explains how swimming has helped her cope with grief. Elsewhere, the all-male, primarily LGBTQ+ swimming group the Dundee Dookers bond over mental health struggles.

A mouthwatering trip to Vigo, Spain’s seafood capitalThe Galician city on the Atlantic coast has the EU’s largest fishing port, which provides its many bars and restaurants with a spectacular trawl of oysters, clams and musselsFiona DunlopTue 22 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 22 Apr 2025 02.01 EDTShareRocks thrashed by Atlantic waves have famously bestowed names such as “end of the world” and “coast of death” on Galicia, Spain’s north-western region. But there is a calmer, more intimate side to this coastline, that of the manyrias(inlets). Legend has it that they resulted from the imprint of God’s hand when he made the world, and, temptingly, they nurture superlative shellfish. This lures me to Vigo, the largest fishing port in the EU, which spills down a hillside into a sheltered estuary lined with marinas, industrial docks, jetties, a fishing port and a cruise terminal.The magic formula is the combination of fresh river water and salty seawater, which creates a nutrient-rich paradise for succulent crustaceans and cephalopods. I soon learn, too, thatViguesesare joined at the hip to the sea – and have been for centuries. Passion forel marrules: “We are all men of the sea,” as one local tells me, and trawler-loads of ocean fish join shellfish on the plates of Vigo’s many taverns, tapas bars and restaurants.Vigo mapAs I stroll along the quay, I suddenly meet a lifesize statue of a bearded man incongruously seated on four giant octopus tentacles. If you know Jules Verne’s epic 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, featuring Captain Nemo and his ingenious submarine Nautilus, this might ring a bell. Inspired by tales of Vigo, which he later visited, the author conjured up Nemo’s fictional search for treasure in the sunken galleons of the seabed. Some were possibly scuttled by Francis Drake, who had raided Vigo three centuries earlier. Other pirates and invaders followed, but the prosperous fishing port survived.I set off to investigate the farmed mussels of the estuary. Pablo Mariño, of marine tourism specialistBluscus, is my knowledgable guide, steering me in his traditionalbateeiroboat over the calm, plankton-rich water towards what looks like a wooden shack on stilts. It is one of more than 600bateas(floating rafts) in thisriaalone – part of Galicia’s marine industry that exports worldwide and employs about 15% of Vigo’s population.View image in fullscreenMonument to Jules Verne in the port of Vigo.Photograph: Ricardo Alvarez Garcia/AlamyJorge, the cheerful boss of this raft, explains the magical, complex process of producing top-notch mussels (some of which I later devour): plump, juicy and never more than 48 hours old. Long ropes suspended above and hanging into the water are their nurturing ground from spawn to shell, where they mature in up to 18 months. Despite falling production, Jorge’s enthusiasm sparkles as he shows off a hefty cluster of the inky black shells, though he admits, “My only problem is that I’m allergic to eating them!”Near where we dock, I meet softly spoken Severino Casal, a former fisher who runs trips along the coast in his 1970s wooden boatNuevo Migueliño. “I fell in love with the sea in my teens: fresh air, the landscape, the varieties of fish. But the industry is changing now due to stricter regulations, also overfishing, rising water temperature and pollution in therias. There are so many factors.”The picturesque old town is an endurance test of steps and slopes winding past granite houses, squares and tempting bars and restaurantsIt’s time to sample some of Vigo’s sea creatures, so I head for the famous Calle de las Ostras (oyster street) to indulge in half a dozen succulent molluscs shucked in front of me for €13 (£11). The city was once known for female “shuckers”, but it is now men who monopolise the stands. I sit down at a table in front ofBar Cocedero La Piedra, am served the mandatory glass of chilled albariño, and rapidly consume the slippery bivalves.Uphill from here starts the picturesque Casco Vello, the old town, an endurance test of steps and slopes winding past sober granite houses, little squares and a slew of tempting bars and restaurants. At night, uplighters illuminate the facades, making it even dreamier. This is where to find the appealing old classicTaberna A Pedra, which is usually packed, and order silky grillednavajas(razor clams, €16),berberechos(cockles, €14),almejas(clams) swimming in garlic, chilli and olive oil,chipirones(cuttlefish, €9) and padron peppers. Like everywhere else, the basket of bread is crustily perfect for mopping up juice.View image in fullscreenAt night, the squares of Casco Vello become even more dreamy.Photograph: Roger Cracknell/Classic/AlamyNearby is funkyValdevez, hidden down a tight alley and a darling of Vigo’s football team. It’s spacious, with a great value €15 set lunch menu, creative dishes, top wines and a lineup of vintage radios. Their tenderpulpo a feira(Galician-style octopus) is crowned with smashed potato and paprika, their scallops are perfectly grilled, and you can even sample aged beef tenderloin from the hills. It’s nothing if not eclectic.Suddenly it’s architecturally all change when I arrive at Praza do Porta do Sol, a square at the city’s centre. Here begins the elegant Ensanche district, a relic of the Catalan entrepreneurs who developed Galicia’s profitable canning industry in the late 19th century. Along with factories churning out tins of sardines and mussels, they broughtmodernista(Catalan culture’s equivalent of art nouveau) architecture, often Parisian in style, as well as banks and luxury commerce that lined the avenues. Vigo boomed. This part of town is now the centre of nightlife, shopping and culture, and the place to break away from traditional eateries.Go raw atRestaurante Crudeza,theplace for divine ceviche, with sea bass, scallop, or salmon tartare (€20-€30), and superbly prepared by a Venezuelan team and very affordable. To digest, there is a steep walk up to the El Castro fortress, built in 1665 to fend off English attacks, and now surrounded by beautiful parkland. Sweeping views take in the blissfulIslas Ciés, as well as fishing villages and pristine beaches across the luminous water. The islands, which you need a permit to visit, and villages of Moaña and Cangas, can be reached by ferry or the immense Rande bridge.View image in fullscreenA plate of grilled razor clams is a typical Galician tapa.Photograph: Laura Di Biase/AlamyOff the Gran Via, where I am spirited uphill by moving walkways – a welcome innovation – I seek outEnxebre, a sharply modern restaurant expertly run by a young couple breaking new ground with surreal twists on Galician classics. Their €35 tasting menu is a steal, and you can sit at the kitchen counter to watch the action.Back towards the estuary, I catch my breath on a bench in the Alameda da Praza de Compostela, where gardens of magnolias and tree ferns are rimmed by stately facades. Although most surrounding bars and restaurants are mediocre, an exception lurks around the corner:La Mar Salada. This chic little restaurant is renowned for perfectly baked Atlantic fish (seabream, sea bass), cod in pil pil sauce and creamy rice with red prawns and monkfish.We order jugs of the densest red wine I’ve ever seen to wash down empanadas, croquetas, jamón, tortilla and pork filletPlenty more seafood restaurants lie in wait, but I decide to spend my last evening investigating a unique 300-year-old Galician tradition – afurancho. This takes me into the hilly wine-country of Rías Baixas in the company of Juan Vidal and Lorena Cancelas, two of the founders ofGuía Furanchín, an online guide to dozens of small-scale wineries which open for three months between December and June to offload their surplus. Whether seated convivially in a garden, a garage, a lean-to or in the family living-room, punters come to enjoy young wine together with homemade tapas.We order jugs of both red (the densest I’ve ever seen) and white to wash down empanadas,croquetas,jamón, tortilla and pork fillet – simple but tasty food.View image in fullscreenThe fishing port of Vigo looking out to the Islas Ciés.Photograph: jx1306/Alamy‘It’s very wild. I’ve seen wolves’: a hike through the forests and ghost villages of secret GaliciaRead moreAs I watch the ruddy faces of our dining companions, many still in working clothes and enjoying a cheap night out (our bill came to €12 each and we were sated), I realise that this institution, unique to Galicia, reflects the region’s rural soul, if not exactly the “men of the sea”.For anyone with two or four wheels, or simply two legs, Vigo also offers a seductive range of coastal side trips, from Cambados (the capital of albariño wine), where at low tide shellfishers rake the sand for razor clams, to the nature park of Corrubedo, a birders’ haven where boardwalks vanish into undulating sand dunes. In Corrubedo itself, search out authentic seafood at the very coolBar do Porto, owned by the British architect Sir David Chipperfield and his family. As Galician aficionados for more than 30 years, they prove how this region gets under your skin. Townies can head south to discover charming Baiona with its peninsula fort, now a parador, or north to the architectural treasures, vibrancy and culture of Pontevedra.The world of Vigo is yourostra– or is it mussel?The trip was facilitated by theSpanishtouristofficeandTurismo de Vigo.

But neither sore feet nor swarms of midges would stop the librarian and his scientist wife, Dee Johnson, from reaching their goal: the promise of pastries at theBakehousein the west coast fishing town of Mallaig, a 14-day trek plus two ferry hops away from their home near Montrose.View image in fullscreenDan Warren at the Bakehouse.Photograph: Dee JohnsonThe pair are so-called “bakery pilgrims”, travelling significant distances in the pursuit of a fine loaf or bun. “Some of the time we were pushing through overgrown tracks, and there were lots of bogs,” Warren says of their journey. But their eventual reward was a soft brioche bun, filled with crème pâtissière and finished with crumble and berries.I can relate. The siren call of the honey buns atPopty’r Dref bakeryin Dolgellau, Wales, drew my wife and me from Oxfordshire, nearly four hours away. We tagged on a hike up Mount Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), but it was really just a scenic spot to enjoy our bakery haul.A couple of weeks ago, my family and I also travelled an hour or so to sample the babkas and honey croissants atFarro bakeryin Bristol. Not long before that, it was a rhubarb-cardamom-brioche concoction atPobl bakeryin Talgarth Mill, near Hay-on-Wye. Both were well worth the journey.But it turns out we are amateurs among hardened bakery tourists. Professional cyclist Maddy Nutt often plans long-distance routes around the promise of a croissant or a pain au chocolat. “I’ll go out of my way to get to the best bakeries,” she says, recounting a recent five-hour endurance ride from London to Ramsgate’sStaple Stores. A puncture meant she arrived three minutes before it closed. She spent £3 on a charity shop rucksack and took home what remained of the bakery’s daily output.Long-distance bakery-seekers don’t mind a queue, and there is often a sense of camaraderie, with people who have travelled from far and wide swapping shop recommendations to pass the time. (The chewy almond thumbprint cookies atBriar Bakeryin Ashburton, Devon, are one suggestion.)In the UK, you rarely need to travel far to find a bakery. Greggs has more than 2,600 outlets. Gail’s, the chainassociated with high-street gentrification, now has 170 branches. A pack of two croissants from a Tesco bakery costs £1.75.View image in fullscreenRefreshing the window display at Long Boi’s Bakehouse in Levenshulme, Manchester.But it is the rarer treats that attract the bakery tourists. Usually, these are created by small operations, run by an owner-baker from a single site. Many pride themselves on using sustainable ingredients, such as flour sourced from regenerative farming. The pastries are often an upmarket twist on the classics, as is the case with a kimchi and egg danish atLong Boi’s Bakehousein Levenshulme, Manchester, and a spiral-shaped miso bacon escargot from London’sArôme.Journeying to a far-flung bakery obviously carries a carbon cost, but for many people this kind of travel has replaced other holidays or breaks they would have taken. There are plenty of social media influencers on the hunt for pretty pastries to gorge their feeds, but bakery wanderlust is bigger than that. In Korea, they have a word for the trend: “bbangjisullae” is a portmanteau of “bbang” meaning “bread” and “seongjisullae” meaning “pilgrimage”. Koreans, it seems, are increasingly prepared to travel to try the country’s best bakeries;some take overnight trainsfor fear of missing the morning’s limited supply.On a bright Saturday morning atBath bakery Landrace, pilgrims share the queue with local residents. “They all come for the cinnamon buns,” says manager Charlotte Briggs. At £4 apiece, these fragrant, springy coils have kept a spot on the counter since the shop opened in 2019.View image in fullscreen‘We’ve been out here when it’s -3C’ … Hetty Niblett (left) and Tomos Owens at Landrace, Bath.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianLycra-clad couple Tomos Owens and Hetty Niblett cycled nearly two hours to visit. “I just love croissants,” says Owens. “We’ve been out here in line when it has been -3C in winter.” The pair are trying as many spots as they can from the bookBritain’s Best Bakeries, which was published last year.Mother and daughter Chie and Karin Takita, from Ibaraki in Japan, included Landrace in their UK itinerary after Karin spotted its creations onInstagram. The pair came away with a newfound appreciation for hot cross buns – “So good!” – despite Chie’s previous impressions of “dry” British buns.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

Everyone thought I was mad. To me, it was worth it!” At Landrace, Burgess’s favourite is an Italian-style croissant, with a filling of cream blended with pistachios that are roasted in-house.BakeryTŷ Melin, which means “mill house” in Welsh, is the creation of Angharad Conway and partner Lance Gardner. They have four sites in south Wales, all of which bake their signature “croissant bomb” – a crispy outer filled with chocolate or hazelnut or salted caramel – which has become a social media sensation. “We have been overwhelmed … we have customers willing to travel so far to try our products. It makes the hours and effort that we put in worth it,” says Conway. Their bestseller, however, is their almond croissant; one customer travelled from Scotland to Cardiff just to get their hands on one, says Conway.View image in fullscreenLannan’s cherry tart with pistachio custard.Photograph: Darcie MaherBut there are few bakeries that have drawn more tourists thanLannan in Edinburgh. Since opening in Stockbridge in July 2023, the shop has developed a cult-like following. “People travel from all over the world. It’s mind-blowing for me,” says baker-patron Darcie Maher. “We just had someone who had come all the way from Canada to try the bakery. There was someone from New Zealand last year who booked their trip around coming to Lannan.”Maher cringes at any association with being a “viral bakery”, but she has become something of a star. Many bakery devotees are quick to reel off names of who owns which bakehouse, and where they worked previously.“I feel like I’ve been to Lannan just from seeing it on social media,” says Megan Hermes, who lives in Guildford, Surrey. She has yet to make the trip to Stockbridge, but she is happy to put in the miles for a good pastry. What started as a way for the local government worker to treat herself at the end of a 25km run has become a plan to criss-cross the country, combining bakery visits with weekends away. “I’m not into a beer crawl but I am up for a bakery crawl,” she says. That has sometimes meant queueing for the best part of an hour at sites such asLondon’s Toad bakery, home to a sought-after yuzu-orange jaffa cake.Bakeries can be pricey: at Landrace, the sausage roll will set you back £5. But these treats are obviously far cheaper than a restaurant meal, or some of the other experiences and events that people have tended to travel for in the past.View image in fullscreenScéal’s cardamom honey bun.Photograph: Scéal BakeryMilly Kenny-Ryder, author of Britain’s Best Bakeries, planned a trip to visit Dublin’sScéalwith her husband and child – only to realise after booking flights that it had moved outside the city. The extra train journey didn’t deter her. “It was torrential rain; we all turned up in soggy socks. But it was worth the visit” A long queue doesn’t faze her, either: she waited for more than an hour atEric’s, the London bakery whose recent creations include a lime and mascarpone mousse pastry.In February, Evie Clement from Somerset went to Paris to seek out the best bakeries, planningher trip around where to have breakfast,” she says. Stops includedLand&Monkeys,LeonieandCafé Nuances, where she tried an “amazing” pain suisse. In the UK, Clement has hopped on the bus with her brother, Guy, for the 40-minute journey to have baked goods atBristol’s East Village Cafe.Pastries are often an upmarket twist on the classics: a kimchi and egg danish, a miso bacon escargotFor bakers, renown can bring pressures. When Lannan first opened, says Maher, “we were busier than I expected. I was working 120 hours a week and sleeping on a foam mattress in the basement of the bakery.”Thankfully, Lannan has now grown from two to 10 bakers. There have been rumours that some of the most sought-after bakeries deliberately limit supply, creating an artificial scarcity to push up the hype factor – but this seems absurd to Maher, who has spoken aboutmaxing out the bakery’s oven capacity. Lannan is staffed seven days a week, despite only being open to customers Wednesday to Sunday.A willingness to follow the breadcrumbs far across the map often comes from an appreciation of just how difficult it is to achieve baked nirvana. Many bakery tourists are home cooks who appreciate the chasm between their banana bread and the intricate hazelnut and vanilla poached pear danish from London’sFortitude Bakehouseor the perfectly constructed rosemary and sea salt twists atMabel in Norfolk.Whether it’s on your street or halfway across the country, that moment when you step outside a bakery, open your brown paper bag and sample the goods inside is always a promising start to the day.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If I have forgotten to pick up a loaf, I will often panic-make them for breakfast or packed lunches. While they are great on the side of stews, soups and curries (or on the barbecue, if that’s the way the weather is going), I’ve made them the hero in this elegant but easy brunch/lunch-style setup. You can make one flatbread per person (as instructed), or you could make multiple mini ones that are almost like little herby pancakes.

A pack of two croissants from a Tesco bakery costs £1.75.View image in fullscreenRefreshing the window display at Long Boi’s Bakehouse in Levenshulme, Manchester.But it is the rarer treats that attract the bakery tourists. Usually, these are created by small operations, run by an owner-baker from a single site. Many pride themselves on using sustainable ingredients, such as flour sourced from regenerative farming. The pastries are often an upmarket twist on the classics, as is the case with a kimchi and egg danish atLong Boi’s Bakehousein Levenshulme, Manchester, and a spiral-shaped miso bacon escargot from London’sArôme.Journeying to a far-flung bakery obviously carries a carbon cost, but for many people this kind of travel has replaced other holidays or breaks they would have taken. There are plenty of social media influencers on the hunt for pretty pastries to gorge their feeds, but bakery wanderlust is bigger than that. In Korea, they have a word for the trend: “bbangjisullae” is a portmanteau of “bbang” meaning “bread” and “seongjisullae” meaning “pilgrimage”. Koreans, it seems, are increasingly prepared to travel to try the country’s best bakeries;some take overnight trainsfor fear of missing the morning’s limited supply.On a bright Saturday morning atBath bakery Landrace, pilgrims share the queue with local residents. “They all come for the cinnamon buns,” says manager Charlotte Briggs. At £4 apiece, these fragrant, springy coils have kept a spot on the counter since the shop opened in 2019.View image in fullscreen‘We’ve been out here when it’s -3C’ … Hetty Niblett (left) and Tomos Owens at Landrace, Bath.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianLycra-clad couple Tomos Owens and Hetty Niblett cycled nearly two hours to visit. “I just love croissants,” says Owens. “We’ve been out here in line when it has been -3C in winter.” The pair are trying as many spots as they can from the bookBritain’s Best Bakeries, which was published last year.Mother and daughter Chie and Karin Takita, from Ibaraki in Japan, included Landrace in their UK itinerary after Karin spotted its creations onInstagram. The pair came away with a newfound appreciation for hot cross buns – “So good!” – despite Chie’s previous impressions of “dry” British buns.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

Everyone thought I was mad. To me, it was worth it!” At Landrace, Burgess’s favourite is an Italian-style croissant, with a filling of cream blended with pistachios that are roasted in-house.BakeryTŷ Melin, which means “mill house” in Welsh, is the creation of Angharad Conway and partner Lance Gardner. They have four sites in south Wales, all of which bake their signature “croissant bomb” – a crispy outer filled with chocolate or hazelnut or salted caramel – which has become a social media sensation. “We have been overwhelmed … we have customers willing to travel so far to try our products. It makes the hours and effort that we put in worth it,” says Conway. Their bestseller, however, is their almond croissant; one customer travelled from Scotland to Cardiff just to get their hands on one, says Conway.View image in fullscreenLannan’s cherry tart with pistachio custard.Photograph: Darcie MaherBut there are few bakeries that have drawn more tourists thanLannan in Edinburgh. Since opening in Stockbridge in July 2023, the shop has developed a cult-like following. “People travel from all over the world. It’s mind-blowing for me,” says baker-patron Darcie Maher. “We just had someone who had come all the way from Canada to try the bakery. There was someone from New Zealand last year who booked their trip around coming to Lannan.”Maher cringes at any association with being a “viral bakery”, but she has become something of a star. Many bakery devotees are quick to reel off names of who owns which bakehouse, and where they worked previously.“I feel like I’ve been to Lannan just from seeing it on social media,” says Megan Hermes, who lives in Guildford, Surrey. She has yet to make the trip to Stockbridge, but she is happy to put in the miles for a good pastry. What started as a way for the local government worker to treat herself at the end of a 25km run has become a plan to criss-cross the country, combining bakery visits with weekends away. “I’m not into a beer crawl but I am up for a bakery crawl,” she says. That has sometimes meant queueing for the best part of an hour at sites such asLondon’s Toad bakery, home to a sought-after yuzu-orange jaffa cake.Bakeries can be pricey: at Landrace, the sausage roll will set you back £5. But these treats are obviously far cheaper than a restaurant meal, or some of the other experiences and events that people have tended to travel for in the past.View image in fullscreenScéal’s cardamom honey bun.Photograph: Scéal BakeryMilly Kenny-Ryder, author of Britain’s Best Bakeries, planned a trip to visit Dublin’sScéalwith her husband and child – only to realise after booking flights that it had moved outside the city. The extra train journey didn’t deter her. “It was torrential rain; we all turned up in soggy socks. But it was worth the visit” A long queue doesn’t faze her, either: she waited for more than an hour atEric’s, the London bakery whose recent creations include a lime and mascarpone mousse pastry.In February, Evie Clement from Somerset went to Paris to seek out the best bakeries, planningher trip around where to have breakfast,” she says. Stops includedLand&Monkeys,LeonieandCafé Nuances, where she tried an “amazing” pain suisse. In the UK, Clement has hopped on the bus with her brother, Guy, for the 40-minute journey to have baked goods atBristol’s East Village Cafe.Pastries are often an upmarket twist on the classics: a kimchi and egg danish, a miso bacon escargotFor bakers, renown can bring pressures. When Lannan first opened, says Maher, “we were busier than I expected. I was working 120 hours a week and sleeping on a foam mattress in the basement of the bakery.”Thankfully, Lannan has now grown from two to 10 bakers. There have been rumours that some of the most sought-after bakeries deliberately limit supply, creating an artificial scarcity to push up the hype factor – but this seems absurd to Maher, who has spoken aboutmaxing out the bakery’s oven capacity. Lannan is staffed seven days a week, despite only being open to customers Wednesday to Sunday.A willingness to follow the breadcrumbs far across the map often comes from an appreciation of just how difficult it is to achieve baked nirvana. Many bakery tourists are home cooks who appreciate the chasm between their banana bread and the intricate hazelnut and vanilla poached pear danish from London’sFortitude Bakehouseor the perfectly constructed rosemary and sea salt twists atMabel in Norfolk.Whether it’s on your street or halfway across the country, that moment when you step outside a bakery, open your brown paper bag and sample the goods inside is always a promising start to the day.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
