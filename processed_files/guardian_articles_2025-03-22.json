The first of these was “putting more money in the pockets of ­working people”.But with many Labour MPs already deeply concerned over Reeves’s plan toraise about £5bn by cutting ­benefits, including for disabled ­people, evidence that living standards are on course to fall markedly under a Labour government – and to decline most for the least well off – will add to the mood of growing disquiet in party’s ranks.‘Does it score?’ How the OBR became the key arbiter of the Treasury’s sumsRead moreThe JRF analysis rests on a ­realistic assumption that theOffice for Budget Responsibility(OBR) will adjust its forecasts in line with the Bank of England and other main forecasters when it makes them public on Wednesday. The OBR is expected to halve the expected growth rate for this year from 2% to about 1%.In what it describes as a “dismal reality”, the JRF said its detailed analysis shows that the past year could mark a high point for living standards in this parliament. It concludes that the average family will be £1,400 worse off by 2030, representing a 3% fall in their disposable incomes. The lowest income families will be £900 a year worse off, amounting to a 6% fall in the amount they have to spend.The JRF also said that if living standards have not recovered by 2030, Starmer will not only have failed to pass his No 1 milestone but will also have presided over the first government since 1955 to have seen a fall in living standards across a full parliament.Comparing 2030 with 2025, it said the average mortgage holder is set to pay about £1,400 more in ­mortgage interest annually and the average renter about £300 more in rent a year, while average earnings are set to fall by £700 a year. The JRF said the poorest third are being disproportionately affected by rising housing costs, falling real earnings and frozen tax thresholds.Alfie Stirling, director of insight and policy at JRF, said further cuts were not the way to reverse the trend of falling living standards. Instead, he argued, Reeves should consider raising tax for the wealthiest.“There is no doubt the government is facing an unenviable list of economic pressures and uncertainties, ranging from the domestic to the international. But how you manage these risks is a matter of political choice..“It is wrong, and ultimately counterproductive, to try and rebuild the public finances through cuts to disability benefits. Instead, government should be addressing hardship and raising living standards directly, as part of their strategy for growth.“Fiscal pressures should be met through tax reform. There are a number of options to raise revenue from those with the broadest shoulders, while also supporting growth by removing perverse incentives in the tax system and staying within the government’s manifesto commitments.”Earlier last week a group of leading economists wrote to theFinancial Timeswarning that it would be a “profound mistake” for ministers to cut spending or investment, adding that “the UK cannot cut its way to growth”.Several areas of unprotected government spending such as prisons, justice and local government – the last of which has already seen real terms cuts of over 45% since 2010 – are likely to be in line for further cuts on Wednesday, casting doubt on Starmer’s claim that is not returning the country to austerity.In her budget last October, Reeves left herself with £9.9bn of “fiscal headroom” – in effect, spare money in reserve – to allow her to meet her fiscal rule that says day-to-day spending must be matched by revenue coming into the Treasury.But higher-than-expected borrowing costs on global markets, leading to higher debt interest payments, and lower than expected growth have wiped away that leeway, leaving her needing to find ways to restore the finances through raising money or cutting expenditure or both.Local government leaders are among those most anxiously awaiting Wednesday’s statement, which they fear could reduce what they receive and tip more councils into bankruptcy, leaving them all straining more to fund key services for the most vulnerable such as social care.Councillor Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association, said that “without adequate investment now, we risk not being able to deliver crucial services that so many depend upon and our desire to help government fulfil its ambitions for the future are severely hindered”.With ministers struggling to manage the economy, the latest Opinium poll for theObservershows the damage being done to Labour’s reputation from its economic stewardship after eight months in power.No single party leader is now trusted on the economy, Opinium found. However, Starmer (-32%) and Reeves (-38%) are the most distrusted, with the Reform leader, Nigel Farage, the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, and shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, all rated similarly on -22%, -23% and -24% respectively.While most voters say they do not trust any party on economic issues, the Tories are now marginally more favoured than Labour to run the economy and “improve your financial situation”.View image in fullscreenUK chancellor Rachel Reeves said the country is suffering from a shortage of engineers, bricklayers, carpenters and electricians.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PAMinisters will announce plans on Sunday to spend £600m on 60,000 more construction workers to help build more homes and revive economic growth.Reeves said: “We are determined to get Britain building again, that’s why we are taking on the blockers to build 1.5m new homes and rebuild our roads, rail and energy infrastructure.“But none of this is possible without the engineers, brickies, sparkies, and chippies to actually get the work done, which we are facing a massive shortage of.”“We’ve overhauled the planning system that is holding this country back, now we are gripping the lack of skilled construction workers, delivering on our plan for change to boost jobs and growth for working people.”A Treasury spokesperson said: “Real wages are rising at the highest level in six months, but this government inherited the worst living standards growth since ONS [Office for National Statistics] records began.“We are clear that getting more money in people’s pockets is the No 1 mission in our plan for change. Since the election, there have been three interest rate cuts, we have increased the national living wage by a record amount, the triple lock on pensions means that millions will see their state pension rise by up to £1,900 this parliament and working people’s payslips have been protected from high taxes.”Explore more on these topicsSpring statement 2025The ObserverRachel ReevesKeir StarmerLabourTax and spendingConsumer affairsOffice for Budget ResponsibilitynewsShareReuse this content"

The regulator Ofgem warned it would “not hesitate” to take action if there were any breaches of standards or licence obligations.Heathrow wasshut down on Fridayafter a blaze at a high-voltage substation in Hayes, west London, with more than 1,350 flights disrupted and an estimated 300,000 passengers facing travel chaos. Heathrow airport said it was “fully operational” on Saturday, although disruption to flights was expected to continue for a few days.Counter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan police have been leading the investigation into the cause of the fire. Police say that after an initial assessment, they are not treating the incident as suspicious.Miliband said: “The loss of power to theHeathrowarea has caused major disruption to thousands of people and many businesses. We are determined to properly understand what happened and what ­lessons need to be learned.“That is why, working with Ofgem, I have today commissioned the NationalEnergySystem Operator to carry out an investigation into this specific incident and to understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure, both now and in the future. The government is determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow.”Neso was launched as a public body in October, with responsibilty for the managing and planning of electricity and gas networks in England, Scotland and Wales.Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden is separately already leading a review of national resilience, which is due to report shortly. ANational Risk Registerpublished in January outlined the risk of attacks on the power network or critical failures.View image in fullscreenA deserted arrivals hall at Heathrow on Friday after the airport ground to a halt following a nearby fire.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APThomas Woldbye, chief executive of Heathrow airport, said this weekend that a review would examine how the impact on operations from any similar incident could be minimised in the future. He said yesterday he was “proud” of howHeathrow dealt with the incident, but he has been criticised for “complacent” public comments.“The situation was not created at Heathrow,” Woldbye told the BBC Radio 4Todayprogramme. “It was created outside the airport and we had to deal with the consequences. Of course, we look at what we can do better.” Woldbye said the airport is supplied by three power substations, but it was necessary to “restructure the supply” because of the fire.Experts have described the Heathrow shutdown as a “wake-up call” that raised questions about the resilience of power infrastructure supporting other critical sites.Lord Toby Harris, chair of the independent National Preparedness Commission, said: “I find it extraordinary that the airport has got itself into a position where one substation going out is sufficient to take out the whole airport.” He said the public comments coming from the airport team and Woldbye on the shutdown had been “rather complacent”.It emerged on Saturday that a consultancy report had warned in 2014 that a “key weakness” in the airport’s infrastructure was the “main transmission line connections”. The warning in the risk assessment study, reported by theFinancial Times, stated that “even a brief interruption to electricity supplies could have a long-lasting impact”.Hundreds of additional staff have been drafted in to help clear the passenger backlog, with the impact on travel arrangements expected to last for days. Farah Rafeeq, 24, who was due to fly to Cambodia with a friend on Friday for a wedding, said: “The last few hours have been nightmarish because it is one of our closest friend’s wedding and we have to travel for at least 20 hours to get there. We had to pay double the amount, between £600 and £700, for the new flight.”The transport secretary Heidi Alexander said: “Heathrow is a massive airport that uses the energy of a small city, so it’s imperative we identify how this power failure happened and learn from this to ensure a vital piece of national infrastructure remains strong.”Fintan Slye, chief executive of Neso, said: “Neso welcomes the government’s commission to review the power outage incident impacting Heathrow and surrounding areas. We will now work with all relevant stakeholders to understand the ­lessons that can be learned to improve the future resilience of Great Britain’s energy system.”Neso is expected to report its initial findings within six weeks.Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportThe ObserverAir transportTransportLabourEd MilibandHeathrowOfgemnewsShareReuse this content"

But researchers have struggled to work out whether diabetes itself raises the risk of some or all of the cancers.For the latest study, the Manchester group turned to the UK Biobank which holds medical and lifestyle data on half a million people. They examined the records of 23,750 people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and compared them with more than 70,000 matched controls without diabetes.There tends to be a surge in cancer diagnoses shortly after people are found to have diabetes, simply because patients have more medical tests. The researchers accounted for this spike in cancer due to better detection by ignoring cases reported within a year of a diabetes diagnosis.According to the study, after five years the risk of any obesity-related cancer was 48% higher for men recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes than for those without the condition. For women, the risk was 24% higher in those with a recent diabetes diagnosis.Not all obesity-related cancers rose with diabetes, however. Women with diabetes were no more likely to develop endometrial cancer or post-menopausal breast cancer than those without, according to the study which will be presented at the European Congress onObesityin Málaga, Spain, in May.Across the population, the lifetime risks for liver and pancreatic cancer are higher for men than women. In the UK, one in 76 men and one in 130 women will develop liver cancer, while one in 55 men and one in 59 women will get pancreatic cancer.Tipping said it was too early to know whether people with diabetes would benefit from cancer screening, but added: “We know with pancreatic cancer that it’s important to detect it early.”It is unclear how diabetes might drive cancer, but scientists suspect high levels of insulin, high blood glucose and chronic inflammation. The sex differences may be driven by hormone levels, how sensitive the body is to the effects of insulin or variations in body fat.Sophia Lowes atCancerResearch UK said: “This study helps increase our understanding of the link between diabetes and cancer. While many questions remain about how and why diabetes might cause cancer, research like this is vital in helping us better prevent, detect and diagnose the disease.“Overweight and obesity cause at least 13 different types of cancer. The world around us doesn’t always make it easy, but keeping a healthy weight and eating a healthy, balanced diet is one way to reduce the risk of cancer. There are other steps people can take too, such as not smoking and cutting down on alcohol.”Explore more on these topicsHealthCancerDiabetesObesitynewsShareReuse this content"

Francis has been seen once since being admitted to hospital,in a photoshared by the Vatican last week in which he was praying in the ­hospital’s chapel.He suffered several breathing ­crises before his doctors said he was no longer in imminent ­danger, on 10 March. The Vatican said yesterday that his overall health situation remained ­stable, with slight improvements as he continued respiratory and ­physical physiotherapy.Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernández, of the Vatican’s doctrinal office, said yesterday the pope is “doing very well” but the ­high-flow oxygen treatment “dries everything out” and that the pontiff “needs to relearn to speak”.In early March, theVatican released a brief audio of Francisthanking well-wishers, with his voice sounding breathless and difficult to understand.“But his overall physical condition is as it was before,” Fernández said during the presentation of a new book by Francis on poetry.Fernández added that “a new stage” was opening in the 12-year papacy of Francis and that he expected some ­surprises from the pontiff when he was discharged from hospital.After his release, Francis would not immediately be able to meet groups of people, medics said. It remains unclear if an audience with King Charles and Queen Camilla, ­scheduled on 8 April, will take place.Pope thanks those who care for the sick as he continues to recover in hospitalRead moreDespite his health challenges, on some days Francis has continued to lead the Vatican from his hospital room, including approving individuals for sainthood. Last week, he wrote to the editor of theCorriere della Sera­newspaper reiterating his appeal for peace and disarmament. “We must disarm words, to disarm minds and disarm the Earth,” he wrote.Francis is prone to lung ­infections because he developed pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed while training to be a priest in his native Argentina.He has suffered ill health in recent years and has often alluded to resigning if bad health prevents him from doing his job.Speculation over an ­imminent resignation was vehemently dismissed last week by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisThe ObserverThe papacyCatholicismnewsShareReuse this content"

There will be above average temperatures for most parts of the UK topping 15C in London, 12C in Birmingham and 11C in Manchester.The Met Office said: “Heavy showers have developed across eastern parts of England this afternoon, with some hail and thunder mixed in. Heavy, thundery showers continue in parts of London and the East Midlands, with some areas seeing 10-15mm of rain in less than an hour.”The UK experienced itswarmest spring equinox day since 1972on Thursday with 21.3C recorded in Northolt, west London, and Chertsey, Surrey.Jonathan Vautrey, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “For this time in the year, it is rarer to have such intense storms. This is happening because we have had a lot of warm weather of late and temperatures are notably above average for the time of year.“We’ve had highs reaching over 20C over the last few days, and we were up to 18.5C as the high today as well, where we should be more around 10 or 11C.“That sort of heat that we’ve got around at the moment has really helped to spark off some of these thunderstorms, and a lot of moisture being drawn in with this sort of low-pressure system that’s been arriving across the UK.”Vautrey added that climate crisis is pushing temperature extremes to new levels. “We’re constantly seeing warmer temperatures at earlier points of the year compared to where they normally are.“These sort of intense summer storms are then increasingly going to happen at more points in the year because we’re getting those temperatures in there to really allow them to start developing.”Flood alerts from the Environment Agency remain in place for 20 parts of the country including Henley, Salisbury and Hertfordshire.The Met Office told travellers to “take care” as “there could be some localised flooding in places”.Explore more on these topicsUK weathernewsShareReuse this content"

However, the stadium only provides a fraction of this sum, with a large tranche of public funds required to secure the venture.Graham Stringer, a Labour MP and former leader of Manchester city council, hit out at the project last week, describing it on the websiteConfidentials Manchesteras a “tax exile’s half-baked, misbegotten scheme”.Speaking to theObserver, Stringer, a United season ticket holder, said: “The stadium doesn’t happen without public funds. Any representations to local or central government for public money to go into this scheme should be refused.”He said the money could be used more effectively in other parts of GreaterManchesterand it was “outrageous” that Ratcliffe was pushing the government for public funds to help increase the value of his business.View image in fullscreenManchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe wants ministers to help support the club’s plans for a new stadium with public funds to regenerate the surrounding area.Photograph: Lucy North/PARatcliffe, chair of the petrochemicals company Ineos, agreed a deal in December 2023 tobuy a minority stake in Unitedworth about £1.25bn. He extended his shareholdings last year,now owning almost 29% of the club.The businessman, who was born seven miles up the A62 in Failsworth, Oldham, has used his fortune to back a string of sports teams, including the Ineos Britannia sailing team trying to win the America’s Cup and Ineos Grenadiers, one of the world’s most successful cycling teams.It was reported in 2019 that less than a year after he was knighted for services to business and investment, Ratcliffewas planning to avoid up to £4bn in taxby switching his residence and fortune to Monaco. Ratcliffe has responded that he employs thousands of people in the UK and contributes hundreds of millions of pounds to the economy.‘Eiffel Tower of the north’? Manchester United unveil 100,000-seat new stadium projectRead moreThe Glazer family, who made their fortune from shopping centres in the US, still control the majority of voting rights at United. Ineos, meanwhile, is in charge of sporting operations at the club.Since becoming co-owner, Ratcliffe has presided over approximately 450 job cuts at the club and other cost savings, includingclosing down the staff canteen at Old Trafford. He warned this month that United would have been “bust at Christmas” without these measures.Despite the financial struggles and the team languishing in 13th place in the Premier League table, Ratcliffe revealed this month that the club was backing plans for the100,000-capacity stadiumclose to the Old Trafford ground. He said that the proposed £2bn stadium – the centrepiece of a new regeneration project – would become a destination like the Eiffel Tower in Paris.The project envisages a vast canopy spanning the stadium and a public plaza twice the size of Trafalgar Square. The architect Foster + Partners, appointed by the club to develop the master plan for the scheme, said the stadium will overlook a “mixed-use miniature city of the future”.A reportcommissioned by United claimed the project could deliver an additional £7.3bn to the UK’s economy each year. The stadium itself would, however, only contribute an extra £243m a year to the local economy by these calculations, compared with the current Old Trafford ground.View image in fullscreenMan Utd’s current Old Trafford home would be replaced with a 100,000- capacity stadium.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PATony Syme, head of finance and economics at Salford University, said: “The overwhelming majority of economic impact comes from the regeneration, not the stadium itself.” He added that the biggest investment was likely to be from public funds required to prepare the site, create public amenities and build the infrastructure.The scheme has won the support of key backers, including Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, and Sebastian Coe, whochaired the Old Trafford regeneration taskforce, which investigated the options for the club’s home ground and infrastructure.Burnham has insisted no public funds will be used for the construction of the stadium, but has been lobbying for government funding for the wider regeneration scheme and site preparation. The construction of a new stadium would require the relocation of an adjacent rail freight hub at a cost of between £200m and £300m.The area surrounding the stadium, which is part of a growth area in Manchester known as the Western Gateway, would also be eligible for public funding. It is intended the use of public funds would help “pump-prime” private sector investment.Waseem Hassan, a Labour party councillor for Old Trafford, said he fully supported the project, but residents also wanted the club to contribute to the community. He said: “It needs to happen because we need regeneration in the north. We are asking the club to contribute to schools, infrastructure and the environment. ”View image in fullscreenA computer-generated image of the new Man Utd stadium’s interior.Photograph: Foster + Partner/APA Greater Manchester Combined Authority spokesperson said: “The Old Trafford regeneration scheme represents the biggest sports-led regeneration scheme since the London 2012 Olympics. As was the case in London, public sector funding can help to unlock sites and deliver infrastructure, enabling massive private sector investment. Public money would not be used to build a new stadium.”A spokesperson for Trafford council said: “This is a once-in-a-generation chance to totally transform Old Trafford and the surrounding area.“It will breathe new life into the region with the creation of tens of thousands of new jobs and much- needed new homes being built.“The next step will see us shortly appointing a team of consultants to devise a strategic master plan to map out how the regeneration project will look.”United declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedThe ObserverJim RatcliffeManchesterAndy BurnhamBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

But the ‘gentrifiers’ is a bit more complicated,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe graffiti has made Max Tobias think again about locations of future bakeries.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian“Being held responsible for housing prices feels like a heavy cross to bear, but there’s no getting away from it: we started a sourdough bakery in Hackney at a time when it was hard to come by a flat white there – and now the community has transformed and local people are being priced out.“We’re in an impossible situation when it comes to the ‘gentrification’ accusation,” Tobias added. “What do we do as a socially driven organisation trying to scale and help local, young people find work? We need to find areas to open our bakeries where there are underrepresented groups but also aspiring professionals who want to buy our croissants.”Jamie Oliver also started his now-closed, not-for-profit restaurant and chef-training programme, Fifteen, to help vulnerable young people.He said: “Max and the dedicated team at Dusty Knuckle are creating real social change in their local area by harnessing the transformative power of food and hands-on skills. They offer young locals a second chance to turn their lives around.“I recently filmed there for my up-and-coming documentary on dyslexia, it was amazing. Some team members said they learned more in three months at Dusty Knuckle than during their entire school career, gaining a sense of achievement and accomplishment.“Investing in people is also investing in the community.Gentrificationor rehabilitation? It’s a fine line. You want to help people in an area but selling quality food requires growing an audience willing to pay for it.“I chose Old Street for Fifteen because it was cheap rent, it’s not now. Moro restaurant revitalised a rough Exmouth Market, which is now bustling and super cool. This ebb and flow has always been part of London as it’s continued to grow in size and population.”Billy was introduced to the Dusty Knuckle’s trainee scheme when he came out of prison after a 12-year sentence for murder.“Nowhere else would give me a job when I came out of prison but the Dusty Knuckle gave me a chance to shine,” he said.“I was really confused when I heard about the graffiti,” he added. “It has to have been done by somebody who has no idea what the Dusty Knuckle actually believes in and stands for because the Dusty Knuckle has changed more lives and done more for a disadvantaged community, whether a person’s white, black or Muslim, than the actual community itself.“I know so many gang members who have gone on to change their lives after working at the Dusty Knuckle programme because it gave them a legit way to earn a living.”Paul Burnham, the secretary of the Haringey Defend Council Housing group, said responsibility for gentrification lies with local and central government, not individual businesses.“Yes, £12 sandwiches are drivers of gentrification but the things that really matter are high house prices and high market rents,” he said. “If local people had protected, affordable housing, it wouldn’t matter how much a local croissant cost.“This government’s goal of building 1.5m new homes doesn’t include a target for a single new affordable new home. That means the policy will inflate property prices in local areas and drive out the ordinary people who call those areas home.”View image in fullscreenDusty Knuckle’s two bakeries, cafe and baking school employ 120 local people, with a focus on at-risk young people.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianThe Dusty Knuckle has a string of well-known supporters, including the pastry chef and activist Ravneet Gill and the singer-songwriter Jessie Ware. The two bakeries, cafe and baking school employ 120 local people, with a focus on at-risk, young people who have been involved with the justice system, are care leavers or asylum seekers.Tobias co-founded the Dusty Knuckle after spending years working in schools, charities and prisons. “I realised I had nothing to offer these young people who were heading towards a life of crime, or were already in one, other than words,” he said.“I wanted to show them that they could be enterprising, financially self-sustaining and learn skills. I realised that having a buzzing, entrepreneurial, exciting, busy commercial business environment that they could be part of, would be a much more profound way of displaying those values and putting our money where our mouth is, than in a charity.”The graffiti has made Tobias think again about locations of future bakeries. But, he said: “We’d worry a bit about a London where ‘fancy bakeries’ can’t open next to Turkish grocers. How would we get variety and diversity into neighbourhoods then?“Also, how often are ‘poor communities’ included in the public conversation about what their housing and local business landscape looks like?” he asked. “We suspect a lot of the local businesses selling very cheap food aren’t doing so to ‘protect the poor’.”Explore more on these topicsGentrificationHospitality industryFood & drink industryLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The golden labrador can smell and ­identify ­particular bacteria and could soon play a key role in helping researchers develop a programme in which dogs could sniff out individuals infected with dangerous microbes.The project, recently launched by scientists atImperial College London, could be vital in the battle against antibiotic resistance as well as the treatment of patients with lung ­disease and other conditions, they say.“We believe Jodie and her fellow medical detective dogs point to a new way to spot infected individuals, just by having a sniff of their socks or shirts,” said Professor Jane Davies at Imperial College.“They could become a major help in tackling antimicrobial resistance and conditions like cystic fibrosis.”Cystic fibrosis is one of the world’s most common inherited illnesses. A defective protein allows mucus to build up in lungs and other organs, triggering chronic infections that worsen through life.Eighty years ago, most patients died in their teens. Howeverdrugs, called modulators, now offer patients a chance to live into old age. But this success has brought ­problems.Modulator drugs have greatly improved patients’ overall conditions but they do not entirely kill off all the chronic lung infections that affect them. Most are still infected with bacteria whose growth could jeopardise their health.“The problem is that ­bacteria in these patients are now much harder to detect,” said Davies. “Modulators greatly reduce the mucus in their lungs and ­without that it is difficult for them to cough up the sputum in which their bacterial status can be evaluated.” “This is where the dogs come in.”For the first time, we may be able to train dogs to detect pseudomonas on patients’ skin, in their urine or clothingProfessor Jane Davies, Imperial CollegeSeveral years go, Davies and her team, supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, carried out research in which dogs demonstrated they could detect samples grown in the laboratory which contained a bacterium called pseudomonas, which can ­trigger pneumonia, ­urinary tract infections and ­septicaemia – often a serious health problem for cystic fibrosis patients.As part of the trials, dogs, which were provided by the charityMedical Detection Dogsand which included Jodie, were brought into a testing room where samples were set on stands at dog-head height. These stands either included pseudomonas, other bacteria or no bacteria at all.The dogs walked around the room sniffing each sample and when they had detected the pseudomonas, they sat down.“We showed that in laboratory settings dogs can detect pseudomonas in samples,” said Davies. “Now we want to expand that work and have just been given funding from the medical charities LifeArc and the Cystic Fibrosis Trust to ramp up our collaboration with Medical DetectionDogsso that, for the first time, we may be able to train dogs to detect pseudomonas on patients’ skin, in their urine or in their clothing.”Crucially, this system could be expanded to detect bacteria in other patients, not just those with cystic fibrosis. And such an ability would have important implications.Microbes such as pseudomonas are difficult to detect in clinics and techniques to test for it are often invasive, uncomfortable, expensive and cannot be repeated on a regular basis. Dogs could get around that problem.Cambridge study aims to find out if dogs and their owners are on same wavelengthRead more“Bacteria like pseudomonas are often resistant to certain anti­biotics,” added Davies. “We need to pinpoint them with precision to ensure they are treated with the right antibiotic and so keep down the growing ­problem of antimicrobial resistance, which will be worsened if we give patients the wrong type of antibiotics.”About a million people now die every year across the world because of the spread of microbial resistance and that figure is expected to rise over the next 25 years.Recent data suggests problems arising from resistance are easing for the under-fives, but for the over-70s mortality rates have gone up 80% since 1990.“In the fight against ­anti­microbial resistance, we are ​going to need all the help we can get – and dogs like Jodie could be the perfect allies that we could recruit in this battle,” said Davies.Explore more on these topicsCystic fibrosisThe ObserverMedical researchAnimalsAntibioticsImperial College LondonDogsnewsShareReuse this content"

A byelection looms.“Prescott didn’t get sacked,” remarks another Amesbury-supporting drinker, referring to the 2001 incident when then-Labour deputy prime minister John Prescott punched an egg-throwing protester.“Sometimes you’re going to snap,” agreed a member of the group.“He was somebody that you could trust and go to to get something sorted out,” adds Baldwin.But support for Amesbury does not translate into backing for the Labour party. Far from it. Ominously for Keir Starmer’s party, polls show that Nigel Farage’sReform UK, which came a distant second in the general election here, could cause a sensation and win in this seat when the contest to find Amesbury’s successor takes place. That would be a hammer blow to Labour so soon after it won a historic election landslide.View image in fullscreenJason Baldwin: ‘This country is going wrong, It needs somebody that can sort this out and look after the people who need looking after. It needs change.’Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverSome of the reasons why opinion is shifting quickly become clear from the pub talk. Baldwin has three children who have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. He fears that this government’s planned cuts to benefits, and particularly the tightening of eligibility rules for personal independence payments, will affect his family severely.“I’d love to have a one on one with each politician and say: ‘Come and have a look how hard it is’,” he says. “Most people in Runcorn are thinking about benefit cuts and taxes … This country is going wrong, It needs somebody that can sort this out and look after the people who need looking after. It needs change.”AsRachel Reevesprepares to announce more cuts to spending for unprotected government departments in her spring statement on Wednesday, these are the kind of raw expressions of anger that Labour MPs are hearing from their constituents all too often.In their weekly surgeries they confront the human stories. As a result, disquiet is rising on the Labour backbenches, with more and more MPs dismayed that their government seems to be hitting the poorest and most vulnerable hardest in their desperate attempts to balance the booksand keep within their self-imposed fiscal rules.For Labour, the signs are worrying, not only for this byelection but also for wider local elections in May. Nationally, the Tories are now favoured by more people than Labour to run the economy well and “improve your financial situation”, according to the latest Opinium poll for theObserver.That is a huge turnaround, given the damage Liz Truss inflicted on the Conservatives’ reputation for economic management. Local government leaders are warning that, after 15 years of austerity cuts, Reeves may be about to add more misery with further reductions in council budgets, which will feed through to reduced funding for crucial areas, including social care services.Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association, tells theObserver: “Local government has made huge savings and efficiencies over the past decade and continues to innovate and transform services to get the best for residents and provide greater value for money. However, without adequate investment, now we risk not being able to deliver crucial services that so many depend on, and our desire to help government fulfil its ambitions for the future are severely hindered.”Labour statisticsRuncorn and Helsby will soon be full of Labour and Reform people canvassing for votes. Amesbury had represented the marginal Weaver Vale seat since gaining it from the Tories in 2017, and won July’s general election with 53% of the vote. Reform UK received 18% while the Conservatives came third on 16%. The Green party won 6% and the Liberal Democrats 5%.In Runcorn’s library on Thursday, three friends are meeting for their weekly Scrabble club. They agree things are going wrong in Britain. The debate is already under way as to who would best put things right.Dave Colleavy, 73, believes that after years of Labour and Conservative control, Reform should be given an opportunity. “We should give somebody else a chance,” he says. “We had 14 years of Conservative rule, but nothing’s any better, and it’s not getting any better at this moment in time.”His fellow Scrabble player Marian Holt, 70, does not know “what Reform stands for” but Colleavy insists that the party would be a “better option than what we have”. “Why are we just persevering with the same thing?” he asks. “If it doesn’t go well, it doesn’t go well, but it’s not going well anyway.”View image in fullscreenMike Amesbury resigned after he was given a suspended sentence for punching a constituent.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAOn the other side of the table Rich Bradshaw, 70, also wants change but backed the Green Party as his preferred alternative.“I think Reform is a worse option,” he says, comparing Farage unfavourably with Donald Trump. “But it’s hard to argue when people say [Labour and the Conservatives] are all the same – it’s all soundbites and budget cuts.”Research on voting intention carried out by Lord Ashcroft Polls last week put Reform ahead of Labour by 42 per cent to 33 per cent among people who said they were certain to vote, and turnout will be key.During theObserver’s visit to Runcorn, all the over-50s spoken to were intending to vote, but younger people interviewed were either unaware of the byelection or said they would not take part.In Costa, two personal trainers meeting for a coffee are surprised to be told that the local MP has stood down after punching a man. “It’s a waste of time talking about politics, and I don’t like politicians,” says one of the friends, who does not want to be named.“Labour are supposed to be the ones who help us out, and we’re worse off with Labour than we were with the Tories.”The pair want to see more support for young people in Runcorn and the surrounding area, where they say there is little opportunity and “literally nothing to do”.“The people who are already rich are all right, but the working man is still getting stung,” says the personal trainer. “I’m from a Labour through-and-through family, but now Labour are in and there’s no benefit.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKThe ObserverLabourRachel ReevesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My own life in ­boxing, which stretches across 55 years, can be divided into stages and all of them carry markers Foreman left in the dirt and dust of the fight game.From the malevolent force he ­personified when he became ­heavyweight champion of the world to the lovable old grandad ­making hundreds of millions as the face of a food grill business, Foreman could be easily ­caricatured. But he was always more complex and interesting than his contrasting personae suggested.I was 11 years old when, in January 1973, I first became aware of Foreman. Boxing had already taken hold of me because, in our white South African suburb, we were­smitten by Muhammad Ali. Who else was as funny and skilful, as ­beautiful and brave? But boxing was like ­nothing else on earth. In 1971, in the Fight of the Century at Madison Square Garden, Ali had lost to the mighty Joe Frazier. Hunched over our inky newspapers I devoured the reports of the buildup to Frazier’s defence of his title in January 1973 – against Foreman. Frazier sounded relaxed at the ­prospect of facing the brooding Texan who never seemed to smile.“I’m doing it for the money,” Frazier said. “It’s that simple. George won’t have any trouble finding me. I’m going to be up against his chest.”The bout lasted just four minutes and 35 seconds and Smokin’ Joe was dropped six times before the ­referee rescued him. But that fight also imparted a graphic insight into the cold-hearted chicanery of boxing.Don King had listened to the epic Ali-Frazier fight from his prison cell in Marion, Ohio. He was electrified by the grandeur and money that could be made from boxing and, being an ingenious hustler, King found himself promoting Frazier less than two years later. He arrived at the stadium with Frazier in a ­limousine and, a few hours later, he left in the company of Foreman, the new champion.2:56A look back at the life and career of boxing legend George Foreman – videoKing thrilled us when he brought Foreman and Ali to Africa the ­following year. TheRumble in the Jungletook place in Zaire [now the Democratic Republic of Congo] but we feared for Ali. How could he, at the age of 32, withstand the bludgeoning might of Foreman? Ali still made us laugh. “George Foreman is nothing but a big mummy,” he chortled, as he mimicked an embalmed monster. “What you white reporters got to remember is this: black folk ain’t afraid of black folks the way that white folks are afraid of black folks.”Foreman, meanwhile, locked ­himself away in a heavily armed compound. When he did appear he looked even more threatening than the snarling German shepherd dog that walked alongside him. In the early hours of 30 October 1974 I listened to the fight in bed. Dread and excitement churned through me as Ali absorbed every ruinous blow before, near the end of the eighth, a voice ­echoed in disbelief from my tiny radio:“Foreman is down! Foreman is down!”I was deliriously happy for Ali and all my fear and suspicion of Foreman melted away. He was just an ordinary man after all.Years later, Foreman provided Thomas Hauser, Ali’s biographer, with a layered account of his real self: “There was a time when I was sort of unfriendly, and Zaire was part of that period. I was going to knock Ali’s block off and the thought of doing it didn’t bother me.“But, to be honest with you, Ali was important to me. I remember being in junior high and walking home with a friend who had a record of Cassius Clay [as Ali was originally known] reading poetry. We listened to the record and I just about fell in love with Ali.”Foreman also told Hauser: “He won fair and square, and now I’m just proud to be part of the Ali legend. If people mention my name with his from time to time, that’s enough for me.”View image in fullscreenForeman in later years: ‘he seemed so fulfilled’.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverWhen Big George made his comeback in 1987, after 10 years of retirement, he was charming rather than surly. Foreman was also courageous and I rose in the early hours of the morning to watch him challenge Evander Holyfield for the heavyweight title again. He was beaten clearly but I admired his stoical will.In October 1993 I met Foreman briefly in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I was in the dressing room with James Toney, who was then a world super-middleweight champion and close to being the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet for a brief period. We had 90 minutes to kill before Toney fought Tony Thornton. The locker room was quiet and tense and then, out of nowhere, Foremen walked in. He was dressed in a tuxedo and his face was wreathed with warmth.Toney, a former crack dealer, cut an imposing figure. But he almost melted as he bumped fists with Foreman.“George fucking Foreman,” Toney said softly to me as the old champion left for his television duties at ringside.Incredibly, a year later, in November 1994, I was up at the dead of night to watch a 45-year-old Foreman win a version of the world heavyweight title again – 20 years after he had lost it to Ali. It was a feelgood story but, to snobs of the ring like me, it still seemed something of a charade. Hugh McIlvanney wrote of how Foreman “took advantage of the incompetence and porcelain jaw of Michael Moorer … Foreman has the IBF belt around his expanding waist, but he is a legend masquerading as an athlete, a bloated giant who moves as slowly as the seasons.”In 1995, on our honeymoon in America, my wife and I watched Foreman defend his title against Axel Schulz. At the end his face was swollen and dejected. Across the ring, his 22-year-old German opponent looked fresh and unmarked. For twelve painful rounds, the young man had thudded blows into the grandad. Schulz was not a great fighter but he was competent.Foreman was too proud to even think about going down, but Schulz was a decisive winner – until the scorecards were read out. It was a split decision win for Foreman.That ludicrous verdict belonged to the dark business of boxing – but it was not Foreman’s fault. He fought three more times and left boxing a year later. Unlike Ali and Frazier, who were both so damaged, Foreman seemed unscathed.A few years ago I was also in the dressing room withRegis Prograison the night he became a two-time world champion. I asked him to name the fighter hemost admired. He chose Foreman.“George was happy with who he was outside boxing,” Prograis said. “He had a bunch of kids, made a lot of money and seemed so fulfilled. He is a legend but we think of him enjoying his life most of all.”Explore more on these topicsGeorge ForemanThe ObserverMuhammad AliBoxingJoe FraziercommentShareReuse this content"

But last autumn Rachel Reeves announced that money left in a defined contribution (AKA money purchase) pension after your death will be pulled into the IHT net from April 2027.Most workplace pensions and all private pensions are defined contribution.The changes mean that “unused” pension savings could be taxed as part of someone’s estate if they exceed the IHT threshold.Unused funds are money in a pension pot that hasn’t been used to claim an income, such as buying an annuity, explains The People’s Pension, a provider.IHT is a tax paid on someone’s assets after they die if they leave enough to go above a certain threshold. The standard IHT rate is 40%, and it is charged only on the part of the estate that is above the tax-free threshold, which is £325,000. (There is a separate threshold for homes.)View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves announced last year that money left in a defined contribution pension after your death will be pulled into the IHT net from April 2027.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAThe exemption for spouses or civil partners will continue to apply, so everything can be left to them without an IHT bill. But other beneficiaries could face tax.Crucially, the details of how all this will work in practice have not been finalised yet.How many people are affected by this?The government insists that the vast majority of people won’t be affected.Late last year it estimated that of about 213,000 estates with “inheritable pension wealth” in 2027-28, 10,500 (just under 5%) would face an IHT bill for the first time because of the changes, and about 38,500 estates would pay more IHT than would previously have been the case. But the government said these figures did not take into account “potential behavioural changes”, such as people drawing down pension funds at a faster rate.The pension firm Royal London says: “If you own your own home, then when your defined contribution pension is added on to this, it might be more than the amount you’re able to pass on free of IHT. And that could mean IHT has to be paid when you die, or when your husband or wife dies.”What can I do now?For older people who can afford it, the easiest thing is probably to spend more pension cash now. But everyone’s circumstances are different, and it is vital for people to ensure that they have enough money to support them through the later years of their retirement.“Faced with the prospect of seeing their hard-earned pension funds heavily taxed after their death, many older individuals are considering a different approach: spending more of their pension while they are alive,” Anick Sharma, a financial planner at Videre Financial Planning, says, adding: “The reasoning is simple – why leave behind wealth that will be significantly eroded by tax when it could be enjoyed in the present?”Some people are planning to give their children money to help with things such as buying a first homeHe says that, for many, the reality is that by the time their estate is passed down, their children are likely to be financially independent and have no pressing need for the inheritance.Some people are planning to give their children money to help with things such as buying a first home.One way of accessing your pension is to take out an annuity, a product that gives you a guaranteed retirement income. So we are likely to see strong demand for annuities in future.We may also see more older people who are worried about a possible future IHT bill take out equity release mortgages. These are a way for over-55s to get cash out of their property without the need to move home. Doing this reduces the value of your estate.Some will go further and use this as an opportunity to downsize their home, reckons Andrew Oxlade, an investment director at Fidelity International. “Money could be raised, some of which could be handed to children and grandchildren. The seven-year rule [see later] is crucial to this … Given the challenge faced by gen Z on getting on the property ladder, it’s an option many parents might consider.”View image in fullscreenSome people see the tax changes as an opportunity to downsize their home.Photograph: Purple Marbles/AlamyThere are various allowances people can use to give tax-free gifts. For example, you can give away assets or cash up to £3,000 in a tax year without them being added to the value of your estate. That £3,000 can be given to one person or split between several people. The small gift allowance lets you give as many gifts of up to £250 per person as you want each tax year, as long as you haven’t used another allowance on the same person. There’s also an allowance that lets you give tax-free gifts to people getting married.Meanwhile, the “potentially exempt transfer” rules allow you to give money or gifts of any amount or value to anyone, which will become exempt from IHT as long as you live for seven years after giving them, although there have been rumours that this could be upped to 10 years at some point.Starting to give gifts out of regular income is another option, Cook says. People can give away as much money as they want as long it comes out of their regular income – such as employment or pension income rather than capital – and doesn’t diminish the giver’s standard of living in any way, explains Alice Haine, a personal finance analyst at the platform Bestinvest.Give me an example of how the new rules might work.Let’s say Emily, 73, died with a defined contribution pension worth £700,000, plus other assets worth £800,000. She didn’t leave a surviving spouse or civil partner. Emily didn’t use her pension during her retirement as she relied on other assets and savings. After her death, her pension fund will pass to beneficiaries chosen by the pension scheme.Currently, her estate is valued at £800,000 for IHT purposes, as her pension is excluded. After applying the £325,000 tax-free threshold, her estate owes £190,000 in IHT (40% of £475,000).From April 2027, Emily’s pension will be included in her estate, increasing its value to £1.5m. The IHT bill shoots up to £470,000 (40% of £1.175m). Of that £470,000 bill, £219,333 would come out of the unused pension cash before it is paid out to Emily’s beneficiaries.Explore more on these topicsPensionsInheritance taxTaxOlder peopleFamily financesAnnuitiesEquity releasefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a huge intelligence amplifier’Zoë CorbynThe co-founder of LinkedIn and Democrat donor remains confident that AI can be good for all of us – if its introduction is handled in the right waySat 22 Mar 2025 14.00 EDTShareReid Hoffman is a prominent Silicon Valley billionaire entrepreneur and investor known for co-founding the professional social networking siteLinkedIn, now owned by Microsoft. He’s also staunchly anti-Trump. The longtime Democrat donor threw his support behind Kamala Harris in the race for the White House. Hoffman spoke to theObserverabout technology in the new political milieu and his new book about our future with artificial intelligence,Superagency. The book, while not ignoring the problems that AI might cause,argues that the technology is poised to give us cognitive superpowers that will increase our individual and collective human agency, creating a state of widespread empowerment for society.You have a vested interest in being positive about AI, including a company focused on conversational AI for business,Inflection AI.Why should we listen to you?First, an economic interest doesn’t necessarily make what someone is saying wrong, and I try to be transparent and not hide mine. Second, I tend to start with my beliefs and follow with my money. And sometimes that does mean doing things that are against my economic interests. Not kissing [Trump’s] ring, like many others have, is probably an economic limiter – but it’s better to be principled. I could have put the time and energy I spent writingSuperagencyinto my companies and made much more money, but I want to share in the intellectual discourse.What’s your hope for the book?I want to at the very least make people AI-curious, so they begin to explore what these superpowers we all might be getting are. There’s a flood of discussion around AI that tends to be negative and concerns a decrease in human agency. And, while that is a common response to new technologies, in previous cases it hasn’t come to pass – human agency has increased – and I predict the AI revolution will land in the same place. But there is a turbulent transition. I am calling it the “cognitive Industrial Revolution” not only because of the anticipated superpowers and superagency we will gain, but because, like the Industrial Revolution, the transition will be difficult. We can get through it with less pain and more grace, as well as improve the state that we’re moving towards, if we use a techno-humanist compass that points us towards building technologies that increase human agency.I do believe AI will primarily still end up being a co-pilot, though obviously some job types will disappearYou argue that AI chatbots such asChatGPThave been a turning point in increasing human agency because, comparedwith AI technologies such as facial recognition, predictive policing and algorithmic surveillance, they workforus andwithus rather thanonus and we must affirmatively choose to use them. But they can still guide us towards certain viewpoints, numb our critical thinking and, of course, potentially upend our jobs–which would seem to undermine human agency.To take jobs, they are being transformed, andinformation professionals will need to be using AI tools to do part of their work. If you don’t you will be under-tooled and won’t be competitive. And you may feel that as a loss of agency. You don’t want to change but you can’t choose not to. But then you begin to see the upside: repetitive tasks might be automated, creative processes accelerated. You get a lot more agency and so do other people.So we won’t all become obsolete?I do believe AI will primarily still end up being a co-pilot, though obviously some job types will disappear. We will need to build technologies that can help people whose jobs are changing adapt or, if the job does completely goes away, find other jobs that they can learn and possibly do with AI.You label those who fret about AI’s near-term risks and harms as “gloomers” – but isn’t it important to be critical of new technology?Yes, but where the implication is we should stop or massively slow down – it isn’t helpful. Not least because the countries that adopt the cognitive Industrial Revolution early and firmly will win massive amounts of economic strength, and their values will end up shaping the world. I want western democracies to get there ahead of others like China that are trying to embrace it through autocracy.You get to the good future by steering towards it. Not that you don’t pay attention to the bad futures – but you do so as you’re figuring out how to navigate the right way. You adopt an iterative deployment stance – testing deliberately incremental versions en masse in the real world and then looking at where the critiques play and adjusting (which is how OpenAI has rolled out ChatGPT).Where’s the leadership among wealthyDemocrats against Trump? Or are people lying low fearing political retribution, whichyou have saidyou are worried about?Personally, I am regrouping. The point, for me, isn’t fighting Trump. It is helping humanity and making society better, including American society. And you might say that because this administration is not going to listen to my ideas about what the government should be doing on AI, maybe I should focus on contributing elsewhere. I recently launched Manas AI, centred on discovering drugs to cure cancer, and I also recently became a fellow of the London School of Economics, helping them think about how AI reinvents the university.That said, obviously I’ve been dismayed and deeply concerned about various things that have happened since Trump took office, including seemingly allying with Russia and Putin and standing down our offensive cyber operations.You are among thefew tech moguls who haven’t cosied up to President Trump. What should we conclude about the morality of this industryas it rolls back DEI (diversity) initiatives and drops factchecking, as Meta has done?I do have some quieter friends! The technology industry should be in dialogue and taking some of its cues from a government elected by democratic vote. The fact that you don’t happen to like this government doesn’t negate that. But, on the other hand, there are things being done that are, frankly, bad for society. While one could easily argue some DEI initiatives have gone too far and it’s good to adjust them, some of DEI is civil rights – which, unequivocally, it is good to be for.I obviously disagree with some of the moves that have been made to remove factchecking. We have anti-vax claims in various social networking platforms that are pretty easily false and a double-digit percentage of Americans who believe various vaccine-related conspiracy theories. That kind of level of disinformation within society makes it hard for democracies to operate. LinkedIn gets criticised as boring – but it exemplifies a lot of what I think should be happening on social networks around factchecking.View image in fullscreenElon Musk with Donald Trump outside the White House.Photograph: ShutterstockHow worrying has it been to watch the “move fast and break things” tech approach being applied to the US federal government by Doge[Elon Musk’sdepartment of government effeciency], in some cases reportedly using AI software to identify budget cuts?I expect most business people, including myself, would think that figuring out how to make government more efficient is a good goal. But you can do it in a way that’s less destructive, less cruel and more lawful than is being done. Firing all these experts and then trying to rehire them: it is a hot mess of incompetent behaviour. Even doing it hard and fast, there are ways – they could have asked for memos about the programmes they were thinking of cutting. The “I’ll just cancel all of it and then we’ll see what happens” is a path that comes with massive external costs.You and Elon Musk used to be friends. But he has accused you and continues to repeat the accusation that you were one of Jeffrey Epstein’s clients – which you have said is “slander and a lie” and that your only involvement with Epstein, which you have apologised for, was in helping the MIT Media Lab fundraise.Any plans to take legal action?I have yet to ever personally bring a lawsuit. I tend to be a builder and a maker and legal action of this sort is very difficult in the US. I have thought about also calling for the Epstein files to be released to bring out the truth. But then do I really want to get into that tar pit? I question Elon’s motives for saying these things given now he’s in government. I think he is trying to smear me to try to make my voice less relevant to the American people.How do you AI-proof yourself? What’s your advice to a young adult thinking about a career path?I don’t think it is AI-proofing yourself; it is AI-amplifying yourself. The important thing is to be engaging with AI and learning the tools. And young people have a real advantage: because they are interested in and tend to adopt new technologies readily, they can bring a skill set and mindset to the workplace that can help the workplace transform.Your previous book,Impromptu, is described as written “by Reid Hoffmanwith ChatGPT-4” and it documents your conversations with the chatbot. To what extent did you use AI to write this book?While [my co-author and I] feel we own every word here, we used it a lot! For research, to give us the pros and cons of what we were arguing in various sections, and to suggest rewrites of paragraphs to give them more zing. My recommendation to all writers is to start using AI deeply. It is a huge intelligence amplifier. And I don’t think it is necessary the way we used it – which wasn’t wholesale quoting – to say “written with AI”. It is would be like saying “written with a Mac”.How should we regulate AI? Biden’s 2023 executive order, which was the closest the US had to any federal AI regulation and was aimed at trying to reduce its risks, has been rescinded by Trump, who described it as a barrier to American AI innovation.Regulation should be iterative – like deployment. So certainly, regulation as we go and even some regulation now. The Biden executive order was directionally right, meant as it was to tackle major harms rather than any harm you could think of, and hopefully it is just cancelled in name. But it isn’t just regulation. Feedback from customers, employees, the public are all part of steering the path here. And benchmarks and metrics can be important too as a non-legally binding way of shelving algorithms that perform poorly.Are we going to end up with chatbots built on partisan large language models (LLMs) that steer clear of truth and reinforce our own worldviews?Obviously, it’s not good for us to be in complete filter bubbles. And I think you will get some of that with some LLMs. I am a fan of identifying the principles you are training your LLM on and then articulating a reasoned argument for that. So: I’m the “anti-woke” LLM because I believe this, this and this, or I’m an LLM that will let you know when there’s a big swath of people who disagree with you because I think it is important for you to be informed. Then people will know what they are using.Is technologists’ holy grail of reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI) – in which AI can perform any intellectual task that a human can and which many expect will be achieved before the end of the decade – needed for the cognitiveIndustrial Revolution?Not necessarily, although it would be an even further amplification. LLMs today are enabling us to do things that no human being can do, in terms of the breadth of knowledge, and bringing things together. I do think that within three years the tools will be good enough that, if you’re not using them, it will be like a professional not having a mobile phone. But whether we are talking about AGI or even artificial super intelligence (ASI) [greatly exceeding human cognitive abilities], and which I think is at least decades away, we should try to shape them in a way that’s good for us and good for society. Let’s make sure ASIs are essentially Buddhist in their values.Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right With Our AI Future?by Reid Hoffman and Greg Beato is published by Authors Equity (£22).

I make eggs – soft boiled, scrambled or an omelette – sliced cucumber, toast with butter and a bowl of yoghurt on the side. Whether I eat too depends on how much I ate the previous night – and how late.Last year, I decided I’d skip breakfast altogether. I was reading everywhere about thebenefits of intermittent fasting(IF) and it didn’t feel like a huge sacrifice. Apparently, if I managed to avoid food for 16 hours, half of it spent sleeping anyway, I was more likely to sustain weight loss compared with following any other diet. On top of that, fasting periods are said to allow the body to repair cells and, as a result, help to reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, general inflammation, memory loss, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and other maladies.So much gain for so little pain; it would be silly not to, right? And it did, for a while, give me that satisfying feeling of an empty stomach, a kind of lightness and a sense that I’d instantaneously lost weight, even before I’d shed a single kilogram. Looking in the mirror, my belly seemed flatter.After a few days, I noticed that as soon as the 16-hour fast was up, I was starving. I had to have something, immediately. At 10, I had a handful of nuts and an apple, just to keep me going. It was not enough, so I had more nuts at 11 and then the big meal that I “earned” through fasting at 12.30pm. Unfortunately, my job involves trying food throughout the day, which meant that by 3pm I felt too full to work. All I wanted was to lie down and sleep, for ever. Having a wholesome meal at 6pm, before going on the next fast, was a small torture.I always wanted to shrink my belly and love handles, but it wasn’t an obsession. Now, after trying intermittent fasting, it wasI ended up gaining weight. My belly now looked plumper than when I started. The irony is that before hearing about IF and its benefits, I wasn’t thinking that much about my size. Yes, I always wanted to shrink my belly and its associates, the love handles, but it was far from an obsession. Now, suddenly, it was. In short, intermittent fasting messed with my brain and contributed zilch to my physique.I may be overegging the effect of this fleeting episode, but it serves to make a point. We have all been there. With turmeric and avocado, fermented foods, superfoods, low-fat, just fat, an apple a day, five a day, the Mediterranean diet, keto,paleo, protein. The list goes on and my memory isn’t sharp enough (do I need more oily fish?) to recall half of it. But the impossible length of this list goes to show how ephemeral these dieting diktats are.It seems to me that if we stopped for one second and allowed ourselves to ignore all this noise, and instead follow the well-established routines we grew up with surrounding cooking and eating, we wouldn’t need such “solutions”. Eating regimes foster self-doubt where there is no need for it. They make us overthink our relationship with food instead of just living it. The world of diets is a trap that locks you in by messing with your head.The trouble is that there is much to be said for many of these notions. Who would deny the goodness of vegetables or the benefits of fermented foods for our guts? The idea of taking a break from eating for a good few hours every day also makes sense. That’s what our hunter-gatherer ancestors did and they didn’t suffer from our cardiovascular conditions. The point is, adopting a “regime” comes at a cost, there’s a balance to disrupt.View image in fullscreenStyling: Victoria Twyman. Grooming: Carol Morley at Arlington Talent. Thanks to: littlemousecheese.com and cacklebean.com.Photograph: Jay Brooks/The GuardianAs 21st-century humans, we are always on the lookout for simple ideas that would solve all our problems and eradicate the constant anxiety we suffer. For the past few decades, it seems that nutrition has been the fount of many such simple notions. Mental health, physical health, longevity, wellbeing – everything can be fixed if we sort out our diets.Others have already pointed out that the problem lies with equating food with nutrients. Nutrients alone don’t make you healthy, but food can make you healthy – and you can also be unhealthy even if you eat an incredibly “healthy” diet.TheAmerican thinker Michael Pollanpointed this out with prophetic clarity in the late 00s, when the media, scientists and food manufacturers were colluding in promoting an ideology he describes as “nutritionism”. The term relates to the unexamined acceptance that food is just the sum of its nutrients. Chicken thigh, potato salad, hummus or a cookie are described using terms such as carbohydrate, protein, saturated fat, fibre, vitamin C or amino acids. This way, we can look right through them. We can forget about food and talk about things that are easy to define, prescribe and sell.This is completely wrong.It has been shown, time and again, that our understanding of nutrients is always superficial and partial. For a long time, it was assumed that we can conceive of everything in terms of just three categories: carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Later on, vitamins and the importance of fibre were discovered. This doesn’t even scrape the surface. The deeper we dig, the more we realise how complex our foods are. Pollan lists more than 30 antioxidants in garden thyme alone.We need to reclaim our meals from the field of nutrition and take them back to the realm of human interaction, conviviality and cultureWe have a limited idea about all the elements that make our food and, more importantly, we really don’t understand the myriad intricate ways in which they interact with each other and with our bodies, which are all different and have particular needs.The desire to reduce food to nutrients and then come up with the right set of those as a solution to our daily needs assumes that there isn’t something out there to fulfil those needs. And there is. It is simply food with ingredients that are recognisable and aren’t excessively messed with. I know that the definition ofultra-processed foods, a category that’s much discussed right now, isn’t clearly agreed on yet, but we all know them when we see them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Replacing one “bad” nutrient (fat) with another “good” one (starch) has, most likely, been a major culprit in making us fatter and less healthy.Yet, even if we accept that nutrients tell a very partial story and that we should probably be talking about a potato, and not about carbohydrates and fibre in isolation, we need to understand that the food we eat, the meals we enjoy, are all part of our very particular cultures, culinary traditions and circumstances.You would be surprised to hear that even the Mediterranean diet riles me. I don’t dispute that fruit, vegetables, nuts and olive oil are great choices. I eat them all the time and my desert island food is, probably, a Greek salad – tomato juices, olive oil, vinegar, bits of onion – mopped up with fresh bread. The trouble with the Mediterranean diet is that most of us don’t live in Crete, and we don’t necessarily have access to all the fresh ingredients that are cultivated there.The idea that we can transform our diet in a radical way to make things simple – nutrients, Mediterranean, healthy, happy, satisfied – is an illusion. There aren’t simple solutions.We know best what we need to eat – and when. The food our parents cooked us, the meals we made together, the things that come naturallyWhat we eat and when needs to be removed from most conversations about health. We need to reclaim our meals from the field of nutrition and take them back to the realm of human interaction, of conviviality, culture and the daily activities that define us as humans. As I said, we don’t need food solutions, we have them! They are called meals and recipes; they are called a birthday cake.The breakfast that I was so willing to give up in favour of intermittent fasting has proved itself for millennia as an effective way to sustain us and to mark the beginning of the day with a social gathering. If I forgo breakfast, what do I replace it with? Isn’t it just like the fat in the yoghurt? Give it up at your peril.The solution to the bogus question of what to feed ourselves is in front of our eyes. It comes in the form of roast chicken with roasted potatoes. It’s joyful, intuitive cooking: beans on toast, a cheesy omelette, dal with rice, a quick salad or a slow stew. We all know these things. We don’t need to break them down into nutrients or question their credentials.We know best what we need to eat – and when. The food our parents cooked for us, the meals we made together, the things that come naturally, instinctively, as we walk into the kitchen. That’s what we should be cooking and eating. If we slow down, spend time gathering real ingredients and paying attention as we cook them, we’re already there.Cook for yourself, cook for others, invite them over, give them a bowl of soup. The rest will follow.Explore more on these topicsFoodDiets and dietingNutritionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She is married to Christopher Robinson, a writer, whom she adores, and they have two gorgeous toddlers. Life could not be much better or fuller. Her new book is called Free. But it could just as easily be called Still Not Free.Knox’s search for freedom has led her down surprising paths. Most surprising was her decision to write to and then befriendGiuliano Mignini, the conspiracy-theorist prosecutor who created the shocking narrative that Kercher, a 21-year-old Londoner on a student exchange in Perugia, was killed in 2007 by Knox, Sollecito and Rudy Guede after a drug-fuelled sex game got out of hand. Shocking in itself. But even more shocking because Knox, then aged 20, and Sollecito, 23, had only been going out with each other for six days and neither had previous convictions. And most shocking of all because there was DNA evidence at the murder scene suggesting that Guede (who had been arrested the previous week in Milan for breaking into a nursery school armed with a knife) was the killer, and none implicating Knox and Sollecito.Knox, now 37, admits that her family think she’s mad for forging a relationship with Mignini. “They thought I had Stockholm syndrome and that I was in a weird abusive relationship with my abuser. But I was haunted by this ‘Why?’ question. Why did this happen to me? If they had done their job correctly, I would be a footnote in Meredith’s story.” It becomes clear over a two-hour conversation by video link how much talking to Mignini has helped her. It also becomes clear that having her murder conviction quashed was not enough for Knox. She is still haunted by the idea that the prosecutor believed she murdered Kercher, her housemate and fellow exchange student. What she wanted more than anything from Mignini was an admission, or even a confession, that he had got it, and her, wrong.Knox looks happy and confident, so different from the last time I saw her in Seattle in 2014 when she was waiting for the Italian jury to return its verdict in her retrial for murder. Back then, she was in pieces. Today, she’s wearing a quirky T-shirt with purple and yellow sleeves and a white alien in the middle. When Knox was a teenager who loved to play football and was known as Foxy Knoxy (a nickname her teammates gave her that was later used to sexualise and demonise her), people loved her quirkiness. But once she was arrested, quirky became downright weird in press coverage. The tabloids scrutinised everything for hints – she once had a loud party and a neighbour called the police; she did cartwheels in the police station (she didn’t know she was a suspect and she was stiff with tension); she brought a vibrator to Perugia (a joke present from friends); she smiled in court (at her parents, whom we couldn’t see); she got off with someone on a train and caught herpes. All of this was reported at the time as if it was evidence against her.View image in fullscreenKnox being taken to a court hearing in Italy in 2008.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/API first wrote to Knox in 2009 afterinterviewing her mother, Edda Mellas. By then, Knox and Sollecito had been in custody for 20 months while Guede was already serving a 30-year sentence for Kercher’s murder after being convicted in a fast-track trial. Mellas told me her daughter was compulsively honest, eccentric and naive. I remember her saying that if she bought a new pair of shoes and asked Knox for her opinion, she would tell her straight out that they were hideous. She couldn’t help but tell the truth, she said.But when Knox was interrogated after Kercher’s murder, she didn’t tell the truth. Under intense pressure, she confessed to her involvement in a murder she knew nothing about. Police interviews were supposed to be recorded, but these weren’t. She was interrogated for 53 hours over five days in a language she was just beginning to speak. She says she was slapped twice on the head. The police used a system devised to get confessions known as theReid technique. It’s highly effective – officers create imagined scenarios, tell suspects that other witnesses have contradicted their story or dobbed them in, make them think that they were lured into the crime by a more senior partner. The problem is it often leads to false confessions. Knox withdrew her statement hours later. Evidence showed it couldn’t be true. The man she implicated, alongside herself – Patrick Lumumba, her boss at the bar where she worked – had a cast-iron alibi. But it was too late. Everything was set in motion. And the prosecutor was not for turning.The letters Knox sent to me were touchingly innocent, in every sense – big bubble handwriting, hopeful quotes from Beatles songs: “Here comes the sun! Let it be! Be well, Simon. I’m in your hands, Amanda.” Next to this she had drawn an outline of her hands. If she was guilty, she had to be a psychopath – and she didn’t seem like a psychopath to me. We continued writing over the years. Her conviction was quashed in 2011 and she returned to America to try to rebuild her life. But in March 2013 the court of cassation, Italy’s highest court, announced it was overturning the acquittals and thatthere would be a retrial.When I spoke to her in Seattle in January 2014, it was the last week of the retrial, which had started inItalyfour months earlier, and which she did not attend. However hard she tried to hold herself together, she was distraught and often tearful. Finally, after 11 and a half hours’ deliberation, the jury found Knox and Sollecito guilty for a second time, and they were sentenced to 28 years and a half years and 25 years, respectively. Knox refused to return to Italy, but there was every chance she could be extradited. After the verdict, she told me: “It’s like I’ve just been diagnosed with cancer.” She said she was thinking back to her time in prison when “you could empathise with people who thought about taking their own life because they’re just … trapped”. I feared for her. (In Free, she says she considered killing herself in prison.)Fourteen months later, inMarch 2015, the murder convictions were overturned again. Knox got on with living, and we wrote to each other less frequently.This is the first time we’ve spoken in years and there’s plenty to catch up on. She tells me about her three-year-old daughter Eureka and 17-month-old son Echo; how the family lives on an island a ferry’s trip away from the family home in Seattle; how at home she is in this artsy forest community where difference is respected and creativity nurtured. I ask how her mother and stepfather, Chris, are. And still she’s upbeat. She says Chris decided he was done with being a computer guy and fulfilled an ambition by heading off to Panama to experience a different life, and they are all waiting for him to come home.Are Chris and Edda still together? Her tone changes. Her words slow, as they tend to when she’s upset and trying to keep control of her emotions. “No, they are not, actually. They got divorced this past year. Their relationship really struggled over the course of my incarceration, because they were apart for so long. Chris was living in Italy, because he could work there. And, after spending four years apart from each other, they never really learned how to be together in the same house ever again. So that’s one of those ripple effects of all of these things.” And now the tears come. “Part of me blames myself for it. If I hadn’t studied abroad and if this crazy thing hadn’t happened to me, maybe they would still be together now.”I had a lot of rage that I didn’t know where to place. My sister said she felt she was walking on eggshells around meThe ripple effect can be seen in so many ways. She says that when she got home the first time, she hoped she’d be able to pick up her life. What’s more, her family expected her to. But she couldn’t. There was so much to process. She’d been happy-go-lucky before. Now she’d sit at the dinner table, terse, anxious and moody. “I had a lot of rage that I didn’t know where to place. My sister said she felt she was walking on eggshells around me. In prison, I was sad, and once I was ‘free’, but not really free, I was angry.”She was so confused. “I felt rejected by the world, that there was no place for me any more, and I was angry about that.” She knows it was unfair on her family. They had put their lives on hold for four years, given their all emotionally, physically and financially to support her, were suffering their own form of PTSD, and this was how she was thanking them.Did her mum understand what she was going through? “She knew something was wrong, but didn’t know the right way to help me. That was scary for her, because while I was in prison, it was very clear what the answer was – prove Amanda is innocent and get her out of prison. Now it was, ‘How do I help my daughter heal? I don’t understand why Amanda’s angry right now or why she’s still washing her underwear in the sink when there’s a perfectly good washing machine right over there.’” Did you understand why you were doing that? “At the time, no. I suppose I wasn’t able to navigate the free world like a free person so I just found myself in a new kind of prison.”It wasn’t just a metaphorical prison. “I couldn’t open my bedroom window because there were paparazzi outside in the street taking photos of me.” How long were they there? “Months.” Even after the paparazzi disappeared, she’d discover pictures of herself in the papers and have no idea where they had come from. “I’d find out that somebody had been stalking me on my walk to the grocery store and they got pictures of me wearing sweatpants or giving my boyfriend some change so that he could go buy a coffee, and it would be like, ‘What is Amanda paying off her boyfriend not to say?’ or, ‘Look how ugly Foxy Knoxy is now’. For years I never knew if I was being stalked by somebody, and I lived in this constant state of paranoia.”View image in fullscreenKnox, photographed last month.Photograph: Patrick Kehoe/The GuardianKnox was back at university, but she was frightened of talking to people, let alone making friends. Some people thought she was a monster, some thought she was a catch, and some just treated her as cheap entertainment. So she stuck with the people who had known her pre-conviction. She had relationships with two former male friends, and got engaged to one of them. But gradually she realised he had also objectified her. “My fiance told me that he imagined me as Joan of Arc.” She shudders. “I didn’t like people fantasising about me instead of seeing me for who I really was.” It didn’t seem any different from the people who wrote to her in prison telling her she was a satanic slut or those who said they wanted to marry her.Some people think Meredith’s identity disappears next to my identity. I don’t blame them; in a way it’s true. She became the footnote of a story where I was the central figureThe press continued to devour stories about her. Everything she did was judged against Kercher’s fate. “Any joke that I make, especially about my own trauma, was seen as being at the expense of Meredith. And any good thing in my life must be at the expense of Meredith, because my identity and her death are inextricably interlinked in so many people’s minds.” The way she sees it is they are flip sides of the same coin. It could just as easily have been her who was killed, she says, and Kercher who was jailed. “Even if I hadn’t been wrongly accused and put in jail, I would still be going to therapy because I came home one day and found my house broken into and my roommate murdered. Like it would bethedefining trauma of my life, just that.” Her face is blotchy with tears. “I just happened to be the one of us who got to go home to her family and got to keep living her life. Does that mean that I should hide and pretend that I don’t exist because that’s an offence to Meredith’s memory that I get to keep existing?”What people don’t realise or won’t accept, Knox says, is that she and Kercher were friends. Today she regards her as an inspiration. “Meredith is like this ghost sitting on my shoulder who fought for her life and didn’t succeed, who is telling me to fight for my life.” She stops, uncomfortably. “I know that’s not what people like to hear. Some people think that her identity disappears next to my identity. And, again, I don’t blame people for having that idea. She became the footnote of a story where I was the central figure.” Knox says it sickened her the day she read a headline in the New York Post saying“Man Who Killed Amanda Knox’s Roommate Freed on Community Service”.A turning point came after theInnocence Project, an organisation that works to exonerate the wrongly convicted, invited her to a conference in Portland. The idea of attending a meeting with a bunch of people who had been declared innocent horrified her. After all, she had only recently been reconvicted. “I was not even technically an exoneree. I was just like, Jesus Christ, I don’t even belong at this conference.”But her mother convinced her to go. One of many moving moments in the book is when Knox turns up, paralysed with fear, and two young men approach her. They see how nervous she is, how reluctant to be there, and tell her: “You don’t have to explain a thing, little sister. We know.”From that moment, she says, she was dedicated to the Innocence Project. “The realisation that what I had been through wasn’t unique was my first moment of knowing that there was a way for me to connect with other human beings, and that I could have a purpose.” She had found her tribe. And her tribe looked and sounded very different from her – the majority were male, black and a good deal older than her. Most had spent far longer than her in prison. That was also when she realised she had been relatively lucky in her misfortune. “I’ll never forget an exoneree telling me at that conference, ‘Thank God you got wrongly convicted, Amanda, because before a little girl from the suburbs of Seattle, a college-educated white girl, got wrongly convicted, no one believed that it was real. So I’m sorry for everything you had to go through, but thank God you did, because now it’s undeniable.’ That really stuck with me.” Ever since she has campaigned – telling her story, making people aware of other miscarriages of justice, and now she is fighting to have the law changed. “One of my battles is with the Washington legislature, trying to ban police deception during interrogations.Police are allowed to lie!It’s an incredibly dangerous practice because it’s not just coercive – when you do that to people it warps their understanding of what is real. I’m working with theWashington Innocence Projectto try to ban police deception and also to get all interactions with police officers to be recorded.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Patrick Kehoe/The GuardianIn 2015, she met Christopher Robinson. He knew that she had been involved in a scandal, but didn’t ask about it. He told her that he wouldn’t Google her. Did he really not know your backstory? Knox smiles. “No. He thought it had something to do with someone being pushed out of a window.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

At that point, Robinson realised he couldn’t avoid finding out about her past. So he went to the other extreme – he did a deep dive, and read everything that was out there about Knox. He discovered the internet trolls and took them on. He was sure he could make them see that his girlfriend was a good person who had been grievously wronged. “I told him that you can’t convince people on the internet, but he needed to go through it himself. So he drove himself mad for about three months trying, until he finally realised and let it go.”Robinson gave Knox a new confidence. He made her realise she didn’t have to apologise for her existence. But like every exoneree I’ve met, she was unable to let the past go. When I interviewed her in Seattle 11 years ago, the thing that stuck with me most was her self-loathing. She had considered herself strong before Italy, but now she regarded herself a “weak” character, because she had yielded to intimidatory tactics, made a false confession and implicated the innocent Lumumba, for which she was sentenced to three years for slander.However quickly she withdrew her “confession”, she had still made it. Although she has been cleared for a decade, she knows people still question her innocence, or simply believe she’s guilty. In recent years she seems to have been trying to win back her self-respect as much as the respect of others by doing the difficult and unexpected. That included writing to Mignini. In Italy, prosecutors are involved with a case from the start – they are supposed to investigate “inquisitorially”, or neutrally, then if a suspect is charged they prosecute adversarially.The astonishing thing about Mignini is at the time he began investigating Knox’s case he was himself facing charges, relating to the infamous “Monster of Florence” murder case when he argued that a satanic cult was responsible for eight double murders that took place between 1974 and 1985, although evidence suggested a lone killer. Mignini was charged with planting bugging devices in journalists’ cars and abusing his power to question reporters. He was allowed to continue practising as a prosecutor despite being charged. He was eventually cleared on appeal after being found guilty on four charges of exceeding the powers of his office.Has she asked the prosecutor whether he believes she is innocent? ‘Yes, and he won’t answer. He says that I am not the  person he thought I was’Mignini, now 74, wrote back to Knox, and they became regular correspondents. As their relationship developed, it became like an existential tug of war – her hurt and grievance on one side, his pride and grandiosity on the other.She discovered they had things in common: a love of animals, classical music and literature. They were both fans of The Lord of the Rings. He told her he identified them with characters in the epic fantasy. “The character he identified with was King Théoden, who did bad things when possessed by a spirit, but ultimately turned out to be an upright person who was saving his people. He said that I was like Éowyn, Théoden’s niece. I find that so interesting because the thing she is most afraid of is a cage. There are moments like that where I go, is he trying to tell me something or is this just a coincidence?”Has she asked him straight out whether he believes she is innocent? “Yes. And he won’t answer. He says that I am not the person he thought he was prosecuting. Or he’ll say things like, ‘It’s very likely, and it’s possible that I made some mistakes.’ The thing that he’s most afraid of is being thought of as somebody who went after a person that he knew to be innocent. He wants to be clear that, at the time, he believed what he was prosecuting.”So he does think she’s innocent now? It’s not as simple as that, she says. “He’s said publicly that he now thinks that I had nothing to do with the murder, but that I was still physically present. So we go back to what was being told to me in my interrogation room. He says things to me like, ‘I know you’re not lying. I just think that you don’t remember what really happened’, which isincrediblypatronising.”At times, their exchanges were comic. He signed Christmas cards “Merry Christmas from your Prosecutor”. She had called him her prosecutor to remind him of the power dynamic, but he interpreted it as a term of affection. At other times, the exchanges were eerie (he asked her if she had ever thought of becoming a mother just after she had a miscarriage that he knew nothing about), and sometimes even poignant. On one occasion, he told her: “I will never forget the grandness of your soul.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Patrick Kehoe/The GuardianDoes she now regard him as a friend? “Good question. How do you define what a friend is? Do I think that he wishes me well? Yes. Someone who cares about you? I think he truly does care about me. Someone who likes you? Yeah, I think he likes me. And you know what? In some ways, I like him.” A friend is someone you trust, I suggest. “I trust Giuliano to be who he is. But the thing I can’t trust him to do yet is proclaim to the world that he was wrong and that people should leave me alone and that I’m innocent.”Does she think her parents were right to suggest it was a crazy idea to get in touch with Mignini? Not at all, she says – meeting him face to face, in Italy in 2022, 15 years after Kercher was murdered and she was jailed, was the most empowering thing she has done. As well as wanting him to absolve you, it feels like you’ve undertaken a form of aversion therapy, I say. “Yes!Yes!” she replies enthusiastically. “Anyone who has been hurt by someone wants the person who hurt them to acknowledge the hurt. It’s not just enough for everyone else to acknowledge that you’ve been hurt. I walked into that room feeling like he had all of the power over me. And I walked away from that room feeling like, oh my God, I have all of the power over him.” In what way? “Because as much as I want him to absolve me, I think he wants me to absolve him more. The one time in my life where I felt unstoppable was when I realised that it wasn’t about what I was going to get from him, it was about what I was going to give him.”Over the past few years, it feels as if she has been trying to unpick her past, stitch by stitch. So when she was in Italy she went to visit the home she shared briefly with Kercher. “In that moment, I could grieve for both her and me, because a part of me did die in Italy.” She says she would love to visit Meredith’s grave one day, but she won’t do it without the Kercher family’s blessing.On the day Kercher was killed, Knox and Sollecito had planned to go truffle hunting near the medieval town of Gubbio. She had never seen a truffle before, never mind eaten one, and was so excited at the prospect. When she was in Perugia, she, her husband, her mother and Eureka met up with Sollecito and they finally had their day truffle hunting, 15 years on. Like her, she says, Sollecito, who spentfour years in prison for the murder, has struggled with life post-conviction.Earlier this year, she was back in Italy. Her conviction for the slander of Lumumba still stands, and she was appealing against it. InJanuary, the court of cassation upheld the verdict. Lumumba was delighted; she was devastated. She understands why he was pleased – because it had a ruinous impact on his life. “He was arrested in the middle of the night, scaring the crap out of his wife and their baby. He was brought to the police office and locked in a cell without any explanation. He was thrown in prison for two weeks. Even after he was released, they would not release his property. The pub remained closed for criminal investigation for three months for no goddamn reason, so he lost his lease. He had to sell his home in Perugia because he didn’t have enough money. He lost a lot and he has not been compensated for that loss in Italy.” Having said all that, she insists it can’t be slander when it has been accepted that Knox’s confession was obtained unfairly, she had withdrawn it so quickly, and Lumumba produced an alibi within a day.For all the weakness she saw in herself, Knox has proved herself a scrapper extraordinaire. And she’s still fighting for her right to live her life and own her story. After it was announced that Disney-owned streaming service Hulu was making aneight-part drama about the miscarriage of justice, with Knox as an executive producer, she was attacked for profiting from Kercher’s murder. Francesco Maresca, the lawyer representing the Kercher family, said: “On the one hand, Amanda says the trial created so much suffering for her but then she tries to have it all – the fame and the money.” Kercher’s sister, Stephanie, said: “Our family has been through so much and it is difficult to understand how this serves any purpose.”Knox is all too aware of the criticism. “People say, why are you continuing to tell your story? Why are you continuing to elevate and platform yourself? And to that I would simply say, ‘Because this is my story. This is all I have, and I think that it’s valuable – not just valuable to me, it’s valuable to other people.’ If there’s anything that I’ve learned from my experiences, it’s that I can connect with people and my story can connect with people, and that it matters. Just like Meredith’s life mattered and her story matters, so does mine.”Free: My Search for Meaning by Amanda Knox is published by Headline on 25 March.

Currently a professor of critical theory and creative writing at Manchester University, he released his debut poetry collection,Thinking With Trees,in 2021. His second collection,Self-Portrait as Othello,(2023) won theTS Eliotand theForward prize. Through time spent in the north of England and Jamaica’s rural Coffee Grove district, his debut in nonfiction,The Possibility of Tenderness(Penguin), intimately explores ideas around class, leisure, economics and self-discovery, looking closely at the life of his farmer grandmother, as well as the plants and people that shaped who he is today. Allen-Paisant lives in Leeds with his wife and two children.ThePossibility of Tendernessis a departure from your work in poetry. How did you go about writing it?I started with a mix of poetry and prose. Then I thought to write a series of essays [and] hammer out some of these big questions around leisure and class within nature but I remember thinking: “All of the ideas that I’m talking about in a theoretical way, I can bring them all out if I just tell a story.” My grandma, “Mama”, she’s the protagonist outside myself. I can use the story of her life to talk about planting, food independence, food sovereignty, living with plants, plants as medicine, globalisation and its effects and kinship with the land.I needed to write to understand where I am now in relation to where I came fromWhat do you want the book to communicate?Living between two different landscapes. I wrote this book to understand how the place I grew up, which is so far away from where I am now both socially and class-wise, shaped me as a writer. I’ve taken a journey… I needed to write to understand where I am now in relation to where I came from.When did that desire to look back at your life in this way begin?I was walking one night [home through Roundhay Park], I cut across a field and, perhaps it was the silence of it all, it suddenly hit me – that I’m living here in this place [with all of this] space and nature. A place where you can roam, where there’s a sense of freedom, of openness. But how did I get here? How come somebody like me is here? I felt for the first time that I had become a different person. We didn’t plan to live here. It’s a very affluent area. Walking across that field in the dead of night unlocked a door and I started to think about nature, trees, birds, big spaces. [Living here] is a kind of privilege on the face of it. But why couldn’t I think about Coffee Grove as a privilege? Was it that bad? I grew up in nature. I grew up among a wholesome green with equality, kinship, exchange, social solidarity. I had all of that. But I had blocked out my background. I think a lot of migrants from the Caribbean do block out our background when you think it’s associated with poverty.What emotions did thinking about your early life bring up?There was that sense of loss and wanting to retrieve something. A part of that was wanting to retrieve the people. But there was also a feeling of euphoria. I found something that brings me meaning.You have written about nature before in your poetry…My first book of poems,Thinking With Trees, came from going on walks, but [before then] I had shied away from nature poetry. I always had in the back of my mind, as a black poet, that you need to talk about more pressing things. A lot ofThe Possibility of Tendernesswas driven by this impetus: “Who said natural writing can’t look like this?” Me talking about class, a non-romanticised version of nature, about people working hard, having dirt under their fingernails.There is a set of concerns in nature writing that doesn’t easily imagine black bodies and lives, but when you consider the history of black people in Britain, it’s critical to situate our identities and our histories within [nature] because we are connected to that history. My little hillside district of Coffee Grove is deeply connected [to the UK]. It was a coffee plantation using enslaved labour from the 18th century founded by a Scottish planter. I wanted to write about these entangled issues, but at the same time, write about joy and the sense of belonging we find in the natural world. We belong in the picture.How did you find writing intimately about the lives of people you care about?There’s a responsibility that I feel towards my people. A big part of the premise of the book is dignity. So often, my kind of environment is portrayed in a lowly light. I wanted to tell a different story. That informed the characterisation. I even had to change my language in certain aspects. I remember my friend, the writer Jacob Ross, read an early version where I was talking about [the local Rasta herbalist] Congolin and his ideas about plants. Jacob was saying: “You need to not overexplain. You need to assume [Congolin’s] vantage point.” I had to be careful of not speaking to a western gaze.What books are on your bedside table?The Book of Disquietby Fernando Pessoa. Jacqueline Crooks’sFire Rush.We Were Thereby Lanre Bakare.W, Or the Memory of Childhoodby Georges Perec.What’s your typical writing process?I’m a chaotic, unstructured writer. I write when I get the time. I have two young kids and life is very demanding.It’s been more than a year since you won the TS Eliot and the Forwardprize for poetry. What have those wins done for you as a writer?Those wins have been mind-blowing. Unexpected, extraordinary gifts. When it comes to the TS Eliot, I’m still getting used to the fact that I won that. It is surreal. Concretely speaking, it’s transformed my life. It’s brought more opportunities my way. It’s hard to think of a stronger type of affirmation, [although writers] shouldn’t need validation. We have to know how to work without it.The Possibility of Tenderness: A Jamaican Memoir of Plants and Dreamsby Jason Allen-Paisant is published by Penguin (£18.99).

I had a lack of horror around gore, I’m not squeamish at all, which was helpful when it came to all those needles for IVF. I thought about being a surgeon. I also thought it would be interesting to become a fishmonger. I’m fascinated by fish – I don’t know why.As an only child,radio was my companion. I had a little battery-operated radio at the table next to my cereal bowl.I broadly exist onsix hours sleep. AfterToday, I’ve got about half an hour of chat left in me before I need to be silent.The goal in everyinterview, the absolute dream, is fresh snow. You’re walking somewhere no one has gone before.I wasn’t a rudechild, but I was certainly inquisitive. I have a curiosity. Sometimes, in conversation, people say, is that the radio you or the real you?Radiomeisme.I routinely workthrough bone-grinding pain. Work is my salvation fromendometriosis. It fills my brain.Being a parentteaches you how to not be the main character in your own life, to play a different role in your own existence. When you’re forced to learn that, you’re also forced to relearn what made your life enjoyable before, and how to access that.I was left withtwo kids when my husband returned to work. I decided to survive the week by writing down everything I felt – a portrait of maternity leave. I hadn’t expected to have a daughter and thought it would be a great map for her should she ever go down this road.On radio, you needto think of someone to talk to, so I think of my Auntie Jean, always a crafty fag on the go, on the white wine by 6pm, maybe a champagne cocktail depending on the night. I thought of her the first time I didQuestion Time, the first time I didWoman’s Hourand the first time I stepped out seven months ago and didToday. She meant so much to me, and that has helped me in moments of doing something new.There are parallelsbetween maternity leave and lockdown: only being able to get out once a day to your local park, knowing your area better than you ever have before, there being limited things you can do, wondering who you are, having an existential crisis.The thing I find hardis toggling between work and parenting. The jaggedness comes in the gear changes between my different roles. It’s almost like relearning a dance step every time.Remember thatthose who matter don’t mind and those who do mind don’t matter. I have a job where I can get judged on a moment in time, and it amazes me how judgments can be formed without the full picture – but that’s the world we’re living in. You’ve got to back facts, you’ve got to back yourself, you’ve got to have people around you that you trust.Maternity Service: A Love Letter to Mothers from the Frontline of Maternity Leave by Emma Barnett is published by Fig Tree at £12.99.

But why is it framed as a London story? Bradford-born writer Lanre Bakare explores how it reaches far beyond the capital – and farther back in timeLanre BakareSat 22 Mar 2025 07.55 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 08.53 EDTShareThe DVD slips into the loading tray, and I watch in hope rather than expectation. I’ve been told Tony Palmer’sThe Wigan Casinois the greatest ever depiction of a northern soul all-nighter, and I want to see it for myself. The film is a window into the underground scene that emerged in the 1970s, powered by soul records that had flopped years earlier. But I’m not interested in the music or the dancing – it’s the crowd I’ve got an eye on.I spot what I’m after. A young man, glistening under the spotlight as he spins balletically in a yellow vest. Then another person catches my eye with his perfectly picked-out afro. It’s a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment, so I rewind to check, and yes, it’s true. A few minutes later, two girls clamber on to a coach, and one waves goodbye down the camera lens. Another boy squeezes through the crush at the front door. These young people are there for the same reason as everyone else: hard-to-find soul music that’s perfectly crafted for dancing. But all of them stand out. They’re different from the majority of the 1,200 dancers crammed into Wigan Casino. They’re Black and British.View image in fullscreenA Black dancer at a northern soul event at Wigan Casino in 1978.Photograph: Kevin Cummins/Getty ImagesSeeing those Black faces contradicted what I’d heard about the scene. Northern soul was about white working-class audiences falling in love with and coveting forgotten Black American music. My bookWe Were Therestarted as a cultural expedition. I wanted to find something that wasn’t supposed to exist: Black northern soul fans from the 1970s and 80s. When I tracked them down, I found their stories changed the way I thought not just about northern soul but about Britain at the start of the Thatcher era. I wanted to know why. I began to wonder what other stories I might have been mistold or had never explored at all – and what those stories could reveal to me, and others, about Britain then and now.No European country has been changed by Black culture more than the UK. British music, fashion, sport, literature, TV and film have had their DNA altered by the influence of millions of people who have come to this small island from across the African diaspora. Our sounds, food, languages, intellect and sartorial choices have meshed with what was already here to create modern British culture. Some of our biggest Hollywood stars – Daniel Kaluuya, Cynthia Erivo, David Oyelowo, Letitia Wright, John Boyega – are Black; designers such as Nicholas Daley and Grace Wales Bonner transmit our styles globally; artists such as Sonia Boyce and John Akomfrah represent Britain on the biggest stages; much of England’s men’s football team is of Black heritage.Black British cultureis an inseparable part of British culture.Modern Black Britishness, which has spread and morphed into myriad forms, was forged in the late 1970s and the 80s, a time of huge ruptures and tumult – social, economic and political. Everywhere you looked, a battle was taking place, and every single gain had to be fought for: fromBirmingham, where academics such as Stuart Hall and Rastafarians were taking on racism in the media, to Leeds and Sheffield, where pioneering music producers would express a new Black British confidence, and even to the countryside, where the Black Environment Network would battle for their own place in the UK’s rural idyll.This was a time of artistic and cultural creation unrivalled in the 20th century. A period when Black British culture flourished and contemporary British culture began to form. But our understanding of that influence is limited, and for many, it starts and ends in one place:London.View image in fullscreenGreat Britain rugby league star Ellery Hanley, who grew up in Leeds.Photograph: Bob Martin/Getty ImagesI was born in the middle of the Thatcher era: 1984. My memories are fuzzy, softened by time; half-remembered fragments. Images of the poll tax riots, milk breaks at primary school, Ian Wright’s gold tooth and Norman Lamont’s eyebrows. But when I think of my home town ofBradford, there are details that come into focus. I can still run through the surnames like a Rolodex in my head: the Taylors, the Sarrs, the Davids, the Ibegbunas, the Ekongs, the Fehintolas, the Cookes, the Oakleys and the Braithwaites. The families you knew and the families you knew of – either by reputation or connection. I can still plot a chart that links the Black families in my area of Bradford: the faces, the cars, the haircuts, the living room furniture and the intellects.I left Bradford at the age of 18 and lived all over the UK –Liverpool, Newcastle, Sheffield, Bristol – in my early 20s before settling in London 14 years ago. In the capital, I’ve often been met by other Black people who express amazement at the fact Black life existed beyond the M25. Their responses weren’t hostile – there was an anthropological desire to understand this otherness. My time away didn’t make me reassess the Black culture I grew up with in Bradford, but it did make me question why it was so rarely acknowledged and little understood by everyone from the average person on the street to the institutions and centres of power in London.View image in fullscreenWarp’s Winston Hazel and DJ Parrot in Sheffield, 1990.Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty ImagesIf you want to understand the unrest that spread around the country in 1981, you’ll most likely be pointed towards events in Brixton. While the south London neighbourhood was a centre of Black culture and resistance, it wasn’t the only one – there were dozens around the UK, like in Liverpool, which had a different, older connection to the unrest. If you want to understand the far right and resistance to groups such as the National Front, you’ll find documentary-makers, journalists and writers referring to thebattle of Lewishamin 1977 as a moment,themoment, when communities came together to fight back against the provocative marches. The Rock Against Racism concert in London’s Victoria Park one year later, where 100,000 people turned out to see the Clash, X-Ray Spex and Steel Pulse perform, is held up as the exemplar of when culture was used to counter rising fascism. If you want to understand the hostile relationship between the police and Black communities, you’ll find accounts of the unrest at Notting Hill carnival in 1976 as the totemic battle when Black Britain fought back.All those events were crucial, but all feed into a simplistic narrative about Black Britishness, which suggests that a group of people, most of whom arrived in the UK after the second world war, took to the streets to rebel – with anger and with violence. This consensus view allows little room for nuance, and obscures a bigger, more complex tapestry of life in Britain during the Thatcher years. There are people in my book whose families go back five or six generations in the UK – long before the Empire Windrush arrived; there are artists and authors, legal campaigners, feminists, ravers, rude boys and rugby league superstars.Some of the stories completely upend established cultural lore. Take the one about how house music came to the UK: the established narrative is that four intrepid Londoners – Danny Rampling, Johnny Walker, Nicky Holloway and Paul Oakenfold – went to Ibiza in 1987 and imported house music, providing the building blocks for the rave scene in the UK. But before acid house went mainstream, Manchester’s Black dancers were the first to interpret the sounds that Chicago DJs such as Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles were playing across the Atlantic. They did so in clubs like Moss Side’s The Reno, Black-owned establishments that operated from the margins while acting as incubators for the Black culture that in turn fed into mainstream British life.As the tumult of Margaret Thatcher’s first term took hold, Black British people were confronted by a country that was becoming more hostile to their presence. Far-right groups marched through immigrant areas and made substantial gains at the ballot box. Mainstream politicians, including Thatcher, weaponised race in a way no other prominent politician had done before. But in 1981, thousands took to the streets, causing unrest that spread around the country, from Bristol to Bradford, as a whole generation rejected what little they were being offered in Britain. This was a time of conflict, not just in the Falklands but here, on the home front, in cities and towns up and down the country, wherever Black Britons were found.In many – but by no means all – cases, the protagonists in these stories are the children ofWindrush. Their parents – or in some cases, grandparents – came to Britain in that great wave of immigration that reshaped Britain in the postwar era. Their parents might have felt they were British because of their new citizenship, but once they got to the UK, they found they were “West Indian”, a catch-all term that no one from the Caribbean would use. Their children were in a different position – yes, they were born in Britain but the question that hung over them was: did that make them British?View image in fullscreenVisual artist Claudette Johnson from Manchester.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianOther Black Britons have a different origin story. Their parents weren’t from the Caribbean or Africa. Neither were their grandparents nor, in many cases, great-grandparents. In Liverpool andCardiff, we find communities with roots dating back to before slavery was abolished across the British empire in the 1830s. These communities were the original multicultural Britain, and they often faced hostility that saw them segregated and attacked. Their stories are hiding in plain sight.For many years, London was where the majority of Black British people lived – hardly surprising given its economic power and the opportunities it offered. Notting Hill, Ladbroke Grove, Hackney, Peckham and Brent: all over the capital Black communities were growing and adjusting to life in Britain. But that is changing. The last census showed that, for the first time since ethnicity was included in 1991, the majority of Black British people live outside the capital.As these communities develop, it’s becoming increasingly unlikely they’ll see themselves represented in popular culture. After the watershed moment of the global Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in 2020, a difficult and stilted conversation about race was forced in the UK. The creative industries tried – often cynically – to address longstanding absences in their collections or portfolios where Black British art should have been. Books, TV shows and films were commissioned and became part of a cultural wave that broke in the wake of BLM.Series about frustrated creatives (Dreaming Whilst Black), opulent family sagas (Riches), Black kids in public schools (Boarders), sci-fi films set on dystopian housing estates (The Kitchen), award-winning gang tales (Top Boy), mould-breaking urban drama (Blue Story), unique accounts of trauma and creativity (I May Destroy You), Black women navigating love and life (Queenie) – there have been so many, yet every single one of those shows or films is set in London or is about Londoners. These aren’t Black British stories; they are part of an ever increasing Black London canon. For commissioners and editors, London is the Black story. But for me and thousands of others, it isn’t – and never could be. The Black London experience doesn’t map neatly on to every Black British experience. There are similarities and staples – food, language, music, hair products – but what makes the experiences different is history.View image in fullscreenBirmingham reggae group Steel Pulse.Photograph: Echoes/RedfernsI’ve found that as soon as you widen the parameters of Black British culture beyond the capital, there’s an untapped reserve to draw from. There are stories that make us reassess moments in our recent history; by examining them, we can understand ourselves and our impact on culture and life in the country as a whole. That reassessment is necessary.Just as I was finishing my book, new research was released showing that 50% of Britons couldn’t name one Black British historical figure. The UK, the authors said, knew “shockingly little” about its own Black history. We’ve had an important wave of corrective histories from David Olusoga, Jason Okundaye, Jim Pines, June Givanni, Ferdinand Dennis, Stella Dadzie, Paterson Joseph, Hakim Adi, Marika Sherwood and Stephen Bourne, but clearly we need more. Perhaps one way of addressing this lack of cut-through is to make these stories truly Black and British – rooting them in locations that have been overlooked, in areas that people don’t think of as Black. Maybe then more British people will pay attention to the history of this small but important island and think of Black history as having taken place in their own towns, cities or parishes, as well as in London.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The journey sent me into dusty archives and on internet trawls searching for names scrawled down on yellowed paper. I spoke to people at the centre of extraordinary events who’ve never been asked about them. I managed to get hold of some interviewees a few months before they died and discovered that many others I wanted to speak to had already passed on. This history might have been staring us in the face, but it’s fragile.There are so many more stories waiting to be unearthed, in cities like Nottingham and Belfast, and towns including Luton and Plymouth. Black history is everywhere on these islands. Without Black people in Wigan, Bradford, Ambleside and Wolverhampton, the country we live in and the culture it has produced would look completely different. What I’ve discovered made me reconsider what I thought Black Britain was and is, what it can encompass and where it might go next.This is an edited extract from We Were There, which is published byBodley Headon17 April.To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Among their number were dozens of Black northern soul fans who influenced the scene and navigated the late 70s in Britain, a time when the far right was on the rise.BradfordThe wrongful arrest and conviction in 1978 of George Lindo, a textile worker from Bradford, triggered an international campaign for his release. At the same time, an American film crew came to the UK to record the reality of life in Britain for its Black residents. The film they made,Blacks Britannica– which captured some of the Lindo campaign – would be banned and censored but its warning proved prophetic.BirminghamAs a moral panic about “Black muggers” and Rastafarians spread in 1979, an academic from Jamaica called Stuart Hall turned the lens around on the media, including the BBC, and accused British journalists of being complicit in the hugely negative coverage Black Britons received. His main inspiration would be the world outside his door in Birmingham, especially the multicultural area of Handsworth.View image in fullscreenHandsworth-born poet Benjamin Zephaniah.Photograph: Michael Ward/Rex FeaturesLiverpoolIn 1981, violent unrest moved around the country, leaving many city centres looking like war zones after clashes between Black communities and the police. Unemployment, poverty and policing fuelled the disturbances in Liverpool, where documentary-maker Bea Freeman captured the thoughts of Black scousers who worked with her on landmark Channel 4 film They Haven’t Done Nothing.WolverhamptonIn the city that was home to Enoch Powell, who became notorious after his “Rivers of Blood” speech, a new generation of Black British artists gathered. Their work reflected the chaotic and racist place Britain was in the early 1980s, but also questioned colonialism and the British empire. In October 1982, they invited other Black artists to a convention that became a launchpad for some of UK art’s biggest names.ManchesterIn Moss Side, behind a small black door, there was a club that acted as a hub connecting all parts of Black Manchester.The Renowelcomed guests including Muhammad Ali, and was linked to the Pan-African movement that had deep roots in the city. As Manchester was reshaped after the second world war, Manchester’s Black population was caught up in the churn and the club became a refuge and incubator for Black British culture.The countrysideAway from the cities, Black Britons were trying to get a foothold as the 80s progressed. The Black Environment Network took on the complacency of politicians who refused to see rural racism as an issue, and included Ingrid Pollard whose artwork Pastoral Interlude tackled the reality for Black Britons who ventured into the green and pleasant land.View image in fullscreenTwo of the Cardiff Three, Yusef Abdullahi (left) and Tony Paris, in 1992, freed after being wrongfully convicted of the murder of Lynette White in 1988.Photograph: Press Association ImagesCardiffCardiff’s Black population was one of the most significant in the country, known as the melting pot that had produced the pop star Shirley Bassey. But it had always been maligned, fetishised and – on occasions – attacked. In the late 80s, as an urban renewal plan sought to transform its Butetown area, a horrific murder saw a group of men framed and an entire community slandered.EdinburghIn January 1989, a Somali asylum seeker’s murder in the Scottish capital appalled the small Black community north of the border. The Lothian Black Forum, which included the former Guardian columnist Gary Younge, campaigned to force the Scottish public and politicians to see the reality of life for Black Scots who were constantly told racism was the “English disease”.Leeds and SheffieldAs the 1980s drew to a close and Thatcher finally faced defeat, a new sound – created by working-class Black Britons – took hold of the rave scene. Bleep’n’bass emanated from places including Leeds and Sheffield. At the same time, a group of Black rugby league players, including Ellery Hanley and Martin Offiah, took the game to new heights and created the blueprint for modern sporting celebrities.Explore more on these topicsBlack British cultureBritish identity and societyHistory booksSocial historyRaceNorthern soulSoulextractsShareReuse this content"

And avocados? Forget itSat 22 Mar 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 15.48 EDTShareAt a party not so long ago, a friend told me that she was about to leave. “I’m hungry,” she said, her eyes sliding towards the coats. “I’m going home for a bowl of Weetabix.” I greeted this with some surprise, if not outright derision. Wouldn’t she prefer a pizza with me? But already she was entering an ecstatic state. “Weetabix islovely,” she went on. “Sugar, cold milk … ” Half a century of eating the stuff had taught her the optimum point at which to devour it, a fleeting moment she could judge by sight. Its biscuit-dryness had to be gone, but it needed to be soft rather than soggy. Her eyes half closed, she wantonly mimed pushing a spoon into this late-night ambrosia.I thought of this the other day, when Alan Titchmarsh, TV gardener and aspirant steamy novelist, informed the nation it should stop eating avocados on the grounds of their environmental impact (to summarise: many of those sold in the UK are grown on land that was formerly rainforest; their cultivation involves huge amounts of water in places where it’s scarce; they must be shipped 5,000 miles or more to reach us). “There’s a lot to be said for cornflakes, Weetabix and Shreddies,” he announced, deploying the homely tartness that made him such a hit onPebble MillandGround Forceto deal with the 21st-century hipster breakfast of choice. Ha! Next time my friend refused a dinner date on the grounds that she would rather commune with a bowl of cereal, I would have no choice but to mention him. Several times. In my best (native) Yorkshire accent.First, eggs benedict mounted a gooey putsch – then things turned fully shakshukaTo be serious, though, there is a circle here – for me, and perhaps for you. Titchmarsh’s edict, a statement to which theTimesdevoted a leader column, plots the story of our lives in breakfasts. Once, after all, it was so simple: cereal, toast and tea came as standard; a full English was a treat if you were away for the weekend. But then, eggs benedict having already mounted its gooey putsch, about a decade ago things turned fully shakshuka. If it sounds spoilt to talk of the tyranny of choice in the context of breakfast, all I can say is don’t you always feel slightly anxious when you utter the words “just toast, please” at a hotel, as if you’re somehow letting down your waiter?In my childhood, breakfast was only ever toast. Cereal was eaten first thing by kids in TV ads, but in our house it was reserved for post-school hunger, to be consumed in the moments between taking off your coat andGrange Hill.Avocados, of course, were highly exotic, even rare: in restaurants, they were the starter that succeeded (after decades) fruit juice or half a grapefruit. Did this exoticism lie behind the sudden craze, in the early 1980s, for avocado bathroom suites? I’ve always wondered about this. But either way, according to memory, they tasted much better then – by which I mean that they tasted ofsomething, even if it was only the olive oil you lugged home from France in the Datsun and a little light social progress.When I was a student, I rarely ate breakfast: if I was up early enough for there to be a wait for lunch, a Mars bar would do it (I was like Prof Tim delay-your-breakfast-for-the-sake-of-your-gut Spectoravant la lettre). In my twenties, I ate bad Danish pastries that were delivered to our desks in the newsroom via a trolley as compensation for the fact that we were indentured. My thirties were the restaurant years, when I spent far too much on what was by now called brunch. My forties, when I was newly and happily married, was the era of devotedly making bacon sandwiches for my beloved (OK, I still do this). And now, here we are, preparing to cancel avocados.Personally, I won’t be bereft; I never got with the programme so far as smashing them goes. Yet still I salute their unlikely journey. In their huge stones, knobbly skins and propensity for causing hand injuries, I see an island nation desperately seeking sophistication. To pinch from TS Eliot, in our beginning is our end. In succession, breakfast dishes rise and fall. We turn back now to our Weetabix gratefully, tasting its particular nothingness afresh.Explore more on these topicsBreakfastRachel Cooke on foodFoodAvocadoscommentShareReuse this content"

Qualifiers matter only in as much as they have to be negotiated.Friday’s win by England over Albaniafell into a very familiar pattern. The brave new world of Thomas Tuchel turned out to look a lot like the faded old world of Gareth Southgate. England had lots of the ball, did not move it fast enough and won by a couple of goals. It does not matter. They could have won 10-0, 8-5 or 1-0 and it would mean almost nothing in terms of the winning of the World Cup.England want to win the World Cup next summer. They have a squad that should make them challengers. Barring pratfalls, there will come a point next year when they will play an Argentina or a Spain or a France, a team of equivalent or greater talent and, almost certainly, that is what will determine whether they are successful.Lewis-Skelly gamble pays off for Tuchel as he balances impatience and reality | Jonathan LiewRead moreBut before that they will have a dozen or so games against teams with less lofty aspirations who, as with Albania, set out in a deep block. There was a period when Southgate’s England were very good at those games: they scored 39 goals in 10 qualifiers for the last World Cup. Butthey still lost to France in the quarter-finals. Fabio Capello’s England scored 34 goals in 10 qualifiers for 2010, then weregrindingly awful in South Africa. Racking up hatfuls of goals in qualifying is evidence of nothing more than that you are good at racking up hatfuls of goals in qualifying.At this stage, there are two things Tuchel has to do. He has to make sure England do get to the World Cup – and Serbia and Albania away will not be easy – while at the same time beginning to construct a side capable of playing against teams who will operate in a very different way from their opponents in qualifying. Much of that work will happen on the training pitch, away from the public eye. Much of it is to do with having a plan and then tweaking and refining it as he goes along and not being distracted by flavour-of-the-month players and the clamour that builds around them. Tournaments are usually won by systems and environments, and almost never by bolters who suddenly hit form in the April and May just before a tournament.Friday was not perfect. England,as Tuchel acknowledged, did not move the ball as quickly as he would have liked them to, did not get it wide soon enough or often enough to stretch the play. There were a couple of moments of defensive anxiety, in part caused by overcommitting against extremely passive opponents. Dan Burn heading the ball out of Jordan Pickford’s hands was not a model of north-eastern communication and cooperation. But fundamentally it was fine. Good enough. Three points. Tick. And there was one moment to offer real hope.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane (right) scored again in a World Cup qualifier. Getting players to run beyond him will be the key England’s success.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The ObserverAt the last Euros, which,despite the fact they got to the final, was Southgate’s worst tournament, there were three major problems. The absence of a left-back was happily resolved by picking a left-back, which leaves two quandaries. England lack a player who can sit deep in midfield, break up opposition attacks and control the tempo of a game – a Rodri, an N’Golo Kanté, a Toni Kroos. It is not that that sort of player is essential for winning tournaments, but having one would balance a midfield with Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham. Curtis Jones may be the answer, although his natural tendency is to push higher than would be ideal. There were a couple of instances when Albania were able to break into space that, say, Rodri would have been occupying, but it was a start. It may come.But probably the most significant flaw last summer was that Harry Kane, quite apart from his fitness struggles, did not fit with the players behind him. One of his great gifts is the capacity to drop deep; to ask him not to do that, to stay high and occupy the box, is to remove a key part of his game and also what should be a valuable weapon for England in dragging opposing defences out of position. But that then needs players who will run beyond Kane, to exploit the space he has created. At the Euros, England did not have that – they had Bellingham, Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka clogging up the zone Kane was moving into – which is one of the reasons they always looked more dangerous when a more frontrunning centre-forward, Ivan Toney or Ollie Watkins, came on.The sort of interaction that became familiar with Kane and Son Heung-min at Tottenham, Kane dropping deep, spinning and pinging a pass into the path of a charging Son, is very difficult to achieve against a side who sit deep as Albania did and leave no space for opponents to run into. But after 26 minutes on Friday it happened: Kane dropped deep, three England players went beyond him and he played a pass to Marcus Rashford. It was a challenging pass, it came to Rashford at an awkward height and his touch was slightly heavy, but it had at least been possible and had been attempted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rashford may not have the technical ability of Cole Palmer or Saka, and he may not have the tactical brain of Foden, but it may be that by having the right attributes to offer balance, he ends up being more important than any of them.It was a glint, no more. Much of Friday’s game comprised the hypnotic retention of possession, the gentle probing, that has become characteristic of home England qualifiers. But in that one pass, there were perhaps the very early signs of what Tuchel’s England may be, of a balance and a method that can succeed.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThe ObserverThomas TuchelFootball tacticscommentShareReuse this content"

The hush of trepidation that filled the Cardiff air approaching the final whistle confirmed what proved an awkward but satisfying night as Wales edged past Kazakhstan, 110th in the world, to preserve Craig Bellamy’s unbeaten record, though an improved performance is surely required if that is to remain in North Macedonia on Tuesday.Wales hope this is the start of another memorable journey. And one with a happier ending than three woeful group-stage performances. This week even Davies, a typically uber-cautious talker, did not dress up Wales’s showing at the last World Cup. “The best moment of Qatar was probably just the Ukraine [playoff] game in getting there,” said the defender, whose header 79 seconds into the second half offeredWalescomfort before Matondo converted Sorba Thomas’s cross. North Macedonia have won their past six matches and Wales can expect a step up in class. “We have to be at our best,” Bellamy said. “I don’t look at everything like I’m living with a knife between my teeth. We have to embrace it and be excited.”Wales 3-1 Kazakhstan: World Cup qualifier – as it happenedRead moreA nervousness pervaded this stadium at half-time when Kazakhstan deservedly headed in level. In truth, Wales made an underwhelming start, with Maxim Samorodov registering the first shot, but led on nine minutes owing to a slice of luck, James’s shot taking a huge deflection to wrong-foot the Kazakhstan goalkeeper Alexandr Zarutskiy after Askhat Tagybergen failed to clear the ball. Bellamy punched the air but Wales did not accelerate clear of their opponents.David Brooks failed to seize on a two v one scenario, undercooking a pass for Thomas, and a couple of minutes later Wales were reeling when Connor Roberts was penalised for handball inside the box. Roberts handled Islam Chesnokov’s cross and the Lithuanian referee, Donatas Rumsas, after a lengthy VAR check, awarded a penalty. Tagybergen sent a tame spot-kick down the middle of Karl Darlow’s goal and the ball, via Darlow’s feet, corkscrewed over the line.Bellamy spent recent weeks delving into the archives to get a flavour of what to expect, analysing the way Ali Aliyev, Kazakhstan’s interim manager, set up his team when in charge of Kazakhstani side Kyzylzhar in his previous job. In reality, Bellamy did not need a database to tell him Kazakhstan would line up in a low block.View image in fullscreenBen Davies heads Wales into a 2-1 lead.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersPatience was key. “The important part is to not get bored of keeping the ball,” Bellamy said. “If you try to force things, you can become even more vulnerable to the counterattack. I still hear the shouts: ‘Get it forward, get it [up] there.’ I know, but I’m not hitting up ‘there’ when we have the numbers ‘here’. The message at half-time was: be patient, they’ll tire and then we’ll pick them off.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It did not pan out quite like that. Wales may have been a little stodgy but there was nothing laboured about Davies’s header after the restart. Zarutskiy flapped at a Thomas corner and the ball zoomed over the goalkeeper’s flailing hands and towards the back post, where Davies powered in. It was the perfect way to erase any fears forming in the minds of those who witnessed Armenia overpower Wales here in a Euro 2024 qualifier or, indeed, Gibraltar hold Wales 0-0 last summer.“In games where you go in as favourites there are expectations to walk all over teams, but it is never the case,” Davies said afterwards. How did Bellamy react at the break? “He came in, Mr Calm, and was clear in the message of what he expected. I think the players were the ones most frustrated, annoyed and angry.”Neco Williams tested Zarutskiy with a smart free-kick but Matondo eventually sealed victory, converting from close range after the substitute Jordan James flipped the ball wide to Thomas. “Don’t take me home,” crooned the locals, for whom those four words were the soundtrack of an unforgettable run to the semi-finals at Euro 2016. Now they pine for another adventure on the global stage.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersThe ObserverWalesKazakhstanmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But thenew International Olympic Committee presidentnow faces the biggest set of challenges to global sport since the 1980s, when boycotts rocked the Moscow and Los Angeles Games. As the 41-year-old prepares to take over from Thomas Bach in June, what issues will she face?Protecting women’s sportOne of Coventry’s key pledges has been to protect women’s sports and athletes. On Friday, she pointed out that as Zimbabwe’s sports minister she had removed the football federation’s board after female referees reported being sexually harassed. She has also talked about a blanket ban on transgender athletes from the female category.View from Africa: how Kirsty Coventry will handle sport’s biggest job at the IOCRead more“Protecting the female category and female sports is paramount,” she says. “There is more and more scientific research. It is very clear that transgender women are more able in the female category and can take away opportunities that should be equal for women.”Coventry says she wants to set up a taskforce to address how best to protect women’s sport, which became a global controversy at the women’s boxing tournament in Paris, whenImane KhelifandLin Yu-ting won gold.In January, she said lessons needed to be learned but added that there “needs to be a little more sensitivity” when it comes to athletes with a difference in sex development condition, who were reported as female at birth but then underwent male puberty.View image in fullscreenImane Khelif’s gold medal in Paris has brought the issue of women’s sport to the forefront.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAThe return of Russia?There is no obvious path for the IOC to lift its suspension of Russia’s Olympic body while four regional sports councils in eastern Ukraine remain under Russian control. However, Coventry says she is against banning countries from the Games and has promised to set up another taskforce to look at “some guiding frameworks” when it comes to Russia.As things stand, only a few Russians will be competing as neutral athletes at the Milan CortinaWinter Olympicsin 11 months’ time. However, it will be fascinating to see whether a Russian return – Putin’s favourite sport is ice hockey – could be part of a peace deal in Ukraine.Dealing with Donald TrumpCoventry takes over at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty around the globe and with Trump threatening to ban people from certain countries from entering the United States. Casey Wasserman, the chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Games, has said: “Irrespective of politics today, America will be open and accepting to all 209 countries for the Olympics”, but no one can be quite sure what Trump will do next.Coventry has promised not to flinch. “I have been dealing with, let’s say, difficult men in high positions since I was 20 years old,” she said on Thursday, when asked about Trump. “We will not waver from our values: solidarity and ensuring every athlete that qualifies for theOlympic Gameshas the possibility to attend the Olympic Games and be safe during the Olympic Games.”Who will host the 2036 Games?A key issue for the IOC is finding a host for the 2036 Olympics, which is being fought over by India, Qatar, Turkey and several other countries. One thing to watch is if Coventry sticks with Bach’s policy of allowing a “preferred bid” to be fast-tracked into exclusive negotiations.If that happens, India will be seen as favourites. Coventry is close to the influential IOC member Nita Ambani, whose family is the richest in Asia. There is no set timetable for a decision on 2036, but Coventry has hinted that she will involve IOC members more in the decision-making process.TheclimatecrisisThe climate crisis not only threatens the traditional slot for the Summer Games of July and August but also raises existential questions for the Winter Olympics. Coventry has called for greater flexibility, pointing to how the marathon in Tokyo 2020 was staged in Sapporo where it was cooler. Do not be surprised if a Games in India in 2036, and perhaps Saudi Arabia in 2040, are held in the autumn.“We have an incredible amount of interest in the Games for 2036 and 2040 from new regions, which is exciting,” she said. “It opens up the question of the timing of the Games and we need to be proactive about that, both summer and winter.”Keeping the Olympics relevantThe Olympics has proven remarkably resilient in a rapidly changing media and entertainment landscape, with the Paris Games a resounding success. Last week, NBC announced this month it had reacheda four-year extension of its rightsfor the Olympic Games, valued at $3bn (£2.5bn), to take them through to 2036. But a key task for Coventry over the next eight years will be to acquire new top-tier sponsors, most likely from India and Saudi Arabia, and keep the Games relevant globally, especially among young people.Explore more on these topicsInternational Olympic CommitteeThe ObserverOlympic GamesWinter OlympicsSport politicsWinter Olympics 2026LA Olympic Games 2028featuresShareReuse this content"

This had pretty much everything and Scotland were the team left standing with a victory at the end of a pulsating encounter. These sides meet again in August, in Pool B of the Women’s Rugby World Cup, and judging by the skill, physicality and entertainment on show in Edinburgh, that appointment in Salford will be unmissable.Sarah Bonar, Emma Orr and Leah Bartlett scored tries for Scotland while Helen Nelson kicked a penalty and three conversions – each one proving important in the final reckoning. Carys Phillips, Abbie Fleming and Gwenllian Pyrs were try-scorers for Wales, who started and finished strongly but ultimately paid for missing 35 tackles. Credit to Scotland, too, for whom the wing Fran McGhie was a constant threat, for their smooth handling skills and forward muscle.Honest conversations mean Wales will get better on the pitch in this Six Nations | Jaz Joyce-ButchersRead more“It probably wasn’t the prettiest performance from us,” Nelson told the BBC. “We were frustrated after the first half when we came in, we’d had a lot of possession but probably weren’t clinical enough at the breakdown. But I’m just proud of the girls, to front up in not the best conditions and get the win.”Sean Lynn, the new Wales head coach, was coming off the back off a Premiership victory with Gloucester-Hartpury last weekend and his new charges tore into the contest like champions. Scotland barely had a touch for seven minutes while Wales worked through multiple phases of intelligent handling and perceptive running. Their reward was a try for Phillips after four minutes, the front-rower flopping over from short range and Keira Bevan converting.Scotland were pleased to be reacquainted with their old friend, the ball, and McGhie had home supporters on their feet with a thrilling chip and chase down the middle. Pressure from Bryan Easson’s side built steadily on the visiting defence and Rachel Malcolm, the captain and blindside flanker, looked to have them in the lead with a catch-and-drive from a lineout. However, the TMO intervened and the referee, Kat Roche, overruled the score for obstruction.View image in fullscreenScotland’s Evie Gallagher jumps for a lineout.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PAWelsh tackling had been nothing short of heroic, but their defence was breached three minutes before half-time when Rhona Lloyd made a determined burst on the Scottish left, allowing Bonar to burrow over. Georgia Evans, the Wales No 8, received her first yellow card of the afternoon for collapsing a maul.Despite a bright start, by half-time Wales had made 97 tackles to Scotland’s 74, while Scotland had made 498 attacking metres to 296. Most worryingly for Lynn, perhaps, was that Wales had missed 19 tackles.Women’s Six Nations 2025: team-by-team guide to the tournamentRead moreSure enough, defensive slackness appeared to have cost them when Evie Gallagher went charging into space two minutes after half-time following a slick Scottish lineout. It was Lisa Thomson who eventually touched down but again the TMO, Oli Kellett, had identified a blatant obstruction by the openside flanker Rachel McLachlan.Not to worry: Scotland had their second try after a ball was hacked into space and McGhie’s pace and hustle saw the ball pop out of a ruck, allowing Orr to canter in. Scotland had a 10-point lead and Wales were soon reduced to 14 again when Evans rushed in with a high challenge on Chloe Rollie. Two yellow cards equalled a 20-minute red.Scotland’s Gallagher was promptly sent to the sin-bin for dangerous play at a ruck before Fleming’s try for the visitors, converted by Bevan, brought Wales to within three point with a quarter to play. Gallagher’s yellow card was upgraded to red via a bunker review: “A high degree of danger attacking the lower limb,” said the TMO Kellett. Interesting to wonder what Fabien Galthié and Antoine Dupont might make of that.Quick GuideMatch report: Ireland 15-27 FranceShowFrance were pushed all the way by Ireland in the Women's Six Nations opener after Gabrielle Vernier was sent off for a high tackle, before a late scoring burst secured victory forLes Bleuesin Belfast.After the Ireland No 8 Aoife Wafer's second try on 66 minutes, Dannah O'Brien's conversion would have levelled at 17-17, but the fly-half's kick strayed wide. Morgane Bourgeois, who kicked 12 points with an immaculate five from five, punished Ireland with a penalty four minutes later before Emilie Boulard's try stretched the visitors' lead to 12 and extinguished Irish hopes.France also visit Parma and London in three away fixtures in the campaign as they build towards the World Cup later this year, and were seriously tested by Ireland's physicality. Vernier had run a lovely line after six minutes to get France off the mark before Marine Ménager finished off a flowing move 11 minutes later after powerful carries from Charlotte Escudero and Melisande Llorens.At 14-0, the threat of a rout hung in the air, but the hosts launched themselves into the contest with a crashing short-range score by Wafer on 21 minutes. Vernier was dismissed on 44 minutes after rushing out of the line and smashing head-on-head into Eve Higgins.A powerful Irish drive culminated in a try for Neve Jones five minutes after the break and Wafer's second, with 14 minutes left, was a similarly well-coordinated shove. A fright for France before decisive late scores by Bourgeois and Boulard.Ireland's Edel McMahon told the BBC: \"There is frustration around the group, because we let that game slip away from us at times, but I'm also incredibly proud of where the girls have come from … We're competing with top-tier nations, we're testing them, we're hard to beat and we're firing shots.\"Luke McLaughlinWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Easson’s side were undeterred. Orr went scything into space thanks to a stunning offload by Thomson and the Scottish forwards took over, Bartlett smashing through the defensive cover for the decisive try. A 10-point lead looked defendable but Wales were restored to 15, after the 20-minute red card, and were threatening as the clock ticked down. Scotland held firm to secure back-to-back wins against Wales for the first time in 20 years. Easson’s side go to France next weekend while Wales host England in Cardiff. Neither encounter is likely to be as close, or as thrilling, as this one.“The positives were passion and energy,” Lynn said of the collective Welsh effort. “I asked for it and they delivered … The proudest part for me was we still had that belief, we were still in the game, when they went 12 points up … I’m super proud.”“It means a lot,” Scotland’s Nelson said. “We knew they were going to come at us.

Draper fell back to earth with an unsatisfying 7-6 (2), 7-6 (3) defeat to the 19-year-old Jakub Mensik of the Czech Republic in the second round of the Miami Open.Emma Raducanu finds ‘third wind’ to overcome Navarro in Miami Open epicRead moreDraper’s Indian Wells title run had begun with him demonstrating his experience against the 18-year-old João Fonseca, the youngest player in the ATP top 100. This time, he was unable to escape another difficult draw against an extremely talented teenager. Mensik, who is ranked No 54, saw off Draper, the sixth seed, with an incredible serving performance that yielded 21 aces.For a short while, Draper seemed to have picked up where he left off fromlast Sunday’s demolition of Holger Runein Indian Wells as he burst into the match lasering forehands and serving efficiently.However, as Mensik warmed into the match, showing off his own potent serve and forehand, Draper’s intensity sharply dropped. He spent much of the set audibly fighting with himself as he tried to reestablish his intensity and range on his groundstrokes. As Draper took those issues into the tie-break, Mensik served immaculately to snatch the set.The second set followed a similar pattern as Draper was a step behind throughout. It took a significant effort from the British No 1 to hold on to his serve and save six break points throughout the set while Mensik rolled through most of his own games. The one-sided tie-break was a logical conclusion to a deceptively one-sided set.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Draper will leave Miami frustrated in his inability to maintain the momentum he built in Indian Wells, but a mental and physical letdown after such a breakthrough was always a possibility. With the humidity in Miami making for heavier balls and different conditions, the transition to Miami is challenging in many ways.

And with it they leapfrog their hosts into the top four for now.“I had full faith,” said Benson, only just graduated from Cambridge University, where he won three Blues, “that if [Alex Dombrandt, his captain] asked me, the kicks would be going between the sticks.” He also converted both Harlequins’ tries, the second at the death. Score when he came on: 12-0. Score at the end 12-23.Premiership ready to rumble again with a post-Six Nations glowRead moreSo, another talent seemingly uncovered. But howSaracensfell away in front of 54,000 at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. They were hardly brilliant in the first half, although Alex Goode’s flicked pass to set up Tobias Elliott’s try, their second, just before the break touched the heights of genius. The suspicion, though, that their era is, if not at an end, at least on hold, hardened as Quins, without any of their England internationals, overhauled them in a slow-burning second half that, by the end, was definitely aflame.Quins did not score a point until the hour mark, when Oscar Beard set up his partner in the centre, Ben Waghorn. It was an excellent try. Quins had stolen another Saracens lineout, a feat they would accomplish three times in the second half, and were meandering this way and that when Beard made a beeline for the wide outside. He broke the tackle of Elliott and turned the ball inside for Waghorn. Two more young talents there.View image in fullscreenThe spectators at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium saw Harlequins stage a late fightback to stun Saracens.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The ObserverThen came the three Benson penalties. Saracens were in freefall mode, notwithstanding the influence of England captains past and present and a host of other full internationals readjusting to life in the Premiership. The referee was ruthless towards them. Saracens were awarded their last penalty of the match just after Quins’ first try, which Alex Lozowski missed from long range. Thereafter, all the penalties went the way of the visitors, five of them.Quins’ scrum also enjoyed the edge throughout. A penalty at one of them gave Benson his first shot, in the 70th minute. Then came the one for the lead, two minutes later, some 45 metres out. Nerves? Not a hint of them. Another sailed over. And again, five minutes after that. None of them were gimmes, or anywhere close to them.Suddenly, Saracens needed a try, and they looked at sea. Instead, it was Quins who struck. Nick David streaked clear in the penultimate minute and found Will Porter on his inside shoulder to deny Saracens even a bonus point.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What a far cry from this time last week. The calibre of stadium was familiar to those who had come straight from the Six Nations, as was the scale of attendance. But not much else. Where Quins had rested their England players (although Evans was deployed straight from the Wales camp), Saracens played as many as they could. Their big day, after all. They burst into the match with all the intent you might expect, Theo McFarland finishing from close range in the fifth minute.Not that it inspired them to repeat their rout of the same opposition here last year, when Quins sank meekly to thetune of 50-plus points. This time, Quins stayed in the game in a scrappy first half. But Goode, the maestro on early for Rotimi Segun, rescued the match from its misdirection when he delayed and flicked a pass over his shoulder to the looping Fergus Burke, who put Elliott over in the corner.The feeling then was that Saracens would kick on. But there were Quins young and old, heralded and unknown, who had other ideas.Explore more on these topicsPremiershipThe ObserverSaracensHarlequinsRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Talking toVanity Fairmagazineabout her big screen comeback, in Josh Safdie’s ping pong film,Marty Supreme, the actor, 52, joked of her sex scenes with 29-year-old Timothée Chalamet: “I was like, ‘I’m 109 years old. You’re 14’.”Paltrow also said: “There’s now something called an intimacy coordinator (IC), which I did not know existed.” When the IC spoke to her: “I’m like, ‘Girl, I’m from the era where you get naked, you get in bed, the camera’s on’… We said, ‘I think we’re good. You can step a little bit back’.” She added: “I don’t know how it is for the kids who are starting out, but… if someone is like ‘OK, then he puts his handhere’… I would feel as an artist very stifled by that.”Well, I also don’t know about kids starting out, but I’d imagine it’s much harder for them when rich, famous, powerful players such as Paltrow undermine intimacy coordinators: people specifically hired to safeguard the welfare of everybody on set – not just big stars.I’d love to relay more about the PaltrowVanity Fairarticle: all the darling details about stealth wealth, raw milk, perimenopause, shearling clogs, and the inside track on the financial status of Paltrow’s wellness empire, Goop.A huge dark lie is forming: that now Weinstein and his kind have been dealt with… everything is fineHowever, this is about #MeToo. Specifically, the ongoing soft-cancellation of the intimacy coordinator, whose professional presence, lest we forget, is one of the hard-won gains of the#MeToo movement. How it’s becoming a major Hollywood power flex to declare you don’t need one. How it’s starting to be considered rather chic to dispense with their services. And what the trickledown effect of all this A-list privilege could be.It’s especially mystifying from Paltrow because, as detailed inVanity Fair, she was at the heart of #MeToo, bravelyspeaking out againstconvicted Miramax producer, Harvey Weinstein. Early in her career, Paltrow had a horrible encounter with Weinstein, who was warned off by her then boyfriend, Brad Pitt. Paltrow recalled: “[Pitt]leveraged his fame and powerto protect me when I didn’t have fame or power yet.” One thing that was striking about her experience was that, even with a famous boyfriend, Hollywood director dad (Bruce), respected actor mum (Blythe Danner), and director legend godfather (Steven Spielberg), shestillwasn’t safe from Weinstein.Years later, it’s a little surprising that Paltrow arrived on the set ofMarty Supremeunaware of the existence of intimacy coordinators. (Paltrow lives in prosperous Montecito, outside Los Angeles, not some sea cave in the Outer Hebrides.) But then, there’s a fair bit of this kind of thing about.While some actors (including Emma Thompson and Ewan McGregor) have supported intimacy coordinators, others not so much.Michael Douglas acknowledged Hollywood abusesbut felt that ICs were “executives taking control away from filmmakers”. He also felt it was the man’s responsibility to make the woman comfortable: “Which is hopefully what good acting looks like.”Mikey Madison didn’t feel she needed an ICfor her recent Oscar-winning role inAnora, whose director Sean Baker said: “I have directed approximately 10 sex scenes throughout my career and I’m very comfortable doing so.”In 2023,Jennifer Aniston claimed not to know about intimacy coordinators(“I’m from the olden days, so I was like, ‘What does that mean?’”), refusing one for a sex scene with her friend, Jon Hamm. And so it churns on. How bizarre these anti-stances sometimes look. The claims of being stifled. The pleas for artistic agency. The passive aggression. The faux self-deprecation. The pushing of the idea that not using an IC somehow makes people ballsy, adventurous, down to earth. Never mind how turning one down is a power-play in itself, there is a gigantic missing of the point. It’s wonderful these people feel so safe and protected, but who else is in the room?Intimacy coordinators are not just for lead actors, directors, producers, the people already wielding immense power. They are designed to advocate for everyone, cast and crew alike, including the traditionally powerless/voiceless on set. Not that there haven’t been glitches: last year, the union SAG-AFTRAchanged rules around intimacy coordinators, including around confidentiality, aftertoo many details were given to the pressabout the 2024 film,Miller’s Girl, starring Jenna Ortega and Martin Freeman.How long before people start mocking the idea of being afraid to go for meetings with producers in hotel rooms?Effectively, intimacy coordinators serve as a democratic safety measure. This is why it’s irresponsible for them to be undermined, as an eye-roll, a bore, even an unnecessary wellness-grift (in Gwynnie’s case, oh the irony!). It puts pressure on those without power to be obliging and biddable: “Gwyneth Paltrow didn’t want an intimacy coordinator, so….” It creates a two-tier system: the powerful proclaiming they don’t need ICs; the powerless unable to say they want them.

As much as it was about sexual abuse, it was also about toxic power imbalances. It’s important to remember because a huge dark lie is forming: that now Weinstein and his kind have been dealt with, power-hosed off the streets of Hollywood, everything is fine and, if anything, all the rules and safeguards are starting to get tedious.Striking isn’t it? Outside professionals are routine in Hollywood (stunts; fight scenes; dialect), it’s only with sex, there’s the pushback. From where I’m sitting, this looks like a slow motion asset-stripping of #MeToo. How long before people start mocking the idea of being afraid to go for meetings with producers in hotel rooms?Maybe unfairly, it’s particularly painful when the barely veiled undermining comes from women, especially one who had such a valuable voice during #MeToo. Maybe next time Paltrow comes across an intimacy coordinator, she could remember how most of the hundreds of people she’s working alongside on set don’t have fame and power to protect them.

The emperor has no clothes to cloak his counterfeit rule. Lacking crown and robes, he resorts to vulgar ties and baseball caps. His throne is but a bully pulpit, his palace a pokey, whitewashed house, his courtiers mere common hacks. His royal edicts – executive orders – are judicially contested. And while he rages like Lear, his critics are publicly crucified or thrown to the lions at Fox News.Yet for all his crudely plebeian ordinariness, a parvenu imperialism is Trump’s global offer, his trademark deal and most heinous crime. He peddles it against the tide of history and all human experience, as if invasion, genocide, racial inequality, economic exploitation and cultural conquest had never been tried before. If it wasn’t clear already, it is now.He wants to rule the world.Trump’s menacing claims to Canada, Panama andGreenlandrevive the elitist fantasies ofElon Musk’s grandfatherandTechnocracy Inc, a 1930s rightwing populist movement that sought to unite North and Central America under US suzerainty – the “Technate”. The mindset feeding such pretensions is rooted deep in the national psyche. It’s a mix of Monroe doctrine, “manifest destiny” and the white man’s burden. It’s evil, it’s pernicious, and it’s back.In 1823, president James Monroe, fending off predatory European powers, defined what Russia’s Vladimir Putin, among others, would today term an American “sphere of influence”. His doctrine was later used to justify US intervention in Latin America. Manifest destiny was the belief, popularised after 1845, that the young republic was divinely charged with spreading its dominion and “civilising influence” across the continent and into the Pacific region.Would Trump attempt ethnic cleansing of the lighter-skinned citizens of war-torn Ukraine? Everyone knows the answer to thatNative Americans, exterminated and dispossessed, were principal victims. Manifest destiny helped spread slavery as new states joined the Union. Subsequent colonisations of the Philippines, Cuba and Hawaii were a natural extension. In 1899, Rudyard Kipling’s infamously racist poem,The White Man’s Burden, urged Americans to emulate the British empire and assume global responsibility for governing “new-caught sullen peoples”.That latter phrase aptly describes Trump’s view today of 2 million Palestiniansensnared in Gaza, whom he wants todeport to Somalilandor some other promised land. Migrants corralled at the Mexico border face the white man’s burdensome prejudices, too. Would Trump attempt ethnic cleansing of the lighter-skinned, mostly Christian, citizens of war-torn Ukraine? Everyone knows the answer to that one. While lacking the older varieties’ surface pomp and majesty, Trump’sborn-again imperialismbears the ugly hallmarks of earlier iterations. As before, it comes down to power and money, military might and economic pressure (such as tariffs), control of land, racial and cultural supremacy and an utterly hypocritical morality. It’s causing uproar at home. It infects every aspect of foreign policy.Trump may not be actively conniving in the killing and expulsion of Ukraine’s Indigenous population, but he’s doing his best to rob them of their birthright. In a travesty of negotiation, he cedes territory to Putin, bullies Kyiv’s leaders into seething submission, then makes a grab forUkraine’s mineral wealth. Now he wants its nuclear power plants, too. This is not about making peace.It’s about making money. In Gaza, Trump picks over the bones before the victim has even died. Basic legalities, let alone humanity, are jettisoned. No matter that Israel’sgenocidaireshave killed about 50,000 Palestinians. He wants the seafront property free of charge, its surviving owners evicted, so he can build a luxury resort. “Welcome to the Rafah Riviera, the Trump Organisation’s Nakba-on-the-Med. Enjoy your stay!”Trump and his advisers envisagethree neo-imperial superpower blocs, the US, Russia and China, united in disregard for the UN charter, international law and human rights and acting as they please in self-allotted spheres of influence. In this upended age, Russia is a lucrative business partner while European and Asian allies must fend for themselves. As ever, developing countries are exploited for their resources. To mangle George Canning, the Old World falls prey to the New.Imperialism has evolved since the time of gunboats and missionaries. Absent now is a sense of higher calling and noble purposeIn the wider Middle East, Trump is infinitely more interested in forging a US-Saudi-Israel security, energy and investment alliance than in ending the Palestinian tragedy. A significant obstacle is Iran, another historical victim of colonialists. In his latest Putin schmooze, Trump asked for Russia’s help incontaining its ally. Mullahs beware: there’s a whiff of betrayal in the air. Like big-power bullies throughout history, Trump picks on easy targets. Danish-owned Greenland and Panama exemplify the type of weak, defenceless country that 19th-century European empires scrambled for in Africa. In contrast, note how abnormally quiet is loudmouthed Trump about China, America’s most powerful 21st-century rival.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Like Putin, president Xi Jinping isplaying it cool with Trumpso far. These tuppenny tsars share much in common: authoritarianism, national aggrandisement, ruthless greed. So why fight? All three can be winners, and to winners go the spoils. Look out, Taiwan, meat in an unsavoury US-China sandwich.Imperialism has evolved since the time of gunboats, missionaries and unequal treaties. Absent now is a sense of higher calling and noble purpose. Pioneering frontiersmen pursuing America’s manifest destiny genuinely believed theirs was a righteous cause. British colonial administrators thought they did God’s (and Queen Victoria’s) work. Today’s conquerors betray few such illusions. Even so, Trump casts himself as compassionate, noble-minded peacemaker. So will he pursue peace in desperate Sudan, Myanmar or Congo? Will he stop those “horrible wars” too? No, he will not. Such places do not feature on his redrawn maps. There’s no money or kudos in it for him. And this particular white man’s burden sharing does not extend to losers.In a new, disorderly imperial age, megalomania waives the rules.Simon Tisdall is the Observer’s Foreign Affairs CommentatorExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionChinacommentShareReuse this content"

The Parthenon was completed just before Athens embarked on the devastating Peloponnesian War. Manhattan’s most celebrated skyscrapers went up on the brink of the Great Depression. The British inaugurated the imposing government buildings of New Delhi 16 years before the end of the Raj. I won’t say that this will definitely be the case with the£2bn stadiumdesigned by the Mancunian Norman Foster for Manchester United Football Club, but it’s striking that it’s proposed at a time when the club has closed its staff canteen andmade redundant hundreds of workersto cut costs.Every good thing is promised. It is to be “the world’s greatest football stadium”, iconic AND sustainable, with both rainwater harvesting and a “trident” of 200m-high masts visible from 25 miles away. There is to be a “public space” twice the size of Trafalgar Square and a “mixed use mini-city” around it. There are things to like about the plans, including an attempt to avoid the fortress-like exteriors presented by most stadiums in favour of something more open and lively. But they’d probably do well to concentrate on doing fewer things as well as possible. Otherwise, the building might be like one of those football teams made up of extravagant signings who somehow don’t gel.Exit stage rightView image in fullscreenJD Vance was booed at a Kennedy Center classical music performancePhotograph: Guardian VideoYou can only feel heartened by any sign of resistance to the onslaught of vandalism and cruelty wrought by the Trump administration, as when the audience in the Kennedy Center in Washington DCbooed the vice-president, JD Vance, when he turned up to a performance of Shostakovich and Stravinsky. This was entirely justified, given that Trump hadfired the centre’s chair and 13 trustees, installed himself to preside over the board, and appointed his stooge Richard Grenell as president of the centre (all with minimal complaint from conservatives who allegedly oppose excessive government intervention). On the other hand, one imagines that Vance might have been quite happy with the way this spectacle played out. At least some sections of his base will delight in the outrage he has caused to concert-goers in the nation’s hated capital, paying upwards of $100 a seat to hear music that Vance fans find baffling. Of course, America should be big enough for every kind of culture but – as we’re all finding out – one of the worst things about relentless aggression is that it can be hideously effective.Moving bluesView image in fullscreenBrian Sewell: ‘I have been close to death three times… moving house is far, far worse.”Photograph: Karen Robinson/The ObserverThe renowned art critic Brian Sewell, at a time when he and I both worked for theEvening Standard, lamented the stresses of moving himself and his art collection to a new home. “You know what they say,” I said, “it’s the third most stressful thing after death and divorce.” “Oh no, no, no, no,” fluted Sewell, who suffered from a serious heart condition, “I have been close to death three times, and I can tell you that moving house is far, far worse”.

Not so much in the US, where the chaotic uncertainty engineered by Donald Trump and hisProject 2025supporters is creating misery, and not just for the public servants fired or suspended from their jobs.It might also be difficult to see how the goal of happiness is rated in Whitehall when the UK sits only one place above the US in the United Nations’ annual world happiness index. The UK slipped from the 20th most happy country to 23rd inthis year’s index, while the US dropped one position to 24th, both well behind the Nordic countries, which lead the world, and many ­others including Mexico, Australia and Belgium.It would be wrong, though, to put the UK in the same bracket as the US because the Treasury – often considered among the more hard-hearted of bureaucratic organisations – is on a very different journey to the course being set in Washington.While Elon Musk is busy tearing through USAID and Trump is waving executive orders thatdismantle the education department, the UK finance ministry has committed to include wellbeing, for which we can substitute the word happiness, when judging the benefits of public spending.In the vicious budget fight going on at the moment in Whitehall over the three-year spending review, departmental chiefs are supposed to stop, smile and for the first time show how their policies will impact the wellbeing of recipients and the nation. In this respect, the UK will be leading the world.How well this task will be performed is a concern for anyone who has worked inside Whitehall.There will be plenty of civil servants who consider wellbeing a woolly term, especially in the militaristic upper echelons of the public sector, where mental health days and stress workshops are considered laughable diversions, and, if they are embraced, act as a figleaf over a debilitating, 19th-century command-and-control management structure.There will also be opposition from those who consider well­being a diversion from the central task of sparking the UK economy back into life with a “whatever it takes” growth agenda.It’s not ‘the economy, stupid’, it’s ‘wellbeing, stupid'Prof Richard LayardIt would be easy to adopt a cynical attitude – one that highlights the welfare cuts expected to play a major role in balancing Rachel Reeves’s budget and asks how they will affect the wellbeing of benefit recipients.That would be easy – and wrong. As Professor Richard Layard says, there is hard data for Treasury officials to get their teeth into if they need to be convinced of wellbeing’s importance.Layard, an eminent economist at the London School ofEconomics, believes happiness has “never been more important”. “As this year’s World Happiness report shows, unhappiness is the main cause of populism, which is the scourge of our era,” he says. “By contrast, in Britain the spending review process offers hope, since it explicitly targets wellbeing.”One of the most interesting chapters in the report is written by a group of French academics, showing how populism can be explained, not by economic conditions, butby a broader sense of wellbeing in the population.According to Layard, it has long been known that whether a government gets re-elected depends more on the life satisfaction of the people than on the state of the economy. That may be, but, for policymakers, having some recent evidence could be the spur they need to take action.For instance, in the US, there is a link over the past decade between steadily declining life satisfaction and voters changing party in each presidential election.The remarkable performance of the US economy should correlate with high levels of satisfaction in incumbent presidents and Congressional representatives. Not a bit. Similarly, in Britain, high historical levels of life satisfaction in 2019 led to the Conservatives being re-elected while low levels of satisfaction in 2024 led to their defeat.“So it’s not ‘the economy, stupid’, it’s ‘wellbeing, stupid’,” says Layard.In 2020, the Treasury green book of spending guidance was revised to include an assessment of all benefits, psychological as well as financial. In the spending review, wellbeing coins will be allocated and then converted into money to indicate whether policy initiatives should go ahead.But as Layard and the French academics – led by President Macron’s confidant Yann Algan, from the Paris business school HEC – say in the report, the message is broader.The research shows that when people are dissatisfied with their lot and lack trust in their fellow citizens, they become rightwing populists, while people who are dissatisfied but trust their fellow citizens become leftwing populists.Reeves will be concerned about keeping the government’s finances on track in the spring statement on Wednesday, and might delay policies promoting wellbeing if they are seen to cost money. The evidence is that this would only feed Nigel Farage’s Reform party, and possibly leftwing splinter groups. Labour needs to avoid this outcome.Explore more on these topicsSpring statement 2025The ObserverHappiness indicesRachel ReevesHealth & wellbeingEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

There is no satisfying Trump. He will move the goalposts again and againSat 22 Mar 2025 16.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 16.36 EDTShareSince early 2024, I’ve been running a journalism ethics center at Columbia University.So perhaps it’s no surprise that I see the university’s capitulation to Trump both in terms of journalism and ethics.I’ve never run a university, but I have run a newsroom. For 13 years (until I moved to New York City in 2012 to be the New York Times public editor), I was the chief editor of the Buffalo News, the regional newspaper in my home town. I had started there as a summer intern. As editor, I made a lot of decisions; the buck stopped at my desk.It’s not a perfect analogy to Columbia’s situation, but I’ve been thinking about what my options might have been if the paper’s biggest and most powerful advertiser – one important to our financial wellbeing – had gotten wind of an investigation they didn’t like the sounds of. Something that would reveal something negative about their business, let’s say.Suppose that advertiser had threatened to withdraw all their advertising unless we dropped the story. In fact, suppose they wanted promises of positive coverage – perhaps a fawning profile of their CEO, and a series about the good things the company was doing in the community.Let’s complicate it more. Let’s say that my boss, the paper’s owner, was on the advertiser’s side, or at least inclined to see their point of view.What would my options be as editor?There really would be only one: to hold fast. To make the case to the owner that if we were a legitimate newspaper, we would have to be brave and not allow ourselves to be bullied. And to refuse to pull the story. Make sure it’s bulletproof – every fact nailed down – and proceed with plans to publish it.What would happen?That’s hard to say. Maybe the advertiser would blink. Maybe the owner would fire me. Maybe I’d feel I had to resign.The point of this imperfect analogy is simply that allowing oneself – or one’s institution – to be bullied or threatened into compliance is never the right answer.Some principles are so central to an institution’s purpose that to betray them should be unthinkableAnd it’s especially important for strong institutions to stand up, to set an example and to insulate those who have fewer resources or are more vulnerable.Columbia has a huge – nearly $15bn – endowment. It could have withstood the withdrawal of federal funds.Columbia’s leadership could have chosen to say “see you in court” rather than “yes, sir”.Some principles are so central to an institution’s purpose that to betray them should be unthinkable. You don’t kill a valid story under pressure. Because journalism, however flawed, is about finding and telling the truth.And a university – which stands for academic freedom, for freedom of thought, speech and expression, including the right to peacefully protest – cannot buckle to demands to undermine those principles.Sadly, that’s what Columbia did, even going so far as to put an entire academic department under highly unusual supervision, and to empower beefed-up campus police to detain, remove or arrest students for various supposed offenses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that’s not really – or certainly notfully– what’s at the heart of Trump’s move.“It’s all about intimidation,” as my Guardian colleague Robert Reich, a former labor secretary, wrote this weekend, “not only at Columbia but at every other university in America.”Columbia’s capitulation mirrors that of many institutions in recent weeks. A major law firm (Paul, Weiss), under pressure, struck a deal with the White House to donate $40m in legal work to enable Trump’s causes. ABC News settled a defamation suit it probably could have won. And newspaper owners, including Jeff Bezos at the Washington Post, have been cozying up to Trump in many ways that harm credibility and mission.Yet some organizations have decided not to cave, but to be true to their stated and long-held principles.The Associated Press is suing, after theTrump administrationseverely limited its journalists’ access, punishing them for an editorial decision to continue using the term “Gulf of Mexico” on first reference in their stories, not “Gulf of America”. Another large law firm, Perkins Coie, is fighting in court after Trump’s executive order stripped their lawyers of their security clearances and denyed them access to government buildings.Take this to the bank: there is no satisfying the Trumpian demands. The goalposts will always be moved and then moved again.With its huge endowment and sea of rich alumni – some of whom, surely, would be in sympathy – Columbia had other choices. Smaller universities may not.Institutions with resources must resist thuggish bullying, not just for their own sakes, but to protect others who will find it much harder.

In 2021, it implemented a near-total abortion ban: themost radical abortion lawin the US. Now it’s going even further in its crusade to outlaw abortion. On Monday, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, announced the first criminal charges under Texas’s abortion ban. Maria Margarita Rojas, a licensed midwife, was charged with the illegal performance of an abortion and with practicing medicine without a license, according to a press releasefrom Paxton’s office. Her employee Jose Ley was also charged.There are still a lot of details that are unclear or unverified when it comes to this case, which apparently caught officials’ eyes after an anonymous tip-off. But I’ll tell you what is glaringly apparent:Texaswants to make an example of Rojas. They want Rojas, who primarily served a low-income Spanish-speaking community, to be a cautionary tale. One that ensures people are too terrified to even think about helping a woman obtain an abortion.The US assault on free speech is not going to end with Mahmoud KhalilRead moreRojas isn’t getting some sort of slap on the wrist; the full force of the state is coming after her. She was reportedly pulled over bypolice at gunpointwhile on her way to a clinic and the abortion charge is a second-degree felony, which comes with up to 20 years in prison. Meanwhile, according to theTexas Tribune, the state recommended Rojas and Ley each be held on a million-dollar bond. A million dollars! (In the end, a judge ordered their bonds each be set at $500,000 for the abortion-related charges and $200,000 for the medical license charges.) To put this in perspective, a Texas elementary school teacher arrested earlier this month after a “large quantity” of child sexual abuse materials was reportedly found on his devices, is being held in jail on a$75,000 bond.Locking up doctors isn’t a popular policy platform – according to a2024 KFF poll, eight in 10 Democrats, two-thirds of independents and about half of Republicans want to protect doctors who perform abortions from facing either fines or prison time. Which seems to be why Paxton went after a midwife. Mary Ziegler, a law professor and leading authority on the legal history of the American abortion debate,notes in Slatethat “this is almost certainly not the first prosecution that Paxtoncouldhave brought”. No, it looks like Paxton was trying to find the perfect victim: someone he could easily smear.“The fact that Rojas isnota physician is central to Paxton’s strategy,” Ziegler writes. “He claims that the prosecution will protect women from unlicensed and presumably unsafe providers … [he wants] to signal that midwives who provide abortions are unsafe, unqualified, and dishonest.” This attack on the credibility of midwives – particularly non-white midwives – isn’t new. TheGuardian notes that: “As abortion bans spread across the country in the 19th century, midwives were often driven out of work or faced criminal consequences, which in turn led white, male doctors to siphon up their patients and dominate the medical field.”Some observers believe that the timing of all this is also strategic. Abortion activist Jessica Valenti (who used to write this newsletter and nowwrites Abortion, Every Day) has noted that Rojas was arrested weeks ago. Why did Paxton wait until now to send out a press release? Valenti reckons he is trying todistract from the factthat Texas Republicans are trying to push throughSB 2880, which she characterizes as the biggest piece of anti-abortion legislation since Roe was overturned. This bill targets Texans’ access to abortion pills and makes it easier to sue people and companies involved in a person’s medication abortion.The bill also protects“any person who impregnated the woman who used abortion-inducing drugs through conduct constituting sexual assault” from being sued.“Flooding the zone” – astrategy put forwardby Steve Bannon to describe the process of overwhelming the media by creating more news than anyone can possibly follow – is very much part of the Republican playbook. But, at this point, I don’t know whether anti-abortion activists really care about distracting us from all the dystopian schemes they’ve got up their sleeves. On the contrary, they seem eager to rub their cruelty in our faces. Still, amid the unceasing torrent of news, it is true that we must stay focused. We must remember that the arrest of Rojas and Ley isn’t some sort of one-off isolated to Texas but part of a much broader attack on reproductive rights. Don’t listen to Donald Trump’s “reassurances” that abortion rights should beleft to the statesto decide: the eventual goal is to end abortion access entirely.Elon Musk’s dad says his son was friendly with their Black servants growing upThe Washington Post recently did a deep dive into why Elon has become obsessed with anti-DEI efforts.

Eventually, the tech commentariat decided that there could be only two possible interpretations of this corporate standoffishness: either Apple was way behind the game being played by OpenAIet al; or it had cunning plans to unleash upon the world its own world-beating take on the technology.Finally, at its annual World Wide Developers’ Conference (WWDC) on 10 June last year Apple came clean. Or appeared to. For Apple, “AI” would not mean what those vulgar louts at OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Meta raved about, but something altogether more refined and sophisticated – something called “Apple Intelligence”. It was not, as the veteranApple-watcher John Gruber put it, a single thing or product but “a marketing term for a collection of features, apps, and services”. Putting it all under a single, memorable label made it easier for users to understand that Apple was launching something really novel. And, of course, it also made it easier for Apple to say that users who wanted to have all of these fancy features would have to buy an iPhone 15 Pro, because older devices wouldn’t be up to the task.Needless to say, this columnist fell for it and upgraded. (Verily, one sucker is born every minute.) As a piece of kit, the new phone was impressive: the powerful new processor chips, neural engine etc worked a treat. And the camera turned out to be astonishingly good. But the Apple Intelligence features enabled by the upgrade seemed trivial and sometimes irritating. It immediately started messing with my photo collection, for example, imposing categories on images that were intrusive, unwanted and annoying. And there was a new pre-installed app called Image Playground that apparently “makes communication and self-expression even more fun” – which might possibly be true if one were a four-year-old with a short attention span, but is otherwise a turkey from central casting and should have been strangled at birth.There was one feature, though, that looked interesting and possibly useful – a serious enhancement of Siri, Apple’s attempt at a virtual personal assistant. Henceforth, thecompany announced: “Siri will be able to deliver intelligence that’s tailored to the user and their on-device information. For example, a user can say, ‘Play that podcast that Jamie recommended,’ and Siri will locate and play the episode, without the user having to remember whether it was mentioned in a text or an email. Or they could ask, ‘When is Mom’s flight landing?’ and Siri will find the flight details and cross-reference them with real-time flight tracking to give an arrival time.”If Apple had stuck to the Jobs playbook, the time to have launched the enhancement would have been June this year at the earliestOn closer inspection, though, Siri – even running on my expensive new phone – could do none of these useful things. In fact, it mostly seemed as banal as ever. And then, on 7 March, came anannouncement from Apple: “We’ve also been working on a more personalised Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It’s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.”For Gruber, who knows more about Apple than anyone I know, this was like a red rag to a bull. The announcement meant,he wrote, that “what Apple showed regarding the upcoming ‘personalized Siri’ at WWDC was not a demo. It was a concept video. Concept videos are bullshit, and a sign of a company in disarray, if not crisis”. And because he has a long memory, it reminded him that the last time Apple had screened a concept video – the so-called“Knowledge Navigator” video– it was heading for bankruptcy. And it never made anything like it again once Steve Jobs had returned to turn it into the most profitable company in history.Until – says Gruber – now.Is he overreacting? Answer: yes. Apple isn’t in crisis, but this mini-fiasco with Siri and Apple Intelligence looks like the first serious misstep in Tim Cook’s stewardship of the company. If there’s one thing Jobs’ Apple was famous for, it was not announcing products before they were ready to ship. It’s clear that the company grossly underestimated the amount of work needed to deliver on what it promised for Siri last June. If it had stuck to the Jobs playbook, the time to have launched the enhancement would have been June 2025 at the earliest.

In response to the Office for Budget Responsibility’s latest forecast, which will be published the same day, she is expected to announce further cuts to public spending in several areas, alongside the cuts to disability benefits that the government set out last week. Ministers have spent the past week arguing that these cuts do not technically constitute austerity because they will not be as deep as some of those made during the Conservative years. However, what label you put on these cuts matters far less than their impact. They would increase disability and child poverty and further undermine the provision of public services, an indefensible record for the first term of a Labour government.Reeves faces the most difficult set of circumstances of any chancellor in recent decades. She has inherited an economy beset by long-term structural problems, exposed by the financial crisis, and that have gone unaddressed by governments of both colours: low levels of business investment, sluggish productivity growth, gaping regional inequalities and, since 2008, stagnant living standards. These were made worse by successive Conservative chancellors after 2010, who introduced tax cuts that disproportionately benefited the better off while slashing financial support for low-income parents – the poorest tenth of families with children lost £6,000 a year on average between 2010 and 2024 as a result of their changes – and who failed to take advantage of historically low interest rates to borrow to invest, instead taking the ideological decision to reduce the size of the state regardless of the consequences.Global shocks, such as the pandemic and the spike in energy prices, have made the fiscal situation worse. There is more medium-term pain yet to come; Britain’s falling birthrate means that, without increasing levels of immigration, today’s generation of young people will have to pay a higher share of income in tax to maintain the same level of health and social care provision for an ageing population.The days of easy economic boom fuelled by a burgeoning financial services sector are over. Labour should have fronted up with the public about this going into the last election. Instead, Keir Starmer promised voters that, if they voted for him, a Labour government would be able to fix Britain’s economic woes and its ailing public service infrastructure without taxes going up, or having to borrow more than the government’s self-imposed fiscal rules allow. An effective electoral pitch, but an unachievable governing strategy.Labour is now in a bind. The government was counting on growth to deliver rising tax revenues, which would allow it to invest in public services and tackle rising levels of child poverty. Instead, it is facing a worsening economic forecast – the OBR is expected to halve its growth forecast for 2025 – and a need to significantly increase defence spending in the wake of president Donald Trump realigning the US away from support for Ukraine and Nato. Reeves has three choices: she can relax her fiscal rules, increase taxes or cut spending. She should do a combination of the first two. Instead, she plans to further hammer public spending. In the budget last autumn, the government’s spending plans were already unrealistic for the last three years of the parliament; Reeves was relying on limiting public spending increases to 1.3% a year, implying significant cuts to areas such asjustice and transport. And there were no measures to address rising rates of child poverty; the number of children living in poverty is forecast togrow by 400,000over the five years of this parliament under Labour’s existing plansNow, Labour is looking to make significant extra savings from the benefits system, which will drive up poverty levels even further. Its proposals to cut both out-of-work incapacity benefits and to take away the personal independence payments (Pip), worth £4,000 a year from about a million disabled people, will save about £6.5bn. Only a fraction of this will be reinvested in increasing general out-of-work benefits and employment support programmes, which will hit disabled people and their children punitively hard. Some disabled peoplestand to lose £10,000 a yearin one go if they no longer qualify for Pip and their family member also loses carers’ allowance as a result.There are also suggestions that Reeves is looking to reduce public spending increases to just1.1% a year after 2025, which would imply cuts of 7% to departmental budgets such as justice, the home office and local government. But after 14 years of Conservative spending cuts, there is no fat to trim: it will mean a further retraction of the state in ways that will impact vulnerable people – such as those who are homeless, have mental health issues or significant care needs – the most.There are alternatives. The Resolution Foundation estimates that freezing income and national insurance thresholds for two years wouldraise an additional £8bn of incomein a broadly progressive way. The chancellor has choices other than loading the costs of lacklustre growth and increased defence spending on the most vulnerable, as she appears to be planning. Ministers can make the case to voters that tax rises are painful but necessary, given the changing global situation, with its consequences for both economic and international security. Labour needs to rediscover its moral backbone, fast.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Overbury Drive, neighbours were determined to protect a solitary giant dying red gum – stuck right in the middle of their roadSign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsWalter MarshSat 22 Mar 2025 15.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 21.18 EDTShareIt’s a striking image; in a suburban landscape where nature has been largely pushed aside to make way for roads, houses and driveways, the thick craggy trunk of a towering river red gum tree stands defiantly in place, forcing the bitumen to squeeze and buckle around it. Bang in the middle of the street.Barely a day goes by without the residents of Overbury Drive noticing a carload of tourists or curious locals pulling up in their quiet cul-de-sac, cameras at the ready.Photos of the tree, over 20 metres tall and more than 200 years old by some estimates, regularly go viral online. An unofficial Google Maps listing for the “Sacred Tree” guides visitors to this otherwise unremarkableAdelaidebackstreet.View image in fullscreenThe river red gum on Overbury Drive is over 20 metres tall and more than 200 years old.Photograph: Sia Duff/The GuardianAt sunset, its silhouette seems to radiate gold light as rainbow lorikeets screech and swoop around its branches. Their nests are hard to spot from the road – high up above the parked cars, wheelie bins and power lines, the tree’s vast canopy could be its own little world.“The tree is basically why I moved here,” says Paolo Rossi, who has lived on Overbury Drive for two years.The 36-year-old architect’s first-floor flat looks out over the tree, allowing Rossi and his Italian greyhound Fifi to glimpse a history that predates the establishment of the South Australian state itself. “It’s so powerful as a living monument to something a bit ancient,” he says.“For me, it’s amazing to look out my window and see this thing that has been around before any of this existed.”But in recent years, his sense of awe turned into concern.First, he started to spot drying and dying leaves. Then its branches, some between 2 and 3 metres long, started to die back. With each week, he would see another limb begin to turn.“I tried not to make eye contact with it for maybe the last six months – I thought, ‘Wow, this tree has been around for hundreds of years; imagine if it died on my watch?’ Then it started dying.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s amazing to look out my window and see this thing that has been around before any of this existed,’ says Paolo Rossi with his dog Fifi.Photograph: Sia Duff/The GuardianWhen the tree first sprouted, forests of tall red gums just like it lined watercourses around what we now call Adelaide. The Adelaide Plains were home to fields of kangaroo grass and copses of wattle, mallee and she-oak. The land was so carefully maintained through fire-burning by generations of Kaurna people that when settlers did eventually arrive, some compared it to an English park.Today, the suburb of Clarence Park bears little resemblance to that precolonial landscape, and the red gum might have disappeared too if not for an unusual legal intervention.The official story is that when Gertrude Overbury, an 85-year-old farmer’s widow who once owned the surrounding land, died in 1943, her will stipulated the tree be protected in the inevitable event the property be carved up and subdivided.The punishment for felling Australia’s foreshore trees is a mere pittance against developers’ obscene profits | Paul DaleyRead moreStefan Caddy-Retalic, an adjunct senior lecturer at the University of Adelaide’s Waite Arboretum, says in earlier centuries these river red gums would grow deep tap roots that accessed subterranean aquifers, and lateral roots that soaked up surface rainfall. But the neighbourhood has undergone a radical transformation since the red gum first took root.“Imagine that you’re a gum tree,” he says. “Then a city starts to grow up around you, so some of your lateral roots are pruned because there’s a trench put in for a road, or someone puts in slab for a house, or storm water drain or NBN conduit.“You lose a lot of your ability to harvest rain, and then you add in a drying climate, and that means you’re not getting as much rain as you used to.”While cities grow more inhospitable to these old giants, another cycle soon sets in: trees and fields are replaced by steel roofs and asphalt roads that absorb heat during the day and re-radiate it at night.“Overnight, the city doesn’t cool down; it stays hot, and that means more moisture is being lost in the soil. So we lose the shade impact, we lose the evaporative cooling benefit, and we also lose the habitat benefit for biodiversity.”View image in fullscreen‘Just by looking at the tree, you can kind of trace back its story.’Photograph: Sia Duff/The GuardianCities around the world have increasingly been paying attention to the benefits of urban canopy beyond even the mitigation of the “urban heat island” effect; research suggests urban trees can improve sound quality, boost cortisol levels in walkers and reduce flooding risks.But the protection of urban canopies has been a contentious issue for local and state governments around Australia. While “leafy suburb” has grown synonymous with desirability and affluence, establishedtrees are often viewed as an inconvenience, a safety risk and an impediment to development. And while some councils give away seedlings of native trees to residents in an effort to boost the urban canopy, established trees are felled en masse – both legallyand illegally. A 2021 study found greater Adelaide alone lost 75,000 trees a year.“People expect trees in their environment, but they don’t want to be responsible for them,” Caddy-Retalic says. “One way or another, it always comes down to this: ‘I love trees, but this tree needs to go.’”At Overbury Drive, Rossi did not want the tree to go. He was determined the red gum should stay, even as it grew visibly sicker and sicker.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

And when I realised they weren’t, that’s when I got a bit freaked out,” Rossi says.He began dropping notes in letterboxes and arranged a neighbourhood meeting.Rachael Nielsen and Carlo Jensen moved to the street five years ago and were among the 20 or so neighbours who turned up. They had been trying to teach their young sons to value and respect nature.View image in fullscreenThe ailing tree is now showing fresh signs of life.Photograph: Sia Duff/The Guardian“We’re trying to teach Gerry that the trees are not ours,” Nielsen says. “We do not own the trees, even though they’re on the street outside our house and maybe in our yard, but we do not own the trees.”A retired council arborist who lived one street over had also been monitoring the tree. His research of hydrological maps revealed the history before the bitumen, the Overburys and the colonisation of Kaurna Country: there used to be a creek running through Overbury Drive.“Just by looking at the tree, you can kind of trace back its story.”At the neighbourhood meeting last June 2024 the group learned that money would be set aside in the council’s 2024-2025 budget – along with a $180,000 plan to plant 440 new trees. But by December there had been little progress. The tree’s health continued to rapidly decline. Worried residents went to local media to raise the alarm.That month the City of Unley council began installing four red water bollards around the base of the tree to deliver about 1,600 litres of water each day to the tree’s root system three metres below street level. In April, work will begin to rip up one lane of asphalt to create a half moon of garden hugging the tree.Just two months after the bollards’ arrival, the tree has started to bounce back; there are signs of new life, rather than a slow death.“The leaves look greener, they’ve got colour in them,” Nielsen says.“Either it’s about to flower, or it’s putting out new growth,” Rossi adds. “It’s about to dosomething.”But while the tree appears to have been saved, Jensen is wary of failing to see the forest for the Sacred Tree – particularly after signing up to notifications from the state’s planning website.“I get emails every week, seeing all of these significant tree removals, regulated tree removals, and that’s just in Unley council. And then you get emails from them that are like, ‘Oh, we need to do things to increase our tree canopy.’”View image in fullscreenThere are plans to rip up one lane of asphalt to create a half-moon of garden hugging the tree.Photograph: Sia Duff/The GuardianCaddy-Retalic says these tensions will continue as the demand for housing grows, putting a premium on every square foot of land.“There’s a huge pressure to subdivide that block and put another house on it, or to widen that verge, or whatever it might be. And we’re really poor at quantifying the economic value of trees.”For now, at least, Rossi feel a little better as he takes in that remarkable view out his window.“I just couldn’t look at it because I thought it was too stressful,” he says. “But I can now.”Explore more on these topicsTrees and forestsAdelaideSouth AustraliafeaturesShareReuse this content"

His team of international researchers used computer modeling to replicate the transport of blooms on strong currents controlled by negativeNorth Atlantic oscillation(NAO), and how the changing atmospheric conditions helped create the giant sargassum belt.“We had posed the hypothesis before that it is not the rivers that feed the formation of the sargassum blooms in the tropical Atlantic. This model supports the idea that nutrients from slightly deeper layers in the ocean feed the blooms.”Muller-Karger continued, saying that “models showed that some patches of the sargassum were swept up by the wind and currents from the Sargasso Sea toward Europe, then moved southward, and from there were injected into the tropical Atlantic.“At first, we saw just a few patches being pushed south by the NAO. But these algae patches were met with the right conditions to grow and perpetuate blooms. This population of algae, now separated from the Sargasso Sea, forms new blooms every year thanks to having enough light, nutrients and warmer temperatures,” he said.Almost annually for more than a decade, giant clumps of goop from the 5,000-mile-wide sargassum belthave washed ashorein the Caribbean, and from Florida to Mexico, creating problems for local authorities and businesses that rely on tourism.There are also significant health concerns. The rotting sargassum releases large quantities of hydrogen sulfide, which fills the air with an acrid odor similar to rotting eggs, and can provoke asthma and other respiratory issues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scotland and Wales have different property taxes and are not affected.“It’s madness in terms of everybody who is trying to move in the last week of March,” said Richard Dolan, the managing director of Greens Removals in East Anglia.“When you make an announcement like this, you’re creating pandemonium in the system,” he said. “We are only dealing with clients who have got a completion date. There is a huge number of people that ring us every day and ask us if we have any space.”From 1 April, significant changes to stamp duty land tax will affect first-time buyers and home movers. The biggest is the reduction of the nil-rate threshold from £250,000 to £125,000. This means that buyers will now pay a 2% tax on the part of the property value between £125,001 and £250,000.For first-time buyers, the tax-free threshold is being cut from £425,000 to £300,000, plus the maximum property value eligible for relief will drop from £625,000 to £500,000.While the current regime stands until 31 March, most banks are guaranteeing to process mortgage completions in time only if key paperwork is submitted by 25 March. Lloyds Banking Group, the country’s largest mortgage lender, and Barclays are among the big names to have asked conveyancers to request mortgage funds no later than this date.“We are expecting a rush of customers trying to complete their purchase and avoid the extra cost,” said Amanda Bryden, the head of Halifax Intermediaries & Scottish Widows Bank at Lloyds. “We’ll do everything we can to get completions turned around before the stamp duty deadline if they come to us after 25March, but there’s no guarantee.”View image in fullscreenOne removal company boss described the situation before the stamp duty deadline as ‘worse than I’ve ever known it’.Photograph: TM O Pictures/AlamyThose in the removals industry say the picture is more chaotic than when Covid related stamp duty changes wereunwound more gradually in 2021.With 43 years’ experience in the industry, David Strank, who runs Kent-based Stranks Removals & Storage, described the situation as “worse than I’ve ever known it”. “There’s not enough removal companies in the land to move the people that are moving next week.”Strank suggested the deadline had not been publicised enough and had “crept up on people”. With the pressure on, removers were picking up boxes early and putting them in temporary storage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To avoid having to pay an extra £6,500, one first-time buyer had agreed to complete by 31 March but let the vendor stay on until 2 April when they have secured movers.“One elderly woman has decided to reduce her property to cover everyone else’s stamp duty,” said Strank. “She’s too frail. She can’t cope with the stress. It’s going to cost her about £10,000.”Sarah Dwight, who runs her own eponymous practice and is a member of the Law Society’s conveyancing and land law committee, said property lawyers and conveyancers were working gruelling hours to ensure transactions made the cut-off date but did not have “magic wands”.“We are all working flat out,” she said. “I was working on the weekend, emailing documents and letters to other solicitors and they were responding immediately.”Dwight said that because the deadline has bigger implications for first-time buyers it was pushing pressure up the chain. “Normally first-time buyers aren’t overly pushy, because it’s their first home and they are excited. But some are going to lose far more than £2,500 and they’ve usually been waiting the longest for a chain to fall into place.“I’ve had an email from a client that says: ‘If we miss next week, then we can’t move at all, and it will be your fault.’”She said the Legal Ombudsman was expecting a rise in complaints given the projected number of home moves at risk of missing the deadline. “If a client cannot complete, it is not necessarily the conveyancer’s fault. These particular clients are in a chain with six or seven others, so it’s about making sure not only your own client can move, but everybody can move,” she added.A Treasury spokesperson said: “We’re committed to making home ownership possible for hardworking Britons – that’s why we’re fixing the planning system and building 1.5m more homes.“Thanks to measures taken at the budget, there will also be an additional 130,000 transactions over the next five years by first-time buyers and others buying a primary residence.”Explore more on these topicsStamp dutyPropertyFirst-time buyersReal estatenewsShareReuse this content"

The force also confirmed the incident was “not believed to be terror-related”, and thanked those displaced and the public for their patience.A Sussex police spokesperson said it was not yet known when people would be allowed to return to their homes or whether the Hastings half marathon would go ahead on Sunday as planned.He added: “Significant progress has been made in making safe chemicals found in a house on the A259 in St Leonards on Thursday.“The explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) team successfully removed the desensitised chemicals from the house and carried out a controlled burn in a skip near the sea wall on Saturday morning.“Searches by EOD are continuing this morning for any other hazardous materials in the house, to ensure the house is clear of explosive material and the area is safe.“Around 500 additional canisters have also been found containing unknown chemicals, although these are not considered to be explosive.“They will be tested and assessed by East Sussex fire and rescue service and national specialists following the completion of the EOD’s search.“EOD’s initial assessment found large quantities of one material that indicated explosive elements in it. Scientific experiments are now being undertaken to determine the exact nature of the chemical.”Ch Insp James Scott said: “All partners are working hard to resolve the incident as swiftly as possible and allow residents to return to their homes as soon as it is safe.“We appreciate everyone’s support and ongoing patience. We know this has been incredibly disruptive.“Investigations are ongoing however, from evidence gathered so far, there is no indication that the 28-year-old man arrested intended to cause harm either to himself of anybody else.“We cannot put an exact timeframe of when the cordon will be reduced and residents can return to their homes but we should know more late afternoon.“We believe a decision on the half marathon will be made around this time. Further updates will be delivered as soon as they are available.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

These other children need protection.”Peck admitted that some exclusions will always be necessary to keep pupils and teachers safe but said more should be done to support these children to stay in school.Government data shows children on free school meals, black-Caribbean children and those withspecial ­educational needsand disabilities (Send) are among those significantly more likely to be permanently excluded.Iain Brennan, professor of criminology at Hull, who co-authored the research, said: “If you are excluded and no longer in well-supervised education, who are you hanging out with during the day? The ­opportunities for being exploited increase, and how you see yourself is also likely to change.”He added that teachers he spoke to frequently told him that “the writing was on the wall” long before a child was excluded, with external issues including domestic violence and poverty contributing to worsening behaviour at school.“If a teacher is managing a class of 30 and has limited resources and time, it’s often easier to rely on behaviour policy rather than trying to work out how to include and help that child.”However, he warned that failing to rein in exclusions risked “letting down the most vulnerable and ­traumatised children” as well as potentially creating victims of crime and “heaping pressure on prisons”.Kiran Gill, CEO of The Difference, a charity set up to tackle the social injustice of lost learning, called on the government and schools to “sit up and take notice” of this new research.She warned thatpupil referral units, designed to provide alternative education for children who have been excluded from mainstream school, are having to turn away children across the country because they are already full, and many councils are not meeting the legal requirement to find a place in education for children within six days.“That means these children are at home, or worse, on the streets,” she said.“Teachers might think that if they permanently exclude a child they will get more support than they can access in mainstream school, but this research shows that is often not the case.”‘He lashed out. He was scared’: the fight to save vulnerable UK children from being kicked out of schoolRead moreGill warned that children were not only more likely to be criminally exploited ­outside school but also to spend much more time on their phone, where they might be influenced by extreme ideologies.Kate Aubrey-Johnson, a barrister at Garden Court Chambers in London, who co-founded the School Inclusion Project, a group of 200 lawyers offering pro bono support to children facing exclusion, said: “These statistics are shocking but sadly come as no surprise. Any criminal lawyer knows this to be a stark reality for children.”She added: “The vast majority of children are excluded from school for relatively low-level disruptive behaviour that too often arises from unmet needs relating to Send.”She said that excluded children typically become isolated and lose self-esteem, making them an easy target for gangs. “They lose hope that they have a future worth living for.”Explore more on these topicsExclusionsThe ObserverKnife crimePupil behaviourSchool attendance and absenceSchoolsCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

It was for an “AI-assisted sports reporter” at USA Today’s publisher, Gannett. It was billed as a role at the “forefront of a new era in journalism”, but came with a caveat: “This is not a beat-reporting position and does not require travel or face-to-face interviews.” The dark humour was summed up by football commentator, Gary Taphouse: “It was fun while it lasted.”As the relentless march of artificial intelligence continues, newsrooms are wrestling with the threats and opportunities the technology creates. Just in the past few weeks, one media outlet’s AI project was accused of softening the image of the Ku Klux Klan. AI is also playing a part in some British journalists recording more than 100 bylines in a day. Amid the angst over the technology, however, a broad consensus is beginning to emerge about what the technology is currently capable of doing accurately.Yet media companies are already aware of an elephant in the room. Their calculations could be upended should users simply turn to AI assistants to get their content fix. “I think good quality information can rise in an age of AI,” said one UK media executive. “But we need to set the terms in the right way in the next couple of years, or we are all screwed.”The speed at which the technology has arrived has brought some early case studies in journalistic misadventure. In early March, the LA Times launched an AI tool giving alternative perspectives on opinion pieces. Itcaused alarmby saying some local historians regarded the Ku Klux Klan as a “‘white Protestant culture’ responding to societal changes rather than an explicitly hate-driven movement, minimising its ideological threat”. The pitfall, said one media executive looking at AI, was obvious: “It was given a task of making judgments it can’t possibly be expected to make.”The fact that even a tech giant like Apple had tosuspend a featurethat made inaccurate summaries of BBC News headlines shows just how hard it can be to ensure the accuracy of generative AI.In reality, teams of journalists and tech tool designers have been working for years to find the best AI uses. In terms of public content, publishers are clustering around using it to suggest small chunks of text, based on original journalism. In practice, that means headline suggestions and story summaries, easily checked by human editors. The Independent became the latest to announce this week that it would be publishing condensed AI versions of its own stories. Many publishers are trialling or have already deployed similar tools.View image in fullscreenThe Make It Fair campaign was developed to raise awareness among the British public about the existential threat posed to the creative industries from generative AI models.Photograph: Geoffrey Swaine/Rex/ShutterstockSome big organisations have also been experimenting with their own AI chatbots, allowing readers to ask questions using content from their own archives. The problem is that editors cannot possibly know the answers being spat out. Attached to the Washington Post’s chatbot feature is the note: “This is an experiment … Because AI can make mistakes, please verify the response by consulting these articles.”The amount of AI-assisted text that can be safely overseen by human editors is a live issue. Reach, publisher of the Daily Mirror and a series of other local sites, has been using its Guten tool to repackage its own journalism for different audiences. It has contributed to some eye-wateringly high byline counts for some journalists. On one day in January, one regional Reach reporter recorded 150 bylines or joint bylines across the group’s titles. While he did not use Guten himself, the technology was used to repurpose his work for other sites.Some Reach journalists have privately expressed concern. A Reach spokesperson said Guten was only a tool and “needs to be used thoughtfully” by journalists. “We’re encouraged by the progress we’ve made in reducing errors and supporting our everyday work,” they said. “This has enabled us to free-up journalists to spend more time on journalism which would otherwise go unreported.”USA Today Network made the same point about its AI-assisted sports reporter post. “By leveraging AI, we are able to expand coverage and enable our journalists to focus on more in-depth sports reporting,” said a spokesperson.Others doubt whether the time saved will go into original journalism. The former Independent editor Chris Blackhurst said recently he was “very cynical” about the idea, fearing it was more likely to be“freeing people up to work elsewhere”.While publicly visible AI-assisted journalism has created the most debate, it is actually inside newsrooms that the technology is providing gains, interrogating huge datasets. The FT, the New York Times and the Guardian are among the groups exploring the technique. It has already helped find severe cases of neglect from more than1,000 pages of hospital documents in Norway. Transcription and translation are other more everyday uses.Others are using it for “social listening”. The News Movement, which aims content at a younger audience, has built a tool that monitors what its audience are talking about on social media and feeds it back to journalists. “It helps us understand what conversations and topics people are currently having,” said Dion Bailey, its chief product and technology officer. Despite the angst about AI errors, some companies, such as Der Spiegel, are actually trying to use AI to factcheck content.What is coming next? According to academic research, it is “audience-facing format transformations”. In other words, taking a story and turning it into the kind of content that a user wants – be it condensed, audio or even video. About a third of media leaders surveyed by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism said they wanted to experiment with turning text stories into video. Tools can already turn long footage into short, shareable content.Yet hanging over all this newsroom innovation is the fear that it could all be for nought if personal AI chatbots take the place of media companies in producing content. “What keeps me up at night is AI simply inserting itself between us and the user,” said one media figure. Google’s launch this month of a new “AI Mode”, which takes information from multiple sources and presents them as a chatbot, has spooked the industry. Some believe government intervention is the only solution.Some bigger media groups have been signing licensing deals with the owners of the main AI model owners, allowing the models to be trained on their original material with attribution. The Guardian has sucha deal with OpenAI, owner of ChatGPT. Meanwhile, the New York Times is leading a lawsuitagainst OpenAI for using its work.Bailey shares the concerns, but retains hope that the media world can adapt. “If the power goes to two or three big tech companies, then we have some real, significant issues,” he said. “We need to adapt in terms of how people are able to get to us. That’s just a fact.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)NewspapersNewspapers & magazinesNews agenciesInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Mark Dunton, of theNational Archives, believes the ­documents, which go on display in the ­exhibition, MI5: Official Secrets, next week at Kew, west London, shed light on one of the most shady ­periods of British ­espionage.During the cold war period, a group of “Cambridge Spies” managed to compromise the top ranks of British Security and Secret Intelligence Services, MI5 and MI6. “All the layers of description and detail in these documents make the complexity and the mistrust clear,” said Dunton.“The original transcripts of Philby’s interrogations later can be read by the public for the first time. They will be displayed alongside some extraordinary new loans from MI5. Philby’s movements around London in 1951 make fascinating reading.”Tracking him that winter between the Athenaeum Club, the Arsenal stadium, Harvey Nichols and The Goring Hotel, officers sought evidence. Signs of a relaxed demeanour were no proof of innocence: “Such behaviour, however, should not be taken as an indication (a) that his mind is at ease, or (b) that he is not on the look-out for followers. On the contrary he has used the corner of a street into which he was turning in such a way that it would not be difficult to spot a careless watcher: on a bus he has adopted the procedure of a clever agent – although it is impossible (as it should be) to say whether this (or the street corner manoeuvre) was deliberate or otherwise. For the present we are confident that our methods will combat such tactics – if indeed they are tactics, and in any case at the first sign of Peach becoming suspicious (the repetition of recognised spotting manoeuvres will be interpreted as such) we shall withdraw.”Harold “Kim” Philby, an Etonian, had become a committed communist as an undergraduate and was recruited by the Russian intelligence services in 1934. He joined the British intelligence service six years later, serving in Washington from 1949 until 1951, when he first came under suspicion, after the defections of Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.At the first sign of Peach [Philby’s codename] becoming suspicious (the repetition of recognised spotting manoeuvres will be interpreted as such) we shall withdrawMI5 surveillance reportPhilby, who later worked for theObserveras a Middle East correspondent, has been called the “Third Man” because he was suspected by both MI5 and the Americans of being the elusive double agent who had tipped off the two spies before they could be questioned, allowing them to flee to Moscow via France.Philby was, however, publicly cleared of complicity due to a lack of evidence, or perhaps because of a ­protective MI6 strategy.The new surveillance documents show Philby was being bugged and followed in this period. Ironic, since Philby’s own memoir, My Silent War, revealed that he himself had bugged many communist sympathisers on behalf of the British government.Philby drove a black cab that he had bought as a ­private vehicle.The “watchers” made fun of their target, describing his “weatherbeaten face” and “untidy hair”. They added in their notes: “He is inclined to grin when driving; this is almost certainly due to the fact that his vehicle is an ex-taxi and it might well be called a self-conscious or shame-faced smirk.“We have noticed this previously with drivers of similar ‘models’ at which small boys and their like are inclined to jeer.” They later note that he has no mirror, “in breach of law”, which makes tailing him easier. “With our radio-equipped cars behind him it is extremely unlikely that he will see us so long as he is at the wheel.”The five Cambridge spies – Philby, Burgess, Maclean, Anthony Blunt and John Cairncross – all passed information to the Soviet Union from key citadels of the British establishment.Under suspicion again from 1962, Philby finally fled to Moscow a year later, handing over a written confession to his old MI6 friend, Nicholas Elliott. He had been accused by Flora Solomon, a former girlfriend, who said he had once tried to recruit her.Solomon was prompted to speak out, she claimed, by what she saw as the anti-Israel stance of his ­articles in theObserver. This sealed the case against Philby, who had already been named by a Soviet defector, according to theSpycatcherauthor, Peter Wright.Philby spent 25 years in Moscow, instructing trainee spies in the techniques of “tradecraft”. When he died, in 1988, he received full KGB honours.The transcripts on display in Kew will include Philby’s admission that he had passed on information leading to the presumed execution in Russia of the potential defector Konstantin Volkov and his wife.Explore more on these topicsKim PhilbyThe ObserverEspionageMI5National ArchivesCold warUK security and counter-terrorismEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I wasn’t stupid. I said no, but one of them came out and grabbed my wrist. I would love to say I was brave and started screaming or fighting back but I was too scared.Too much too young: I talked to 10,000 children about pornography. Here are 10 things I learnedRead more“At this point, I was crying and trying do something. I was raped in that car by two of them, the third one watched and recorded. At school I was quiet the whole day my friends assumed it was nothing and it was over just like normal. I’m 12 years old now … and I am [a] survivor.”The website said the schools included on the Everyone’s Invited primary school list, which it has decided to name, were there because of both past and recent reports of abuse.“A large majority of our testimonies come from individuals looking back on their experiences,” said Sophie Lennox, a spokesperson for the website. “However, we have anecdotal evidence of children as young as five submitting their stories to our website with adult assistance, be that child therapists or parents.”The website would like relationships and sex education to be taught before the age of nine.“At Everyone’s Invited, we are not suggesting a specific age at which teachers should deliver specific content,” Lennox said. “Instead, we work with schools to decide on a developmentally appropriate time to teach different aspects of relationships and sex education.”She added that evidence from the website’s education programme and testimonies suggested that “across the board, this must be delivered at an earlier age than it currently is, which is nine years old. We need to take a building block approach that educates children to have the agency, tools and language to address these topics”.Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), told the Guardian: “Primary school teachers are reporting that sexist behaviour is happening in their schools. It affects the way that children play together and how girls feel about themselves and the place they have in the world.“Children with siblings in secondary school are also passing on negative attitudes towards women teachers. Sexist and misogynistic behaviour diminishes both boys and girls.“Age-appropriate health and sex education is key to supporting young people as they navigate how to foster healthy and appropriate relationships.“All too often, the over-focus on English and maths in primary education is squeezing out time and space for activities and projects which help with social skills, empathy or personal development.“There also needs to be a debate about the toxic unfiltered access to social media by young children allowed by social media companies.”A government spokesperson said: “All pupils should feel safe and protected at school and these testimonies highlight a wide range of deeply concerning issues.“Misogynistic views are not innate, they are learned, so through our review of the relationships, sex and health curriculum we will ensure young people learn about healthy relationships, boundaries and consent from the start of primary school.“The government is also introducing a new mandatory reporting duty to ensure all professionals and those who work with children are clear on their duty to report.”In the US, call or text theChildhelpabuse hotline on 800-422-4453 or visittheir websitefor more resources and to report child abuse or DM for help.

Labour’s journey from landslide victory to ‘deep unhappiness’Rachel Reeves’s speech next week is being crafted as a ‘re-education’ on Labour’s achievements amid gloominess and sinking poll ratingsPippa CrerarPolitical editorSat 22 Mar 2025 07.14 EDTFirst published on Sat 22 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTShareWhenRachel Reevestakes to her feet in the Commons to deliver her spring statement next week, she will try to pull off what her inner circle describe as a “re-education” exercise over how Labour has used its early days in power.“We want it to be a re-education on all the good things we’ve already done in office,” said one, listing achievements including increasing the minimum wage, cutting NHS waiting lists and improving workers’ rights. “We want everybody to hear it.”That the chancellor feels she has to remindLabourMPs – and the wider public – that their first nine months in office have not been as bad as the polls might suggest is telling, reflecting concern at the top of government about gloominess over the party’s direction of travel.Many on the left are deeply anxious about how, as they see it, things have turned sour so quickly for a Labour party which swept into power with a huge majority of 174 – just short of Tony Blair’s 1997 landslide.Since then, Labour has dropped eight points in the national polls, andKeir Starmer’s personal approval ratingshave plummeted 22 points, although both have been going slowly upwards since the turn of the year.Few Labour MPs believe there is much reason for cheer, as there is little sign of the economy improving anytime soon, with growth forecasts expected to be downgraded again next week and Reeves announcingthe biggest spending cuts since austerity.The despair came to a head this week after Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, announced £5bn of cuts to disability benefits. Despite No 10 arguing that it had a “moral case” for welfare reform as well as an economic one, many Labour MPs responded with dismay.Diane Abbott, the veteran Labour MP, told Starmer at PMQs the decision was “not about morality” and instead “about the Treasury’s wish to balance the books on the back of the most vulnerable”.Afterwards, one minister said: “It’s just not the sort of thing a Labour government should be doing.” Another added: “If we can’t protect the most vulnerable, regardless of the fiscal circumstances we inherited, then what are we for?”The welfare cuts are just the latest example of a series of decisions that have sent ripples of discomfort across the wider Labour movement, starting with the winter fuel payment cut last July and more recently thehalving of the international aid budgetto pay for defence spending.The decision over disability benefits has cut particularly deep, even though there is support for the principle of reform. Aftera meeting with Kendall and Stephen Timms,the social security minister, MPs reported “deep unhappiness” across the party, including on the right.Borrowing overshoot will test Rachel Reeves’s resolve on tax risesRead more“It isn’t every day I find myself agreeing with Diane Abbott,” said one MP. “But we all have people in our constituencies who will be hit by the benefit cuts.”No 10 officials argue the welfare system will collapse unless it is reformed, with the cost of working-age sickness and disability benefits forecast to rise to £70bn a year by the end of the decade. The polls suggest voters are in favour. What they miss, however, is that people do not support targeting the most vulnerable.Government insiders are frustrated that much of what does chime with Labour values – nationalising the railways, imposing a windfall tax on oil and gas, and VAT on private schools – has been overshadowed.“It’s such a gloomy national picture that people just bank the good stuff,” one said. Some feel the country – and despondent Labour MPs – need a wake-up call about how tough things actually are.“We won because people had a sense that the country was broken and things weren’t working. The change they voted for doesn’t come without difficult decisions.”There is, however, an ongoing internal debate that Labour was not bold enough in its ambitions going into the general election, given they anticipated a difficult inheritance. The party is now, in part, dealing with the fallout from that.“It’s not that we knew things were really hard and the public didn’t,” said a cabinet source. “But you have to argue the case for your mandate. That didn’t happen, and that has now weakened our capacity to do difficult things.”Specifically, some Labour MPs feel that Reeves boxed herself in on the economy by ruling out tax rises on working people or changing her fiscal rules. It has meant that as her fiscal headroom has shrunk, so too has her room for manoeuvre.But Downing Street defends the decision. “We didn’t have any option,” one source said. “After Liz Truss we had a moment of opportunity on the economy. We took it. If we don’t show we’re serious about stability, we’ll be attacked as ‘same old Labour’. We’ll lose the advantage.”Yet despite Reeves announcing she had looked at the books when she entered the Treasury and concluded things were worse than expected, there was no suggestion that could render any of Labour’s election promises obsolete.“It feels like there’s a lack of political imagination at the top,” one senior Labour figure said. “There have been various moments over the last few months that we could’ve turned round and said: ‘Things are worse than we thought, so we need to take emergency measures.’ But we didn’t.”Some Labour MPs have pushed for the government to followGermany’s leadand change the fiscal rules to pay for further defence spending, which will be necessary in an ever more volatile world.Treasury officials argue it would be impossible for the UK to do the same. “It’s bollocks,” one said, adding that it would cost £4bn a year – the equivalent of the annual prisons budget. While Germany’s debt is just 60% of GDP, the UK’s stands at 100%, meaning borrowing costs are higher.Others have called for a wealth tax of 2% on assets over £10m, which they say could raise £24bn annually. Again, officials reject the idea, arguing the UK is on par with other G7 countries, with the top 5% of taxpayers projected to pay nearly half of all income tax in 2023-24.Reeves now has few options left. She has chosen to go for more spending cuts, slashing Whitehall budgets next week by billions of pounds more than previously expected.“It’s hugely depressing and it’s not what we came into government to do,” said one MP. “It’s also entirely counterproductive to our growth agenda. If we want to grow the economy, we have to invest. More austerity is not the answer.”There is frustration inside government that their plans are characterised as austerity. While officials do not deny deep cuts are ahead – withsome departments facing reductions of as much as 7% over the next four years– they say it is happening at half the pace as under George Osborne.“It’s just lazy and unfair,” one source said. In the October budget the government announced £190bn of spending, £140bn of borrowing and increased taxes by £35bn more than forecast. “You can’t pour that amount of money into the state and call it austerity.”The government has instead bet the house on growth. “We’re told it will be tough in the early years but we’ll eventually reap the benefits. Let’s hope they’re right,” said a cabinet source.Amid all the despair, MPs are taking some comfort from the fact that Downing Street – which in the early months was buffeted by infighting, rows overfreebies, and an apparent lack of a plan – appears more in control.Experienced officials have been appointed – among them Jonathan Powell, who was Tony Blair’s chief of staff – and the operation has been calling on thinktanks more in an effort to drum up fresh ideas on reform of the state and saving money.“It feels like the government really began in January,” said one person involved. They said No 10’s “mind has been focused by America” with a drive to pick up the pace of government and be seen to be doing things.International volatility has also played to Starmer’s own strengths, with the prime minister’s handling of the Ukraine crisis impressing many. Whether that newfound purpose can be translated to the domestic sphere is another question.And the US could yet change everything: the looming threat of Donald Trump’s trade tariffs has the potential to derail the government’s plans to get the economy growing.For now, the government is trying to focus on the future. Some insiders have been alarmed by the despair that has seeped through the movement. “We do understand the frustrations,” said one cabinet minister. “But we need to stay the course.”Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff, is said to believe that when push comes to shove, Labour’s core vote will come back to the party to keep the Tories, or even Nigel Farage, out. While some may simply choose not to vote, the polling indicates a majority would return to the fold.“Of course MPs feel this is a daunting task. They should feel that because it is,” one senior party strategist said. “But it’s so important to actually start delivering again to give people hope for the future.

It follows growing concern from MPs and campaigners about court-appointed experts who advise on life-changing decisions without having the necessary qualifications. But some organisations say it does not go far enough.The court can appoint experts to carry out assessments and provide evidence that informs judges’ decisions on child welfare matters, such as which parent a child should live with or whether they should be placed in the care of the local authority.In recent years,concerns have been raisedabout court-appointed psychologists being instructed to carry out assessments, make diagnoses and recommend therapy beyond their expertise. The concerns,first highlighted in theObserverin 2022, relate in particular to cases featuring allegations of“parental alienation”– a disputed concept that describes a child’s rejection of one parent because they have been manipulated by the other.Part of the issue is that anyone can call themselves a “psychologist” – it is not a protected title. And whileguidance saysthat psychologists appointed by the court should be regulated by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), an unregulated expert can still be brought in at the judge’s discretion.Earlier this year, anundercover investigationby the Bureau of Investigative Journalismand Tortoise Media exposed the controversial views of one unregulated expert, Melanie Gill, whose advice has been instrumental in the removal of a number of children from their mothers.In December 2023, the president of the family division highlighted the “need for due rigour” in the process of expert instruction but said tighter regulation of the title “psychologist”was a matter for parliament. Thejudgmentfollowed the dismissal of anappeal by a motherwhose children were removed from her care against their wishes after Gill said she had “alienated” them from their father.The proposed change would mean an expert must either be regulated by a UK statutory body – which for psychologists would be the HCPC – or be on a register accredited by the Professional Standards Authority.Prof Mike Wang, chair of the Association of Clinical Psychologists UK, said the change would be a big step forward. However, the proposal says that an unregulated expert can still be used if the issue in question can only be resolved with the expertise of someone who is not regulated, although the judge would have to give reasons for their decision.Wang said: “I think the intentions are good, and it’s going to be much harder if not impossible for bogus expert witnesses to be appointed to give evidence in the family courts. But we would say the exception should be removed. We are worried there are some judges who may use this loophole to justify carrying on using someone who is not regulated.”Wang also said the courts should not use the exception to avoid delays. “If it means there is a delay because you are waiting for an expert to become free, then that is what must happen – you can’t sacrifice the quality of an assessment in order to meet a time constraint.”The proposed rules apply to all expert witnesses but concerns have predominantly related to expert psychologists, who are instructed by the courts to give advice on mental health, substance misuse, trauma, relationship difficulties and abuse.Only psychologists registered with the HCPC have the skills and training to make clinical diagnoses and recommend treatment.New rules ease reporting restrictions in family courts across England and WalesRead moreWang said: “To ensure quality advice it is crucial the family courts only use those who are HCPC-regulated if they require any form of psychological expert.”The charity Rights of Women also believes the proposed changes do not go far enough – specifically in blocking evidence from experts approached before the court’s involvement or in preventing historical reports from influencing a live case. Olive Craig, the charity’s legal adviser, said: “We are concerned that these proposals do not address the specific harm caused by the use of psychologists and psychotherapists who push their personal beliefs about parental alienation.“Evidence from these experts should be inadmissible in court. This means their reports should not be allowed to be used as evidence at all. We will be asking the Family Procedure Rule Committee to include this within the proposed rules.”A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “We agree that only the most qualified experts should be able to give evidence in proceedings, which is why we are currently consulting on this issue. We will carefully consider each response before any changes are finalised.”Thepublic consultationcloses on Friday 6 June 2025.Explore more on these topicsChildrenThe ObserverPsychologyFamily lawEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

But it suddenly shot up again last year to 1,938, the data shows.Mark Dayan, a policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust and its Brexit programme lead, said: “This wave of medicine shortages has already meant people struggle to find the drugs their doctors told them were needed for conditions like epilepsy and cystic fibrosis. It’s very worrying that it appears to be rolling on at full force into a third year.”The report says that while drug shortages have become a problem globally in recent years, the UK is facing “a worsening situation” compared with the rest of Europe because of Brexit.“Elevated and troubling levels of medicine shortages are continuing, with no consistent sign of improvement. The UK has had the lowest import growth in medicines of any G7 country, driven by a reduction in EU imports,” the thinktank adds.United Nations trade data, which Dayan and his colleagues analysed, shows that the UK “once again has the lowest rise in imports of medicines of all G7 countries since 2010”.“The total value [of imports] has fallen by almost 20% since 2015, the year before the EU referendum, in cash terms – an indication of how medicine supply chains have shifted away from the UK,” the report says, with “little sign of a stable recovery since”.HM Revenue and Customs data shows there has been “a decline [in imports] focused clearly on imports from the EU, adding to the evidence that new trade barriers related to Brexit are a likely explanation”.In addition, UK drug exports to the European Economic Area – the 27 EU states plus Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein – have fallen by a third since before the UK voted in 2016 to leave the EU.The National Pharmacy Association voiced alarm earlier this month about “a growing crisis in medicine supply”. All 500 of the pharmacies it surveyed said they could not dispense a prescription at least once a day because drugs were unavailable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are strengthening our domestic resilience further by investing up to £520m to manufacture more medicines, diagnostics, and medical technologies in the UK.“We are also working closely with theNHS, regulators and other key partners to cut red tape to grow our life sciences sector, and with international partners to bolster supply chains.”Explore more on these topicsHealthPharmaceuticals industryNHSBrexitDrugsThinktanksEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Why is there still even a debate?Research suggests the scheme may be more popular than thought, with consultations dominated by a loud minorityPeter WalkerSat 22 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 18.32 EDTShareEven with the caveats about limited data and untangling causation and correlation, the statistics are striking: the first year of a scheme in Wales where the speed limit on urban roads was lowered to 20mphresulted in about100 fewer people killed or seriously injured.Introduced in September 2023 as a major road safety project of the Labour-run Welsh government, it made 20mph the default limit for any built-up area, defined as roads where lamp-posts were no more than about 180 metres apart. This took in about a third of all roads, with the Conservative opposition saying the definition was far too broad.At the time, other controversies were raging over roads policies, including low-traffic neighbourhoods and the expansion of London’s ultra-low emission zone – a culture war embraced by some Tory politicians.Countering this, increasingly, is hard evidence. While Welsh government statisticians warn that at least three years’ data will be needed for a meaningful conclusion, the road casualty figures – showing an estimated 10 fewer deaths and a nearly one-third drop in overall casualties – followresearch from insurersindicating that 20mph zones appear to be bringing down the number of claims.Peter Fox, who covers transport issues for the Conservatives in the Senedd Cymru, insists his worries about 20mph zones are not about the general idea, just how it was implemented, with the lower limit taken as the standard for built-up streets.“None of us are against20mph around schools, busy residential areas, or anywhere where there’s quite a lot of pedestrian footfall,” he said. “But we didn’t need to change the default position.”Lee Waters, who was transport minister in the Labour-run Welsh government when the policy was introduced, has called it “the most successful road safety intervention in modern times”. But even he concedes that with retrospect it could have been done differently.“You have to apply the sniff test,” he said. “If someone is being asked to drive at 20mph and it doesn’t make sense as to why, you have a problem. There wasn’t sufficient capacity or willingness locally to use the flexibility within the guidance, to apply it on a place-specific basis.”View image in fullscreenExperts say consultations on 20mph zones tend to be dominated by dissent, with supporters silent as they assume they are in the minority.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena PicturesThis was subsequently addressed in Welsh government guidance to councils to help them identify areas where 20mph schemes were inappropriate and the speed limit widely flouted. Officials say this assessment process is coming to an end, and changes have been made.Now 20mph zones are being proposed and implemented beyondWales, and not just from Labour politicians. Cornwall council, in south-west England, which is run by the Conservatives, began a programme of reducing speed limits to 20mph in urban areas in 2022, and it is still being expanded.Connor Donnithorne, the councillor who leads on transport matters in Cornwall, said their policy had been different to Wales, including a more targeted approach and a focus on encouraging people to reduce their speed using signs rather than enforcing it with cameras.“The idea is to do all this in a pragmatic way,” he said. “The issue is that if you force people to go 20mph on a road where it doesn’t make sense, it’s very difficult to change driver behaviour and patterns. That’s why we’ve worked very hard with the highways team to make sure that it is done in the right places, because that brings the community along with us.”For all the progress, a key question remains: as more and more evidence arrives, why is all this still even a debate? As Waters puts it: “There is still this idea that 70 or so road deaths a year in Wales is acceptable. But we would never accept 70 deaths a year on the ferry to Ireland, or on buses.”Some argue that it is because ofwhat is called motonormativity, an idea devised by Ian Walker, a professor of environmental psychology at Swansea University. This sets out that car ownership and use is so ubiquitous that people are all too often unable to think beyond it.One result, he argues, is that people implicitly accept deaths and injuries on the roads as this is seen as essentially random, and so in a curious way almost fair, when in fact the odds are notably worse for pedestrians and cyclists.“This isn’t generally done in bad faith,” Walker said. “It’s just a very car-centric mindset of thinking the risk is distributed equally, when for some it’s much higher and systemic.”Another aspect of Walker’s research has an even more pertinent lesson for politicians: policies such as 20mph zones are often more popular than people think.A study he led, based in the UK, US and the Netherlands, found that two-thirds of people believed they personally supported non-car travel more than the public at large. This is an example of a social-psychological phenomenon called pluralistic ignorance, where people automatically assume the consensus must differ from their own views.In this case, it seemingly happens “because people rarely see changes to the car-first status quo being seriously discussed or supported, let alone implemented”, Walker argues. As such, he says, consultations on 20mph zones tend to be dominated by dissent, with supporters silent as they assume they are in the minority.There is, perhaps, a lesson here for politicians, although not an easy one: sometimes it can be best to ignore the noisiest voices, and take the evidence-based course.Explore more on these topicsRoad safetyWalesLocal politicsRoad transportLocal governmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They all will no longer have access to classified information – a courtesy typically offered to former presidents and some officials after they have left public service.“I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,” Trump wrote. He said he would also “direct all executive department and agency heads to revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities from these individuals”.Earlier this month, the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, announced that she had revoked the clearances and blocked several of the people named in Trump’s memo, along with “the 51 signers of theHunter Bidendisinformation letter” – referring to former intelligence agency officials who asserted that the notorious Hunter Biden laptop, which was discovered before the 2020 election, was likely a Russian disinformation campaign.Trump’s decision to remove Biden from intelligence briefings is a counterstrike against his Democrat political opponent, who had banned Trump from accessing classified documents in 2021, saying the then ex-president could not be trusted because of his “erratic behavior”.Earlier this week, Trump announced he was pulling Secret Service protections for Biden’s children, Hunter and Ashley, “effective immediately”, after it was claimed that 18 agents had been assigned to the former president’s son for a trip to South Africa and 13 to daughter Ashley.More broadly, the security-clearance revocations issued on Friday appear to correlate with a cherrypicked list of the president’s political enemies, including the New York attorney general,Letitia James, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, both of whom prosecuted Trump during the Biden era.Others on the list include Fiona Hill, a foreign policy expert who testified against Trump during his first impeachment about her boss’s alleged scheme to withhold military aid to Ukraine as a way of pressuring its president to investigate the Bidens; Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who also testified at the hearings; and Norman Eisen, a lawyer who oversaw that impeachment.Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger,Republicanswho served on the committee investigating the January 6 US Capitol riots, were also added to the list. Trump said the information ban “includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President’s daily brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the intelligence community”.The move comes asNBC News reportedthat former president Biden and and his wife, Jill Biden, had volunteered to help fundraise for and help to rebuild the Democratic party after the stinging defeat of Biden’s nominated successor, Kamala Harris, in November.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s not just embarrassing, it’s calamitous | Tim WintonRead moreOn the Great Barrier Reef, bleaching is being detected from around Townsville to the tip of Cape York, a distance of about 1,000km.On Western Australia’s famous Ningaloo reef, waters have accumulated the highest amount of heat stress on record during an extended marine heatwave that has hit coral reefs all along the state’s vast coastline.Paul Gamblin, the chief executive of the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said history would “record this profoundly distressing moment” when two world famous reefs both suffered widespread damage at the same time.View image in fullscreenCorals begin to bleach at about 4DHW, and 8DHW can kill heat-sensitive corals. Scientists say levels up to 16DHWs have been detected on the Ningaloo coast.Photograph: David Juszkiewicz/Curtin UniversityDr Zoe Richards, an associate professor and coral scientist at Curtin University, spent 10 days monitoring the health of Ningaloo reefs and the neighbouring Exmouth Gulf earlier this month.She said in shallower areas known for their clear waters, which are popular with tourists, she had seen up to 90% of corals bleached and evidence of corals dying. Even slow-growing corals that were hundreds of years old were bleaching, she said.Ningaloo last experienced widespread bleaching only three years ago.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe WA government, which is coordinating monitoring across reefs there, said bleaching had also been reported at Kimberley, Ashmore Reef, Rowley Shoals, Barrow Island, Dampier Archipelago, inshore Pilbara and Exmouth Gulf.Richards said: “This isn’t isolated to Ningaloo – this is happening across the entire north-west shelf. There has never been this scale of impacts in WA. I am not aware of this ever happening before. Climate change has definitely caught up with the reefs in WA.”Corals lose the algae that give them their colour and most of their nutrients if ocean waters get too warm. If bleaching is not severe, corals can recover, but studies show they are less able to reproduce and are more susceptible to disease.Coral reef experts use a metric known as degree heating weeks (DHW) to show how much heat corals have accumulated. Generally, corals begin to bleach at about 4DHW, and 8DHW can kill heat-sensitive corals.Dr Jessica Benthuysen, an oceanographer at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims), first saw signs of heat accumulating in WA last August. By the end of December, she said, some areas had sea surface temperatures 4C hotter than normal.Benthuysen said levels up to 16DHWs had been detected on the Ningaloo coast, which were the highest on record.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Underwater checks found bleaching at 24 of 30 reefs surveyed.Bleaching was worse farther north – there is no concern for reefs in the park’s southern section.Last summer was the worst bleaching event on record for the reef and thefifth major outbreak in eight years, hitting all across the marine park.Dr Neal Cantin, a coral reef biologist at Aims who was on the monitoring flights, said bleaching was generally worse closer to shore but there was “high to medium” bleaching on reefs from Cairns to the far north. He said in the far north, heat stress was between six and 13DHWs, which was “capable of causing mortality”.Dr Roger Beeden, the chief scientist at the authority, said detailed analysis of the data from the flights was still being analysed, but he said the lack of recovery time for corals between major events was worrying.“It’s the frequency as well as the severity that makes us most concerned,” he said.Dr Emily Howells, a coral scientist from Southern Cross University who has been at the Australian Museum’s research station on Lizard island since February, said this was now the sixth summer in a row that bleaching had been seen there.The island, in the north of the reef, was badly hit by bleaching last summer and scientists at Aims who visited in subsequent months said the areahad lost one-third of its live corals due to the heat.Howells said there was less coral mortality this year, “but that’s because a lot of the sensitive corals died last summer”.“There just isn’t enough opportunity for these coral communities to bounce back. It’s heartbreaking,” she said.“We’re making it more and more challenging for the corals. The solution is having stronger action on climate change. The longer we wait, the worse it will get.”‘Catastrophic’: Great Barrier Reef hit by its most widespread coral bleaching, study findsRead moreNorthern parts of the Great Barrier Reef have also been heavily affected by flooding from torrential rains. James Cook University’s TropWATER group has recordedflood waters carrying sediments and nutrients in a plume across 700kmof the coast and extending as far as 100km offshore.Jane Waterhouse, a reef water quality expert at TropWATER, said major flood events appeared to be happening more often and flood plumes were reaching farther offshore.“River discharge carries pollutants, sediments and nutrients,” she said. “You get muddy water that cuts the light that seagrass and corals need to grow, and that nutrient also allows algae to grow.”Gamblin said the widespread damage from underwater heatwaves and cyclones to both reefs was “what our world-renowned scientists have been warning us about for decades”.He said fossil fuel companies were “doubling down” to get more mega projects running, pointing toareas around Scott Reef in WA being targetedfor expansion by Woodside.He said: “More mega polluting projects up at places like Scott Reef will make a tragic situation worse.

A message seeking comment was left for a lawyer representing Liebb and the other traveler, Jacob Sebbag.In the lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, Liebb said he had been in the bathroom in the back of the plane for about 20 minutes on 28 January when a flight attendant woke Sebbag from a nap and asked Sebbag to check on him.Liebb said he explained his gastrointestinal predicament and assured Sebbag that he would be out soon. Sebbag then relayed that to the flight attendant, the lawsuit says.About 10 minutes later, with Liebb still indisposed, the pilot approached Sebbag and asked him to check on Liebb, the lawsuit says. The pilot then yelled at Liebb to leave the bathroom immediately, the lawsuit says.Liebb said he told the pilot that he was finishing up and would be out momentarily.The pilot responded by breaking the lock, forcing the bathroom door open and pulling Liebb out with his pants still around his ankles, exposing his genitalia to Sebbag, flight attendants and nearby passengers,according tothe lawsuit.“The pilot became visibly enraged, broke the lock on the door and forced the door to the bathroom open, pulling Liebb out of the bathroom with his pants still around his ankles, exposing his genitalia to Sebbag, several flight attendants, and the nearby passengers on the plane,” the lawsuit said.It added that Lieb said he felt “sexually violated and embarrassed after having been publicly exposed in the nude”.“With Sebbag leading Liebb, the pilot proceeded to repeatedly push the [two] back to their seats while making threats of getting [them] arrested and making scathing remarks about their Judaism, and how ‘Jews act’,” the lawsuit continued.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are homeland. You have no rights here.”The men said United booked them on a flight to New York City the next day for free, but any savings from the complementary tickets were lost because they had to pay for an overnight hotel stay and food during their delay.The two men said that the handcuffs caused “severe wrist pain” that “persisted for days afterwards”.Maya Yang contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsUS newsUnited AirlinesAirline industryHoustonTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

He was once described by the former education ministerPap Ndiayeas “very close to the most radical far right”. Bolloré, in a senate hearing in 2022, denied political or ideological interventionism, saying his interest in acquiring media was purely financial and his cultural empire was about promoting French soft power. He said his group was so vast, it contained all views.But some independent booksellers say it is dangerous for democracy for one conglomerate to have such a huge influence on cultural output. Hachette Livre, which was part of the Lagardère group bought by Bolloré’s Vivendi in 2023, is the No 1 publisher and book distributor in France. It owns scores of publishing houses, producing the bestselling Asterix comic books, literary fiction, thrillers, political titles, Manga comics and school textbooks. The group also owns the Relay bookstores at French train stations. Hachette has more than 200 publishing imprints worldwide. It is the second biggest publishing conglomerate in the UK, where it owns Hodder & Stoughton, and is the third biggest in the US.As well as the moves by some booksellers, protest groups on the left have started a “bookmark rebellion”, where individuals hide bookmarks inside paperbacks in large commercial stores with messages such as “boycott Hachette”, detailing the scale of the Bolloré empire.View image in fullscreenHearts and reviews for books in Le Pied à Terre.Photograph: Ed Alcock/The GuardianThese bookmarks have regularly been placed inside the memoirs of the former UK prime ministerBoris Johnson, published in France by a Hachette imprint, and ofJordan Bardella, the young president of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally, whoseCe que je cherche(What I’m Looking For) has sold more than 150,000 copies, with the might of Bolloré’s publicity machine behind it.Willems acknowledged it was hard to rebel against a group that controlled such a large part of distribution. “We’d like to be able to stage a boycott,” he said. But this was impossible because of Hachette imprints’ vast back- catalogue, which includes key authors such as the punk feministVirginie Despentesand writers including Lola Lafon. “A boycott would be damaging for customers who want to read those writers. So we do what we can,” he said.This meant not ordering certain new books, or taking fewer copies and placing them away from prime positions on tables. Willems will also limit events for Hachette books, with one recent exception for a local novelist friend of the bookshop.View image in fullscreenA customer browses in Le Pied à Terre.Photograph: Ed Alcock/The GuardianWillems said customers had been interested to learn about Bolloré’s presence in publishing. “But it’s hard for people these days. They’re wary of what food to buy, what clothes to buy and now it’s what books they buy. It becomes exhausting.”In Lyon, Martin Beddeleem, from the independent bookshopLa Virevolte, said: “In the book world, we’ve been worried for some time about the concentration of ownership that runs from book editing to publishing and distribution.” In the current polarised political landscape in France, he felt that books could become “a weapon”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bookshop will host a public debate on the issue in June.Benoît Grange, from the climate protest collective Les Soulèvements de la Terre, part of the bookmark protest, said: “This is about informing readers. Around 700,000 bookmarks have been printed. People keep asking us for more so they can slide them into books in shops. It’s ongoing.”The French Nobel-winning novelistAnnie Ernauxsaid at the time of the Hachette takeover thatshe would refuseto be published by the group.This week, the representative body for staff at Hachette Livre,expressed concernsover what it called an editorial line close to the far right in Bolloré’s other print and TV media.Jean-Yves Mollier, a historian of French publishing and professor at the University of Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, said Bolloré’s expansion had added “an enormous publishing conglomerate” to a media empire. Mollier likened this to the expansion of the media mogulRupert Murdochinto book publishing in the US. “I think for freedom of expression, pluralism and democracy it can represent a risk,” he said.Hachette Livre was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsBooksFranceParisPublishingEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

There were approximately 200 people at the park when the shooting occurred.Those killed included two 19-year-old men and one 16-year-old boy. Police have not yet released the names of those killed and others who were injured but said that the victims were between 16 and 36 years old.In a press conference on Saturday, police said that seven people who were injured had been sent from local hospitals to El Paso for further treatment. Four others have been treated and released, and police are still waiting on updates from local hospitals on the remaining four patients.No arrests have been made but police are following “multiple leads”, officialssaid, adding that “this is a huge crime scene with a lot of moving parts”.In a statement on Facebook on Saturday, the Las Cruces police department issued a public request for videos from the Young Park shooting, particularly “video that shows the shooting or subjects with firearms, to submit the video so investigators can analyze it and help develop a better understanding of the incident”.Police added that casings had been located “throughout the park and parking lot” and that “all the casings located so far are handgun caliber casings”.One witness, 20-year-old Angel Legaspy, whose parked car was struck by bullets,toldthe New York Times: “They just started shooting and they just started running around everybody,” adding that the shooting was “like all over the place”.On Saturday morning, Johana Bencomo, a Las Cruces city councilor and the mayor pro temp,wroteon Instagram: “Part of me wanted to write that this is something you never really think this is going to happen in your city but that actually feels deeply untrue. Honestly [nowadays] a tragedy like this feels like a nightmare just waiting to come true at any possible moment, yet also always praying and hoping it never will.“As with all acts of gun violence in our city and beyond, my heart is broken for the victims and families impacted. This was a heinous act of violence that will leave our city mourning,” she added.New Mexico’s governor, Michelle Grisham, has alsoissueda statement, saying: “The indiscriminate nature of this shooting is both shocking and unacceptable, but sadly not surprising. This violence tears at the fabric of our communities and leaves wounds that may never heal.”“I am mobilizing state resources to support local law enforcement in their investigation. If you have any information, particularly video or images that could help identify those responsible, please come forward and contact the Las Cruces police department immediately,” she added.The Guardian has reached out to city officials for comment.Explore more on these topicsNew MexicoGun crimeUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

When Alinejad realized that he was speaking on the phone, she said “sorry” and grew worried. “I was like, the guy is a little bit suspicious so I got panicked. I ran to my entrance door,” Alinejad recalled. She scrambled to get the key and then saw him in her front garden.“It was full of sunflowers,” Alinejad said. “He was like, in the sunflowers staring into my eyes.” She told her friend that they should leave right away for their planned trip to Connecticut.She told her husband, maybe he was just taking photos. “A lot of people [are] taking photos of my garden, my beautiful sunflowers.”Alinejad had used the garden as a salve for the frequent insults and threats received for opposition to Iran’s treatment of women, planting a flower for “every single curse” against her. “That’s why you see I have a beautiful, massive garden, because I face a lot of cursing and threats.”As it turned out, that man was a would-be assassin named Khalid Mehdiyev, and Alinejad was the target of an extraordinary plot to kill her and silence a powerful voice of opposition to the Tehran regime.Federal prosecutors showed how Mehdiyev was supposed to be the triggerman in aninternational murder plotinvolving the Iranian government and Russian mobsters named Rafat Amirov and Polad Omarov. Iranian officials hired Amirov and Omarov to kill Alinejad in the US for $500,000 after previous plots failed, prosecutors said.The Iranian regime wanted to assassinate Alinejad due to her advocacy for women’s rights and freedom. She had left Iran in 2009 following the country’s disputed 2009 presidential election and moved to the US, where she launched online campaigns for women’s rights and worked as a journalist, author and fierce critic of the Iranian government.Amirov and Omarov werefound guiltyon Thursday in Manhattan federal court of charges such as murder-for-hire, and attempted murder in aid of racketeering. Omarov’s lawyer, reached for comment, said in an email: “We respect the jury’s verdict, but plan on filing an appeal on Mr Omarov’s behalf.”Mehdiyev testified as a government witness at trial. Prosecutors said that Amirov and Omarov paid him $30,000 to kill Alinejad and detailed the alleged plot in court papers.View image in fullscreenRafat Amirov and Polad Omarev appear in court in New York as Masih Alinejad testifies.Photograph: Jane Rosenberg/ReutersIn mid-July 2022, Amirov sent photos of Alinejad and her home, as well as her address, to Omirov. In turn, Omirov sent the information to Mehdiyev.Days later, Mehdiyev acquired an AK-47-type assault rifle and even boasted to his housemate: “I bought this thing[,] you’d lose your mind if you saw it…war machine…f--k” in a text with several crying smiley-face emojis.Mehdiyev then repeatedly traveled between his Yonkers,New York, home and Brooklyn where he surveilled Alinejad and her family. He repeatedly sent updates to his gangster buddies who showered him with encouragement. In one missive, Mehidyev told Omarov he was at the “crime scene”.“Ok. You are a man!” Omarov responded in a 24 July 2022 exchange, according to court papers.The duo swapped messages several days later, brainstorming ways to lure Alinejad to the door. Maybe Mehidyev could ask for flowers from the garden?She did not, however. It seemed that Omarov and Amirov were growing concerned about Mehdiyev. “This matter is going to be over today, brother. I told them to make a birthday present for me,” Omarov said in a 27 July 2022 text. Amirov responded with “an image of two hands together in prayer” and links to Alinejad’s social media accounts.The next day, Mehidyev drove back to Alinejad’s home. En route, Mehidyev recorded a video that showed a suitcase in the backseat, and opened the front flap – revealing the assault rifle.He sent the video to Omarov with the caption “we are ready.” Omarov sent Amirov the video. Amirov cautioned that Mehidyev should “keep the car clean” – to shoot Alinejad away from the vehicle, lest there be forensic science evidence.Mehidyev did not know that he was being watched. Police had spotted him around Alinejad’s neighborhood the day before and on the morning of 28 July 2022, thought he was acting “suspiciously”.Mehidyev got into and out of his Subaru several times. He went to her house, tried looking inside the window, and also tried opening the front door. Mehidyev even ordered food delivery to his car.The plot was foiled after Alinejad left her home. Mehidyev drove away about 15 minutes later.He ran through a stop sign and police pulled him over. After checking his documents, police found that he was driving without a license – and that it had been suspended – resulting in his arrest.While Mehidyev was at the police precinct, officers searched his car. They found the gun – which had an “obliterated” serial number – and ammo, as well as more than $1,000.Iranian dissident put under 24-hour police protection in UK after threats to lifeRead moreMehidyev told authorities that he was merely looking for an apartment in that neighborhood because “the rent was too high and he needed to find a new place to live.” Yes, he tried to open the outer door of the house, so he could knock on the inside door and ask about renting a room. The cash was in case he needed to rent a hotel room, court papers said.Without being asked about a gun, Mehidyev “volunteered” that he didn’t know anything about the weapon. After agents left the interview room, Mehidyev asked to speak with them again.Mehidyev told them the AK-47 was his and that “he had been in Brooklyn because he was looking for someone.” He then requested a lawyer and declined to speak any more.Mehidyev reportedly pleaded guilty to his involvement in the plot. He became the prosecution’s key witness at trial.Alinejad has not lived at her home since late July 2022.She went back “just for once to see my neighbors, to make sure that they’re watering my garden and my tree”.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkUS crimeIranfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s exquisite and confounding. For one, it demands its audience be extremely tall to witness anything unless they are in the first dozen, tightly packed rows. The view is not great for the rest of the 4,800 people here – a shame, because there’s so much to take in.Since her career began more than a decade ago, twigs’s work has been doggedly conceptual, with a keen eye for visuals – physically grounded in movement as well as musically abstract. Defying convention is baked into her offering. Now it feels as though Tahliah Debrett Barnett has the audience, and the big label budget, to really go nuts with set design.A mysterious black cube broods centre stage as shrouded dancers contort their bodies. Encased in a hard-edged khaki bodice and flowing gown, twigs begins Act I a cappella, her delicate soprano in contrast to the harsh, monochrome environment. Her back catalogue is full of these contrasts, artfully delivered, but this set dials them up: the gossamer within the hard-edged, the sad inside the sexy.When twigs does grab a microphone, her range is magnificent, from coo to trill to bawlMary Magdalene, from her 2019MagdaleneLP, finds twigs intoning about “a woman’s work, a woman’s prerogative”, quoting Kate Bush as disembodied, polyphonic backing vocals fill the space. Soon, though, we’re in the judder of a warehouse rave. The set plunges into the club-oriented physicality ofEusexua,an album about a feeling that – roughly – translates as a kind of orgasmic flow state where the self dissolves, leaving pure inspiration in its wake. Everybody on stage is in their pants.Part throb, part sob,Eusexua’sRoom of Foolsaccurately restates the joyous abandon of dancing it out. We now refer to this as “somatic healing”, but – in one coining or another – expunging mental suffering through the body has always featured in human ritual movement. “We’re open wounds, just bleeding out the pressure,” twigs sings.Watch the video for Room of Fools by FKA twigs.The context here is that twigs unexpectedly found liberation at Prague warehouse raves while filmingThe Crowa couple of years back. The backstory to that, however, is gruelling – including, but not limited to, her relationship with the actor Shia LaBeouf. Histrial for alleged assault, battery and emotional distresswas postponed until September this year. “I was hanging on by an eyelash,” twigs toldImogen Heap in an interview hosted by Spotify.Anyone wanting to pursue the Tahliah Debrett Barnett technique, meanwhile, should search for the 11-step somatic healing sequence twigs came up with to reattune:The Eleven.A few months back it became another movement piece,performed at Sotheby’s.Later tonight, twigs and her dancers will find themselves trapped inside the stark cube’s smothering, diaphanous walls, fighting their way out in a sort of 3D shadow play with impressive depth of field. Later still, the structure will be revealed as a skeleton of girders with pulleys, an industrial space with chain swings and a pole to dance on – play as torture, or the other way around. Twigs spends a lot of time spinning upside down, her physicality ecstatically sinuous and masochistically racked.View image in fullscreenFKA twigs and her A-game dancers.Photograph: Richard Saker/the ObserverGreat swathes of this gig pass in choreography. Her troupe know they are working for a dancer who went pro in childhood, so bring their A-game to every twitch. One indisputable highlight comes with the terrific percussive workoutDrums of Death, which re-enacts theSeveranceoffice vibe moves of the track’s video. Another occurs onGirl Feels Good, an homage to Madonna that also takes its choreographic inspiration from her line dancing-themedDon’t Tell Mevideo (2000).Purists will grouse that, with dance given equal billing, twigs does not actually sing every note. “Live” is, admittedly, an elastic concept at many pop shows where the music so often arrives via playback. There’s no band, but twigs’s producer Koreless DJs and plays piano. Two dancers, Eddy Soares and James Vu Anh Pham, double as instrumentalists, with guitar, clarinet and piano given live cameos. And when twigs does grab a microphone, her range is magnificent, from coo to trill to bawl.View image in fullscreenFKA twigs at Aviva Studios, ManchesterPhotograph: Richard Saker/the ObserverQuestion marks must also hover over – spoiler alert – the prop beast that turns up in Act III, a winged demon that, eventually, appears to peel back its own head to reveal a giant baby-like mask of twigs’s face. In a production laced with impactful moments delivered with elegance – the goring of a dancer in silhouette at the culmination ofNumbers, the funny, affecting mid-set faux interview skit that segues intoKeep It, Hold It– the monster feels overbaked.All is forgiven, though, as twigs’s back catalogue dovetails into some of the most accessible music of her career.Perfect Stranger– the most commercial pop she has yet made – is an absolute banger that deserved vertiginous chart placings. It all ends with the 2019 track that she used to be most famous for,Cellophane. Long pregnant gaps between her sung lines climax into a pained howl. By this point, unscripted visuals have become part of the show – giant backlit silhouettes of twigs playing out on the venue walls.Explore more on these topicsFKA twigsKitty Empire's artist of the weekPop and rockElectronic musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

And by people I mean us all. Lockdown popped up on regular shows such asMore or LessandWomen’s Hourlast week, as well as several specially commissioned programmes, right acrossRadio4.Three episodes of the four-partLockdown’s Legacy–The Children,The TeachersandThe Medics– each half an hour long, were presented by Catherine Carr, ofWhere Are You Going?Carr is a lovely interviewer of those who are unused to being interviewed, and these shows were sympathetic and subtle. She spoke to year 11 children who were in the final year of primary school when the first lockdown began in March 2020. They never went back. “There were some friends I never saw again,” says one. “Not ever.” Their first year of secondary school was disrupted too, with the social distancing and on-off lockdowns of autumn 2020, followed by the single day back in January 2021, then full lockdown again. Early 2021: those dark winter months indoors when time grew heavy and it genuinely felt as though normal life could never return.Some of the children’s recollections were sweet (one staged a guinea pig sports day in his garden), some devastating (“I know someone who got an eating disorder from it,” says another, “and still has it.”) Teachers remembered the clear differences between the kids’ circumstances – how several were happily holding toys up to cameras while others showed them holes they’d punched in the bedroom wall. Others were drifting further and further away. The medics episode cut straight to the heart: “In the early days there was this unnerving silence,” said one hospital doctor. “Suddenly children had become invisible.” A GP: “We went from 10,000 children per hour consult[ing] with GPs across London face to face to one per hour.” The children weren’t coming in. They just disappeared.One of the teenagers that Carr spoke to, when asked about how he would describe lockdown to kids who didn’t go through it, responded: “I think I would just exaggerate it for the plot. Like… back in my day we couldn’t even step out the house! You wouldn’t even last a day!”I felt I needed some of that vim while listening to new Goalhanger offeringJourney Through Time. (Yep, another history podcast.) Hosted by historians David Olusoga and Sarah Churchwell (he’s British Nigerian, she’s American), the opening two-parter about the Black Tom Island explosion in New York in 1916, where a munitions factory off Jersey City was blown up by German saboteurs, was fine but surprisingly academic.Exciting, right? Unfortunately, the first episode doesn’t offer up anyone interesting enough to grab the attention. Instead, we learn about the supposedly then-neutral US making money from sending weapons to anti-German forces. Not until episode two, when we meet Martha Held, an opera singer turned bordello owner, does the story take off. “Bombs were being brought into the dining room,” said Olusoga. “Guests sang German patriotic songs, including Deutschland Über Alles [sic].”Michelle Obama is an immensely impressive person, but her “go high” positivity is reduced to platitudes hereBoth Olusoga and Churchwell are good: chatty and fluent, with information packed into every sentence. But as well as more grabby human stories there’s a need for some decent production: some energy and contrast; some audio drop-ins (archive sound? A short musical sting?). The overall dynamic is… steady. It makes the listening experience airless, like an afternoon lecture in a hot room. Your mind wanders.At leastJourney Through Timegave us actual facts. Not so Michelle Obama’s new podcastIMO, which she hosts with her brother, Craig Robinson, who’s an executive director of the US National Association of Basketball Coaches. IMO stands for “in my opinion”, but as neither Obama nor Robinson seem to have any unusual takes, it’s hard to work out why. Michelle (“Meesh” to Robinson) is an immensely impressive person, but her “go high” positivity is reduced to platitudes here. And worse, in the first episode proper, to dull gender cliches. Hey people, ya know that men just don’t talk about emotions! They like to watch sports instead! Ugggghhhh.Pity the poorIMOadvice-seeker, Eva, who sent in an honest and touching letter about how she’d been dropped by a friend because that friend felt Eva hadn’t been supportive enough during a tough time. Obama, Robinson and second-episode guest Issa Rae were almost dismissive – “Eva was like, hit or miss,” said Rae. “That’s a violation!” – and their recounting of their own experiences around friendship were dull. You can feel like a friendship is “off” without wanting it to end; you can feel guilt and relief and hurt at the same time. Or, if you’re onIMO, perhaps you can’t.There was the odd insightful moment: I enjoyed Robinson saying that he went out regularly with two male friends for drinks and they would set up a “chair of angst” where one of them could sit and talk about what was bothering them. But Michelle’s “revelation” that she likes to spend seven hours sitting at a table talking with a friend when they come to stay, including one hour’s discussionper child,sounded even more boring than the show. Obama’s children are adults! What is there to say? Plus, whatever happened to having fun?‘The odd insightful moment’: watch IMO with Michelle Obama, Craig Robinson and guest Issa Rae.Explore more on these topicsRadioMiranda Sawyer on podcasts and radioPodcastsMichelle ObamaDigital mediaFactual radioreviewsShareReuse this content"

After the Pistols performed a version of New York, Carter asked the crowd: “How many of you lot were here the first time?” After a roar from the crowd, he shouted: “It’s a pleasure and a privilege to be here with these legends tonight.” He then joked: “Right, who wants to call it there?”Jones then launched into the strings of Pretty Vacant.

Carter saw off a possible stage invasion by hurling himself from the stage into the crowd.

From the plethora of celeb cameos to the great one-liners, this comedy is an absolute treatEllen E JonesSat 22 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTShareThe Studio has some notes for Hollywood. Like inThe Oner, the second episode of Apple TV+’s new industry comedy (out Wednesday 26 March) from theSuperbadteam of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. The incoming head of Continental Studios, Matt Remick (Rogen), is careening through the Hollywood Hills in his convertible, racing to the set in time to catch the director’s virtuoso oner. That is a scene filmed in one single, continuous take, which – in this case – must also be completed in “the magic hour” before sunset when the light isjust so.As Matt and fellow executive Sal (Ike Barinholtz) make their clumsy entrance (patronising a PA, offering unwanted feedback, debating whether the oner really is “the ultimate cinematic achievement” or “just a director jacking off”), it becomes clear that the episode willitself unfold in a oner. Very clever.Did you already know all about oners? Perhaps you have an opinion on theGoodfellastracking shot v Roger Deakins’s Oscar-winning work on Sam Mendes’s war movie1917? If so, you are very much The Studio’s target audience: an unabashed cinephile who bemoans the never-ending churn of bankable “IP” while wishing for a return to the days of classics such as Roman Polanski’sRosemary’s Baby, Woody Allen’sAnnie Hallor, as Matt ruefully reflects, “some great film thatwasn’tdirected by a fucking pervert”.You are, in fact, quite a lot like Matt, a man whom corporate big boss Griffin Mill (Bryan Cranston) suspects of unsuitable instincts: “You’re obsessed with actors and directors liking you, rather than being obsessed with making the studio as much money as possible.” Griffin’s got Matt bang to rights there, as we see in another episode when Matt delegates, delays and otherwise weasels his way out of delivering a necessary note to famous nice-guy director Ron Howard.Unlike Matt, though, The Studio has plenty of constructive criticism to offer, with a point of view on every live industry issue, from overlong running times to gender parity. All the episodes zip along like an assistant in a golf cart crossing the lot on an emergency coffee run, but all contribute something interesting to the big picture. Because Matt’s personal dilemma is also the dilemma at the heart of cinema: are we making art here? Or are we making money? Is it possible to do both? And if it is, can you do so without turning into a total lying, scheming scumbag, who’d sell your grandmother for an awards speech shoutout?Rogen and Goldberg seem to be managing, at least judging by The Studio’s crammed cameo list, which overflows with the friends they’ve made – and kept – along the way. I mean, they managed to get Scorsese for the first episode. And let me tell you, no one plays “Martin Scorsese” like Martin Scorsese. This guy’s got talent!Indeed, every cameo in The Studio is a career-best, and every supporting actor is perfectly cast. It’s a treat whenever Kathryn Hahn enters a room as marketing maven Maya, giant adult sippy-cup in hand, to ream out Matt for even aspiring to cool (“Who are you? The fucking Fonz?”). Or when ex-studio head Patty (Catherine O’Hara) turns up to reminisce – very respectfully, mind – about some dearly departed dick (“He had a package like a caramel leather sofa … rest in peace”).One evergreen criticism is that, like La La Land or Entourage, The Studio is another example of the industry’s self-obsession which risks alienating the average audience member, who’s never set foot on a soundstage nor sampled the delights of on-set catering. Not even a single M&M.But, as Maya could tell you – might scream in your face, in fact – not everything needs to be relatable, Matt. Whatever happened to being awestruck by glamour? This is Hollywood, baby, the town where, actually, magic hour lasts all day. Or all decade, back in the 70s; that era of Easy Riders and Raging Bulls, which the Continental team are subconsciously, sartorially reaching for in every scene. But wait, maybe the glory days aren’t over just yet, because The Studio is a triumph! You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll pre-order the Blu-ray. Two thumbs up. Five stars. No notes.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We did between 180 and 200 shows a year. But driving up and down the motorways is the hard part because the traffic is so much heavier than it ever was … There was never a problem with recovering from a show because that’s the thing that brings you to life. We were always fit to do a show. It’s just the driving up and down motorways.”McNally, who formed the band when he was 16 in 1957, said: “The traffic is now an absolute nightmare.”View image in fullscreenJohn McNally of the Searchers on stage at Theatre Royal Wakefield.Photograph: Paul Thompson/West Yorkshire ImagesThe Merseybeat band found fame playing in the clubs ofLiverpooland Hamburg. Their debut No 1 hit Sweets for My Sweet in 1963 was followed by the chart-toppers Needles and Pins and Don’t Throw Your Love Away, establishing them as a global act by the mid-1960s.But they have never played Glastonbury until now. “No one’s asked us,” Allen said. “The Searchers are finally performing at the greatest music festival of them all. What a way to round off a tour and a career.”McNally added: “A Glastonbury debut at 83! Can anyone top that? … We can’t wait to see our fans again for this incredible final farewell.”Glastonbury has long championed ageing stars, including Paul McCartney, who headlined in 2022 at the age of 80. Those playing this year include Rod Stewart, 80, and Neil Young, 79.Watch the Searchers performing Needles and Pins on the Ed Sullivan show in the US, 1964.McNally – the son of a Liverpool docker and a barmaid – said some of the veterans keep on playing because there is now money to be made. The Searchers were among many musicians who did not earn much in the past: “In the 1960s, no one had a rulebook to follow, no person to look after them. We just went through the motions and got ripped off.”He added: “You think: hang on, where’s the money going? We did our first tour of America in 1964 and, when we got back, it was like: ‘tuppence for you and tuppence for you and tuppence for you …’. What? We were paying for everything.

I have trees, shrubs, vegetables and flowers, roses, snapdragons and geraniums, which are very easy to grow in our part of the world. At the moment I am mostly pruning, which is convenient because I can do it standing up, only crouching and stooping a little. I consider pruning to be like editing – you decide how you want a shrub to grow. Every house here used to have a garden but now that land is so expensive it is mostly used for more buildings. Gardens are unusual, unfortunately.2.TheatreA Knock on the Roof by Khawla IbraheemView image in fullscreenKhawla Ibraheem in A Knock on the Roof.Photograph: Joan MarcusI saw this at the Traverse theatre inEdinburghlast year. It’s a wonderful one-woman play about a woman living in Gaza and having to respond to the small warning bombs that the Israeli army throw on your roof to let you know that you have five to 15 minutes before they destroy your house. In the play, she practises how to react quickly, what and who to take. It’s very tense and a very good account of life under these terrible conditions. It’s about the earlier war of course, the 2014 war. I think they have stopped this practice – now they just destroy without warning.View image in fullscreen3.ExhibitionPalestine from AboveThis was on at the AM Qattan Foundation in Ramallah and is now at a gallery in Istanbul. The foundation is a philanthropic organisation and it does very good exhibitions. This one investigates the ways in which Palestine has been looked at from above – surveillance, cartography, photography – and puts this in context by showing, alongside those images, pictures, art and interviews by the people living there. Viewing Palestine from the sky has long been part of a colonial war of subjugation, and Palestinians try to escape and counter this through their own works.4.MusicBehind the Symphony with Antonio Pappano: Mahler (Symphony No 1)(Marquee TV)Watch a trailer for Behind the Symphony.I very much like classical music but I have never really appreciated Mahler and always felt as if I was missing out on something. This is a documentary about the life story, history and artistry of three symphonies, one of which is by Mahler. Antonio Pappano does a very good job of describing his Symphony No 1 and I found it enlightening. Before I didn’t really understand what Mahler was trying to do, but when someone guided me through it step by step it was an entirely different experience. It grabbed me. I like Beethoven, Schubert, Bach and now Mahler!View image in fullscreen5.BookDon’t Look Left: A Diary of Genocideby Atef Abu SaifI had been following theGazawar and it got to the point where I couldn’t take any more: news of one massacre after another. I was numb and started withdrawing, but then I picked up this book by the Palestinian Authority minister for culture, who went to Gaza from the West Bank to do an event there. He took his son with him so that they could swim in the sea, then the war started and they were stuck. He wrote this diary, which exactly evokes the feeling of life there under a war against civilians as well as Hamas. If you survive, it is by chance.6.PlaceEdinburghView image in fullscreenA view over Edinburgh old town to Arthur’s Seat.Photograph: GettyThis is a place I have been visiting since 1991 and that has been very kind to me. I come every summer for its culture and music, and to walk in the gardens and parks. Many of my books have been launched here and I have made friends and feel at home. It gives me respite from the rigours of the West Bank. It’s a place where, if you love something, when you come back you find that it is still there, that it hasn’t been destroyed.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.When I was asked to review plant-based cheeses, I thought twice about doing so. Although there are some companies, usually smaller operations, that make non-dairy cheese out of fermented nuts or soya beans, more often than not it’s manufactured by big companies who are adept at recreating flavours, but who use ultra-processed ingredients such as emulsifiers, stabilisers and additives to get there.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve used vegan cheese only a handful of times in the eight years I’ve been writingmy vegan column for the Guardian, partly because I like to know what’s going into my body (and, on reading the ingredients, I am often bamboozled), and also because it varies so wildly in terms of how it behaves: does it melt, split, grate and, most importantly, how does it taste? For a food writer, that makes it tricky to use and make sure there’s consistency in the journey between my kitchen and yours.So here is my chance to dig a little deeper. In testing these cheeses, I’ve led with flavour first, looking for anything on the spectrum between buttery, sweet and mild to full-blown extra-sharp, tangy and pungent. Following closely behind, the texture has to be right, too, because so much about eating cheese is about mouthfeel and that satisfying, creamy fattiness. Finally, credentials: my vote will always be in favour of products made with natural ingredients, because, ultimately, I believe that’s where the best food comes from.The best vegan cheeseBest all-rounderLa Fauxmagerie Shoreditch smokedView image in fullscreen£4.50 for 100g at Waitrose★★★★★Absolutely delicious, and with the same instant gratification as dairy cheese – and I know because I can’t stop nibbling it.

Yes, it’s highly processed, but it is also a tasty, plant-based cheese. A solid block that could be used any which way.Best splurgeKinda Co FarmhouseView image in fullscreen£6.50 for 120g at Kinda Co£6.95 for 120g at Abel & Cole★★★★☆A very soft, organic cashew nut- and miso-based cheese. It almost melts in the fingers and then does so in the mouth. Very sharp, almost lemony at first, then gives way to a flavour that’s more “pungent miso” than cheddar. That said, it has umami in spades, the mouthfeel is spot on and it has the purest ingredients list of all these “cheeses”. With its spreadable texture, would be best between two slices or melted through pasta.And the rest …C’é Dairy? MaturedView image in fullscreen£6.99 for 120g at I Am Nut OK★★★☆☆Very soft, and hard to extract from the packaging without smooshing it. Tastes like a fermented, very sharp, savoury, cheddary … cashew paste, which is exactly what it is. Has the fewest ingredients and could be an option for those looking for purity and good flavour, and are happy to sacrifice texture. Best spread on toast.Bute Island Sheese cheddar flavour blockView image in fullscreen£2 for 200g at Ocado£2.49 for 200g at Alternative Stores★★★☆☆Mild, gently tangy and impressively cheesy at first, with a good, creamy texture, too. Actually, perhaps the flavour is too mild because it gives way to a faint but detectable starchy finish. It comes in a block and cuts better than it crumbles, but is comprised of lots of processed ingredients.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Tastes somewhere between cold unsalted butter and the mild, sweet wrapped sliced cheese that I ate (and enjoyed) in the 1980s. The mouthfeel starts at polypropylene and transforms to cream. I ate one and didn’t hate it, but I didn’t feel particularly well afterwards, either.Tesco Free From coconut oil mature cheddar alternativeView image in fullscreen£2.60 for 200g at Tesco★★☆☆☆Tastes like ground powdered rice held together by fat. On checking the ingredients, it turns out I’m wrong about the rice – it is actually four different types of starch held together by water, coconut oil, a regulator and a phosphate. On the plus side, it has a nice, smooth and solid texture that not every plant-based cheddar can boast.Nurishh cheddar flavour plant-based slicesView image in fullscreen£1.75 for 120g at Sainsbury’s★★☆☆☆Comes in slices andtastes like the mild, buttery and plasticky love child of a Baby Bel and a Laughing Cow triangle, which is weird but apt, seeing as it’s produced by the same company that makes both those cheeses.Applewood vegan blockView image in fullscreen£2.30 for 200g at Asda£2.45 for 200g at Waitrose★☆☆☆☆Tastes of nothing until masticated vigorously.

Excellent firmness to the knife.Violife CheddartonView image in fullscreen£2.75 for 200g at Ocado£2 for 200g at Asda★☆☆☆☆Tangy and salty, but not in any discernible cheese- or cheddar-like way, plus it disintegrates into a disgusting powder in my mouth.Explore more on these topicsVegan food and drinkThe FilterCheeseFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not a drop passes their lips. Those are the consummate athletes. I was a mischievous athlete. You know the little miniature bottles of Drambuie? My roommates would notice at the end of a competition that Lewis would have a little Drambuie. Delicious! But when I won the gold medal [at the 2000 Olympics] I actually had a bottle of bubbly for that. My roomies must have thought it was going to happen, so they had a little bottle for me.My early memoriesare of foodassociated with my heritage and my mum: a lot of big flavours, a lot of curry chicken. One dish I can actually taste in my mouth now is snapper, which is a very popular fish in the Caribbean. Especially on Good Friday – we only had fish, so she would prepare whole snapper in a pan, with onions, peppers, a lot of black pepper and fish seasoning. It was just heaven. Whether you ate it hot or cold, that snapper would just be exquisite.My mum worked two jobs,but we’d stock up at the weekend and she was probably batch-cooking a bit. So up early to the market and on the bus, because my mum didn’t drive. I was part of a team: Mama and I carried the bags – I think that’s where my early weight-training days came into play. We’d go to the big marketplace in Wolverhampton: the butchers, fresh produce, that fresh fish smell. I hated the smell, but looking back, I didn’t realise how blessed we were really.How often do I have a G&T moment? This is not a therapy session. You don’t need to knowIt’s welldocumented:I love an apple crumble. An apple crumble, with cinnamon and custard – mmmm! Just don’t talk to me while I enjoy myself.My boys are 18 and 16,6ft 4in and 6ft 2in. They’re big boys, and you can’t shop enough. They’ll go through half a pack of bacon and four eggs, and that’s just one of them. I’m like, “Have you seen the price of eggs?” So now I keep the really good eggs for myself, but I literally have to squirrel them away. I hide my Burford Browns in the top cupboard. He’ll probably read this now and know where they are. But we have talked about it in jest: let’s get some chickens, because this is the only way we’re going to stave off that insatiable appetite.I had the privilege of being a guest judge on Great British Menu.Oh. My. Goodness. I was so excited. I don’t think they even got the words out before I was like, “Yeah, I’m there.” You think you can cook until you see a professional. It’s all in the sauces, isn’t it? It’s just genius.If I’m cooking,I love a little G&T, prepared well. It’s an occasion, so the cucumbers will go in, lime, a little bit of music. It’s not just flung in the glass. You know everyone’s got their stock of really nice glasses they don’t really use? I bring mine out for the G&T. It’s my moment, my time, the G&T moment. How often are G&T moments? This is not a therapy session. And you don’t need to know. As and when.I knowI look well.But definitely my body has changed. It’s not as lean as it used to be, but that’s OK, because I’m not training for a purpose any more. I’m not trying to be the best athlete in the world.When you retire,there is an element of blowout, because I lived a very routine, meticulous but not obsessive lifestyle: sleep, food, rest, recovery, all part of the big game. And, naturally, you can’t sustain that to the levels you used to do, and I wouldn’t want to. So I’m glad I had that period [after retiring] where I danced with the devil for a bit. I delved into the fun side of food, which is great.My favouritethingsFoodOxtail with rice and peas, the Caribbean dish. It’s just divine and very comforting. And, actually, we talk about the importance of collagen: back in the day, that’s where you’d get your collagen, by sucking that bone dry. So I’d say there’s health benefits.DrinkMy go-to is a cup of herbal tea. It’s the last thing I have at night, no matter where or what time I come in.Place to eatIt’s closed now, but I remember having a really fantastic taster menu at Maze, Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant. That was exquisite.Dish to makeI’ve cooked a lot of salmon, and I’ve got that down pat. Just pan-fried salmon, very easy, but the key with fish is not to overdo it, so it’s still succulent. Some wilted spinach, a little squeeze of lemon at the end and maybe a herb salt. I feel very saintly when I’ve done that.Adaptability: Seven Lessons for Success in a World of Competing Demands by Dame Denise Lewis (Piaktus, £25)is out nowExplore more on these topicsFoodLife on a plateAthleticsCaribbean food and drinkinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Then out of the blue he got an emailBySam WollastonSat 22 Mar 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 11.53 EDTShareIn early 2020 life was sweet for Graham Hornigold. A pastry chef who has worked in Michelin-starred restaurants and been a judge on Junior Bake Off, he had recently launched his own small chain of high-end doughnut shops and cafes in London, along with his partner, New Zealander Heather Kaniuk, also a pastry chef. They had a baby on the way, too – a chance for Hornigold to create the happy family unit he hadn’t experienced in his own childhood.Then, out of the blue, dropped the email that would change his life.Hi Graham, I’m not sure if this is going to reach you as I’ve been searching for a way to contact you and found this email. My name’s Dionne, formerly known as Theresa … Graham was born in Germany before being taken away from me to England.“My first thought was: someone is taking the piss,” Hornigold tells me, over coffee at a branch ofLongboys, his doughnut chain. But not a lot of people knew where he was born. Could this really be his long-lost mum?Hornigold came into the world at a British army base in Germany in 1974. From the age of two he was fostered for a couple of years – he doesn’t know why – then he lived in Hertfordshire with his dad, a sapper in the Royal Engineers, and his stepmother. Hornigold’s birth mother wasn’t around; he didn’t know where she was, or even who. His dad – who drank and could be violent – didn’t say much about her, except that she had left.Hornigold describes his upbringing as difficult, and his father as “ex-army, classic 1970s”. He has a scar on his head from where his dad kicked him when he was seven. The last time they met Hornigold was 18, and knocking his father down. He does know he’s no longer around.There are a couple of ways Hornigold could have dealt with his difficult childhood. “Either you allow life to consume you and become bitter, or you utilise those challenges,” he says. He chose option B, went to college to study catering and followed his dream of becoming a chef. “The challenges are a trauma response – you advance yourself or feel a sense of acceptance.”He has a habit of slipping into the second person: putting up a grammatical buffer between himself and difficult memories, perhaps. But that’s what Hornigold did: threw himself into his passion for pastry. He says to love someone is to feed them: “Your first meal comes from your mother. If that’s not the greatest act of love, tell me what is.” Having missed out, he did wonder about his mother. Her name was on his birth certificate, but internet searches hadn’t thrown up anything. It was she who had decided to come back into his life.I wonder, given what happened, if he now wishes she hadn’t? “I wish she’d just come in and said, ‘Hi, I’m your mum, come up and see me every other weekend and we’ll have a roast.’ Just be a normal mum.” But that’s not what happened; nor was she just a normal mum. She was, in Hornigold’s words, “a destroyer of lives”.Hornigold replied to the email with some questions – What was his middle name? Where exactly was he born? – all of which Dionne answered correctly. She had recently flown in from Bangkok and they met at a hotel in Liverpool. “Hello, my darling.” A beaming Asian woman in her mid-80s reached up from the sofa. They embraced, making skin-­on-skin contact for the first time since he was a baby.Hornigold is initially quite guarded, not one to pour his heart out to some bloke from the Guardian he has known for five minutes. I ask him how that was, a hug with his mum after 45 years. “It’s like if you’ve got a DIY job and you can’t find your drill for ever, then you do, it’s a bit like that.” He has another go, digs a little deeper. “I mean, it was kind of surreal, but good, yeah.” Good how? “Like you were transported, you feel a sense of belonging you hadn’t felt before, when you don’t know your roots. Everyone wants to know their history.”View image in fullscreen‘I was blinded by the fact that she had come into my life again’: Graham Hornigold with his mother Dionne.Photograph: courtesy of NetflixThen the pragmatist returns, noting the practical advantages of knowing your mum. “Like when you’re at the doctor’s and they ask: is there a history of X, Y or Z?”It does look as if he has been transported to childhood, the one he never had. Kaniuk filmed that first encounter; there’s footage of them getting to know each other. It has been used in a forthcoming Netflix documentary, stitched together with interviews. A friend of Hornigold’s says Graham was like a little kid with Dionne; a baby, born again. The documentary is called Con Mum.The first bombshell dropped early, at that meeting in Liverpool. Dionne told Hornigold she had a brain tumour and bone marrow cancer, and had only six months to live – that was why she had come to find him. “So it was a bit bittersweet. I’d just had her come into my life; now she was being taken away again.”Suddenly there was a lot to juggle in Hornigold’s life: the baby on the way, plus a new mother, who wouldn’t be around for long, and a global pandemic making logistics difficult. But having found his mother, he wanted to spend as much time with her as they had left.Dionne – a cuddly but frail 85-year-old with a big smile – was something of a tycoon. She told Hornigold she had been living in Singapore and had businesses – fruit farms and palm oil plantations – in Malaysia (where she was born) and Indonesia. She was on the phone the whole time, talking to people all over the world in multiple languages, and she had a taste for the high life. She suggested she come to London and checked into a five-star hotel, living on the finest champagne and caviar. There were two sources of her wealth, she told Hornigold: her business acumen, and being the illegitimate child of the former sultan of Brunei. It sounded implausible but he wondered if that was why, when they went to the Dorchester hotel, she was treated so well: he knew the Dorchester is owned by the royal family of Brunei.Hornigold says any parent wants to be able to provide some financial security for their children, but maintains he wasn’t thinking much about the money. “I’ve just had her come into my life, and all you care about at the time was to get to know her, so I could get to know me.”View image in fullscreenWith former partner Heather Kaniuk. His mother, Hornigold says, was ‘the catalyst’ for their breakup.Photograph: courtesy of NetflixStill, he wasn’t complaining when Dionne bought him a car, a new Range Rover, to make up for all the presents she hadn’t bought him over the years. Then she bought Kaniuk a car, a BMW, so she didn’t feel left out.In September 2020, Kaniuk gave birth to a baby boy. But then Dionne seemed to take a turn for the worse, texting Hornigold from her hotel a picture of the blood she had passed in the loo. Further juggling was required: he moved her into the family home in Kent, which caused tensions. Kaniuk says in the documentary that Dionne’s attitude changed after the birth: she started criticising Kaniuk, complaining she wasn’t getting time with her grandson. “That sense of ‘I’ve just become a mum’ was robbed from me, because there’s Dionne,” she says.A couple of months after the birth, Dionne and Hornigold began to discuss going to Switzerland to meet with a banker and a lawyer, and sign the documents that would enable Hornigold to inherit her considerable wealth. He would need a Swiss bank account, she said.In Zurich, her high living continued: an expensive hotel, restaurants, champagne, more champagne. There were meetings with a banker and a lawyer, but no documents were signed; apparently there were hold-ups in accessing the money, because of Covid. The days turned into weeks. Hornigold missed his new son, but at least he was spending his mother’s last days with her. They met people whose businesses Dionne agreed to invest in: a couple with a startup selling high-end products, a middle man looking for investment in a new cancer treatment. She would invest, she told them, but, again, she couldn’t access her funds right now. Could they help her out, and not tell Hornigold?She was very good at doing that: getting money from people to bankroll her extravagant lifestyle without others finding out. But the truth was becoming clear to Kaniuk and to Hornigold’s friend Juan, who happened to be living in Zurich. Kaniuk discovered Hornigold had moved money out of their joint account to give to his mother and had set up credit cards in his own name to pay the bills – £20,000 for the Zurich hotel, the same in London, more when they came back. It turned out this had started soon after they first met. It hit Kaniuk that Dionne had made it look as if she had paid for everything when in fact they had, because Hornigold thought the money would come back tenfold, or more.View image in fullscreen‘I’m a master at spotting BS now.’Photograph: Manuel Vazquez/The GuardianThe wedge Dionne was driving between them was banged in further. “She was trying to get me out of the picture,” Kaniuk says in the documentary. And the cars? She found out monthly payments for them were coming out of her and Hornigold’s joint account. In total, he had run up debts of around £300,000.Kaniuk had been trying to book for them to go to New Zealand to introduce their son to her family, but Dionne was trying to stop Hornigold going. Convinced his mum was about to die, he decided to stay. So Kaniuk and their son went without him. “I needed to see my family and be around people who loved me,” she says.The penny finally began to drop for Hornigold after Juan sat him down over a bottle of wine and told him he didn’t think Dionne was dying, that she was a scammer and he needed to snap out of the trance she had put him under. Around the same time, in a drawer in her hotel suite, Hornigold came across the red food dye she must have poured into the loo to look like blood.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Money, and greed, are behind most scams. Again, he says it wasn’t about the money. He admits to being blinded, but “blinded by the fact that my mum had come into my life and she was going to be leaving again”.People who are searching for love often fall for scams, and that Hornigold does admit to. “Yeah, absolutely. That was my downfall. If you don’t receive it when you’re a kid, you have this wound you carry around … Can you honestly tell me the bond between you and your mother you haven’t seen in 45 years and who is dying wouldn’t be stronger than anything else?” Hearing Hornigold’s account, it is hard to believe a mother would do that to her son. As Kaniuk says, “it goes against everything you think a mother should do – loving and protecting a child. She didn’t do any of that; she effectively destroyed her child’s life. With no remorse.”There are unanswered questions in the documentary. The farms and plantations – was any of that true? Dionne was certainly on the phone a lot; the banker and lawyer were real. She must have had some money, though had she scammed it from other people? “You can speculate,” Hornigold says, “but you just don’t know, do you?”Kaniuk did her own detective work: she spoke to a man in Indonesia who had paid Dionne $40,000 for a hajj pilgrimage to Mecca that never materialised. How many others had she scammed that way? Kaniuk found records of scams Dionne had committed in the UK: convictions for shoplifting and obtaining property by deception. “God, I wish I knew this before,” Hornigold says. “I can understand you’re this type of person, but to do it to your own son – that’s what I don’t understand.”Is there a possibility Dionne really is the illegitimate child of the former sultan of Brunei and Hornigold his grandson? “We’ll never know,” he says.When they first met, Dionne didn’t want to do a DNA test. “There’s no need,” she’d told him. “You either believe me or you don’t.” But then, after pressure from friends, Hornigold persuaded her: “Part of me didn’t want to be related,” he says.He knew the answer before the results came through. To be honest, watching the film, I knew the answer; you can see the likeness between their faces. Sure enough, it is 99.9% certain Dionne is his mother.View image in fullscreenIn new documentary Con Mum – a title Hornigold says is fair and accurate.Photograph: courtesy of NetflixCon Mum, indeed (a title Hornigold thinks is fair and accurate). But their relationship made the situation difficult legally: when Kaniuk went to the police, she was told Dionne’s activities wouldn’t be seen as fraud, because she is his mother. Hornigold has looked into it: “Essentially they call it a bad business decision, because you know where the money is going and who to.”A little over a year after smashing into Hornigold’s life like a wrecking ball, Dionne returned to Malaysia. There’s a moment in the film where she calls him on the phone: “I love you, son, I’m sorry for what happened.”“Really?” Hornigold says, sarcastically but, remarkably, without anger. “It was kind of life-changing, Mum.”“I’ve done what I’ve done, son. I cannot change, son.”“You take care, yeah? I need to go.”That call was a while ago. Hornigold, who has become more open as we’ve talked, now describes the year when his mother came back into his life as “frenzied, anxious, mind-bogglingly painful, in the sense that your brain hurt all the time. It was just darkness.” He felt suicidal. “One minute you’ve got everything; the next you’ve got nothing, and on the spin of a knife you’re deciding whether you’re going to stay alive or not. And if you don’t seek help, you’ll keep attracting this cycle.”Hornigold did seek help. “I’ve done the head work, sorted out the inner demons.” That’s the message he’d like to get across and partly why he did the documentary: mental health is real; get help and you can fix it.Is he more wary now? “I’d like to think I’m a bit more clued up. I was pretty good at spotting BS before, now I’m a master at it,” he laughs.Hornigold’s son is now on the other side of the world: Kaniuk never came back from New Zealand. He thinks if it hadn’t been for his mother, they would still be together: “She was the catalyst.”‘No one wants a Nazi in their family’: a German prisoner of war, a secret affair and the mystery of my dad’s parentageRead moreAlthough he misses his son desperately, being able to pull up a picture of him on his smartwatch has kept him going through dark moments. He recognises the parallels with his own childhood, growing up without a parent – “Yeah, it’s continuing the cycle” – but this is different. He describes his mother as “a bad person at her core”; his dad wasn’t great, either, whereas Hornigold is, he jokes, “an all-round good guy”. Is he, though, seriously? “I am, yeah,” he confirms, only half-joking now. He video chats with his son and plans to visit as soon as he can afford to. He is still heavily in debt, but has his business, and a home. “I won’t let it affect him, in the sense that he won’t see his dad. I’m going to be a big part of his life.”Hornigold doesn’t know where Dionne is now – Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia – and when Netflix approached her for comment, she didn’t respond. He hasn’t spoken to her for three years. I wonder if he thinks that, in spite of everything, she loves him? “No.” Is she capable of love? “No.” Does he have any love for her? “Apart from the fact that she brought me into the world, no.” He refers to her as Dionne rather than Mum now; “sometimes something else”, more explicit. It hurts, but Graham Hornigold has come to accept that he doesn’t have a mother.Con Mumis on Netflix from 25 March.Explore more on these topicsFamilyParents and parentingScamsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their answers were fascinating, funny – and could help us frame our days on EarthJames BaileySat 22 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 11.35 EDTShareIn September 2015, I was unemployed, heartbroken and living alone in my dead grandad’s caravan, wondering what the meaning of life was. Where was I going to find happiness, or purpose, or meaning? What was the point to all of this?Like any millennial, I turned to Google for the answers. I trawled through essays, newspaper articles, countless YouTube videos, various dictionary definitions and numerous references to thenumber 42, before I discovered an intriguing project carried out by the philosopher Will Durant during the 1930s. Durant had written to Ivy League presidents, Nobel prize winners, psychologists, novelists, professors, poets, scientists, artists and athletes to ask for their take on the meaning of life. His findings were collated in the bookOn the Meaning of Life, published in 1932.I decided that I should recreate Durant’s experiment and seek my own answers. I scoured websites searching for contact details, and spent hours carefully writing the letters, neatly sealing them inside envelopes and licking the stamps. Then I dropped them all into the postbox and waited ...Days, and then weeks, passed with no responses. I began to worry that I’d blown what little money I had on stamps and stationery. Surely, at least one person would respond?When someone finally did, it turned out to be a rejection. My heart continued to sink as I received a spate of letters returned to sender. Eventually, rather excitingly, replies started to drop through my letterbox.During the three months I spent living in the holiday park, walking the cliffs and trying to figure out my life, these responses greatly inspired me. Perhaps, as Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel alluded to in her answer, meaning had emerged through the practice of the quest.What follows is a small selection of the responses, from philosophers to politicians, prisoners to playwrights. Some were handwritten, some typed, some emailed. Some were scrawled on scrap paper, some on parchment. Some are pithy one-liners, some are lengthy memoirs. I sincerely hope you can take something from these letters, just as I did.My letterIn 1931, the philosopher Will Durant wrote to 100 luminaries in the arts, politics, religion and sciences, challenging them to respond not only to the fundamental question of life’s meaning but also to relate how they each found meaning, purpose and fulfilment in their own lives. I am currently replicating Durant’s study, and I’d be most appreciative if you could tell me what you think the meaning of life is, and how you find meaning, purpose and fulfilment in your own life?As Durant originally instructed, “Write briefly if you must; write at length and at leisure if you possibly can.”‘It’s like alchemy’: Hilary Mantel, late authorView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Hilary Mantel/ Robinson/ Little BrownI’ve had your letter for a fortnight, but I had to think about it a bit. You use two terms interchangeably: “meaning” and “purpose”. I don’t think they’re the same. I’m not sure life has a meaning, in the abstract. But it can have a definite purpose if you decide so – and the carrying through, the effort to realise the purpose, makes the meaning for you.It’s like alchemy. The alchemists were on a futile quest, we think. There wasn’t a philosopher’s stone, and they couldn’t make gold. But after many years of patience exercised, the alchemist saw he had developed tenacity, vision, patience, hope, precision – a range of subtle virtues. He had the spiritual gold, and he understood his life in the light of it. Meaning had emerged.‘It might be an idea to find meaning with something smaller, say a pickled walnut’: Michael Frayn, playwright and novelistView image in fullscreenThank you for inviting me to contribute to your anthology of views on the meaning of life. It’s not something I can respond to, I’m afraid, because it’s not clear to me how “life” can have a “meaning” in any ordinary sense of either word. It might be an idea to start with something smaller, say a pickled walnut. Once we’ve got it clear how a pickled walnut could have a “meaning”, we might move on to something larger – the borough of Haringey, say, or influenza – and work our way up.‘I’ve seen death many times. What matters most isn’t success, or wealth’: Kathryn Mannix, palliative care consultantView image in fullscreenEvery moment is precious – even the terrible moments. That’s what I’ve learned from spending 40 years caring for people with incurable illnesses, gleaning insights into what gives our lives meaning. Watching people living their dying has been an enormous privilege, especially as it’s shown me that it isn’t until we really grasp the truth of our own mortality that we awaken to the preciousness of being alive.Every life is a journey from innocence to wisdom. Fairy stories and folk myths, philosophers and poets all tell us this. Our innocence is chipped away, often gently but sometimes brutally, by what happens to us. Gradually, innocence is transformed to experience, and we begin to understand who we are, how the world is, and what matters most to us.The threat of having our very existence taken away by death brings a mighty focus to the idea of what matters most to us. I’ve seen it so many times, and even though it’s unique for everyone, there are some universal patterns. What matters most isn’t success, or wealth, or stuff. It’s connection and relationships and love. Reaching an understanding like this is the beginning of wisdom: a wisdom that recognises the pricelessness of this moment. Instead of yearning for the lost past, or leaning in to the unguaranteed future, we are most truly alive when we give our full attention to what is here, right now.Whatever is happening, experiencing it fully means both being present and being aware of being present. The only moment in our lives that we can ever have any choice about is this one. Even then, we cannot choose our circumstances, but we can choose how we respond: we can rejoice in the good things, relax into the delightful, be intrigued by the unexpected, and we can inhabit our own emotions, from joy to fear to sorrow, as part of our experience of being fully alive.I’ve observed that serenity is both precious and evanescent. It’s a state of flow that comes from relaxing into what is, without becoming distracted by what might follow. It’s a state of mind that rests in appreciation of what we have, rather than resisting it or disparaging it. The wisest people I have met have often been those who live the most simply, whose serenity radiates loving kindness to those around them, who have understood that all they have is this present moment.That’s what I’ve learned so far, but it’s still a work in progress. Because it turns out that every moment of our lives is still a work in progress, right to our final  breath.‘It means, above all, preserving the board on which we play this game’: Bill McKibben, author and environmentalistView image in fullscreenI’ve thought about this a good deal since you wrote.I think the meaning of life is to keep the remarkable game of being human going forward. In the past, this meant reproducing, above all. But, now, it means, above all, preserving the board on which we play this game. And since we’re now setting that board on fire, it’s our job to put that fire out. In our time, that’s the most important task we can undertake, since all depends on it. The best thing about the human game is that it, potentially, can stretch far out into the future – but only if we act now.‘Reading is my cubicle and my treehouse’: Gretchen Rubin, author and happiness expertView image in fullscreenIn my study of happiness and human nature, and in my own experiences, I have found that the meaning of life comes through love. In the end, it is love – all kinds of love – that makes meaning.In my own life, I find meaning, purpose and fulfilment by connecting to other people – my family, my friends, my community, the world. In some cases, I make these connections face-to-face, and in others, I do it through reading. Reading is my cubicle and my treehouse; reading allows me better to understand both myself and other people.‘The secret of life is a very simple thing’: Matt Ridley, science writerView image in fullscreenThere never has been and never will be a scientific discovery as surprising, unexpected and significant as that which happened on 28 February 1953 in Cambridge, when James Watson and Francis Crick found the double-helix structure of DNA and realised that the secret of life is actually a very simple thing: it’s infinite possibilities of information spelled out in a four-letter alphabet in a form that copies itself.‘The first awareness, in Bergen-Belsen, was that kindness and goodwill had survived’: Susan Pollack, Holocaust survivorView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Susan Pollack/ Robinson/ Little BrownIn response to your letter, here are a few thoughts that assisted me to look forward in my youth after those bleak, horrendous times in 1944. I am a camp survivor from Auschwitz and was liberated from Bergen-Belsen on 15 April 1945. I was totally dehumanised, fearful, distrustful, lost to contemplate the future, all alone, unable to comprehend the values for a life in a modern civilisation.Fourteen years old – unable to walk, to express the latent, suppressed anguish – the realisation I only speak Hungarian, no skills, no education, no finance, no support system, no knowledge.The first awareness, in Bergen-Belsen, was the discovery that kindness and goodwill had also survived. When the British soldier lifted me up from the mud hole – seeing a twitch in my body – he gently placed me in one of the small ambulances. From that experience, miraculous goodwill is one of the guiding lights to this day. I often think of that moment and ask, “What part of that goodness with your heart do you take from that soldier?”Kindness, generosity comes in small everyday events. Small measures of goodness have an enormous impact – to this day I take nothing for granted. I remember the effect and appreciation this first helpfulness had on my life – it gradually removed the heavy iron cover on me, and sparks of “I can do” and “I want to do” gradually came into my existence.In Sweden, where I was taken for recuperation for my devastated physical corpse-like being, one of the facilitators had a large collection of classical records. These he played every evening, and we sat around and listened in awe to Beethoven symphonies and other pieces. In my interpretation, I could feel the energy of the music, from sorrow and despair to the drive of supreme human effort to rise above those destructive memories. I must say not completely – personally, I don’t want to let it go completely – but I am free of the chains which deprived me in the camps. Music, generally, has an enormous effect on my life.I moved on. I became a Samaritan helper for some eight years. I took a degree at the age of 60 and then a diploma in psychology. For me, life is full of possibilities, like a search engine – find your meaning for existence that makes me feel worthy – self-esteem is the reward.I was fortunate in having a family and could play with my grandchildren, reclaiming those years of persecution.I remember the doctor in Sweden who took me in his arms to teach me walking, and turned to me saying: “I have a little girl like you.” What a discovery about myself – powerful words that still ring in my ears long after 70 years – I cherish kind words. These are the propelling force to continue our journey and many more small events that had a huge impact on my life.‘I could not be happy if the only things that motivated me were purely mercenary’: John Major, former prime ministerView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: The Rt Hon Sir John Major/ Robinson/ Little BrownIt is not easy to respond to this, except perhaps in the negative: life would have no meaning without family and friends, nor without an incentive for getting out of bed each morning. I could not be happy if I were idle, nor if the only things that motivated me were purely mercenary, with no personal interest or connection. We all need a purpose – large or small – and that, to me, is what gives life its meaning.‘I want to show up fully, or as fully as possible, for my time on Earth’: Oliver Burkeman, author and journalistView image in fullscreenI agree with the scholar of mythology Joseph Campbell, that it makes more sense to say that what we’re seeking isn’t a meaning for life, so much as the experience of feeling fully alive. There are experiences that I know, in my bones, are “why I’m here” – unhurried time with my son, or deep conversations with my wife, hikes in the North York Moors, writing and communicating with people who’ve found liberation in something I have written. I would struggle, though, if I were to try to argue that any of these will “mean something” in some kind of timeless way, for example, 500 years from now.What’s changed for me is that I no longer feel these experiences need this particular kind of justification. I want to show up fully, or as fully as possible, for my time on Earth. That’s all – but, then again, I think that is everything. And so I try, on a daily basis, to navigate more and more by that feeling of aliveness – rather than by the feeling of wanting to be in control of things, which is alluring, but deadening in the end.‘The meaningless cruelty of my niece’s death taught me about life’s purpose’: Monica Heisey, author, essayist and screenwriterView image in fullscreenYours is a big question, certainly, and one I have been thinking about a lot this year. Last spring, my niece Rosemary was born, squirming and healthy and pink, with my sister’s big blue eyes and my brother-in-law’s button nose. Nine days later, she died in her sleep. On the phone with my sobbing mother, I realised my sense of life’s meaning had been undefined, or at least had never been tested. I’d been chugging along, untouched by capital-T tragedy, oblivion feeling blissfully abstract.Confronted for the first time with the Real Deal, I searched for meaning, and found none. There had been no warning, would turn out to be no cause, and of course it had not happened “for a reason”. Something terrible had occurred from nowhere, and now our lives were changed for ever, and Rosie would not get to have one. I felt nihilism like a riptide, swirling around me and tugging at my ankles. It would have been easy to go under.But the days and weeks after the meaningless cruelty of Rosie’s death also taught me about life’s purpose, or at least showed me a way I might define it. I had anticipated a week of quiet mourning punctuated by a kind of depressed chaos as everyone scrambled to arrange a funeral and perform grim and foreign administrative tasks. I assumed tragedy on this scale would feel lonely. But my memories from that period are densely populated: old friends rallying, travelling long distances to hold my sister and her husband and look at pictures and remember a person they would never get to know; my long-divorced parents coming together to provide a soft place to land for their three long-grown children; distant relatives with stories we’d never heard about cousins we’d also never be able to meet; a cluster of colleagues surrounding my sister, huddling like a football team about to break for a challenging second half; the unlikely presence of my divorce lawyer with a box of homemade scones and clotted cream.Instead of numb or adrift, I felt almost painfully alive. We were surrounded, I realised, by Rosie’s community, who were, of course, ours too. There were faces I hadn’t seen in years – due to life and geography and the pandemic – and I saw then that they had not been gone, not really. We hadn’t “lost touch”, we had just been busy, all of us, with work and children and the business of living, but now they were needed, and so here they were. Increasingly, I think this is the only purpose we have: to be in connection with each other, to batten down our collective hatches against life’s many and various brutalities. To me, everything else that feels like purpose – making and consuming art, engaging in collective efforts to better society or the planet, listening deeply to loved ones – is really an avenue to connection, providing it and being enriched by it, too.In terms of happiness, many people more intelligent than I have suggested shooting for contentment instead, and I think they are right. Still, there are some things that make me reliably happy, and I have found much contentment in cultivating opportunities to experience them. These include: friends’ laughter, reading at the bar, unrealistically flattering denim, good gossip, morning sex, coffee and a walk with a slight hangover, a sunny day experienced from a safely shaded area, cornbread, cats, the exhilaration of being bad at something new, boxing (relatedly), and making a sauce for three to five hours. There are more, of course – the list grows all the time – and keeping track of them feels important.I suppose happiness is knowing what is personally meaningful to you, and engaging with it, which is kind of a nice full circle to come to in this letter. A natural conclusion that returns to the beginning makes me happy, too. Another for the list.‘Four and a half decades of my life have been in a hole, but I’ve still enjoyed it’: Charles Salvador, aka Charles Bronson, one of Britain’s longest-serving prisonersView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLetter from Charles Bronson, for Saturday magazine - Meaning of Life, Mar 22Photograph: Charles Bronson/ Robinson/ Little BrownLife is, to me, a gift.You have to respect it.Appreciate it.Hold on to it for as long as possible.People who let go don’t deserve it.Four and a half decades of my life have been in a hole, But I’ve still enjoyed it.I made it work for me.Coz I found “myself”.[Overleaf] Never piss on a rattlesnake!‘Failure is fine. It’s how you respond to it that makes all the difference’: Fatima Whitbread, retired British javelin throwerView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Fatima Whitbread/ Robinson/ Little BrownIf you add value to other people’s lives, you’ll never be at a loss for living a life of purpose. The purpose is what ultimately leads to happiness. Society emphasises success a great deal, and some people overreact to it by being overly harsh on themselves, on their perceptions of what success is. Rather, ask yourself, how can I add value today? And then do it.My learning is that you’re going to fail. If you do anything at all in life that is noteworthy. On the other hand, if you play it safe you might not fail. But then you probably didn’t reach your fullest potential, either. Failure is fine. It’s how you respond to it that makes all the difference in the world.Don’t blame anyone for the failure, least of all yourself. Simply acknowledge what has happened, note what you’ve learned and how you’d do it differently next time, and move on. Make no excuses. They are simply a waste of everybody’s time. Worst comes to worst, you’ve learned something new that makes you a more multi-dimensional person, an interesting person. After all, it’s not failing that matters, but learning from our failures.And if you don’t try, how can you possibly fail in the first place?‘I asked my mother what she thought it was, from her now frail vantage point’: Anil Seth, professor of cognitive and computational neuroscienceView image in fullscreenIt feels strange to be writing to you about the meaning of life while my mother is struggling to hold on to hers. At the age of 89 she’s had a long life by the standards of human history, but any human life is the briefest glimmer in the vastness of time. The inconceivable brevity of human existence brings questions about meaning, purpose and fulfilment into sharp relief.My mother was born in York in 1934, on Christmas Day, and grew up playing in the ruins of bombed-out buildings. She was a teacher, and later an artist and a landscape photographer. Lately, before her recent illness, she would wonder to me at the prospect of nonexistence. She knows she will die, as most of us do at some level, but she cannot imagine not existing. As the horizons of her life have contracted, she has been able to find contentment in simpler and simpler things: the rhythms of the garden, the play of light on the leaves of a tree. This flexibility suggests to me that meaning, purpose and fulfilment are not only different things, but moving targets, if they are targets at all.I’ve spent my career trying to understand more about the mystery of consciousness. About how the mess of neural wetware inside our heads can give rise to the everyday miracle of experience. Consciousness is intimately familiar to each of us. We all know what it’s like to be conscious, and what it’s like to lose consciousness when we fall into a dreamless sleep. The nature of consciousness is also endlessly perplexing, confounding scientists and thinkers for thousands of years.Some people worry that pursuing a scientific perspective on conscious experience might drain life of meaning by reducing us to mere biological machinery. I have found the opposite to be the case. There is no reduction. There is rather a continuity with the natural world, and with this continuity comes an expansion, a wider and deeper perspective. As we gradually pull back the curtains on the biological basis of conscious experience in all its richness, there are new opportunities to take ourselves and our conscious lives less for granted. We can see ourselves more as part of, and less apart from, the rest of nature. Our brief moments in the light of existence become more remarkable for having happened at all.A recognition of the precarity of consciousness can help defuse some of our existential fears. We do not usually worry much about the oblivion that preceded our birth, so why should we worry about the equivalent oblivion that will follow our death? Oblivion isn’t the experience of absence, it is the absence of experience. As the novelist Julian Barnes put it, in his meditation on mortality, there is “nothing to be frightened of”.I’ve come to think of consciousness as the precondition for meaning. An argument can be made that without consciousness, nothing would matter at all. Meaning, purpose and fulfilment can take many forms against this backdrop. The Aristotelian concept of eudaimonia best captures what I have in mind here. Eudaimonia means living well, flourishing, doing that which is worth doing. It is not about pleasure or hedonic satisfaction, nor is it about selfless sacrifice for some greater good. It involves realising one’s potential through cultivating virtues such as reason, courage and wisdom. Fundamentally, it comes down to doing a bit of good and feeling good about doing so.For me, participating in some small way in the scientific and philosophical journey to understand ourselves and our place in nature, and communicating some of this journey to others, offers the promise of a slice of eudaimonia. In practice, frustration lurks at every turn. There is the risk of hubris when dealing with such apparently grand matters. And the dramas of everyday life get in the way.Which brings me back to my mother. Today she has rallied, unexpectedly confounding the prognosis of the doctors. I asked her what she thought the meaning of life was, from her now frail vantage point. She told me it was about relationships with other people, and who can argue with that.‘My brief answer: what the hell?’: Alan Ayckbourn, playwright and directorView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Ayckbourn/ Robinson/ Little BrownSixty years ago, with a burgeoning career, on the verge of being a professional playwright and director, I would probably have readily answered your question. I felt, as they say, that the world was at my feet. These days, alas, I sense very much it is on my back. I have no idea why I write, nor indeed why I’m still alive. Probably the writing is as much a reflex for me as breathing. That’s all I can say.Sorry, but you caught me at the wrong end of my existence. My brief answer: what the hell?‘I do not need to know it’: Charles Duhigg, author of The Power of HabitView image in fullscreenWhat is the meaning of life? I can honestly say: I have no idea. But I write this in London, where I am visiting with my wife and two boys. And they are healthy and safe, and (mostly) happy, and there’s joy in watching their delights: a clothing stall with a jacket they’ve long wanted; the way the double-decker bus carries us above the fray; a monument to scientific discoveries beside a flower garden and goats.I’m surrounded by evidence – of the blitz, D-day, colonies despoiled, JFK and MLK and 9/11 – that all could be otherwise. I hear about bombs falling on innocents, an uncertain election, a faltering climate, and many of us lacking the will (or charity) to change.Yet still I marvel that we flew here in under 12 hours – while my ancestors required months and tragedies to transit in reverse – and that I will send this note simply by hitting a button, and we can love whomever we want, and see and speak to them at any hour, and a pandemic did not end my life, did not kill my children’s dreams, did not make society selfish and cruel.And, for now, that’s enough. I do not need to know the meaning of life. I do not need to know the purpose of it all. Simply breathing while healthy and safe, and (mostly) happy is such a surprising, awe-inducing, humbling gift that I have no right to question it. I won’t tempt fate. I won’t look that gift horse in the mouth. I’ll simply hope my good fortune continues, work hard to share it with others, and pray I will remember this day, this moment, if my luck fades .This is an edited extract from The Meaning of Life: Letters from Extraordinary People and their Answer to Life’s Biggest Question, edited by James Bailey and published by Robinson on 3 April.

Two nights before we set off I leave a rehearsal room at 10pm, exhausted after a seven-hour practice. It occurs to me, not for the first time, that I am too old for this shit.On the morning of the first gig, my wife and I have a row: she appears to be unaware that I am taking the car for the weekend.“You said you were getting a lift,” she says.“That’s next weekend,” I say.“You never said you were taking the car,” she says.“I’m sorry, but I’m sure I did,” I say, no longer entirely sure.“You’re completely screwing me over,” she says. I think: man, she really is angry.“This is a genuine misunderstanding,” I say.My wife turns and walks away. I’m already running late, so I just go.I get lost on arrival, because the venue and the venue’s backstage loading bay are two very different addresses, and my satnav has taken me to neither. Instead I find myself in a car park behind an auction house, my path blocked by a large container.I’m preoccupied by my wife’s refusal to speak. Holding a grudge isn’t her thing (it’s more mine) and I start to worry“That doesn’t sound good,” says the drummer when I call him. “How far are you from the high street?”“I don’t know,” I say. “It’s my first time in Bury St Edmunds.”By the time I get to the venue and unload, the rest of the band are set up and ready to go. I still have to find somewhere to park, and my way back on foot. For more than one reason, I’m beginning to wish I hadn’t driven.Between the sound check and the gig I call my wife. She does not pick up. At 7.30pm we take to the stage. Three hours later we are in a Travelodge room drinking white wine from coffee mugs and critiquing the set, number by number.“By my reckoning that riff appears in the song 13 times,” I say. “Tonight I played it correctly on nine occasions.”“Not bad,” says the fiddle player.“A personal best,” I say.“There were lots of first-night mistakes,” says the piano player. “The audience didn’t seem to notice.”“That’s even more worrying,” I say. “They think it’s supposed to sound like that.”The next day, on the way to Milton Keynes, I ring my wife. She does not pick up. I call her again when I get there – still no answer.That night I make far fewer mistakes, possibly because I’m so preoccupied by my wife’s refusal to speak. Holding a grudge isn’t really her thing (it’s more mine) and I start to worry that her silence is a cause for alarm. Either way, I’m amazed by its efficacy as a punishment.The next morning I ring my wife before leaving for Grantham; again it goes straight to voicemail. I send a text that says, “I get that you’re not speaking to me,” realising too late that the obvious reply is no reply.I cannot find the loading area of the Grantham venue, and once again the drummer has to talk me in.“You made it,” he says when I arrive. “Well done.” His drums are already set up.

Now only anxieties about confidence and their age gap hold them backHow do you do it? Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told to Olivia LadanyiSat 22 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTShareGlenn, 49Sex used to feel like an obligation, now it feels like a team activity in pursuit of pleasureJosephine is only the second person I’ve had sex with. The first was my ex-wife of 25 years, the last seven of which were sexless. Josephine and I met as colleagues, but we became very close friends and, over the years, I confided in her about my unhappy marriage. When I was getting divorced, I confessed to Josephine that I was nervous about being intimate with another woman. That’s when she suggested she and I have sex. Our first night together, I was scared to be naked in front of someone after such a long time. But I was even more worried that, if it didn’t work out, I’d lose my best friend. It felt like jumping off a cliff.Sex with Josephine is completely different to the sex I’d had with my wife. She’s confident in herself and assures me that I’m good enough – and that my penis isn’t too small, which is another thing I worried about.She reminds me that sex is fun, it isn’t a performance I’m being graded on or a test I could fail. Sex used to feel like an obligation or transaction, now it feels like a team activity in pursuit of pleasure.With her encouragement, I’m learning to take charge, but I find it a bit uncomfortable – it’s not something that comes naturallyThere is a 12-year age gap between us, which is only really challenging in a practical sense because we’re at different stages of our lives. Josephine says that I could be with someone much younger, but I love her. When our friends comment on the age gap, calling her a cougar, I know they are joking, but it makes Josephine feel insecure, so I often have to reassure her that I’m attracted to her.I suppose we both get a little nervous sometimes, but we know how to comfort each other. I take anxiety medication, and one side-effect is that I struggle to orgasm. I used to hear “Are you finished yet?” but with Josephine, it means we spend more time being intimate. We don’t have to have a goal. Josephine mostly takes the lead. With her encouragement, I’m learning to take charge, but it’s not something that comes naturally. It took me a long time to believe that Josephine enjoys having sex with me, but she’s convinced me that she really does get pleasure from my pleasure.Share your experienceShare your experiencesIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

It felt as if I’d been hit by a bolt of lightning. But I brushed it off, knowing he was married and nothing could happen. When he eventually left his wife – a year after he told me he was thinking of divorcing her – his five-year plan involved getting laid. So I suggested that on the day of his divorce, we go on a date and spend the night together.He jumped the gun and made a move before his divorce went through. Because it was unexpected, I didn’t have lubricant and knew it would hurt without it, so there was no penetration. I’ve found intercourse a bit uncomfortable since menopause, and I now take oestrogen, which helps, but I still prefer oral. On a successful night, we’ll both orgasm, but we’ve learned that orgasm is just the dessert, and it doesn’t mean you don’t enjoy the rest of the meal without it.Sometimes, I worry about Glenn leaving. Although I look good for a woman in her 60s, I could wake up one day and look my ageThis is how we do it: ‘I’d distract myself to avoid climaxing – until the time I said out loud, “I need to take the bins out”’Read moreTo be good at anything, including sex, you need positive feedback, so I encourage Glenn by telling him when he’s done a good job, which has helped with his performance anxiety. I’d also been celibate for six years before the first time we had sex.Sometimes, I worry about Glenn leaving. Although I look good for a woman in her 60s, I could wake up one day and look my age. He could be with someone in their 30s. How can I compete with that? But he makes me feel adored. When I express my fears, and point out women in our running club who are faster than me, younger than me, he says, “Well they’re not as good a biochemist as you.”I wish our age gap weren’t so big. Glenn tells me it doesn’t bother him, but I just feel old in comparison. Mostly, I feel sad I wasted all those years not spent with my true love. But then when we think about it, the age difference makes it impossible. When I was 30, he was 18. We talk about fantasy worlds where we’re the same age and about our future – when Glenn retires, we’ll move to Scotland and live in a cottage away from everyone. I’ve never been able to picture that far ahead with anyone before.Explore more on these topicsSexThis is how we do itRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His speech quickly faded from the fast and furious news cycle. But future historians may regard it as a milestone on a road leading the world’s oldest continuousdemocracy to a once unthinkable destination.Eviscerating the federal government and subjugating Congress; defying court orders and delegitimising judges; deporting immigrants and arresting protesters without due process; chilling free speech at universities and cultural institutions; cowing news outlets with divide-and-rule. Add a rightwing media ecosystem manufacturing consent and obeyance in advance, along with a weak and divided opposition offering feeble resistance. Join all the dots, critics say, and America issleepwalking into authoritarianism.“These are flashing red lights here,”Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director turned Trump critic. “We are approaching Defcon 1 for our democracy and a lot of people in the media and the opposition leadership don’t seem to be communicating that to the American people. That is the biggest danger of the moment we’re in now: the normalisation of it.”Much was said and written by journalists and Democrats during last year’s election campaign arguing that Trump, who instigated a coup against the US government on 6 January 2021, could endanger America’s 240-year experiment with democracy if he returned to power. In a TV interview, he had promised to be “dictator” but only on “day one”. Sixty days in, the only question is whether the warnings went far enough.The 45th and 47th president has wasted no time in launching a concerted effort to consolidate executive power, undermine checks and balances and challenge established legal and institutional norms. And he is making no secret of his strongman ambitions.Trump, 78, has declared “We are the federal law” and posted a social media image of himself wearing a crown with the words “Long live the king”. He alsochanneled Napoleonwith the words: “He who saves his country does not violate any law.” And JD Vance has stated that “judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power”.Trumpquickly pardonedthose who attacked the US Capitol on January 6, placed loyalists in key positions within the FBI and military and purged the justice department, which also suffered resignations in response to the dismissal of corruption charges against the New York mayor Eric Adams after his cooperation on hardline immigration measures.View image in fullscreenThe president now has the courts in his sights. Last weekend, the White House defied a judge’s verbal order blocking it from invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law meant only to be used in wartime, to justify the deportation of 250 Venezuelan alleged gang members to El Salvador, where they will be held in a 40,000-person megaprison.Trump accused James Boasberg, the chief district judge in Washington who made the ruling, of being “crooked”, said he should be “impeached” and labelled him a “radical left lunatic of a judge”. The outburst prompted John Roberts, the chief justice of thesupreme court, to deliver a rare rebuke of the president, emphasing that “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision”.In an interview on the conservative Fox News network, Trump denied defying a court order and said he would not do so in future. But he added ominously: “We have very bad judges and these are judges that shouldn’t be allowed. I think at a certain point, you have to start looking at what do you do when you have a rogue judge?”David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W Bush,posted on the X social media platform: “Almost every major Trump action is intentionally illegal. Trump is gambling that the US democratic system is too broken to stop him. He assumes, to borrow a phrase: ‘All we’ve got to do is kick the door in and the whole edifice will come crumbling down.’ Testing hour is here.”The White House has yet to release the names of the deported Venezuelans or proof that they were indeed criminal gang members. In another recent incident, it sent 40 undocumented immigrants to the notorious detention facility at the Guantánamo Bay naval base, only for a judge to intervene and force their return to the mainland.Some commentators suggest that theTrump administrationis exploiting the power of sadistic spectacle. They say it is priming the public for future crackdowns and testing its level of tolerance for a moment when, for example, it might invoke the Insurrection Act to target anti-Trump protesters.Steve Schmidt, a political strategist and former campaign operative for George W Bush and John McCain, said: “Donald Trump is producing a Washington television show from the Oval Office that’s authoritarian in nature. You go on TikTok and see the deportations scored to songs and videos released by the administration. It’s a theatre of the absurd. It’s a theatre of malice. All of it is desensitising people to the use of authority and power.”Violations of civil liberties are piling up on an almost daily basis. They include incidents that, if they had happened anywhere else in the world before 2025, the US would have been among the first to condemn.Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian entrepreneur and actor in the American Pie movie franchise, was detained for almost two weeks in “inhumane” conditions by US border authorities over an incomplete visa.She wrote in the Guardian: “I was taken to a tiny, freezing cement cell with bright fluorescent lights and a toilet. There were five other women lying on their mats with the aluminum sheets wrapped over them, looking like dead bodies. The guard locked the door behind me.”Fabian Schmidt, a German national who is a permanent US resident, was detained and, his mother said, “violently interrogated”, stripped naked and put in a cold shower by US border officials. A French scientistwas denied entry to the US after immigration officers at an airport searched his phone and found messages in which he had expressed criticism of theTrump administration, according to the French government.Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist who previously worked and lived in Rhode Island,was deporteddespite having a US visa. Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral scholar at Georgetown University and citizen of India married to a Palestinian, was detained by immigration agents who told him his visa had been revoked.Columbia University student activistMahmoud Khalil, a legal US resident with no criminal record, was detained over his participation in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and is fighting deportation efforts in federal court. Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator, reacted on social media: “In dictatorships, they call this practice ‘being disappeared’. No charges, no claims of criminal behaviour. The White House doesn’t claim he did anything criminal. He’s in jail because of his political speech.”Another trigger for alarm is Trump’s close relationship with tech oligarchs, many of whom donated to and attended his inauguration. Tesla and SpaceX head Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) has beentaking a chainsawto the federal bureaucracy, firing thousands of workers in indiscriminate ways that have been challenged in court.Musk’s X regularly parrots pro-Trump propaganda. Jeff Bezos, owner of Amazon and the Washington Post, recently ordered that the newspaper narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. Several star reporters and columnistshave quit in recent months.Trump has escalated attacks on media outlets whose coverage he dislikes, including barring them from workspaces and events. He has filed lawsuits against media outlets and falsely claimed the flagship series 60 Minutes admitted guilt regarding a lawsuit.His appointee to head the Federal Communications Commission is investigating PBS (Public Broadcasting Service) and NPR (National Public Radio). Last weekend, the Trump administration put almost the entire staff ofVoice of America– which began broadcasting in 1942 to combat Nazi propaganda – on leave and ended grants to Radio Free Asia and other media with similar news programming.Trump’s moves in the foreign policy arena hold up a mirror to his domestic vision. He has rattled longtime allies in Europe over whether the US remains committed to Nato and has sided with Russia in talks to end the war in Ukraine. He even called the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a “dictator” andberated him in the Oval Office.View image in fullscreenTrump has long shown an affinity for autocrats such as Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping of China and Kim Jong-un of North Korea and his actions have been compared with those ofViktor Orbán in consolidating power in Hungary, including remaking the judiciary, gaming elections and cracking down on media and civic organisations.At the Center for American Progress thinktank in Washington this week, JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois,told the Guardian: “If you haven’t already read about Orbán in Hungary, go read about what he did steadily, not that slowly, to put the noose around that country. Donald Trump admires Orbán and I believe he and his team have learned from that and are replicating that.”What some find most frightening of all is the relative lack of resistance so far. Trump’s approval rating equals his best-ever mark as president at 47%, according to arecent NBC News poll, although a majority – 51% - disapproves of his performance. Some 55% of voters approve of his handling of border security and immigration, while 43% disapprove.Setmayer, who now headsthe Seneca Project, a women-led super political action committee, commented: “The fact that Donald Trump’s approval rating is still in the mid-40s should scare the hell out of every American who understands the value of our constitutional republic, the freedoms that we enjoy and the rule of law, because what he is doing is categorically against everything this country was founded on.”This is reflected in Congress, where the Republican party is more loyal to and unquestioning of Trump than ever.Few members have daredto speak out against the president’s support for Putin, haphazard tariff policy or bullying of neighbour Canada. They know that dissent would likely result in public humiliation on social media and a primary election challenge funded by Musk.Democrats, for their part, are still struggling to meet the moment as swelling protests across the country hunger for leadership. Last week, Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the Senate, reversed his positionby voting to passa Republican budget plan that will make cuts to housing, transportation and education while also empowering Trump and Musk to slash more programmes.Faced with the prospect of a government shutdown, Schumer argued that he was choosing the lesser of two evils but ignited a furious backlash from Democrats in the House of Representatives and grassroots activists. NBC’s poll found that just 27% of voters say they have positive views of the party, its lowest rating since the question was first asked in 1990.Meagan Hatcher-Mays, a senior adviser forUnited for Democracy, a coalition of 140 organisations aimed at reforming the courts, said Democrats were wrongfooted by Trump’s narrow victory in the national popular vote last year.“They took the wrong lesson from the outcome of that election and they think Donald Trump is a lot more popular than he actually is,” she said. “Their baseline is already to be scared but that made them more scared to push back or resist against some of Donald Trump’s worst impulses. What you have now is they’re more comfortable caving and that’s what they have been doing.“They have not been able to mount a durable opposition to Donald Trump or to congressional Republicans.You can’t just be not Donald Trump. You have to be for something and you have to paint a vision for what you want for the American people. Instead what they’ve decided to do is just say nothing and hope for the best and that is not going to win them any seats in 2026.”The courts are potentially the last line of defence. Federal judges have blocked dozens of Trump’s initiatives, including attempts to eliminate agencies, end birthright citizenship and freeze federal funding. This week, a judge found that Doge likely violated the constitution “in multiple ways” with its dismantling of the development agency USAID.Jamie Raskin, a Democratic representative from Maryland, noted that Democrats and their allies have filed more than 125 cases against various attacks on the rule of law and obtained more than 40 temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions.“We’re in the fight of our lives,” he told the Guardian. “This is not a two-week, two-month or even two-year fight that we’re in. This is going to take us many years to defeat the forces of authoritarian reaction, and the Democrats are rising to the occasion.“If you look at the way democratic societies responded to fascism a century ago, it just takes time for people to realign and refocus and mobilise a concerted and unified response. Are we there yet? No. But are we going to be in a place where we can stand together and defeat authoritarianism in our country? Yes, we are going to get there.”Norm Eisen, a lawyer and founder of State Democracy Defenders Action, has brought successful cases that stopped Trump targeting thousands of FBI employees and blocked Musk’s access to sensitive data at the treasury department. He said: “Donald Trump is definitely pushing towards authoritarianism. He promised to be a dictator on day one and he hasn’t stopped. That’s the bad news.“The good news is that he has met vigorous pushback from litigants like myself and many others and from courts at every level. So far, his most outrageous illegal conduct has been countered.”If the Trump administration ignores such orders, the US could face a full-blown constitutional crisis. But Eisen retains measured optimism, saying: “It’s a mistake to count us out. We have so surprised ourselves and the world over and over again in our history and there is cause for hope here when you see the furious legal pushback by lawyers.“There is reason for hope but nobody knows. Will we go the way of Brazil, Poland, Czech Republic, where I was ambassador, all of which pushed out autocratic regimes in recent years? Or will we go the way of Hungary and Turkey, which failed to oust autocrats? It remains to be seen but I, at least, am hopeful.”"

[That’s what] they want woman to think – that is a lie.”Many of her claims, including that abortion leads tobreast cancer, have been thoroughly disproved by scientific studies. Other claims, such as that abortion causeslifelong mental health problemsand infertility also have been shown to be untrue when access to abortion is safe and legal. Studies show that abortion denialincreases the riskofboth.The backlash is a pre-emptive strike in case feminists win, it’s a deliberate organised effort because we were so closeMarta Lempart, Polish pro-choice activistMountenay, from the Christian, anti-abortion Endeavour Forum, is one of many speakers, mostly women, to address the Conference on the State ofWomenand Family (CSWF) in New York. Over two days they speak repeatedly of love and respect for women, yet decry global efforts to empower women and expand their rights. They reiterate their stance against abortion in any circumstances, including gang-rape, and hail motherhood as the ultimate role for women.Sponsored by four leading US, rightwing organisations, including the Heritage Foundation –architect of Project 2025– andC-Fam– designated a hate group by the TheSouthern Poverty Law Center– CSWF is an opportunity for conservative heavyweights and anti-abortion campaigners to reassert their opposition to “gender ideology” and air their grievances about the perceived attack on conservative values. LGBTQ rights, thepandemic treaty, comprehensive sex education and “leftish insanity” on US college campuses are held up as examples of corrupting secular ideologies.View image in fullscreenPresident Donald Trump signs a ‘No Men in Women’s Sports’ executive order, February 2025.Photograph: Abe McNatt/White HouseTrump’s blizzard of executive orders, including the assertion that “there are only two genders”, felt like “Christmas multiple days in a row,” says Jay W Richards, director of the Richard and Helen DeVos Centre for Life, and a fellow atthe Heritage Foundation. “Suddenly it’s a new day – that’s the good news; the bad news is the fight is not over.”Anti-rights actors are nothing new. But the ferociousness of the attack on – and scale of the current backlash against – women’s rights is sending a chill through rights defenders, giving an urgency to calls for a united response.A minute’s walk from the CSWF gathering, the 69th Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is taking place at the same time at the UN’s headquarters. This annual meeting aims to address the widespread inequalities, violence and discrimination women continue to face around the world.UN secretary general António Guterres opens the conference with ared alert: “The poison of patriarchy is back – and it is back with a vengeance: slamming the brakes on action; tearing up progress; and mutating into new and dangerous forms.”His warning that hard-won gains are being thrown into reverse follows aUN reportrevealing that one in four countries reported a backlash on gender equality in 2024. Based on a review of progress by 159 member states, the report attributes the rollback to crises including a weakening of democratic institutions, Covid, climate breakdown and conflict. But it notes the key role of anti-rights actors who “are actively undermining longstanding consensus on key women’s rights issues. Where they cannot roll back legal and policy gains altogether, they seek to block or slow their implementation.”View image in fullscreenAt the UN conference a political declaration reaffirms a commitment to respect, protect, and champion the rights, equality, and empowerment of women and girls – but has a glaring omission.Photograph: Ryan Brown/UN WomenEarlier this month, Oxfam published its ownassessmentof the damage being wreaked by anti-rights groups: “A range of rightwing, religious, and conservative actors around the world are capitalising on persistent crises, to reorient state power towards a reassertion of racist and sexist profit-driven systems that favours the wealthy, privileges men, and harms and disadvantages women and LGBTQIA+ people in the name of ‘traditional’ family values.”I wasn’t scared, and then it hit me that this movement is more daring, bolder and is doing anything they can do to convey their messageNelly Munyasia, Reproductive Health Network KenyaMany of the events taking place at UN event address the threat posed by anti-rights groups. In a session called Feminism for the Win: Strategies to Defy and Defeat Anti-feminist Movements, panellists speak of the rise of “chainsaw masculinity” and “rapid authoritarian transformation”. Marta Lempart, the activist who led Poland’s pro-choice women’s strikes, notes grimly “the alpha male is back in town,” adding: “The backlash is a pre-emptive strike in case feminists win, it’s a deliberate organised effort because we were so close.”The anti-rights movement is also present at the UN. In one Q&A Liana Gordon, a youth delegate from the Canadian anti-abortion organisation Campaign Life Coalition, asks the panel: “You talk of women’s rights but what about the rights of the unborn child?”The question infuriates Lempart. “Whenever someone says ‘women’s rightsbut… or human rightsbut…’ it’s bullshit … I hate these guys and I’m saying that out loud. You have to fight, insult them, do all the things you should’t be doing. You have to speak how you feel.” It is a response that delights Gordon who later relays it to herfellow anti-abortion activists. “Last year I did not see this type of emotional response at least not at this level. It confirmed to me that we are winning,” says Gordon. “I have a message for Marta: you may hate me but we love you.”Challenging participants and taking up oxygen in discussions is a keystrategyfor anti-rights groups at CSW. After taking part in one panel discussion, Nelly Munyasia from the Reproductive Health Network Kenya, recalls being handed a flyer incorrectly stating that abortion is not legal in any country. “Initially I wasn’t scared, and then it hit me that this [anti-abortion] movement is more daring, bolder and is doing anything they can do to convey their message.”On the first day of CSW, member states adopt a political declaration reaffirming their commitment to respect, protect and champion the rights, equality, and empowerment of women and girls. Sima Bahous, executive director of UN Women calls the declaration “a show of unity for all women and girls, everywhere … at a time when hard-fought gains for gender equality are under attack.”View image in fullscreenAt a UN women event delegates celebrate the Beijing+30 Action Agenda, designed to build on the 1995 declaration.Photograph: Ryan Brown/UN WomenThe US governmentrefuses to endorseit, but it is welcomed by leading health and rights groups such as the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) as a sign of international solidarity and support for the human rights of women and girls.But the declaration has a glaring omission: while sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) was part of adraft declarationpublished in January, there is no mention in the final agreement. IPPF believes the absence of SRHR, acornerstone of women’s equality and sustainable development, significantly weakens the text’s scope.Thirty years ago SRHR was included in the 12 critical areas covered by thehistoric Beijing declaration in 1995, a policy framework still regarded as the blueprint for gender equality and justice. Since then, it has often been a point of contention in international forums, but the2024 agreement acknowledged“the need for ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including for family planning, information and education”. The omission this year is seen by global advocacy groups and research centres as another effect of the increasingly hostile environment.“This year negotiators didn’t feel they could continue to fight for [those rights] so they let it go – because [otherwise] it would crash the negotiations. Many of us find that profoundly disappointing,” says Beth Schlachter, senior director of US external relations at MSI Reproductive Choices.Meta and Google accused of restricting reproductive health informationRead moreSchlachter’s colleague, Bethan Cobley, director of external affairs and partnerships, adds that the absence of language around SRHR has global ramifications, “These words set the global normative framework in the countries where we operate; countries take this language and use it to inform their national policies – it is hugely important.”The environment of extreme hostility is having numerous detrimental effects on healthcare providers attempting to deliver services to communities across Kenya, says Munyasia. “We come from a continent where abortion continues to be regarded as a taboo – you can imagine the work we have done to show women [they can have a safe abortion]. Now we are seeing disinformation which contributes to stigma and instils fear in women who will be termed murderers.”Munyasia has been harassed on social media and has had to remove signs from ReproductiveHealthNetwork Kenya offices, and even move offices; the call centre it runs has been reported to the authorities. The organisation has also recorded a rise in police targeting healthcare providers – it has documented 28 arrests of healthcare providers and their patients in the last two years.View image in fullscreenAnti-abortion activists protest at the International Conference on Population and Development in Nairobi, Kenya, 2019.Photograph: Dai Kurokawa/EPAShe is alarmed at the prospect of thePan-African Conference on Family Valuestaking place in Nairobi in May adding to the atmosphere of fear and distrust among women who use reproductive healthcare services.The worst part of it, says Munyisia, is that relentless attacks combined with aid cuts will prevent women and girls accessing contraceptives and safe abortion leading to unplanned, unwanted pregnancies, a rise in HIV infections and maternal deaths.“It’s going to be messy unless we have funders that can step up to mitigate this,” she says. “What breaks my heart is that vulnerable women and girls will suffer in global south.”Back at CSWF, a delegate from Liberia asks a panel how she could support young women who have been gang-raped.“Pray,” comes the reply.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentWomen's right to chooseWomenWomen's rights and gender equalityAbortionSexual healthGlobal healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is, in fact, so much happening simultaneously that it is virtually impossible to tackle it all.That is why efforts on the ground, in our communities and in our neighbourhoods are as vital as they ever were. Just like the grassroots civil rights movement of the 1960s forced change at the top, now too is a moment when our work can and must push back against Trump and a far right that is strategically dismantling every measure of progress. We must resist in order to exist.View image in fullscreenUSIllustration: Guardian Design/Guardian Design / Getty Images / ShutterstockWhen Trumpwas being sworn into officeon 20 January, my organisation,National Action Network, held a massive rally at the historicAfrican Methodist Episcopal churchin Washington DC. It was important for us to gather at this church, at a location that has long served as a place of refuge and comfort during dark times. As we once again find ourselves caught in the winds of uncertainty, chaos and injustice, we must organise, strategise and execute our own plan of action in order to save any measure of advancement and our hard-won civil rights.Despite the cruelty emanating from the Oval Office, there is a lot that can be done at the state and local level, and in our communities. In fact, state laws and policies often affect people more directly than federal policies at times. Therefore engaging state- and locally elected officials is vital – let them hear from you. After all, they are in office to serve the people and serve our interests, so our interests must be known. Whether it’s women’s reproductive rights, voting rights, LGBTQ+ rights, protecting immigrants, or any other issue, our concerns must be addressed. This is not a time for sitting back and watching helplessly; there is a lot that we can and must do to peacefully fight back.Here’s how we can push backOne of the first executive orders that Trump signed in office was toeliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmesin federal agencies. Many corporations, such as Target, McDonald’s, Walmart and others, unfortunatelyhave fallen in lineand capitulated to pressure from the right to either scale back significantly their DEI policies, or eliminate them altogether. It is why I announced on Martin Luther King Day that National Action Networkwill lead a strategic boycottof two companies that have dropped their DEI commitments.We’ve put together a group that is engaged in a 90-day study of which corporations have abandoned their DEI initiatives the most – and how much of their consumer base is in the Black community and how much of our wealth they receive. We will announce which companies we’re strategically boycotting at National Action Network’supcoming annual conference, held from 2 to 5 April at the Sheraton Times Square hotel in New York City.Not only will we boycott specific entities that don’t respect us, but we are also simultaneously supporting those who stand with us. After retail giant Costco announced that it will remain firm in its DEI policies, I led hundreds of people in a“buy-cott” at a Costco in East Harlem. That was followed by similar buy-cotts at Costco locations in New Jersey, Los Angeles and all over the south. It is vital to proactively support those who support us. We must remember why we have DEI in the first place – in order to rectify institutional policies that purposefully excluded us. Trump and other businesses may attack DEI, but they cannot dictate where we spend our hard-earned dollars. Our actions will speak for us even as they try to silence us.This is just one example of how we can push back individually and collectively during these challenging and dark times. There is much that we can do at the local community level to protect ourselves and our neighbours, and speak out where needed. When they cut social services, help those less fortunate and help people understand how they can navigate an increasingly confusing system. When they continue to eliminate DEI and voting protections, make sure people are empowered to know how to weather the storms – and how to still participate in the electoral process.When they go after reproductive rights, help women know where and how they can seek the care they may need and stay safe. When they target undocumented immigrants, make sure they know their rights. When they target the LGBTQ+ community, stand with them and continue to push for greater equality and inclusion. Over these next four years, it will be incumbent upon all of us to unite as one because the vile attacks against us are resting on a theory of divide and conquer.During the great civil rights movement, Black Americans and our allies organised, marched, boycotted and put enough pressure on the White House to bring about substantive change that was then codified into law. People didn’t just give us our rights out of the kindness of their hearts; we demanded them. It was pressure from the grassroots that then forced elected officials to act. We once again find ourselves living in an era where our work, our voices and our actions can and must speak volumes and bring about a nation where all of us are valued, protected and afforded the same rights and liberties.Trump and the right are counting on us to be defeated or deflated; we must strategise and push back because there are more of us than them. Those of us who care about diversity, inclusion, equality and justice far outweigh those working to destroy it. We just need to use our power effectively – and as one.The Rev Al Sharpton is an American Baptist minister, civil rights activist and radio talkshow host"

That’s a cautionary tale for global citiesInternational trade boomed with the city’s early adoption of technological and economic changes, but Black neighborhoods became ‘sacrifice zones’Lois BeckettSat 22 Mar 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 11.03 EDTShareOakland,California, is often treated as a city on the margins, best known for its struggles with poverty and gun violence, as well as for its history of radical Black activism. But a new book, The Pacific Circuit, argues that Oakland should be viewed as one of the centers of global change in the past century, serving both as a key node in the new global economy built around trans-Pacific trade, and as one of the “sacrifice zones” this economy requires.Far from being an outlier, US journalist Alexis Madrigal argues,Oaklandis in fact an early adopter of the technological and economic changes now tearing through cities across the US, and around the world. Oakland has long been the canary in Silicon Valley’s coalmine of disruption, the book suggests. But its residents don’t suffer passively: they organize and learn how to fight back.View image in fullscreenMargaret Gordon at the Oakland army base at the Port of Oakland, on 20 June 2015.Photograph: Will Whipple/GuardianThrough the life story of Margaret Gordon, a 78-year-old Black environmental justice activist in West Oakland, Madrigal charts the personal repercussions of major technological and economic developments of the 20th and early 21st centuries, from real estate redlining, to container shipping, to mortgage-backed securities and the 2008 financial crisis.We spoke with Madrigal, a contributing writer for The Atlantic and the co-host of KQED Forum, a Bay Area radio show, this week. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.You live in Oakland, and you’ve been working on this book for nearly a decade. What are the questions you started with?When people come to Oakland, you see all the containers, and you see all the trucks and cranes and ships, and then, as you move into the city, you see there’s this neighborhood attached to the port, and you see it is clearly struggling with environmental and other problems. What is the relationship between these two things? What does being a port city do to the rest of the city? I ended up going all over the place to track down the answers.View image in fullscreenThe Pacific Circuit: A Globalized Account of the Battle for the Soul of an American City, by Alexis Madrigal.Photograph: Courtesy of Alexis MadrigalYour book focuses on what was once the majority-Black neighborhood of West Oakland, and particularly on Seventh Street. Situate us: what does that look like?Seventh Street used to be this thriving commercial Black corridor in the 1930s and 40s. In the 50s, “urban renewal” was done to it, which meant a lot of bulldozing, for a massive post office facility. An overhead train was run through the center of the street, and the commercial corridor kind of collapsed.Today, Seventh Street is quite a wide, empty street that runs from downtown Oakland out to the port. There are very few thriving businesses there, and many things are in disrepair, and all around there are still community builders, and people trying to make this neighborhood good.Margaret Gordon, one of the central figures of the book, is one of those local residents fighting to make the neighborhood a safer place. She’s one of the founders of the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, and was honored by the Obama White House as a “champion of change” for her work to improve West Oakland’s air quality. Gordoncalled this book “a family affair”because of how closely the two of you worked together. How did her life become the main thread of the story?It’s because Ms Margaret knows everybody – that’s the alternate title of the book. Everyone from Lisa Jackson, the vice-president of environment, policy and social initiatives at Apple, to people on the street. She and her life represent a really crucial movement and change in the Bay Area, which was lots of Black people migrating here during WWII. She was born in war housing here in 1946.View image in fullscreenThe Southern Pacific Railroad wharf and pier on Seventh Street in Oakland, circa 1919.Photograph: Library of Congress Prints and Photographs DivisionThere’s a standard history of Oakland, starting with the arrival of the city’s Black population as part of the Great Migration fromsouthern states, followed by “urban renewal” in the 1950s that bulldozed and dislocated Black communities, the crack epidemic and the war on drugs, and then gentrification and more displacement. In writing The Pacific Circuit, what are you trying to add to this narrative?There’s a very deep and important urban history about the policies that structured Oakland and many other cities: segregation and redlining. I wanted to connect that with the big economic changes that were occurring over the same period, including containerization – the development of container shipping, and a network of shipping connecting Asian manufacturers and American consumers. Oakland is the first big container port in the western United States, connecting to Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam.There’s a second component to building these new transportation networks: you need all of the information technology to control these supply chains – you need the products of Silicon Valley.And, as the third component, you need this sacrificial environmental landscape through which to scale global trade. What that means on the ground: you need hundreds of coastal acres on which to put containers, and you need a neighborhood that’s marginalized enough that you can run thousands of diesel trucks through it every single day, polluting the air and creating all this noise pollution. I wanted people to know that Silicon Valley and the growth of global shipping are directly connected to the problems people are having in West Oakland.View image in fullscreenShipping containers being unloaded at the Port of Oakland, on 28 October 2021.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersIn researching this book, you found that Oakland’s Black radical thinkers, including Huey P Newton and other Black Pantherparty leaders, were very attuned to the importance of Oakland becoming a global port city, and the implications of what we might now call “globalization”. How did Newton make sense of this?In the early 1970s, Huey Newton is looking down at the port of Oakland from his penthouse apartment, and he writes this essay, The Technology Question. He saw that the development of global supply chains was incredibly powerful and difficult to stop, and that it had really important ethical and political implications. Newton and the Panthers were hoping to build “revolutionary intercommunalism”, where sub-national units in different nations, people who found themselves in the same relation to the American imperial power, would join up together. And the first node would be the city of Oakland.You learned that the Black Pantherparty leaders actually had this plan at the time to gain power in Oakland, and to strategically use Oakland’s port as part of the global battle for Black liberation. Do you think a lot about that alternate history?They didn’t ever win the city government. And it might not have worked. But there was a possibility of having an enduring base of power. What happened instead is the slow deflation of the 1970s, and then the boom of the crack era.View image in fullscreenSupporters of the Black Panther leader Huey Newton rally in Oakland, California, in 1970.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveYou’ve described this book as attempting to be a shadow history of the working people of Silicon Valley. What do you mean by that?There’s a lot of different ways to tell Silicon Valley’s story, and I think a lot has been left out. There’s an enormous labor force that’s put into place to do the assembly and eventually manufacture the electronics that make Silicon Valley into Silicon Valley. And that is absolutely inseparable from Asian manufacturing, and the women who work in those countries. When this work happens in California, many of the people working in those factories are also immigrant women. You have these two groups of women, across the ocean from each other, who are basically the equivalent of the auto workers in Detroit. These are the people who built Silicon Valley – all these workers, largely Asian women. And they’ve been completely written out of the story.Your book chronicles the many ways that technological innovation can devastate people and communities. But it also contains an unexpected number of victories, including several wins for the west coast longshoremen who used to unload ships by hand.One of the core premises of the book is that this system of Pacific shipping has these choke points, and the No 1 is the port. In 1934, there’s a massive strike in San Francisco by the longshoremen, and it’s essentially a total win. They get a hiring hall, and all of these changes to the consistency and the quality of the work that they do. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union is able to unionize as a racially integrated, leftwing union across the ports of the west coast. I have found that group to be totally fascinating, both because they did allow the forces of modernization to the waterfront, and they have maintained pretty substantial strength as a union throughout, though much smaller than they were in their heyday.What does the ILWU do in the face of the rise of container shipping, which drastically reduced the number of human workers needed to load and unload cargo?ILWU leader Harry Bridges does a deal, and, as they put it, “they get a share of the machine”. For each ton that was shipped, some money was put into the union, and they agree to shrink the union over time. It remains a very controversial decision.You write a lot about the vanished world of the dockworkers, what their jobs and theirlives were like before containerization essentially ended this way of work. Looking back, how do you evaluate it?I’ve spent a lot of time talking to these guys. Many of them are still alive. The job used to be brutal, physically demanding, and it left you broken. On the other side, you had friends, it was human – it was fun, in a lot of ways, not every day, but often. And there was this unbroken connection to the culture of the longshoremen: the bullshitting, drinking, hanging-out culture of the dockworkers. Now that dockworking is heavily mechanized, I don’t think most people would call it fun anymore, but it is also less damaging to your body, much safer, in most ways.View image in fullscreenCivil defense volunteers on a turret that could direct 10,000 gallons a minute, at the Port of Oakland on 29 March 1953.Photograph: MediaNews Group/East Bay Times/Getty ImagesWhat are some of the other unexpected wins that Oakland residents have made as they struggle against some pretty big systemic problems?The latest fight has been over a coal export terminal in the port of Oakland, that was going to take coal from Utah and ship it to Asia. Activists in Oakland, including Margaret Gordon, put together the No Coal in Oakland campaign, and they’ve managed to keep the export terminal from getting put in. Along with the work of other local activists who have also held the line on coal exports at other ports, that means that coal is still in the ground in Utah.You write in the book that you’re worried that the logistical supply-chain systems that have long governed global shipping are increasingly coming home – and that on-demand ordering threatens to replace the cityitselfas a way of organizing commerce. How concerned are you that cities themselves might become an outmoded technology?I think the Bay Area is already kind of living in that future in a lot of ways. It’s not the “doom loop”, which has these particular features related to the pandemic. This is more like one of those tidal forces: every business is getting a little harder to run. Oakland just got voted the best restaurant city in America, and I know a lot of restaurateurs in Oakland, and they can barely keep the doors open. People don’t come in. They order from a ghost kitchen. It’s so hard to get people to be out and living city life. I am genuinely troubled by it.We have imagined that the pandemic was something we would come back from. What if, instead of a blip, it was a pulling forward?That is a grim view.On the other hand, this is something that’s more under control of individual people and communities than so many other problems with our world. This is something that people can choose – but they have to choose the city over a narrow individualistic idea of convenience. Over the long term, not having restaurants that can stay open, not having bookstores, not having coffee shops is very inconvenient, even if at any moment it might be more convenient to order delivery.Explore more on these topicsOaklandShipping industryBlack US cultureCaliforniaRaceWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This hard-hitting series about the malign influence of the online “manosphere” arrived just as news broke about a story that had been making UK headlines for nine months: that of notorious crossbow killer Kyle Clifford, who raped and murdered 25-year-old Louise Hunt last year after she ended their relationship. The latest update showed that Clifford had searched the web for Andrew Tate’s podcast mere hours before killing Hunt, her sister Hannah and mother Carol at their family home in Hertfordshire.The show’s star and co-creatorStephen Grahamwas originally horrified by a spate of violent incidents across Britain in which teenage boys committed deadly knife crimes against girls. The actor said these shocking stories “hurt my heart” and asked of him: “What’s going on in our society where this kind of thing is becoming a regular occurrence?” He teamed up with screenwriter Jack Thorne – a regular collaborator who has worked with Graham on such acclaimed British dramas as This Is England, The Virtues and Help – to create a potent drama interrogating this distressing trend. Thorne says they wanted to “look into the eye of male rage”.The gritty, emotionally charged result follows the working-class Miller family from Yorkshire. Their world is blown apart when 13-year-old schoolboy Jamie is arrested in a dawn raid on suspicion of murdering a female classmate, Katie Leonard. Poignantly, Jamie wets himself with panic when armed police burst through his bedroom door. He repeatedly insists he’s innocent. However, it’s no spoiler to say that chilling CCTV footage makes clear who was responsible for the frenzied multiple stabbing. This isn’t a whodunnit, it’s a whydunnit. Exploring what motivated this shocking crime is why Adolescence has struck such a chord.The series tackles the devastating and sometimes fatal consequences of toxic masculinity. The manosphere and Andrew Tate are name-checked in the script but the central character, says Thorne, has been “indoctrinated by voices a lot more dangerous than Tate’s”.Jamie has fallen under the spell of misogynistic influencers and suffered cyber-bullying for being an “incel”. His parents admit that he would shut himself in his bedroom and be on his computer long into the night. They assumed he was safe but he was secretly being radicalised. His story highlights the corrosive impact of social media on impressionable minds and has resonated profoundly with audiences. Parents of teenagers have been watching rapt, heartbroken and horrified in equal measure – with the show clocking up an astonishing 24.3m views in its first four days of release, four times more than the number two show. It tops the Netflix ratings in 71 countries, ranging from Chile to Vietnam. One British police force has even said it should be a “wake-up call for parents”.Labour MP Anneliese Midgley has called for the series to be screened in parliament and in schools, arguing that it could help counter misogyny and violence against women and girls. PM Keir Starmer backed the idea, praising Adolescence and saying that he’d watched it with his own teenage children. Starmer added that violence against girls was “abhorrent … a growing problem … we have to tackle it”.View image in fullscreenSir Keir Starmer talking about Adolescence in parliament.Photograph: House of Commons / PA WireThere have been discussions on the BBC’s Newsnight and Today programmes. Graham appeared live on CNN yesterday, reflecting on how the internet “is parenting our children just as much as we are”. This was followed by an interview on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in which Graham said: “We’re all accountable – the education system, parenting, the community, the government and especially social media.”Thorne has called for the introduction of a “digital age of consent” by banning smartphones for under-16s. Pundits have suggested that social media giants should do more to regulate algorithm-driven extreme content. A recent survey came to the depressing conclusion that more than half of young women are now frightened of their male peers.The debate was further fuelled by former England football manager Sir Gareth Southgate delivering a televised lecture this week, warning about the dangers of “callous, manipulative and toxic influencers” and demanding better male role models. His pleas were echoed by feminist writer Caitlin Moran, author of What AboutMen?, on Channel 4 News. She said toxic masculinity was “very joyless and very depressing”, expressing the hope that Southgate’s speech and Adolescence would be a watershed moment.The series has won widespread plaudits both for its tour de force performances – expect all the cast to be in the mix for major acting awards next year – and for its technical virtuosity. Each episode is filmed in one hour-long continuous take, without any cuts, edits or CGI. The camera never leaves the action, adding an immersive tension that suits the unflinching content. As Adolescence fever has gripped audiences worldwide, Netflix has cannily released behind-the-scenes footage of how the filming was achieved via a cleverly choreographed system of cameras being passed between operators, who fixed them to cranes, vehicles and drones on the fly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The opening part is a police procedural. Subsequent episodes switch gear into a school drama, a two-hander play, then finally a kitchen sink soap opera. These chapters combine into a coherent, gut-punchingly powerful whole. Adolescence currently holds a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and has received unanimous five-star reviews.The Guardian’s critic Lucy Mangan called it“the closest thing to TV perfection in decades”. This view was echoed in the US. Rolling Stone’s Alan Sepinwall hailed it as “among the very best things – and an early contender forthebest thing – you will see on the small screen this year”. In the New York Times, Margaret Lyons described it as “a rich work of social critique”, describing the third episode as “one of the more fascinating hours of TV I’ve seen in a long time”.Safeguarding minister Jess Phillips said: “Netflix’s brilliant Adolescence is not just a drama. It’s a disturbing glimpse into the minds of thousands of young boys warped by the violence and abuse they are witnessing every day online.”Social media is similarly overflowing with praise. Film director Paul Feig saluted the first episode as “one of the best hours of television I’ve ever seen”. While Bafta-winning screenwriter Sarah Phelps saluted its “God-tier writing”. Adolescence looks set to become an all-time TV classic. However, its most lasting legacy could be the urgent questions it asks, the vital conversations it starts and the societal change it kickstarts.Explore more on these topicsAdolescenceTelevisionViolence against women and girlsSocial mediaMenSexual harassmentDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I love how the florets take on flavour and fat. I enjoy how the personality of the cauliflower pops out when you roast the bejesus out of it to reveal a caramel-like bitter sweetness. And I am a fan of how cheap and comforting it is. This recipe is a celebration of the roast cauliflower and, since the oven is on anyway, I’ve made a baked rice to go with it (credit toYotam Ottolenghifor the technique) that is herby, nutty, hot with harissa and brought together with a thwack of lemon juice.Roast cauliflower with harissa pilafThe baked rice needs a tight foil lid for the steam to cook it, so don’t skimp on the time it takes to seal it properly.Prep15 minCook50 minServes4For the cauliflower2 red onions, peeled and finely sliced1 cauliflower(1.1kg), trimmed and cut into 4cm florets6 tbsp sunflower oil– I likeMr Organic2½ tsp ground cumin2½ tsp ground kashmiri chilli2 tsp turmeric2 tsp fine sea saltFor the rice350g basmati rice, unwashed4 tbsp sunflower oil4 tbsp rose harissa paste2cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated1½ tsp fine sea salt1 lemon, juiced, to get 3 tbsp20g mint, leaves picked and finely chopped20g coriander, leaves and tender stems finely chopped60g roasted cashews, finely choppedHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9. In a large baking dish, combine the finely sliced onion and cauliflower, then add the oil, spices and salt, and rub them in to coat everything well. Cover the dish tightly with foil, pressing all around the edges, then put to one side.Put the rice, oil, harissa, ginger, salt and 700ml just-boiled water in a second large baking dish. Cover this with foil, too, sealing it well and pressing down all around the edges.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Bake both trays for 25 minutes, carefully turning them around once halfway through. Take both trays out of the oven and put the rice tray to one side, with its foil lid intact, and leave to rest. Take the foil off the cauliflower tray and return it to the oven for 10 minutes to crisp up.After 10 minutes, take the foil off the rice, then tip the cauliflower and onion mixture all over the top. Pour over the lemon juice, sprinkle with the chopped herbs and cashews, and serve warm.Explore more on these topicsMiddle Eastern food and drinkThe new veganVegan food and drinkVegetablesRiceFoodMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

The 14-year-old, who lives in Sydney, Australia, is on the shortlist for this year’s Sony WorldPhotographyawards youth competition. “The Australian winter sunset is notoriously fast-moving, so I started preparing for the shoot as soon as I got home,” Hasanoff says. “I knew I’d only have a 20-minute window to capture the mysterious light between sunset and darkness, which would contrast with the brightness of a torch.”‘The boy jumped at just the right moment’: Pradiptamoy Paul’s best phone pictureRead moreHolding that torch is Ryuji, Hasanoff’s neighbour and family friend, whom he describes as “extremely cool and charismatic, with great hair, who dresses like a DJ, although he’s actually an art student”.The concept for the shot – a DJ who had broken down on their way to a gig – was already decided on, but Hasanoff found the perfect additional detail when he opened the bonnet. “As I don’t own a vintage Rolls-Royce, it was a real surprise to find what looked like a makeshift turntable inside,” he says. “It was a lucky bonus!”He adds that he was inspired by the work ofGregory Crewdson. “He’s an epic photographer who uses light to tell a story.

His team of international researchers used computer modeling to replicate the transport of blooms on strong currents controlled by negativeNorth Atlantic oscillation(NAO), and how the changing atmospheric conditions helped create the giant sargassum belt.“We had posed the hypothesis before that it is not the rivers that feed the formation of the sargassum blooms in the tropical Atlantic. This model supports the idea that nutrients from slightly deeper layers in the ocean feed the blooms.”Muller-Karger continued, saying that “models showed that some patches of the sargassum were swept up by the wind and currents from the Sargasso Sea toward Europe, then moved southward, and from there were injected into the tropical Atlantic.“At first, we saw just a few patches being pushed south by the NAO. But these algae patches were met with the right conditions to grow and perpetuate blooms. This population of algae, now separated from the Sargasso Sea, forms new blooms every year thanks to having enough light, nutrients and warmer temperatures,” he said.Almost annually for more than a decade, giant clumps of goop from the 5,000-mile-wide sargassum belthave washed ashorein the Caribbean, and from Florida to Mexico, creating problems for local authorities and businesses that rely on tourism.There are also significant health concerns. The rotting sargassum releases large quantities of hydrogen sulfide, which fills the air with an acrid odor similar to rotting eggs, and can provoke asthma and other respiratory issues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Critics have beenjailed, elections have been transformed into “patriots only” affairs,journalists have been harassedand hundreds of thousands of peoplehave left.This week, an obscure legal development has, in the eyes of some legal experts, inflicted another cut on the city’s once revered legal system.On 17 March, Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal (CFA), the city’s top bench, rejected an application fromJimmy Lai. The 77-year-old pro-democracy activist is nowon trialfor alleged national security offences – charges which could see the former media mogul spend the rest of his life in jail. Although the trial is well under way, Lai’s legal team have been trying to appeal against the decision to bar his preferred lawyer, Tim Owen KC, from representing him.‘The old days are no more’: Hong Kong goes quiet as security laws tighten their gripRead moreThe details of the saga date back to 2022, when Owen was first approved to represent Lai. TheHong Konggovernment objected to Owen’s admission, but lost multiple appeals to have him blocked. So John Lee, the chief executive, turned to Beijing. In December 2022, the Chinese government issued an interpretation of the national security law, which had been imposed on the city in June 2020 to quell months of pro-democracy protests. The interpretation stated that the courts needed approval from the chief executive to admit foreign lawyers in national security cases.Although Owen had been admitted to represent Lai before the interpretation was issued, Hong Kong’s national security committee nonetheless instructed the immigration department todeny him a work permit.“It’s pretty well unheard of for somebody who is entitled to represent a client not to receive a work permit,” says Jonathan Sumption, a former supreme court judge whoquit the CFA last year, warning that the rule of law was “profoundly compromised” in Hong Kong. “I think it tells us quite a lot about the view of the rule of law taken by the executive”. Sumption said that blocking Owen via a visa refusal was “a subterfuge” on the part of the government.But the issue at the heart of Lai’s appeal was not the visa – but the fact decisions made by the national security committee cannot be legally challenged, a principle that has caused alarm in some legal circles.Paul Harris SC, a former chairperson of the Hong Kong Bar Association, who fled the city in 2022 after being warned by the national security police that they were considering charging him with sedition, said that the principle “effectively gives the committee the powers of a police state”.While the CFA did not give a reason for rejecting Lai’s appeal this week, it did so using a rule that is normally reserved for applications with “no reasonable grounds” or that are “frivolous”.“This is another, among many, blows to the rule of law,” said Michael C Davis, a former law professor at the University of Hong Kong. “The CFA surely missed an opportunity to reign in what has become excessive resort to national security claims and to better articulate the boundaries, if any, of the committee’s immunity from review.”Samuel Townend KC, chairperson of the Bar Council of England and Wales until this year, said that the CFA’s refusal to hear the appeal amounted to the court “washing their hands of any judicial oversight” of the national security committee.Simon NM Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong, warned against reading too much into the CFA’s decision. He pointed to an earlier ruling which stated that the national security law was clear in its intent to immunise certain decisions from legal challenge. He said that by refusing to grant leave to appeal, the CFA judges may just have decided that Lai’s specific claim was simply without merit. “The question of judicial reviewability of a NSC [national security committee] decision on jurisdictional grounds remains open,” Young said.But for Lai, it is the end of the road on this legal challenge. He will not be able to instruct his chosen lawyer in any future proceedings. With his national security trial expected to run until the autumn, and further appeals expected if he is convicted, there may be many more to come.Hong Kong’s judiciary did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsChinaHong KongJimmy LaiAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Peter Dutton MP, minister for home affairs, and [redacted]”.Dutton under pressure to give MPs ‘anything to sell’ to voters as cost-of-living budget loomsRead moreGuests were ferried to the private island from the Noosa marina at 12pm, returning at either 4pm or 4.45pm. The drive from the Sunshine Coast airport – where Dutton landed – to the Noosa marina takes about 30 minutes.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe investigation found that Dutton’s use of expenses was within the rules, and Guardian Australia is not suggesting otherwise. The rules state that parliamentarians are required to use expenses in good faith, “for the dominant purpose of conducting parliamentary business” and in a way that achieves “value for money”.Documents obtained under freedom of information by the Guardian and former freelance journalist William Summers show the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (Ipea), which oversees MPs’ expense claims, conducted a preliminary assessment of Dutton’s travel followingGuardian’s reportingin 2021.The preliminary assessment concluded that Dutton had used parliamentary business resources for the trip and recommended that a more thorough investigation, known as an assurance review, be conducted.The documents show the full review was completed six months later, on 9 September 2021, and determined that Dutton’s expense claim was in accordance with the rules.That was because the invitation to the event “addressed the Minister as Minister for Home Affairs” and “the Minister was an invited guest to the ‘Long Lunch on Makepeace Island’ event, which he attend in his official capacity as a Minister.”This made the trip parliamentary business and entitled Dutton to claim travel in association with it, the watchdog ruled. It found he had not used taxpayer funds “for his travel from Maroochydore to Makepeace Island or from Makepeace Island to his home base of Brisbane”.“On the basis of the assessment conducted, IPEA has concluded the travel was for parliamentary business as defined in Schedule 4(b) of the Determination, as the Minister was an invited guest to the ‘Long Lunch on Makepeace Island’ event, which he attend in his official capacity as a Minister,” the watchdog ruled.Ipea declined to comment further on its ruling.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On 19 July 2019, he posted a video filmed in Ironbark Gully, a park in the outer Brisbane suburb of Ferny Hills, which is in his electorate of Dickson, 100km from Maroochydore. It featured an RSL sub-branch president, whom he hailed as one of “Dickson’s heroes”.The website for Makespeace Island describes it as a “private luxury resort home, set on an exclusive-use island and nestled in the tranquil waters of the Noosa River”. The island is used for corporate retreats and functions, among other things.For those staying overnight, a master villa attracts a nightly rate of $19,950 for eight guests.Anthony Whealy, a former New South Wales supreme court judge and current chair of the Centre for Public Integrity, said the expenses system needed review.He said it allowed a grey area for MPs to claim travel in circumstances the public would not always accept as fair.“I think the public demand that these sorts of systems be shaken up every now and again because clearly they’re not satisfactory,” Whealy said.“There’s always this grey area where integrity is being threatened.

The other, Tarong, would use 55% more water than its existing coal station.Tarong’s primary water source is the Boondooma Dam, from which it is allocated 30,000 megalitres a year, and which also supplies drinking water for the nearby town of Kingaroy and irrigates the rich agricultural country along the Boyne River. But Tarong also has a pipeline to the Wivenhoe Dam, the main supply of water for Brisbane and Ipswich, which – due to substantial premiums – it only uses when Boondooma Dam levels are low.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailMore than 1.3m cubic metres of seawater were required to coolJapan’s Fukushima nuclear reactors and prevent a complete meltdown in 2011– about 1,000 times the combined capacity of Wivenhoe and Boondooma dams.The report has been described as “flawed and highly politicised” by the Coalition.The QCC director, Dave Copeman, said the fact there was “nowhere near enough water capacity in our dams to stop a nuclear meltdown if things go wrong” exposed the Coalition’s energy plan as a “nuclear fantasy”.“If there was an emergency, you could run the whole [Wivenhoe] Dam dry and still not have enough water to stop a meltdown,” Copeman said.“The Coalition is not being honest with farmers and the community about the realities of their nuclear scheme. At best it’s impractical, at worst it’s grossly irresponsible and could result in a major incident.”4:36Here's why Peter Dutton's nuclear power plan is a fantasy - videoThe Callide coal-fired power plant has an annual water allocation of 20,000 ML from the Callide Dam, which is fed by the Awoonga Dam. As of Wednesday, Awoonga – which supplies the city of Gladstone’s water – was at 46% capacity, and Callide – which supplies drinking water to Biloela – was at 16.5% capacity. Callide Dam is also used to replenish aquifers that irrigate crops in the Callide Valley.Callide would have to find an additional 27,000 ML of water to power the kind of power plants implied by the Coalition’s nuclear plan, the QCC report found – with Copeman saying there was simply “not enough water available”.Clare Silcock, the renewable energy engineer for the QCC who crunched the numbers on the report, said the Coalition’s nuclear proposal was scant on details. Instead she drew upon the Frontier Economic’s modelling thatthe opposition has relied upon to argue its nuclear vision for seven reactors across the countrywould be 44% cheaper than the government’s renewables-led plan.That report models just over 100,000 gigawatt hours of nuclear electricity in the National Electricity Market (NEM) – which covers Queensland, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia – by 2050.Six of the proposed nuclear sites are within the NEM, and so the QCC report assumes the generation would be spread equally across those sites.But Silcock said none of the other four proposed plants were “going to be particularly better in terms of water availability”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve just done the analysis for Queensland – but the question is valid around all those six sites”.Ian Lowe, emeritus professor at Griffith University’s school of environment and science, said the QCC research was “sound”.Lowe said that a rule of thumb was that a nuclear power station needed about 15% more water than a coal-fired power station of the same capacity. So whether the proposed Tarong and Callide nuclear plants would require more or less water than the current coal stations would depend on the capacity for which they were built.“[But] if we were to build the amount of nuclear power proposed in the Frontier Economics report as part of the Coalition’s long-term approach for 2050 electricity, there would not be enough water for Tarong and Callide to provide the proposed share of power,” he said.That meant that the Frontier report was “implicitly assuming that the nuclear power program would be expanded” beyond the sites already identified by the Coalition.“So it would be reasonable to ask the question: if the much larger nuclear program proposed in the Frontier Economics report were to go ahead, where would all the extra power stations be sited?” Lowe said.“Given that we are the driest inhabited continent and rainfall patterns are being significantly disrupted by climate change, they would have to be on coastal sites and using sea water for cooling, which would add further costs due to the design complication of resisting corrosion”.The shadow energy minister, Ted O’Brien, described the QCC report as “flawed and highly politicised” criticising it for making assumptions about water usage based ona 2006 feasibility study into the possibility of establishing a nuclear power industry in Australiacommissioned by then prime minister John Howard.“The fact is, the latest nuclear power plant designs are incredibly efficient and their water usage is comparable to coal fired power stations which they will eventually replace,” O’Brien said.“The Coalition has embraced a world’s best practice ‘coal to nuclear’ because it allows us to leverage existing infrastructure – including water, transmission and a local workforce.”The Coalition minister pointed tothe Palo Verde Nuclear power plant in the Sonoran Desert, one of the United State’s largest power producers and the only one in the world not near a large body of water as it uses treated wastewater from nearby cities.Explore more on these topicsEnergyNuclear powernewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not just embarrassing, it’s calamitous | Tim WintonRead moreOn the Great Barrier Reef, bleaching is being detected from around Townsville to the tip of Cape York, a distance of about 1,000km.On Western Australia’s famous Ningaloo reef, waters have accumulated the highest amount of heat stress on record during an extended marine heatwave that has hit coral reefs all along the state’s vast coastline.Paul Gamblin, the chief executive of the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said history would “record this profoundly distressing moment” when two world famous reefs both suffered widespread damage at the same time.View image in fullscreenCorals begin to bleach at about 4DHW, and 8DHW can kill heat-sensitive corals. Scientists say levels up to 16DHWs have been detected on the Ningaloo coast.Photograph: David Juszkiewicz/Curtin UniversityDr Zoe Richards, an associate professor and coral scientist at Curtin University, spent 10 days monitoring the health of Ningaloo reefs and the neighbouring Exmouth Gulf earlier this month.She said in shallower areas known for their clear waters, which are popular with tourists, she had seen up to 90% of corals bleached and evidence of corals dying. Even slow-growing corals that were hundreds of years old were bleaching, she said.Ningaloo last experienced widespread bleaching only three years ago.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe WA government, which is coordinating monitoring across reefs there, said bleaching had also been reported at Kimberley, Ashmore Reef, Rowley Shoals, Barrow Island, Dampier Archipelago, inshore Pilbara and Exmouth Gulf.Richards said: “This isn’t isolated to Ningaloo – this is happening across the entire north-west shelf. There has never been this scale of impacts in WA. I am not aware of this ever happening before. Climate change has definitely caught up with the reefs in WA.”Corals lose the algae that give them their colour and most of their nutrients if ocean waters get too warm. If bleaching is not severe, corals can recover, but studies show they are less able to reproduce and are more susceptible to disease.Coral reef experts use a metric known as degree heating weeks (DHW) to show how much heat corals have accumulated. Generally, corals begin to bleach at about 4DHW, and 8DHW can kill heat-sensitive corals.Dr Jessica Benthuysen, an oceanographer at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims), first saw signs of heat accumulating in WA last August. By the end of December, she said, some areas had sea surface temperatures 4C hotter than normal.Benthuysen said levels up to 16DHWs had been detected on the Ningaloo coast, which were the highest on record.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Underwater checks found bleaching at 24 of 30 reefs surveyed.Bleaching was worse farther north – there is no concern for reefs in the park’s southern section.Last summer was the worst bleaching event on record for the reef and thefifth major outbreak in eight years, hitting all across the marine park.Dr Neal Cantin, a coral reef biologist at Aims who was on the monitoring flights, said bleaching was generally worse closer to shore but there was “high to medium” bleaching on reefs from Cairns to the far north. He said in the far north, heat stress was between six and 13DHWs, which was “capable of causing mortality”.Dr Roger Beeden, the chief scientist at the authority, said detailed analysis of the data from the flights was still being analysed, but he said the lack of recovery time for corals between major events was worrying.“It’s the frequency as well as the severity that makes us most concerned,” he said.Dr Emily Howells, a coral scientist from Southern Cross University who has been at the Australian Museum’s research station on Lizard island since February, said this was now the sixth summer in a row that bleaching had been seen there.The island, in the north of the reef, was badly hit by bleaching last summer and scientists at Aims who visited in subsequent months said the areahad lost one-third of its live corals due to the heat.Howells said there was less coral mortality this year, “but that’s because a lot of the sensitive corals died last summer”.“There just isn’t enough opportunity for these coral communities to bounce back. It’s heartbreaking,” she said.“We’re making it more and more challenging for the corals. The solution is having stronger action on climate change. The longer we wait, the worse it will get.”‘Catastrophic’: Great Barrier Reef hit by its most widespread coral bleaching, study findsRead moreNorthern parts of the Great Barrier Reef have also been heavily affected by flooding from torrential rains. James Cook University’s TropWATER group has recordedflood waters carrying sediments and nutrients in a plume across 700kmof the coast and extending as far as 100km offshore.Jane Waterhouse, a reef water quality expert at TropWATER, said major flood events appeared to be happening more often and flood plumes were reaching farther offshore.“River discharge carries pollutants, sediments and nutrients,” she said. “You get muddy water that cuts the light that seagrass and corals need to grow, and that nutrient also allows algae to grow.”Gamblin said the widespread damage from underwater heatwaves and cyclones to both reefs was “what our world-renowned scientists have been warning us about for decades”.He said fossil fuel companies were “doubling down” to get more mega projects running, pointing toareas around Scott Reef in WA being targetedfor expansion by Woodside.He said: “More mega polluting projects up at places like Scott Reef will make a tragic situation worse.

It means they can borrow more cheaply than smaller competitors that don’t have this,” Richardson says.“We need to price this insurance right, and it’s not clear we are charging the banks anything like the actual market value (of this insurance).”Richardson points to Reserve Bank research that argued a more realistic level could be multiples of the current level.“I think if we raised the major bank levy, it would improve competition without worsening safety,” he says.The least worst optionIn a speech last year, the chair of APRA, John Lonsdale, highlighted the devastating impact of bank failures and pointed to the lessons of history.“In a country that hasn’t experienced a significant bank failure in almost 35 years, it’s easy to forget or become complacent about their impact on the economy and the community,” Lonsdale said.View image in fullscreenBanks such as NAB, ANZ, Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank pay a ‘major bank levy’ equal to 0.06% – or 6 basis points – of the value of their liabilities.Photograph: AAP“When the Pyramid Building Society fell into liquidation in 1990, the Victorian government had to repay $900m dollars to affected depositors, which it funded with a five-year levy on petrol. In other words, taxpayers footed the bill.”While governments do not provide an explicit guarantee to bail out major banks in a crisis, history shows this is almost always the case.And for good reason.The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas conservatively estimated that the costs of the GFC to the American economy were between 40% and 90% of GDP, even after the public bailed out Wall Street.The IMF has estimated the average cost of a financial crisis is more than 60% of a country’s entire annual economic output.The UK government poured £137bn (AU$281bn) into rescuing floundering banks between September 2007 and the end of 2009. Most of those payments were eventually recouped, but the Office for Budget Responsibility in 2021 reckoned the eventual tab of the bailout at £33bn pounds.Nico de Lange is a lead analyst at S&P Global Ratings – one of just three hugely influential firms which assign credit scores to businesses and countries around the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would give them a leg-up compared to other institutions as their cost of funding should be lower,” De Lange says.The borrowing advantageExperts agree that it is impossible to pinpoint the exact benefit the taxpayer backstop delivers to the big banks. The consensus from past research, however, is it is likely substantially higher than the levy set in 2017.The RBA in 2012 analysed the rates at which the big banks borrowed and found they had an “unexplained funding advantage over smaller Australian banks of around 20 to 40 basis points on average since 2000”.Two years later, a paper released under freedom of information showed the RBA estimated this advantage was worth between $1.9bn and $3.7bn in 2015.While the funding advantage changes over time, these estimates suggest that the 6bp bank levy would be three to six times larger to more accurately capture the implicit promise that taxpayers will ride to a bank’s rescue.In dollar terms, the crude maths suggests the big four banks plus Macquarie would pay $5bn and $10bn a year collectively if made to pay for the benefits of being too big to fail.Guardian graphicTreasury officials, in their explanatory memorandum for amendments to the 2017 Major Bank Levy Bill, said the levy was a fundraising measure but placed it squarely in the context of financial crises and the concept of too-big-to-fail.The levy would shore up the budget in order to provide “greater fiscal capacity to accommodate shocks such as those seen in the global financial crisis”, the memo said.“The major bank levy is similar to bank levies imposed in other advanced countries, recognising that large leveraged banks are a source of systemic risk in the financial system and the wider economy. Those risks were made evident in the global financial crisis.”This rationale for the levy was downplayed by the Turnbull government, however, who were wary of making explicit what has always been an implicit guarantee.View image in fullscreenThe then treasurer, Scott Morrison, after his 2017 budget speech.Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAPMorrison in his budget night speech framed the levy as a pro-competition measure, saying it “represents an additional and fair contribution from our major banks, is similar to measures imposed in other advanced countries, and will even up the playing field for smaller banks”.Stephen Anthony is a former senior Treasury official and chief economist at Industry Super Australia, before starting advisory group Macroeconomics. In 2014, Anthony estimated the too-big-to-fail guarantee for the four major banks alone was worth between $2.9bn and $4.5bn.The research was commissioned by the association of smaller, customer-owned lenders who have long complained about the lack of a level playing field with their bigger competitors.Anthony tells Guardian Australia he believes the comfortable banking oligarchy is “the source of a lot of the lack of competitive pressures there are in the Australian economy”.“It reminds you just how protected the big banks’ ‘utility licence’ is,” he says.“If you go back to the Campbell committee report (in 1981), the whole rationale behind the deregulation of the financial sector was supposed to be getting capital to small and medium-sized businesses at a reasonable rate.“On any measure that has been an abject failure, and since the GFC we’ve seen a further strengthening of the hand of the too-big-to-fail players.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian budget 2025BankingAustralian economyBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

The scheme is capped at 10,000 places a year, with a total of 40,000 places over four years.The housing minister, Clare O’Neil, said that under the changes, “most first home buyers are [now] eligible”.Income caps will be increased from $90,000 to $100,000 for single applicants, and from $120,000 to $160,000 for joint applicants and single parents. Property price caps will also be increased in line with the average house price in each state and territory, rather than the price of dwellings, which include all residential properties such as apartments and units.“In Brisbane, for example, we’re raising property price caps from what were $700,000 to now $1m,” O’Neil told reporters on Saturday. “In Melbourne from $850,000 to $950,000, and in Sydney from $950,000 to $1.3m.Expect a lot of talk about Australia’s deficit, but remember the golden rule: budgets are always about choices | Greg JerichoRead more“This today will reflect in almost all circumstances the average house price in those capital cities.”For NSW, the price cap is set at $1.3m rather than the median house price – about $1.5m – to ensure prices remain within the borrowing capacity of first home buyers.O’Neil said a lot of young Australians “can’t see themselves ever owning a home of their own, and one of our government’s goals is to turn that around”.“Help to Buy is going to be a very important pathway for many Australians to get into home ownership. We expect the scheme will be really, really popular.”The government will increase its equity investment in the scheme by $800m, from $5.5bn to $6.3bn, to support the changes.The government also announced $54m would be allocated in the budget to supercharge prefabricated and modular home construction, which it says can be built up to 50% faster than traditionally built homes.The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said the housing market was a “disaster” but young people did not want to co-own with the government.He said the Coalition would let first-homebuyers access up to $50,000 of their superannuation.“Five years ago if somebody had been able to do that ... their net position today would potentially be tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars better off because they had purchased a house and they’d got into the housing market,” he said.But Independent ACT senator David Pocock welcomed Labor’s move, saying that while there was “no silver bullet”, these were “sensible changes” that would help more home buyers get into the market.“Change to help single parents also very welcome,” he wroteon social mediaon Saturday. “More needed but a good step from [O’Neil].”Help to Buypassed the Senate last Novemberwith the help of the Greens, who unsuccessfully had pushed for a number of concessions. This was after the Greens and Coalition previouslyteamed up to delay the billin the Senate in September.The Greens had called on the government to reform negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions in return for their support on Help to Buy, but later reduced their demands, instead asking for an extra 25,000 social and affordable homes.The Greens eventually helped Labor pass the legislation without their concessions, vowing to pursue these using their balance of power in the event of a minority government after the next election.The upcoming federal budget, to be delivered by the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, on Tuesday, is widely tipped to include some support for households, including another round of $300 energy rebates.Dutton isfacing internal pressureto match any cost-of-living relief offered in the budget, with one Coalition MP saying: “If Labor is offering cost-of-living [relief] in the budget, it is nearly impossible to see us not matching that.”The Help to Buy scheme will open for applications in late 2025.–with Australian Associated PressExplore more on these topicsHousingAustralian election 2025Labor partyAustralian politicsAustralian budget 2025newsShareReuse this content"

Mark Dunton, of theNational Archives, believes the ­documents, which go on display in the ­exhibition, MI5: Official Secrets, next week at Kew, west London, shed light on one of the most shady ­periods of British ­espionage.During the cold war period, a group of “Cambridge Spies” managed to compromise the top ranks of British Security and Secret Intelligence Services, MI5 and MI6. “All the layers of description and detail in these documents make the complexity and the mistrust clear,” said Dunton.“The original transcripts of Philby’s interrogations later can be read by the public for the first time. They will be displayed alongside some extraordinary new loans from MI5. Philby’s movements around London in 1951 make fascinating reading.”Tracking him that winter between the Athenaeum Club, the Arsenal stadium, Harvey Nichols and The Goring Hotel, officers sought evidence. Signs of a relaxed demeanour were no proof of innocence: “Such behaviour, however, should not be taken as an indication (a) that his mind is at ease, or (b) that he is not on the look-out for followers. On the contrary he has used the corner of a street into which he was turning in such a way that it would not be difficult to spot a careless watcher: on a bus he has adopted the procedure of a clever agent – although it is impossible (as it should be) to say whether this (or the street corner manoeuvre) was deliberate or otherwise. For the present we are confident that our methods will combat such tactics – if indeed they are tactics, and in any case at the first sign of Peach becoming suspicious (the repetition of recognised spotting manoeuvres will be interpreted as such) we shall withdraw.”Harold “Kim” Philby, an Etonian, had become a committed communist as an undergraduate and was recruited by the Russian intelligence services in 1934. He joined the British intelligence service six years later, serving in Washington from 1949 until 1951, when he first came under suspicion, after the defections of Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.At the first sign of Peach [Philby’s codename] becoming suspicious (the repetition of recognised spotting manoeuvres will be interpreted as such) we shall withdrawMI5 surveillance reportPhilby, who later worked for theObserveras a Middle East correspondent, has been called the “Third Man” because he was suspected by both MI5 and the Americans of being the elusive double agent who had tipped off the two spies before they could be questioned, allowing them to flee to Moscow via France.Philby was, however, publicly cleared of complicity due to a lack of evidence, or perhaps because of a ­protective MI6 strategy.The new surveillance documents show Philby was being bugged and followed in this period. Ironic, since Philby’s own memoir, My Silent War, revealed that he himself had bugged many communist sympathisers on behalf of the British government.Philby drove a black cab that he had bought as a ­private vehicle.The “watchers” made fun of their target, describing his “weatherbeaten face” and “untidy hair”. They added in their notes: “He is inclined to grin when driving; this is almost certainly due to the fact that his vehicle is an ex-taxi and it might well be called a self-conscious or shame-faced smirk.“We have noticed this previously with drivers of similar ‘models’ at which small boys and their like are inclined to jeer.” They later note that he has no mirror, “in breach of law”, which makes tailing him easier. “With our radio-equipped cars behind him it is extremely unlikely that he will see us so long as he is at the wheel.”The five Cambridge spies – Philby, Burgess, Maclean, Anthony Blunt and John Cairncross – all passed information to the Soviet Union from key citadels of the British establishment.Under suspicion again from 1962, Philby finally fled to Moscow a year later, handing over a written confession to his old MI6 friend, Nicholas Elliott. He had been accused by Flora Solomon, a former girlfriend, who said he had once tried to recruit her.Solomon was prompted to speak out, she claimed, by what she saw as the anti-Israel stance of his ­articles in theObserver. This sealed the case against Philby, who had already been named by a Soviet defector, according to theSpycatcherauthor, Peter Wright.Philby spent 25 years in Moscow, instructing trainee spies in the techniques of “tradecraft”. When he died, in 1988, he received full KGB honours.The transcripts on display in Kew will include Philby’s admission that he had passed on information leading to the presumed execution in Russia of the potential defector Konstantin Volkov and his wife.Explore more on these topicsKim PhilbyThe ObserverEspionageMI5National ArchivesCold warUK security and counter-terrorismEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Three German citizens have been held for prolonged periods despite apparently having committed no crime nor any obvious violation of US visa or immigration rules – includingone US green card holderwho was detained at Boston’s Logan airport.US deportees face brutal conditions in El Salvador mega-prison: ‘Severe overcrowding, inadequate food’Read moreThe UK Foreign Office, too, has bolstered its advice to warn of a risk of arrest after Becky Burke, a tourist from Wales who had been backpacking across America, was stopped at the border with Canada andheld for three weeksin a detention facility. Last week members of the UK Subs, a British punk band,were denied entryand detained after they landed at Los Angeles international airport.Even before the most recent spate of detentions, forecast visits to the country this year had been revised downward from a projected 5% rise to a 9% decrease by Tourism Economics, an industry monitoring group, which cited “polarising Trump Administration policies and rhetoric”, particularly around tariffs.It predicted that the drop-off would lead to a $64bn shortfall in the US tourist trade.“There’s been a dramatic shift in our outlook,” said Adam Sacks, the president of Tourism Economics,told the Washington Post. “You’re looking at a much weaker economic engine than what otherwise would’ve been, not just because of tariffs, but the rhetoric and condescending tone around it.”The decline has been most pronounced from neighbouring Canada, which Trump has menaced with cripplingtariffsand repeatedly threatened toannexoutright.

The Danish foreign ministry advised travellers who use thegender designation “X” on their passportto contact the US embassy before travelling, while Finland cautioned travellers whose gender had changed that they might not gain entry.Members of British punk rock band UK Subs denied entry into the USRead moreThe recent episodes are all the more striking because they involve countries long allied to the US, although students and academicsfrom Indiaand the Middle East have also been detained in recent days despite holding valid visas. While visitors from many regions have long had difficulty entering the US, immigration officials have traditionally taken a more lenient stance towards travellers from allied nations.Pedro Rios, the director of the American Friends Service Committee, a non-profit group that aids migrants,told APthat it was unprecedented in the 22 years he had worked at the southern border for travellers from western Europe and Canada to be detained with such regularity.“It’s definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn’t make sense,” he said. “The only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsGermanyEuropeCanadanewsShareReuse this content"

He was once described by the former education ministerPap Ndiayeas “very close to the most radical far right”. Bolloré, in a senate hearing in 2022, denied political or ideological interventionism, saying his interest in acquiring media was purely financial and his cultural empire was about promoting French soft power. He said his group was so vast, it contained all views.But some independent booksellers say it is dangerous for democracy for one conglomerate to have such a huge influence on cultural output. Hachette Livre, which was part of the Lagardère group bought by Bolloré’s Vivendi in 2023, is the No 1 publisher and book distributor in France. It owns scores of publishing houses, producing the bestselling Asterix comic books, literary fiction, thrillers, political titles, Manga comics and school textbooks. The group also owns the Relay bookstores at French train stations. Hachette has more than 200 publishing imprints worldwide. It is the second biggest publishing conglomerate in the UK, where it owns Hodder & Stoughton, and is the third biggest in the US.As well as the moves by some booksellers, protest groups on the left have started a “bookmark rebellion”, where individuals hide bookmarks inside paperbacks in large commercial stores with messages such as “boycott Hachette”, detailing the scale of the Bolloré empire.View image in fullscreenHearts and reviews for books in Le Pied à Terre.Photograph: Ed Alcock/The GuardianThese bookmarks have regularly been placed inside the memoirs of the former UK prime ministerBoris Johnson, published in France by a Hachette imprint, and ofJordan Bardella, the young president of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally, whoseCe que je cherche(What I’m Looking For) has sold more than 150,000 copies, with the might of Bolloré’s publicity machine behind it.Willems acknowledged it was hard to rebel against a group that controlled such a large part of distribution. “We’d like to be able to stage a boycott,” he said. But this was impossible because of Hachette imprints’ vast back- catalogue, which includes key authors such as the punk feministVirginie Despentesand writers including Lola Lafon. “A boycott would be damaging for customers who want to read those writers. So we do what we can,” he said.This meant not ordering certain new books, or taking fewer copies and placing them away from prime positions on tables. Willems will also limit events for Hachette books, with one recent exception for a local novelist friend of the bookshop.View image in fullscreenA customer browses in Le Pied à Terre.Photograph: Ed Alcock/The GuardianWillems said customers had been interested to learn about Bolloré’s presence in publishing. “But it’s hard for people these days. They’re wary of what food to buy, what clothes to buy and now it’s what books they buy. It becomes exhausting.”In Lyon, Martin Beddeleem, from the independent bookshopLa Virevolte, said: “In the book world, we’ve been worried for some time about the concentration of ownership that runs from book editing to publishing and distribution.” In the current polarised political landscape in France, he felt that books could become “a weapon”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bookshop will host a public debate on the issue in June.Benoît Grange, from the climate protest collective Les Soulèvements de la Terre, part of the bookmark protest, said: “This is about informing readers. Around 700,000 bookmarks have been printed. People keep asking us for more so they can slide them into books in shops. It’s ongoing.”The French Nobel-winning novelistAnnie Ernauxsaid at the time of the Hachette takeover thatshe would refuseto be published by the group.This week, the representative body for staff at Hachette Livre,expressed concernsover what it called an editorial line close to the far right in Bolloré’s other print and TV media.Jean-Yves Mollier, a historian of French publishing and professor at the University of Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, said Bolloré’s expansion had added “an enormous publishing conglomerate” to a media empire. Mollier likened this to the expansion of the media mogulRupert Murdochinto book publishing in the US. “I think for freedom of expression, pluralism and democracy it can represent a risk,” he said.Hachette Livre was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsBooksFranceParisPublishingEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

There will not be a civil war, and Israel will remain a democratic state,” said Netanyahu.Shin Bet has said that it began its investigation into connections between officials in the prime minister’s office and the Qatari government in early February, before the release of the 7 October report. The investigation is looking into allegations that some members of the prime minister’s office, as well as other government agencies, took money to promote the interests of Qatar.Who is Ronen Bar, the sacked chief of Israel’s Shin Bet security service?Read moreThe decision to fire Bar has brought tens of thousands of Israelis to the streets, protesting against what they have said is an attack on the country’s democracy. Demonstrations have also been egged on by the government’s resumptions of airstrikes in the Gaza Strip this week, killing more than 590 people, including 200 children, and upending a two-month truce.Israel’s supreme court suspended Netanyahu’s decision to fire the domestic intelligence head, which will remain in place until a hearing is held, by 8 April at the latest. The country’s attorney general also said the prime minister cannot appoint a new Shin Bet director.Netanyahu, in a post on X, said it was his right to fire and appoint agency heads.“There will be no civil war! The state of Israel is a state of law, and according to the law, the government of Israel decides who will be the head of the Shin Bet,” Netanyahu said. He doubled down in his speech on Saturday, claiming that the government can dismiss the heads of security agencies.Netanyahu disputes court order freezing decision to fire Shin Bet chiefRead moreIsraeli opposition leader Yair Lapid called for a country-wide strike if Netanyahu does not abide by the high court’s decision, claiming doing so would cause the government to be “outside of the law”.“If that happens, the entire country should stop,” Lapid said to thousands of protesters in Tel Aviv.The opposition leader’s party condemned the sacking of the Shin Bet head, which it described as being motivated by a conflict of interest.Netanyahu is on trial in three separate corruption cases, which include charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust. Netanyahu was set to testify in his corruption trial on Tuesday, but the court cancelled the hearing after the Israeli military resumed its military operations in Gaza on the same day.Netanyahu has also sought the dismissal of the country’s attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, a longtime critic of his. The government is set to meet to begin dismissal procedures against her on Sunday.Demonstrators also protested against Israel’srenewed military operation in Gaza, demanding instead a deal to release the remaining hostages in Gaza. The ceasefire agreement had previously facilitated a hostage swap for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons, as well as the entry of sorely needed aid into Gaza.Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

LastTuesday Israeli warplanes, tanks, artillery, drones and ships launched a wave of strikes, shattering the increasingly fragile pause in hostilities that had brought respite to the devastated territory for nearly two months. The ceasefire had also brought hope which, Palestinians in Gaza said, made the return to violence that much more unbearable.In a video statement last Wednesday, Israel Katz, Israel’s defence minister, called on 2.3 million people inGazato “banish Hamas”, saying “the alternative is complete destruction and ruin”.Two days later, as air strikes continued and the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) seized a key strategic corridor that divides Gaza, Katz issued a new ultimatum, this time telling Hamas to give up the 59 hostages it is still holding or “lose more and more land that will be added to Israel”. He said that the IDF would use “all military and civilian pressure, including … implementing US President Trump’s voluntary migration plan for Gaza residents”.These last lines were important. A second phase of the ceasefire deal agreed in January was supposed to start three weeks ago and lead to an eventual definitive end to the war. A principal reason for Israel ditching this plan in favour of a 30- to 60-day truce with no such endpoint is that Israel’s most senior policymakers feel not just empowered but even inspired by the new incumbent of the Oval Office.The Israeli government has adopted Trump’s lexicon of internal enemies. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, last week railed againstthe leftist deep statethat supposedly opposes the will of the Israeli people.Trump’s loud proposal to displace the entire population in Gaza so it can be turned into the “Riviera of the Middle East” has made the previously unspoken desire of many increasingly influential actors in Israel into a project that can be publicly discussed – and even possibly realised in the relative short term.Katz’s threats echo Trump’s almost word for word. “To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD,”the US president posted earlier this month.Historians may well see the return of Trump to the White House as the inflection point in this current war.Its first phase began with the horrors of the October 2023 surprise attack, when 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed by Hamas militants who attacked communities in southern Israel. Hundreds, young and old, were gunned down in their homes or at a music festival. More than 250 were dragged back into Gaza as hostages.This phase then continued through the first months of the hugely destructive and lethal Israeli reaction. A relentless military offensive killed some 29,000 people within four months. Families were wiped out by single strikes on homes. A tight blockade imposed on Gaza by Israel meant growing shortages of everything from cooking oil to anaesthetics. A single truce lasted 10 days.A second phase of the war lasted almost a year, with periods of intense and deadly but often localised Israeli military operations. Gaza was plunged into an acute and protracted humanitarian crisis. There were marchers around the world but international outrage had only a marginal effect. Palestinians in the devastated territory survived as best they could, moving from ruined town to crowded tented camps and back to the rubble of their former homes in a desperate bid to avoid missiles, shells, shrapnel and starvation. There was no realistic plan for a “day after”, and few could envisage one.The pause in hostilities in mid-January, which initially led to a degree of hope, may now be seen as the relative calm before a brutal new phase of the conflict. The threats of Katz, Trump and Netanyahu suggest what is coming next.General Eyal Zamir, the new chief of staff of the IDF, has told Netanyahu that the only way to achieve Israel’s avowed war aims of destroying Hamas and returning the hostages in Gaza is through massive and completely unrestrained force involving large numbers of troops on the ground,say well-informed Israeli experts. This is what the prime minister and his cabinet, particularly those drawn from Israel’s surging far right, want to hear.It is also what some Israeli strategic analysts and military experts have been arguing since the start of the war. A year ago, those saying that a military administration of Gaza – with the IDF controlling aid supplies and the population– was inevitable were ignored. But that is not the case now.The plan to seize much of Gaza and “reorder its space in a more favourable way”, in the words of one Jerusalem-based expert who backs the military administration plan, also matches the thinking of the far right in Israel who see a chance now to at least partially empty Gaza of Palestinians. One way to do this is by making it unliveable and then finding some way to allow inhabitants to leave. There are military and political officials in Israel currently looking at ways of encouraging “legal immigration” – even if, given conditions in Gaza, any migration would almost certainly beillegal under international law.The wave of air strikes last Tuesday came in a brief 10-minute period just after 2am, and appear to have primarily targeted middle-ranking and some senior Hamas political and military officials, of whom many were at home asleep with their often large families. This explains, to some extent, the apparently high proportion of women and children among the 400 casualties. Israeli officials havespoken of striking 80 “terrorist” targets.Netanyahu described the wave of strikes as “just a beginning”. The Israeli prime minister has been guilty of speaking many untruths during this war. It is fair to assume this was not one of them.Explore more on these topicsGazaThe ObserverMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

But this will require a proper assessment of what the civil service will and won’t do in future.”A Cabinet Office source said: “To deliver our Plan for Change we will reshape the state so it is fit for the future. We cannot stick to business as usual.“By cutting administrative costs we can target resources at frontline services – with more teachers in classrooms, extra hospital appointments and police back on the beat.”On Wednesday, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is expected to unveil spending cuts in her spring statement as she seeks to balance the books after disappointing growth figures and higher than expected borrowing.More money has already been allocated to defence byreducing the aid budget, it was announced last month.Explore more on these topicsCivil serviceBudgetPat McFaddennewsShareReuse this content"

There will be above average temperatures for most parts of the UK topping 15C in London, 12C in Birmingham and 11C in Manchester.The Met Office said: “Heavy showers have developed across eastern parts of England this afternoon, with some hail and thunder mixed in. Heavy, thundery showers continue in parts of London and the East Midlands, with some areas seeing 10-15mm of rain in less than an hour.”The UK experienced itswarmest spring equinox day since 1972on Thursday with 21.3C recorded in Northolt, west London, and Chertsey, Surrey.Jonathan Vautrey, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “For this time in the year, it is rarer to have such intense storms. This is happening because we have had a lot of warm weather of late and temperatures are notably above average for the time of year.“We’ve had highs reaching over 20C over the last few days, and we were up to 18.5C as the high today as well, where we should be more around 10 or 11C.“That sort of heat that we’ve got around at the moment has really helped to spark off some of these thunderstorms, and a lot of moisture being drawn in with this sort of low-pressure system that’s been arriving across the UK.”Vautrey added that climate crisis is pushing temperature extremes to new levels. “We’re constantly seeing warmer temperatures at earlier points of the year compared to where they normally are.“These sort of intense summer storms are then increasingly going to happen at more points in the year because we’re getting those temperatures in there to really allow them to start developing.”Flood alerts from the Environment Agency remain in place for 20 parts of the country including Henley, Salisbury and Hertfordshire.The Met Office told travellers to “take care” as “there could be some localised flooding in places”.Explore more on these topicsUK weathernewsShareReuse this content"

The first of these was “putting more money in the pockets of ­working people”.But with many Labour MPs already deeply concerned over Reeves’s plan toraise about £5bn by cutting ­benefits, including for disabled ­people, evidence that living standards are on course to fall markedly under a Labour government – and to decline most for the least well off – will add to the mood of growing disquiet in party’s ranks.‘Does it score?’ How the OBR became the key arbiter of the Treasury’s sumsRead moreThe JRF analysis rests on a ­realistic assumption that theOffice for Budget Responsibility(OBR) will adjust its forecasts in line with the Bank of England and other main forecasters when it makes them public on Wednesday. The OBR is expected to halve the expected growth rate for this year from 2% to about 1%.In what it describes as a “dismal reality”, the JRF said its detailed analysis shows that the past year could mark a high point for living standards in this parliament. It concludes that the average family will be £1,400 worse off by 2030, representing a 3% fall in their disposable incomes. The lowest income families will be £900 a year worse off, amounting to a 6% fall in the amount they have to spend.The JRF also said that if living standards have not recovered by 2030, Starmer will not only have failed to pass his No 1 milestone but will also have presided over the first government since 1955 to have seen a fall in living standards across a full parliament.Comparing 2030 with 2025, it said the average mortgage holder is set to pay about £1,400 more in ­mortgage interest annually and the average renter about £300 more in rent a year, while average earnings are set to fall by £700 a year. The JRF said the poorest third are being disproportionately affected by rising housing costs, falling real earnings and frozen tax thresholds.Alfie Stirling, director of insight and policy at JRF, said further cuts were not the way to reverse the trend of falling living standards. Instead, he argued, Reeves should consider raising tax for the wealthiest.“There is no doubt the government is facing an unenviable list of economic pressures and uncertainties, ranging from the domestic to the international. But how you manage these risks is a matter of political choice..“It is wrong, and ultimately counterproductive, to try and rebuild the public finances through cuts to disability benefits. Instead, government should be addressing hardship and raising living standards directly, as part of their strategy for growth.“Fiscal pressures should be met through tax reform. There are a number of options to raise revenue from those with the broadest shoulders, while also supporting growth by removing perverse incentives in the tax system and staying within the government’s manifesto commitments.”Earlier last week a group of leading economists wrote to theFinancial Timeswarning that it would be a “profound mistake” for ministers to cut spending or investment, adding that “the UK cannot cut its way to growth”.Several areas of unprotected government spending such as prisons, justice and local government – the last of which has already seen real terms cuts of over 45% since 2010 – are likely to be in line for further cuts on Wednesday, casting doubt on Starmer’s claim that is not returning the country to austerity.In her budget last October, Reeves left herself with £9.9bn of “fiscal headroom” – in effect, spare money in reserve – to allow her to meet her fiscal rule that says day-to-day spending must be matched by revenue coming into the Treasury.But higher-than-expected borrowing costs on global markets, leading to higher debt interest payments, and lower than expected growth have wiped away that leeway, leaving her needing to find ways to restore the finances through raising money or cutting expenditure or both.Local government leaders are among those most anxiously awaiting Wednesday’s statement, which they fear could reduce what they receive and tip more councils into bankruptcy, leaving them all straining more to fund key services for the most vulnerable such as social care.Councillor Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association, said that “without adequate investment now, we risk not being able to deliver crucial services that so many depend upon and our desire to help government fulfil its ambitions for the future are severely hindered”.With ministers struggling to manage the economy, the latest Opinium poll for theObservershows the damage being done to Labour’s reputation from its economic stewardship after eight months in power.No single party leader is now trusted on the economy, Opinium found. However, Starmer (-32%) and Reeves (-38%) are the most distrusted, with the Reform leader, Nigel Farage, the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, and shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, all rated similarly on -22%, -23% and -24% respectively.While most voters say they do not trust any party on economic issues, the Tories are now marginally more favoured than Labour to run the economy and “improve your financial situation”.View image in fullscreenUK chancellor Rachel Reeves said the country is suffering from a shortage of engineers, bricklayers, carpenters and electricians.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PAMinisters will announce plans on Sunday to spend £600m on 60,000 more construction workers to help build more homes and revive economic growth.Reeves said: “We are determined to get Britain building again, that’s why we are taking on the blockers to build 1.5m new homes and rebuild our roads, rail and energy infrastructure.“But none of this is possible without the engineers, brickies, sparkies, and chippies to actually get the work done, which we are facing a massive shortage of.”“We’ve overhauled the planning system that is holding this country back, now we are gripping the lack of skilled construction workers, delivering on our plan for change to boost jobs and growth for working people.”A Treasury spokesperson said: “Real wages are rising at the highest level in six months, but this government inherited the worst living standards growth since ONS [Office for National Statistics] records began.“We are clear that getting more money in people’s pockets is the No 1 mission in our plan for change. Since the election, there have been three interest rate cuts, we have increased the national living wage by a record amount, the triple lock on pensions means that millions will see their state pension rise by up to £1,900 this parliament and working people’s payslips have been protected from high taxes.”Explore more on these topicsSpring statement 2025The ObserverRachel ReevesKeir StarmerLabourTax and spendingConsumer affairsOffice for Budget ResponsibilitynewsShareReuse this content"

The regulator Ofgem warned it would “not hesitate” to take action if there were any breaches of standards or licence obligations.Heathrow wasshut down on Fridayafter a blaze at a high-voltage substation in Hayes, west London, with more than 1,350 flights disrupted and an estimated 300,000 passengers facing travel chaos. Heathrow airport said it was “fully operational” on Saturday, although disruption to flights was expected to continue for a few days.Counter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan police have been leading the investigation into the cause of the fire. Police say that after an initial assessment, they are not treating the incident as suspicious.Miliband said: “The loss of power to theHeathrowarea has caused major disruption to thousands of people and many businesses. We are determined to properly understand what happened and what ­lessons need to be learned.“That is why, working with Ofgem, I have today commissioned the NationalEnergySystem Operator to carry out an investigation into this specific incident and to understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure, both now and in the future. The government is determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow.”Neso was launched as a public body in October, with responsibilty for the managing and planning of electricity and gas networks in England, Scotland and Wales.Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden is separately already leading a review of national resilience, which is due to report shortly. ANational Risk Registerpublished in January outlined the risk of attacks on the power network or critical failures.View image in fullscreenA deserted arrivals hall at Heathrow on Friday after the airport ground to a halt following a nearby fire.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APThomas Woldbye, chief executive of Heathrow airport, said this weekend that a review would examine how the impact on operations from any similar incident could be minimised in the future. He said yesterday he was “proud” of howHeathrow dealt with the incident, but he has been criticised for “complacent” public comments.“The situation was not created at Heathrow,” Woldbye told the BBC Radio 4Todayprogramme. “It was created outside the airport and we had to deal with the consequences. Of course, we look at what we can do better.” Woldbye said the airport is supplied by three power substations, but it was necessary to “restructure the supply” because of the fire.Experts have described the Heathrow shutdown as a “wake-up call” that raised questions about the resilience of power infrastructure supporting other critical sites.Lord Toby Harris, chair of the independent National Preparedness Commission, said: “I find it extraordinary that the airport has got itself into a position where one substation going out is sufficient to take out the whole airport.” He said the public comments coming from the airport team and Woldbye on the shutdown had been “rather complacent”.It emerged on Saturday that a consultancy report had warned in 2014 that a “key weakness” in the airport’s infrastructure was the “main transmission line connections”. The warning in the risk assessment study, reported by theFinancial Times, stated that “even a brief interruption to electricity supplies could have a long-lasting impact”.Hundreds of additional staff have been drafted in to help clear the passenger backlog, with the impact on travel arrangements expected to last for days. Farah Rafeeq, 24, who was due to fly to Cambodia with a friend on Friday for a wedding, said: “The last few hours have been nightmarish because it is one of our closest friend’s wedding and we have to travel for at least 20 hours to get there. We had to pay double the amount, between £600 and £700, for the new flight.”The transport secretary Heidi Alexander said: “Heathrow is a massive airport that uses the energy of a small city, so it’s imperative we identify how this power failure happened and learn from this to ensure a vital piece of national infrastructure remains strong.”Fintan Slye, chief executive of Neso, said: “Neso welcomes the government’s commission to review the power outage incident impacting Heathrow and surrounding areas. We will now work with all relevant stakeholders to understand the ­lessons that can be learned to improve the future resilience of Great Britain’s energy system.”Neso is expected to report its initial findings within six weeks.Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportThe ObserverAir transportTransportLabourEd MilibandHeathrowOfgemnewsShareReuse this content"

We are determined to properly understand what happened and what lessons need to be learned.“That is why working with Ofgem, I have today commissioned the National Energy System Operator to carry out an investigation into this specific incident and to understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure, both now and in the future.“The government is determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow. This review will be an important step in helping us to do so, as we deliver our plan for change.”Walsh said “this is yet another case of Heathrow letting down both travellers and airlines”.Speaking to the Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday, Heathrow’s chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, said that while “lessons needed to be learned” from the fire on Friday, most other airports also operated without a separate power plant.‘Colossal failure’: what the papers say about the Heathrow airport shutdownRead moreHe added: “Our systems are not designed to power the entire airport, [for that] we would need a separate standby power plant on the side and we don’t have that.“Heathrow uses as much energy as a city every single day so we don’t have backup power for baggage systems, fuel systems, things like air bridges and so on.“So whereas the safety systems are working and we can get aircraft in and out most of the airport infrastructure comes to a standstill when we need to reset as we did yesterday. That’s how most airports operate.“We are going to, of course, look at what we can learn from this incident but the incident yesterday was a major one, it was not a small thing.”A National Grid spokesperson said the company was “continuing to work closely with the government, Heathrow and the police to understand the cause of the incident”.“Since this unprecedented fire broke out at our North Hyde substation late on Thursday night, our teams have worked tirelessly and in close collaboration with the fire brigade and police to get the situation back under control,” the statement added.It also said the National Grid was “deeply sorry” for the disruption caused, while reiterating that “power supplies have been restored to all customers, including Heathrow, allowing operations to resume at the airport”.British Airways, one of Heathrow’s biggest airlines,said it expected to operate about 85% of its scheduled flightsat the airport on Saturday but huge delays were still expected.The airline would usually expect to run nearly 600 departures and arrivals on a Saturday but it is understood cancellations will be made, where possible, to high-frequency routes.Virgin Atlantic issued a statement on Saturday apologising for the disruption and said it planned to run a “near full schedule with limited cancellations today”.The airline said Heathrow’s closure on Friday had left an “impact on today’s flying programme”, including the repositioning of aircraft and crews.Air India announced its operations to and from Heathrow had started again.“Today’s flight AI111 was on schedule and other flights, to and from London, are expected to operate as per schedule,” it said in a statement.Meanwhile, flight AI161 – which diverted to Frankfurt – “is expected to leave Frankfurt at 14:05 pm local time”, the airline said.Downing Street said there were “questions to answer” about the fire, with counter-terrorism police leading the investigation into the incident that left Britain’s biggest airport unable to function.Two people familiar with the investigation said officials did not believe the fire was the result of any criminal activity or an act of sabotage by a hostile state, and was more likely to be accidental.Police confirmed on Friday evening that the fire was not thought to be suspicious.Asked about an inquiry and whether National Grid had questions to answer, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “There are questions to answer on how this has happened and what can be done to prevent the scale of disruption we’ve seen from happening again, once the situation is under control.”Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportHeathrowHeathrow Airports AuthorityAir transportTransportTravel & leisureWillie WalshnewsShareReuse this content"

A message seeking comment was left for a lawyer representing Liebb and the other traveler, Jacob Sebbag.In the lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, Liebb said he had been in the bathroom in the back of the plane for about 20 minutes on 28 January when a flight attendant woke Sebbag from a nap and asked Sebbag to check on him.Liebb said he explained his gastrointestinal predicament and assured Sebbag that he would be out soon. Sebbag then relayed that to the flight attendant, the lawsuit says.About 10 minutes later, with Liebb still indisposed, the pilot approached Sebbag and asked him to check on Liebb, the lawsuit says. The pilot then yelled at Liebb to leave the bathroom immediately, the lawsuit says.Liebb said he told the pilot that he was finishing up and would be out momentarily.The pilot responded by breaking the lock, forcing the bathroom door open and pulling Liebb out with his pants still around his ankles, exposing his genitalia to Sebbag, flight attendants and nearby passengers,according tothe lawsuit.“The pilot became visibly enraged, broke the lock on the door and forced the door to the bathroom open, pulling Liebb out of the bathroom with his pants still around his ankles, exposing his genitalia to Sebbag, several flight attendants, and the nearby passengers on the plane,” the lawsuit said.It added that Lieb said he felt “sexually violated and embarrassed after having been publicly exposed in the nude”.“With Sebbag leading Liebb, the pilot proceeded to repeatedly push the [two] back to their seats while making threats of getting [them] arrested and making scathing remarks about their Judaism, and how ‘Jews act’,” the lawsuit continued.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are homeland. You have no rights here.”The men said United booked them on a flight to New York City the next day for free, but any savings from the complementary tickets were lost because they had to pay for an overnight hotel stay and food during their delay.The two men said that the handcuffs caused “severe wrist pain” that “persisted for days afterwards”.Maya Yang contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsUS newsUnited AirlinesAirline industryHoustonTexasnewsShareReuse this content"

There were approximately 200 people at the park when the shooting occurred.Those killed included two 19-year-old men and one 16-year-old boy. Police have not yet released the names of those killed and others who were injured but said that the victims were between 16 and 36 years old.In a press conference on Saturday, police said that seven people who were injured had been sent from local hospitals to El Paso for further treatment. Four others have been treated and released, and police are still waiting on updates from local hospitals on the remaining four patients.No arrests have been made but police are following “multiple leads”, officialssaid, adding that “this is a huge crime scene with a lot of moving parts”.In a statement on Facebook on Saturday, the Las Cruces police department issued a public request for videos from the Young Park shooting, particularly “video that shows the shooting or subjects with firearms, to submit the video so investigators can analyze it and help develop a better understanding of the incident”.Police added that casings had been located “throughout the park and parking lot” and that “all the casings located so far are handgun caliber casings”.One witness, 20-year-old Angel Legaspy, whose parked car was struck by bullets,toldthe New York Times: “They just started shooting and they just started running around everybody,” adding that the shooting was “like all over the place”.On Saturday morning, Johana Bencomo, a Las Cruces city councilor and the mayor pro temp,wroteon Instagram: “Part of me wanted to write that this is something you never really think this is going to happen in your city but that actually feels deeply untrue. Honestly [nowadays] a tragedy like this feels like a nightmare just waiting to come true at any possible moment, yet also always praying and hoping it never will.“As with all acts of gun violence in our city and beyond, my heart is broken for the victims and families impacted. This was a heinous act of violence that will leave our city mourning,” she added.New Mexico’s governor, Michelle Grisham, has alsoissueda statement, saying: “The indiscriminate nature of this shooting is both shocking and unacceptable, but sadly not surprising. This violence tears at the fabric of our communities and leaves wounds that may never heal.”“I am mobilizing state resources to support local law enforcement in their investigation. If you have any information, particularly video or images that could help identify those responsible, please come forward and contact the Las Cruces police department immediately,” she added.The Guardian has reached out to city officials for comment.Explore more on these topicsNew MexicoGun crimeUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

In 2023, 56% of unaccompanied minors in immigration courts were represented by counsel, according to the Department of Justice.In aWhite House memoto the justice department posted on Saturday, the executive branch identified the immigration system as one of several legal areas “where rampant fraud and meritless claims have supplanted the constitutional and lawful bases upon which the President exercises core powers”.“The immigration bar, and powerful Big Law pro bono practices, frequently coach clients to conceal their past or lie about their circumstances when asserting their asylum claims, all in an attempt to circumvent immigration policies enacted to protect our national security and deceive the immigration authorities and courts into granting them undeserved relief,” the White House said.The memo directed the attorney general, Pam Bondi, and the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, “to prioritize enforcement of their respective regulations governing attorney conduct and discipline”.Lawyers for Civil Rights, a legal advocacy group currently suing the administration over deportations, called Trump’s sanctions threat hypocritical in a statement to Reuters, saying the president and his allies “have repeatedly thumbed their noses at the rule of law”.The move to cut funding for legal representation was immediately denounced by immigrant legal and welfare groups.“The US government is violating legal protections for immigrant children and forcing them to fight their immigration cases alone,” said Roxana Avila-Cimpeanu, deputy director of the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project.“Already, we are seeing the government move for the expedited removal of unrepresented children. These services are critical not only as a matter of fundamental fairness – children should not be asked to stand up in court alone against a trained government attorney – but also for protecting children from trafficking, abuse and exploitation, and for helping immigration courts run more efficiently.”Lindsay Toczylowski, president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), said the Trump administration had gone “all-in today on endangering unaccompanied children and interfering with their right to due process, breaking with decades of bipartisan congressional support for legal services for vulnerable children”.Toczylowski added that without representation, “the 26,000 children whose access to counsel was slashed today will be at higher risk of exploitation and trafficking and their chances of obtaining legal protection will plummet. No child should be forced to fend for themselves against a trained [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] attorney without a lawyer by their side.”A study published by Save theChildrenin December found that record numbers of unaccompanied minors have come into the US since 2021.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They all will no longer have access to classified information – a courtesy typically offered to former presidents and some officials after they have left public service.“I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,” Trump wrote. He said he would also “direct all executive department and agency heads to revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities from these individuals”.Earlier this month, the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, announced that she had revoked the clearances and blocked several of the people named in Trump’s memo, along with “the 51 signers of theHunter Bidendisinformation letter” – referring to former intelligence agency officials who asserted that the notorious Hunter Biden laptop, which was discovered before the 2020 election, was likely a Russian disinformation campaign.Trump’s decision to remove Biden from intelligence briefings is a counterstrike against his Democrat political opponent, who had banned Trump from accessing classified documents in 2021, saying the then ex-president could not be trusted because of his “erratic behavior”.Earlier this week, Trump announced he was pulling Secret Service protections for Biden’s children, Hunter and Ashley, “effective immediately”, after it was claimed that 18 agents had been assigned to the former president’s son for a trip to South Africa and 13 to daughter Ashley.More broadly, the security-clearance revocations issued on Friday appear to correlate with a cherrypicked list of the president’s political enemies, including the New York attorney general,Letitia James, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, both of whom prosecuted Trump during the Biden era.Others on the list include Fiona Hill, a foreign policy expert who testified against Trump during his first impeachment about her boss’s alleged scheme to withhold military aid to Ukraine as a way of pressuring its president to investigate the Bidens; Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who also testified at the hearings; and Norman Eisen, a lawyer who oversaw that impeachment.Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger,Republicanswho served on the committee investigating the January 6 US Capitol riots, were also added to the list. Trump said the information ban “includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President’s daily brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the intelligence community”.The move comes asNBC News reportedthat former president Biden and and his wife, Jill Biden, had volunteered to help fundraise for and help to rebuild the Democratic party after the stinging defeat of Biden’s nominated successor, Kamala Harris, in November.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was for an “AI-assisted sports reporter” at USA Today’s publisher, Gannett. It was billed as a role at the “forefront of a new era in journalism”, but came with a caveat: “This is not a beat-reporting position and does not require travel or face-to-face interviews.” The dark humour was summed up by football commentator, Gary Taphouse: “It was fun while it lasted.”As the relentless march of artificial intelligence continues, newsrooms are wrestling with the threats and opportunities the technology creates. Just in the past few weeks, one media outlet’s AI project was accused of softening the image of the Ku Klux Klan. AI is also playing a part in some British journalists recording more than 100 bylines in a day. Amid the angst over the technology, however, a broad consensus is beginning to emerge about what the technology is currently capable of doing accurately.Yet media companies are already aware of an elephant in the room. Their calculations could be upended should users simply turn to AI assistants to get their content fix. “I think good quality information can rise in an age of AI,” said one UK media executive. “But we need to set the terms in the right way in the next couple of years, or we are all screwed.”The speed at which the technology has arrived has brought some early case studies in journalistic misadventure. In early March, the LA Times launched an AI tool giving alternative perspectives on opinion pieces. Itcaused alarmby saying some local historians regarded the Ku Klux Klan as a “‘white Protestant culture’ responding to societal changes rather than an explicitly hate-driven movement, minimising its ideological threat”. The pitfall, said one media executive looking at AI, was obvious: “It was given a task of making judgments it can’t possibly be expected to make.”The fact that even a tech giant like Apple had tosuspend a featurethat made inaccurate summaries of BBC News headlines shows just how hard it can be to ensure the accuracy of generative AI.In reality, teams of journalists and tech tool designers have been working for years to find the best AI uses. In terms of public content, publishers are clustering around using it to suggest small chunks of text, based on original journalism. In practice, that means headline suggestions and story summaries, easily checked by human editors. The Independent became the latest to announce this week that it would be publishing condensed AI versions of its own stories. Many publishers are trialling or have already deployed similar tools.View image in fullscreenThe Make It Fair campaign was developed to raise awareness among the British public about the existential threat posed to the creative industries from generative AI models.Photograph: Geoffrey Swaine/Rex/ShutterstockSome big organisations have also been experimenting with their own AI chatbots, allowing readers to ask questions using content from their own archives. The problem is that editors cannot possibly know the answers being spat out. Attached to the Washington Post’s chatbot feature is the note: “This is an experiment … Because AI can make mistakes, please verify the response by consulting these articles.”The amount of AI-assisted text that can be safely overseen by human editors is a live issue. Reach, publisher of the Daily Mirror and a series of other local sites, has been using its Guten tool to repackage its own journalism for different audiences. It has contributed to some eye-wateringly high byline counts for some journalists. On one day in January, one regional Reach reporter recorded 150 bylines or joint bylines across the group’s titles. While he did not use Guten himself, the technology was used to repurpose his work for other sites.Some Reach journalists have privately expressed concern. A Reach spokesperson said Guten was only a tool and “needs to be used thoughtfully” by journalists. “We’re encouraged by the progress we’ve made in reducing errors and supporting our everyday work,” they said. “This has enabled us to free-up journalists to spend more time on journalism which would otherwise go unreported.”USA Today Network made the same point about its AI-assisted sports reporter post. “By leveraging AI, we are able to expand coverage and enable our journalists to focus on more in-depth sports reporting,” said a spokesperson.Others doubt whether the time saved will go into original journalism. The former Independent editor Chris Blackhurst said recently he was “very cynical” about the idea, fearing it was more likely to be“freeing people up to work elsewhere”.While publicly visible AI-assisted journalism has created the most debate, it is actually inside newsrooms that the technology is providing gains, interrogating huge datasets. The FT, the New York Times and the Guardian are among the groups exploring the technique. It has already helped find severe cases of neglect from more than1,000 pages of hospital documents in Norway. Transcription and translation are other more everyday uses.Others are using it for “social listening”. The News Movement, which aims content at a younger audience, has built a tool that monitors what its audience are talking about on social media and feeds it back to journalists. “It helps us understand what conversations and topics people are currently having,” said Dion Bailey, its chief product and technology officer. Despite the angst about AI errors, some companies, such as Der Spiegel, are actually trying to use AI to factcheck content.What is coming next? According to academic research, it is “audience-facing format transformations”. In other words, taking a story and turning it into the kind of content that a user wants – be it condensed, audio or even video. About a third of media leaders surveyed by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism said they wanted to experiment with turning text stories into video. Tools can already turn long footage into short, shareable content.Yet hanging over all this newsroom innovation is the fear that it could all be for nought if personal AI chatbots take the place of media companies in producing content. “What keeps me up at night is AI simply inserting itself between us and the user,” said one media figure. Google’s launch this month of a new “AI Mode”, which takes information from multiple sources and presents them as a chatbot, has spooked the industry. Some believe government intervention is the only solution.Some bigger media groups have been signing licensing deals with the owners of the main AI model owners, allowing the models to be trained on their original material with attribution. The Guardian has sucha deal with OpenAI, owner of ChatGPT. Meanwhile, the New York Times is leading a lawsuitagainst OpenAI for using its work.Bailey shares the concerns, but retains hope that the media world can adapt. “If the power goes to two or three big tech companies, then we have some real, significant issues,” he said. “We need to adapt in terms of how people are able to get to us. That’s just a fact.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)NewspapersNewspapers & magazinesNews agenciesInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

They had exchanged tens of thousands of text messages since 2019, revealing that Terry evidently believed she had cancer, with Sundwall sharing how she would kill herself if she were in Terry’s position, court documents alleged.Police said the pair also texted about Sundwall’s having money problems and how they would be solved by receiving money from Terry’s life insurance policy, which investigators portrayed as “rumored”.Sundwall even allegedly offered to help Terry die – which she did, in August.Investigators became suspicious of Sundwall after Terry’s uncle called first responders to Terry’s home for a medical emergency. Terry’s uncle told police he found her unresponsive in her bedroom in the community of Highland, as Utah’s Deseret Newsreported.Sundwall, who was in the room and reportedly said she had been the only other person there that day, claimed Terry had been unconscious and unable to breathe “for a couple of hours” – and, having a do-not-resuscitate order, would not have wanted to go to the hospital.First responders took note of a diabetic needle at the scene and took Terry – who was not diagnosed with diabetes – to a local hospital. Doctors determined that her blood sugar level was 14, or well below the life-threatening figure of 40, as KUTV noted.Medical staff pronounced Terry dead three days later, leading to an autopsy that determined she had neither had cancer nor other health issues. Terry had died from an overdose of the allergy medication promethazine, what was probably insulin – which treats diabetes – administered to her from outside her body, and other drugs, the medical examiner in charge of the autopsy concluded.Police said they interviewed a forensic pathologist who said administering insulin to a person was the only way to get a blood sugar level as low as the one Terry had, according to the Deseret News.Terry had also never prepared a do-not-resuscitate order, and she had not ever given Sundwall power to make medical decisions on her behalf, said the court documents cited by the Utah news stationsKUTVandKTVX.Police said they later found evidence that Sundwall had pursued information about Terry’s life insurance after her death while also deleting more than 900 texts from her phone in an apparent attempt to mislead investigators.Nonetheless, police said they discovered a text from Sundwall to Terry earlier on the day she had been hospitalized asking: “Do you want to take some promethazine when I get there so that you are asleep when this is happening?” They also said they had evidence establishing that Sundwall had been seeking to persuade Terry to “end her suffering” with a fatal dose of insulin, as the Deseret News reported.Court documents reportedly do not elaborate on why Terry believed she had cancer.Police charged Sundwall with Terry’s murder on Thursday. Court records show she was ordered held without bail pending a pretrial hearing.In Utah, first-degree felony aggravated murder could carry between 25 years and life in prison.Prosecutors also have the option of pursuing the death penalty against anyone charged with that crime in particular. But, in Sundwall’s case, prosecutors had not immediately said whether they were considering doing so.Sundwall has had a nursing license since at least 2007, Utah state records show. Records do not list disciplinary actions against her and show she graduated with an associate’s degree from Utah Valley State in 2006.Terry’sobituarysays her survivors include her sister, her brother-in-law and their children. It describes Terry as someone who enjoyed the outdoors, hunting and camping. She had no children, but she loved babysitting, “filled the role of mom to many kids” and hoped to one day “have her own family”, the obituary said.The obituary said Terry landed a job helping adults with disabilities after she was introduced to a company named Chrysalis. Her declining health left her “unable to work like she had in the past, but she was able to find great comfort from the companionship of her dog Bella”, according to the obituary.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeUtahnewsShareReuse this content"

Many start on social media, but other consumers havesaidthey made the decision to move away from companies on their own.Some groups have coordinated boycotts within their communities in recent weeks, particularly in response to companies like Target,Amazonand Walmart rolling back DEI measures. Target, for example, ended hiring goals for marginalized groups,while Walmart said it will no longer prioritize finding suppliers that are women- or minority-owned companies.Some Americans feel companies are giving up core moral values in bowing to the president.The Rev Jamal Bryant, a pastor based in Baltimore with a large social media following, called on his followers togive upspending money at Target for Lent, which started on 5 March and lasts until 17 April.“These rollbacks represent more than just corporate decisions; they reflect a deeper erosion of the moral and ethical commitment necessary to build a just society,” Bryant wrote on the website he made for the boycott,targetfast.org. “This Lent, we will begin a corporate fast, starting with Target, as a spiritual act of resistance.”Hispanic activists have similarly called on their community to boycott companies, calling it the Latino Freeze Movement. Themovementcalls for a boycott on companies that have scaled back their DEI initiatives, and asks for participants to not spend money on non-essentials “until they show us that they care about our minority and immigrant populations”.Last month, a Harris pollfoundthat 31% of Americans have reported similar goals to “opt out” of the economy this year in light of the changing political climate.The companies have said that they are responding to a changing legal environment around DEI. DEI has been a flashpoint in the culture wars for years, with conservatives arguing that it unfairly discriminates against groups that have historically been in the majority, like white Americans.On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to abolish DEI, and he signed multipleexecutive ordersending DEI programs within the federal government as soon as he came into office. The impact that the administration can have on efforts in the private sector is still unclear, but some companies appear willing to risk losing customers instead of taking their chances.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationConsumer spendingTeslaAmazonUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A message seeking comment was left for a lawyer representing Liebb and the other traveler, Jacob Sebbag.In the lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, Liebb said he had been in the bathroom in the back of the plane for about 20 minutes on 28 January when a flight attendant woke Sebbag from a nap and asked Sebbag to check on him.Liebb said he explained his gastrointestinal predicament and assured Sebbag that he would be out soon. Sebbag then relayed that to the flight attendant, the lawsuit says.About 10 minutes later, with Liebb still indisposed, the pilot approached Sebbag and asked him to check on Liebb, the lawsuit says. The pilot then yelled at Liebb to leave the bathroom immediately, the lawsuit says.Liebb said he told the pilot that he was finishing up and would be out momentarily.The pilot responded by breaking the lock, forcing the bathroom door open and pulling Liebb out with his pants still around his ankles, exposing his genitalia to Sebbag, flight attendants and nearby passengers,according tothe lawsuit.“The pilot became visibly enraged, broke the lock on the door and forced the door to the bathroom open, pulling Liebb out of the bathroom with his pants still around his ankles, exposing his genitalia to Sebbag, several flight attendants, and the nearby passengers on the plane,” the lawsuit said.It added that Lieb said he felt “sexually violated and embarrassed after having been publicly exposed in the nude”.“With Sebbag leading Liebb, the pilot proceeded to repeatedly push the [two] back to their seats while making threats of getting [them] arrested and making scathing remarks about their Judaism, and how ‘Jews act’,” the lawsuit continued.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Should you buy some?Adam GabbattAs Trump escalates a global trade war, looking to gold to shield cash might not be the worst optionSat 22 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 07.02 EDTShareAs economic uncertainty roils the US, the price ofgoldhas roared to record highs amid investors seeking a place to shield their cash fromDonald Trump’s scattergun trade wars.A single ounce of goldcost $3,051.99on Wednesday, compared with $2,160 in 2024, and gold has historically been seen as the safest place to invest in financially turbulent times.But the buying, and potentially hoarding, of gold need not be restricted to the Scrooge McDucks of this world. In 2025, gold can be bought from Walmart and Amazon – although experts say more established gold dealers are a better source.Once a person has bought the gold, they can do whatever they like with it: there are whole Reddit threads devoted to the best way to bury gold underground. (Dig a deep hole, dump your vacuum-sealed gold in the hole, put a layer of rocks on top of the gold so it can’t be discovered by a thief with a metal detector, then try not to forget where the gold is buried.)Americans increasingly worried about tariffs despite Trump’s assurances, new poll showsRead moreExperts suggestnotburying the gold, however.“Gold is one of the few elements on the periodic table that does not decay or oxidize over time, so there’s no need to worry about deterioration,” said Alex Deluce, the host of theGoldTelegraph Show, and an expert in gold investment.“However, for safekeeping, store it in a secure location, ideally in a safety deposit box or a well-protected home safe. Keep it away from direct sunlight and heat sources to maintain its condition and security.”Deluce said gold should be purchased “from reputable suppliers who insure all deliveries”, and financial magazines including Forbes have lists devoted to gold-selling companies.To the uninitiated, an equally important question is: what kind of gold should people buy?Taylor Kenney, an economic journalist who works for ITM Trading, a gold and silver dealer based in Arizona, said most gold purchases are of bullion: gold that has been refined and shaped into coins or bars.Some of those bars are the big heavy type that is frequently stolen from banks in heist movies, but those tend to be very heavy, which means they are very expensive. Instead, many gold purchasers will be buying much smaller bars.A handy example was seen in the recent case of Bob Menendez, the now former Democratic senator who in January wassentenced to 11 years in prisonfor receiving bribes.Photosshared by the FBIshowed that Menendez had an amazing a hoard of gold bullion in a variety of sizes: he had a couple of gold bars that weighed just one ounce.According to the United States Gold Bureau – which is not a government body, but instead a cleverly named private gold-trading company – the one-ounce bars are themost commonly tradedaround the world. Roughly the size of a US military dog tag, one-ounce barswere listedat Walmart for $3,122.10 on Friday, although anyone who has ever ordered and never received a table lamp from Walmart might want to try elsewhere.Menendez had also accumulated, through nefarious means,some one-kilo gold bars, each of which, at today’s prices, is worth just under $100,000.“Now is the perfect time to buy gold,” said Kenney.She said gold prices are rising “in response to inflation, geopolitical unrest and economic uncertainty”.Kenney added: “As dollar dominance is called into question, gold carries no counterparty risk and serves as a true store of wealth, unlike fiat currencies [such as the US dollar] that can be printed at will. The same reason central banks are buying gold is the same reason that average citizens should be buying gold as well.”Is Trump driving the US into a recession? – in chartsRead moreGina Miller, the founder ofMoneyshe.com, is less convinced. She told CityAM that while gold has traditionally been viewed as a safe investment, “its track record reveals significant limitations as a long-term investment”.“For instance, while gold surged 148% from October 2008 to August 2011, it took nearly nine years, until July 2020, to reach new highs. Such prolonged stagnation makes it unappealing for investors seeking steady, long-term growth,” Miller said.With gold at record-high prices, it is unlikely that people will be able to buy the metal and flip it for quick returns. Instead,experts say, people should see gold as a small part of an investment portfolio, rather than pumping all their money into it and putting it in a big vault.As Trump shows no signs of backing down on his trade battles, having a few dog tags of gold stored in a safe space, or, if you’re Menendez, “jammed into jackets and boots”, might not be the worst option.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGoldTrump tariffsTrump administrationCommoditiesUS politicsUS economyanalysisShareReuse this content"

But a new book, The Pacific Circuit, argues that Oakland should be viewed as one of the centers of global change in the past century, serving both as a key node in the new global economy built around trans-Pacific trade, and as one of the “sacrifice zones” this economy requires.Far from being an outlier, US journalist Alexis Madrigal argues,Oaklandis in fact an early adopter of the technological and economic changes now tearing through cities across the US, and around the world. Oakland has long been the canary in Silicon Valley’s coalmine of disruption, the book suggests. But its residents don’t suffer passively: they organize and learn how to fight back.View image in fullscreenMargaret Gordon at the Oakland army base at the Port of Oakland, on 20 June 2015.Photograph: Will Whipple/GuardianThrough the life story of Margaret Gordon, a 78-year-old Black environmental justice activist in West Oakland, Madrigal charts the personal repercussions of major technological and economic developments of the 20th and early 21st centuries, from real estate redlining, to container shipping, to mortgage-backed securities and the 2008 financial crisis.We spoke with Madrigal, a contributing writer for The Atlantic and the co-host of KQED Forum, a Bay Area radio show, this week. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.You live in Oakland, and you’ve been working on this book for nearly a decade. What are the questions you started with?When people come to Oakland, you see all the containers, and you see all the trucks and cranes and ships, and then, as you move into the city, you see there’s this neighborhood attached to the port, and you see it is clearly struggling with environmental and other problems. What is the relationship between these two things? What does being a port city do to the rest of the city? I ended up going all over the place to track down the answers.View image in fullscreenThe Pacific Circuit: A Globalized Account of the Battle for the Soul of an American City, by Alexis Madrigal.Photograph: Courtesy of Alexis MadrigalYour book focuses on what was once the majority-Black neighborhood of West Oakland, and particularly on Seventh Street. Situate us: what does that look like?Seventh Street used to be this thriving commercial Black corridor in the 1930s and 40s. In the 50s, “urban renewal” was done to it, which meant a lot of bulldozing, for a massive post office facility. An overhead train was run through the center of the street, and the commercial corridor kind of collapsed.Today, Seventh Street is quite a wide, empty street that runs from downtown Oakland out to the port. There are very few thriving businesses there, and many things are in disrepair, and all around there are still community builders, and people trying to make this neighborhood good.Margaret Gordon, one of the central figures of the book, is one of those local residents fighting to make the neighborhood a safer place. She’s one of the founders of the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, and was honored by the Obama White House as a “champion of change” for her work to improve West Oakland’s air quality. Gordoncalled this book “a family affair”because of how closely the two of you worked together. How did her life become the main thread of the story?It’s because Ms Margaret knows everybody – that’s the alternate title of the book. Everyone from Lisa Jackson, the vice-president of environment, policy and social initiatives at Apple, to people on the street. She and her life represent a really crucial movement and change in the Bay Area, which was lots of Black people migrating here during WWII. She was born in war housing here in 1946.View image in fullscreenThe Southern Pacific Railroad wharf and pier on Seventh Street in Oakland, circa 1919.Photograph: Library of Congress Prints and Photographs DivisionThere’s a standard history of Oakland, starting with the arrival of the city’s Black population as part of the Great Migration fromsouthern states, followed by “urban renewal” in the 1950s that bulldozed and dislocated Black communities, the crack epidemic and the war on drugs, and then gentrification and more displacement. In writing The Pacific Circuit, what are you trying to add to this narrative?There’s a very deep and important urban history about the policies that structured Oakland and many other cities: segregation and redlining. I wanted to connect that with the big economic changes that were occurring over the same period, including containerization – the development of container shipping, and a network of shipping connecting Asian manufacturers and American consumers. Oakland is the first big container port in the western United States, connecting to Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam.There’s a second component to building these new transportation networks: you need all of the information technology to control these supply chains – you need the products of Silicon Valley.And, as the third component, you need this sacrificial environmental landscape through which to scale global trade. What that means on the ground: you need hundreds of coastal acres on which to put containers, and you need a neighborhood that’s marginalized enough that you can run thousands of diesel trucks through it every single day, polluting the air and creating all this noise pollution. I wanted people to know that Silicon Valley and the growth of global shipping are directly connected to the problems people are having in West Oakland.View image in fullscreenShipping containers being unloaded at the Port of Oakland, on 28 October 2021.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersIn researching this book, you found that Oakland’s Black radical thinkers, including Huey P Newton and other Black Pantherparty leaders, were very attuned to the importance of Oakland becoming a global port city, and the implications of what we might now call “globalization”. How did Newton make sense of this?In the early 1970s, Huey Newton is looking down at the port of Oakland from his penthouse apartment, and he writes this essay, The Technology Question. He saw that the development of global supply chains was incredibly powerful and difficult to stop, and that it had really important ethical and political implications. Newton and the Panthers were hoping to build “revolutionary intercommunalism”, where sub-national units in different nations, people who found themselves in the same relation to the American imperial power, would join up together. And the first node would be the city of Oakland.You learned that the Black Pantherparty leaders actually had this plan at the time to gain power in Oakland, and to strategically use Oakland’s port as part of the global battle for Black liberation. Do you think a lot about that alternate history?They didn’t ever win the city government. And it might not have worked. But there was a possibility of having an enduring base of power. What happened instead is the slow deflation of the 1970s, and then the boom of the crack era.View image in fullscreenSupporters of the Black Panther leader Huey Newton rally in Oakland, California, in 1970.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveYou’ve described this book as attempting to be a shadow history of the working people of Silicon Valley. What do you mean by that?There’s a lot of different ways to tell Silicon Valley’s story, and I think a lot has been left out. There’s an enormous labor force that’s put into place to do the assembly and eventually manufacture the electronics that make Silicon Valley into Silicon Valley. And that is absolutely inseparable from Asian manufacturing, and the women who work in those countries. When this work happens in California, many of the people working in those factories are also immigrant women. You have these two groups of women, across the ocean from each other, who are basically the equivalent of the auto workers in Detroit. These are the people who built Silicon Valley – all these workers, largely Asian women. And they’ve been completely written out of the story.Your book chronicles the many ways that technological innovation can devastate people and communities. But it also contains an unexpected number of victories, including several wins for the west coast longshoremen who used to unload ships by hand.One of the core premises of the book is that this system of Pacific shipping has these choke points, and the No 1 is the port. In 1934, there’s a massive strike in San Francisco by the longshoremen, and it’s essentially a total win. They get a hiring hall, and all of these changes to the consistency and the quality of the work that they do. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union is able to unionize as a racially integrated, leftwing union across the ports of the west coast. I have found that group to be totally fascinating, both because they did allow the forces of modernization to the waterfront, and they have maintained pretty substantial strength as a union throughout, though much smaller than they were in their heyday.What does the ILWU do in the face of the rise of container shipping, which drastically reduced the number of human workers needed to load and unload cargo?ILWU leader Harry Bridges does a deal, and, as they put it, “they get a share of the machine”. For each ton that was shipped, some money was put into the union, and they agree to shrink the union over time. It remains a very controversial decision.You write a lot about the vanished world of the dockworkers, what their jobs and theirlives were like before containerization essentially ended this way of work. Looking back, how do you evaluate it?I’ve spent a lot of time talking to these guys. Many of them are still alive. The job used to be brutal, physically demanding, and it left you broken. On the other side, you had friends, it was human – it was fun, in a lot of ways, not every day, but often. And there was this unbroken connection to the culture of the longshoremen: the bullshitting, drinking, hanging-out culture of the dockworkers. Now that dockworking is heavily mechanized, I don’t think most people would call it fun anymore, but it is also less damaging to your body, much safer, in most ways.View image in fullscreenCivil defense volunteers on a turret that could direct 10,000 gallons a minute, at the Port of Oakland on 29 March 1953.Photograph: MediaNews Group/East Bay Times/Getty ImagesWhat are some of the other unexpected wins that Oakland residents have made as they struggle against some pretty big systemic problems?The latest fight has been over a coal export terminal in the port of Oakland, that was going to take coal from Utah and ship it to Asia. Activists in Oakland, including Margaret Gordon, put together the No Coal in Oakland campaign, and they’ve managed to keep the export terminal from getting put in. Along with the work of other local activists who have also held the line on coal exports at other ports, that means that coal is still in the ground in Utah.You write in the book that you’re worried that the logistical supply-chain systems that have long governed global shipping are increasingly coming home – and that on-demand ordering threatens to replace the cityitselfas a way of organizing commerce. How concerned are you that cities themselves might become an outmoded technology?I think the Bay Area is already kind of living in that future in a lot of ways. It’s not the “doom loop”, which has these particular features related to the pandemic. This is more like one of those tidal forces: every business is getting a little harder to run. Oakland just got voted the best restaurant city in America, and I know a lot of restaurateurs in Oakland, and they can barely keep the doors open. People don’t come in. They order from a ghost kitchen. It’s so hard to get people to be out and living city life. I am genuinely troubled by it.We have imagined that the pandemic was something we would come back from. What if, instead of a blip, it was a pulling forward?That is a grim view.On the other hand, this is something that’s more under control of individual people and communities than so many other problems with our world. This is something that people can choose – but they have to choose the city over a narrow individualistic idea of convenience. Over the long term, not having restaurants that can stay open, not having bookstores, not having coffee shops is very inconvenient, even if at any moment it might be more convenient to order delivery.Explore more on these topicsOaklandShipping industryBlack US cultureCaliforniaRaceWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We are determined to properly understand what happened and what lessons need to be learned.“That is why working with Ofgem, I have today commissioned the National Energy System Operator to carry out an investigation into this specific incident and to understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure, both now and in the future.“The government is determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow. This review will be an important step in helping us to do so, as we deliver our plan for change.”Walsh said “this is yet another case of Heathrow letting down both travellers and airlines”.Speaking to the Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday, Heathrow’s chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, said that while “lessons needed to be learned” from the fire on Friday, most other airports also operated without a separate power plant.‘Colossal failure’: what the papers say about the Heathrow airport shutdownRead moreHe added: “Our systems are not designed to power the entire airport, [for that] we would need a separate standby power plant on the side and we don’t have that.“Heathrow uses as much energy as a city every single day so we don’t have backup power for baggage systems, fuel systems, things like air bridges and so on.“So whereas the safety systems are working and we can get aircraft in and out most of the airport infrastructure comes to a standstill when we need to reset as we did yesterday. That’s how most airports operate.“We are going to, of course, look at what we can learn from this incident but the incident yesterday was a major one, it was not a small thing.”A National Grid spokesperson said the company was “continuing to work closely with the government, Heathrow and the police to understand the cause of the incident”.“Since this unprecedented fire broke out at our North Hyde substation late on Thursday night, our teams have worked tirelessly and in close collaboration with the fire brigade and police to get the situation back under control,” the statement added.It also said the National Grid was “deeply sorry” for the disruption caused, while reiterating that “power supplies have been restored to all customers, including Heathrow, allowing operations to resume at the airport”.British Airways, one of Heathrow’s biggest airlines,said it expected to operate about 85% of its scheduled flightsat the airport on Saturday but huge delays were still expected.The airline would usually expect to run nearly 600 departures and arrivals on a Saturday but it is understood cancellations will be made, where possible, to high-frequency routes.Virgin Atlantic issued a statement on Saturday apologising for the disruption and said it planned to run a “near full schedule with limited cancellations today”.The airline said Heathrow’s closure on Friday had left an “impact on today’s flying programme”, including the repositioning of aircraft and crews.Air India announced its operations to and from Heathrow had started again.“Today’s flight AI111 was on schedule and other flights, to and from London, are expected to operate as per schedule,” it said in a statement.Meanwhile, flight AI161 – which diverted to Frankfurt – “is expected to leave Frankfurt at 14:05 pm local time”, the airline said.Downing Street said there were “questions to answer” about the fire, with counter-terrorism police leading the investigation into the incident that left Britain’s biggest airport unable to function.Two people familiar with the investigation said officials did not believe the fire was the result of any criminal activity or an act of sabotage by a hostile state, and was more likely to be accidental.Police confirmed on Friday evening that the fire was not thought to be suspicious.Asked about an inquiry and whether National Grid had questions to answer, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “There are questions to answer on how this has happened and what can be done to prevent the scale of disruption we’ve seen from happening again, once the situation is under control.”Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportHeathrowHeathrow Airports AuthorityAir transportTransportTravel & leisureWillie WalshnewsShareReuse this content"

My own life in ­boxing, which stretches across 55 years, can be divided into stages and all of them carry markers Foreman left in the dirt and dust of the fight game.From the malevolent force he ­personified when he became ­heavyweight champion of the world to the lovable old grandad ­making hundreds of millions as the face of a food grill business, Foreman could be easily ­caricatured. But he was always more complex and interesting than his contrasting personae suggested.I was 11 years old when, in January 1973, I first became aware of Foreman. Boxing had already taken hold of me because, in our white South African suburb, we were­smitten by Muhammad Ali. Who else was as funny and skilful, as ­beautiful and brave? But boxing was like ­nothing else on earth. In 1971, in the Fight of the Century at Madison Square Garden, Ali had lost to the mighty Joe Frazier. Hunched over our inky newspapers I devoured the reports of the buildup to Frazier’s defence of his title in January 1973 – against Foreman. Frazier sounded relaxed at the ­prospect of facing the brooding Texan who never seemed to smile.“I’m doing it for the money,” Frazier said. “It’s that simple. George won’t have any trouble finding me. I’m going to be up against his chest.”The bout lasted just four minutes and 35 seconds and Smokin’ Joe was dropped six times before the ­referee rescued him. But that fight also imparted a graphic insight into the cold-hearted chicanery of boxing.Don King had listened to the epic Ali-Frazier fight from his prison cell in Marion, Ohio. He was electrified by the grandeur and money that could be made from boxing and, being an ingenious hustler, King found himself promoting Frazier less than two years later. He arrived at the stadium with Frazier in a ­limousine and, a few hours later, he left in the company of Foreman, the new champion.2:56A look back at the life and career of boxing legend George Foreman – videoKing thrilled us when he brought Foreman and Ali to Africa the ­following year. TheRumble in the Jungletook place in Zaire [now the Democratic Republic of Congo] but we feared for Ali. How could he, at the age of 32, withstand the bludgeoning might of Foreman? Ali still made us laugh. “George Foreman is nothing but a big mummy,” he chortled, as he mimicked an embalmed monster. “What you white reporters got to remember is this: black folk ain’t afraid of black folks the way that white folks are afraid of black folks.”Foreman, meanwhile, locked ­himself away in a heavily armed compound. When he did appear he looked even more threatening than the snarling German shepherd dog that walked alongside him. In the early hours of 30 October 1974 I listened to the fight in bed. Dread and excitement churned through me as Ali absorbed every ruinous blow before, near the end of the eighth, a voice ­echoed in disbelief from my tiny radio:“Foreman is down! Foreman is down!”I was deliriously happy for Ali and all my fear and suspicion of Foreman melted away. He was just an ordinary man after all.Years later, Foreman provided Thomas Hauser, Ali’s biographer, with a layered account of his real self: “There was a time when I was sort of unfriendly, and Zaire was part of that period. I was going to knock Ali’s block off and the thought of doing it didn’t bother me.“But, to be honest with you, Ali was important to me. I remember being in junior high and walking home with a friend who had a record of Cassius Clay [as Ali was originally known] reading poetry. We listened to the record and I just about fell in love with Ali.”Foreman also told Hauser: “He won fair and square, and now I’m just proud to be part of the Ali legend. If people mention my name with his from time to time, that’s enough for me.”View image in fullscreenForeman in later years: ‘he seemed so fulfilled’.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverWhen Big George made his comeback in 1987, after 10 years of retirement, he was charming rather than surly. Foreman was also courageous and I rose in the early hours of the morning to watch him challenge Evander Holyfield for the heavyweight title again. He was beaten clearly but I admired his stoical will.In October 1993 I met Foreman briefly in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I was in the dressing room with James Toney, who was then a world super-middleweight champion and close to being the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet for a brief period. We had 90 minutes to kill before Toney fought Tony Thornton. The locker room was quiet and tense and then, out of nowhere, Foremen walked in. He was dressed in a tuxedo and his face was wreathed with warmth.Toney, a former crack dealer, cut an imposing figure. But he almost melted as he bumped fists with Foreman.“George fucking Foreman,” Toney said softly to me as the old champion left for his television duties at ringside.Incredibly, a year later, in November 1994, I was up at the dead of night to watch a 45-year-old Foreman win a version of the world heavyweight title again – 20 years after he had lost it to Ali. It was a feelgood story but, to snobs of the ring like me, it still seemed something of a charade. Hugh McIlvanney wrote of how Foreman “took advantage of the incompetence and porcelain jaw of Michael Moorer … Foreman has the IBF belt around his expanding waist, but he is a legend masquerading as an athlete, a bloated giant who moves as slowly as the seasons.”In 1995, on our honeymoon in America, my wife and I watched Foreman defend his title against Axel Schulz. At the end his face was swollen and dejected. Across the ring, his 22-year-old German opponent looked fresh and unmarked. For twelve painful rounds, the young man had thudded blows into the grandad. Schulz was not a great fighter but he was competent.Foreman was too proud to even think about going down, but Schulz was a decisive winner – until the scorecards were read out. It was a split decision win for Foreman.That ludicrous verdict belonged to the dark business of boxing – but it was not Foreman’s fault. He fought three more times and left boxing a year later. Unlike Ali and Frazier, who were both so damaged, Foreman seemed unscathed.A few years ago I was also in the dressing room withRegis Prograison the night he became a two-time world champion. I asked him to name the fighter hemost admired. He chose Foreman.“George was happy with who he was outside boxing,” Prograis said. “He had a bunch of kids, made a lot of money and seemed so fulfilled. He is a legend but we think of him enjoying his life most of all.”Explore more on these topicsGeorge ForemanThe ObserverMuhammad AliBoxingJoe FraziercommentShareReuse this content"

Conference player of the year RJ Luis Jr had nine points, half his season average, on 3-of-17 shooting.“They outplayed us. They deserve to move on and we don’t,” Pitino said. “That’s what March Madness is all about. No matter how good a regular season you have, you play this way, you’re going to get beat.”Pitino’s history in Providence – he took the Friars to the 1987 Final Four – gave him a home-court advantage as he arrived in March Madness with an unprecedented sixth school.So many of those teams were built with a full-court defense and three-point shooting.St John’s, who beat Omaha in the first round, had the No 1 defense in the country this season to win the Big East, returning to the tournament for the first time since 2019 with a No 2 seed that was their best in 25 years.But the Red Storm’s shooting deserted them on Saturday and they became the first team seeded fourth or better to exit what’s been a chalky tournament so far.“Rick did a good job with his team all year,” Calipari said. “If they made a few shots, they probably beat us. We were fortunate to get out.”The teams combined to make four three-pointers on 41 attempts, with St John’s shooting 28% from the floor overall.“I hate to see them go out this way,” Pitino said. “We thought we were championship-driven in our minds, but I have been disappointed before with this. You hate to see us play like that.“I don’t mind going out with a loss, I just hate to see us play that way offensively,” he said. “It’s just a bitter pill to swallow with that type of performance.”Explore more on these topicsNCAA Tournament 2025US sportsNCAA TournamentCollege sportsCollege basketballShareReuse this content"

Pausing mid-step, he fixes his gaze on a vine creeping onto the asphalt – kudzu, the invasive scourge of the American South. Laz pins it with the toe of his worn-out shoe, then crushes it with a sharp twist.Pop. “Nature isn’t about balance,” he says, kicking the remains aside. “That’s a common misconception – it’s war.”Frozen Head State Park, where he’sheld the Barkley since 1986, has managed to fight off this botanical kraken – so far. Introduced from Japan in the 1930s to combat soil erosion, kudzu earned its reputation as “the plant that ate the South” by swallowing entire forests, abandoned houses, and telephone poles at a pace of up to a foot per day. The government once paid farmers to plant it; now they pay them even more to destroy it.Frozen Head’s relatively intact ecosystem provides a natural defense, but its steep, scarred mountains bear witness to countless other invaders – a fitting setting, as Laz sees it, for the world’s toughest footrace, where change, adaptation and the struggle to survive play out over what Outside magazine once described as “60 hours of hell”.The longer the race, the closer it gets: women are closing in on men in the ultra-endurance arenaRead moreThe Barkley is combat – in 39 years, only 20 have finished this briar-gnarled ultramarathon. With books hidden in the woods as unmanned checkpoints, enough elevation gain to thwart a Sherpa, and a panic-inducing 12-hour start “window” – this run is more crucible than race.Yet three broke the code in 2023, and a record-setting five finished in 2024. The answer, at first glance, seems obvious: perfect weather. Gone is the pea-soup-thick fog, the sudden torrential rains, and the mud-slop footing. But the deeper reasons aren’t as clear. One factor may be Laz’s decision to intervene.A few years back, when temperatures climbed into the 80s, he retreated the start of the race into March. Traditionally anchored to April Fool’s weekend, a sly nod to the absurdity of its demands, it was a tactical move to outflank a spring creeping ever closer. The challenge for Laz has always been keeping the Barkley on the razor’s edge of possibility –where runners suffer but still stand a chance. That means holding it at winter’s retreat, before the heat takes hold and the trees fill out making navigation nearly impossible.The day before this year’s race, I spot three-time-finisher John Kelly. He’s at the back of the line to check in. It’s been two years since I saw him, and he somehow looks younger – slightly tousled dishwater-blond hair, boyish face. I remind him of his pre-race hike that year, when he heard a staccato clatter, like a shaken maraca. The angry timber rattler began to coil. “I don’t think I’d ever seen one that early,” mutters Kelly, who grew up on the edge of the park.“We’re not really certain what’s going on,” says a park ranger who shows up in camp. “It’s a bit of the frog in a boiling pot situation. But it’s not unusual for a snake to come out of their hole on a warm day.” He declines to be quoted – politics – and shies away from the word climate change.Laz doesn’t. “Hell, I’ve been hiking in Frozen Head since before it was a park,” he counters. “These snakes aren’t just sunning a bit; they’re on the move. It’s Grandfather Syndrome. If you actually go out every day for 60 years and pay attention, it’s hard to watch. Fall is approaching spring from the other side. We’ve got one month of winter.”The next morning, he sends 40 of the toughest ultrarunners in the world into the wilds by lighting a cigarette. Most are in shorts. “We might have to move it back to January,” Laz says later in the afternoon. His checked flannel jacket is off as the temperatures have now climbed into the low 70s.To combat the recent string of finishers, he’s added severe nastiness to this year’s course. Just to get to the first book, runners will turn off-trail, tackle a 1,500-foot climb, then navigate their way down a treacherous 1,800-foot descent. From there, a new slope waits: Ball Bearing Hill. This and other navigational trickery led one Barkley veteran to predict that three, maybe four will make three loops – “no finishers.”View image in fullscreenIn 39 years, only 20 have finished the Barkley Marathons. Yet three broke the code in 2023, and a record-setting five finished in 2024.Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty ImagesJohn Kelly is one of 11 who return from the first loop under the cutoff. Ten will go back out. Turning in his book pages, he says, “the course is on the verge of perfection”. Night has settled over the park, thick as coal, and he has no idea when he returns again – it will be 15 hours later, and all chances of a finish will be gone.Throughout the night, Taps rings solemn through camp on an old bugle – honoring the many runners who’ve fallen short – while the few that remain press past rusting mining equipment wrapped in briars, brittle dynamite shacks, and caved in mines. “One wrong step,” Kelly had told me, “and you could find yourself at the bottom of one of those shafts.” Strip mining, deep mining, logging – all have exacted their toll. But nothing has proved as indomitable as nature unleashed by man’s misguided attempts to intervene.Last year a runner was knocked sprawling by a dark, grunting beast. Originally brought to the Smoky Mountains for sport hunting, wild hogs bred with local hogs to create an aggressive, highly adaptable hybrid. The state responded by introducing legislation to allow open-season hunting year-round on them. This backfired spectacularly. Unrestricted hunting inadvertently encouraged people to illegally transport and release hogs into new areas, including Frozen Head, hoping to create additional hunting opportunities.The ranger I spoke with had just “downed him” one the other night – more than 100, he said, in the last year. But he’s not naïve – that’s barely a dent. “I just want to keep them from the visitor center and the playgrounds.”View image in fullscreenUltra-trail runner Aurélien Sanchez, who became the first ever French finisher of the Barkley Marathons in 2023, poses for a photo during a training session on the outskirts of Toulouse last year.Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty ImagesBut invasive pests, whose larvae now survive increasingly mild winters, are proving the toughest foe yet. In the 1990s, a six-legged scourge barely 3mm long advanced from the south – the southern pine beetle. Once held in check by substantial winters, they bore through the bark and create intricate galleries in the phloem tissue. The pine responds by producing resin to “pitch out” the beetles, but when too many attack at once, the tree’s defenses are overwhelmed. Within weeks, their needles turn yellow, then red, before dropping entirely.The next invader came in the form of innocent little tufts of what appeared to be lint – the hemlock woolly adelgid. This tiny aphid-like insect attaches itself to the base of hemlock needles and inserts specialized mouthparts to feed on the tree’s stored starches. Covered in a protective white, woolly wax that resembles cotton balls, a single adelgid can lay up to 300 eggs. The insects gradually drain the tree’s energy reserves, causing needle loss, branch dieback, and eventual death within four to 10 years.In 2002, a metallic green beetle only about half an inch long arrived in Chicago as a stowaway in wooden packing materials – the emerald ash borer. It reached Tennessee in 2010, adding to the ecological pressure.The earliest and perhaps most catastrophic scourge was the chestnut blight. It reached the park in the 1930s and killed an estimated four billion trees across the eastern United States. First discovered in 1904 at the Bronx Zoo, the fungal pathogen spread rapidly southward. From 1912 through 1914, the forest service sent crews wielding crosscut saws and axes through the woods to cut away a 60-mile “barrier zone.” The rhythmic chunk of steel biting wood echoed through valleys as hundred-year-old giants toppled in thunderous crashes. When Laz first hiked here in the early 70s, there were chestnut stumps “you could park a Volkswagen on.”View image in fullscreenGary Cantrell, also known as Lazarus Lake, poses in Castanet-Tolosan near Toulouse in January.Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty ImagesBut the blight jumped the zone, and “Above the level of a man’s head,” observed naturalist Donald Culross Peattie, “the woods will never look the same again.”Through this lens, each Barkley runner isn’t just battling distance, elevation, and Laz’s mind games – they’re moving through a landscape that’s fighting its own race against overwhelming odds.Nearing the 40-hour mark, Frozen Head seemed to remember itself. “50 mile per hour wind, steady rain, less than 1:15 to go,” Keith Dunn, the Barkley Twitter man posts. “The runners better be on Ball Bearing Hill if they hope to get here in time. Wherever they are, things are getting intense. This is the Barkley.”Hopes of a finish are long gone. All that’s left is a Fun Run – a special check-down finish of three loops. For this, Laz grants a cushion of four extra hours – but no runner arriving after that extended window can continue on to loop four. To proceed, they needed to start at the 36-hour mark. For the best of the best, it’s a consolation prize – but three are out there fighting to get it.Those in camp wait and stare into the night. Ten minutes remain. Then a holler cuts through the silence and a light appears at the bottom of the hill – John Kelly. He reaches the gate in a desperate sprint. His haunted, hollow eyes move to his watch. He’s made it. The thought folds him over the gate. The two others won’t be so lucky. Laz stands nearby, under a budding oak, smoke curling from his cigarette. The Barkley has won.To say Laz over corrected ignores the race’s history. After Kelly finished in 2017, it took another five years before anyone finished. Whenever the bar is raised, a readjustment period follows. It’s the way of things that live on the edge.If you look hard enough, you can still spot chestnuts in the park, young ones. It’s been observed that though the trunks die, the roots often survive the blight to send up new shoots. Within 10 to 15 years, most will be infected again. Yet they persist despite near-certain failure, till one day they’ll adapt enough to thrive again.Jared Beasley is the author of the forthcoming book, The Endurance Artist, about Lazarus Lake and the Barkley Marathons.Explore more on these topicsSportUltrarunningMarathon runningUS sportsTennesseefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But thenew International Olympic Committee presidentnow faces the biggest set of challenges to global sport since the 1980s, when boycotts rocked the Moscow and Los Angeles Games. As the 41-year-old prepares to take over from Thomas Bach in June, what issues will she face?Protecting women’s sportOne of Coventry’s key pledges has been to protect women’s sports and athletes. On Friday, she pointed out that as Zimbabwe’s sports minister she had removed the football federation’s board after female referees reported being sexually harassed. She has also talked about a blanket ban on transgender athletes from the female category.View from Africa: how Kirsty Coventry will handle sport’s biggest job at the IOCRead more“Protecting the female category and female sports is paramount,” she says. “There is more and more scientific research. It is very clear that transgender women are more able in the female category and can take away opportunities that should be equal for women.”Coventry says she wants to set up a taskforce to address how best to protect women’s sport, which became a global controversy at the women’s boxing tournament in Paris, whenImane KhelifandLin Yu-ting won gold.In January, she said lessons needed to be learned but added that there “needs to be a little more sensitivity” when it comes to athletes with a difference in sex development condition, who were reported as female at birth but then underwent male puberty.View image in fullscreenImane Khelif’s gold medal in Paris has brought the issue of women’s sport to the forefront.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAThe return of Russia?There is no obvious path for the IOC to lift its suspension of Russia’s Olympic body while four regional sports councils in eastern Ukraine remain under Russian control. However, Coventry says she is against banning countries from the Games and has promised to set up another taskforce to look at “some guiding frameworks” when it comes to Russia.As things stand, only a few Russians will be competing as neutral athletes at the Milan CortinaWinter Olympicsin 11 months’ time. However, it will be fascinating to see whether a Russian return – Putin’s favourite sport is ice hockey – could be part of a peace deal in Ukraine.Dealing with Donald TrumpCoventry takes over at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty around the globe and with Trump threatening to ban people from certain countries from entering the United States. Casey Wasserman, the chair of the 2028 Los Angeles Games, has said: “Irrespective of politics today, America will be open and accepting to all 209 countries for the Olympics”, but no one can be quite sure what Trump will do next.Coventry has promised not to flinch. “I have been dealing with, let’s say, difficult men in high positions since I was 20 years old,” she said on Thursday, when asked about Trump. “We will not waver from our values: solidarity and ensuring every athlete that qualifies for theOlympic Gameshas the possibility to attend the Olympic Games and be safe during the Olympic Games.”Who will host the 2036 Games?A key issue for the IOC is finding a host for the 2036 Olympics, which is being fought over by India, Qatar, Turkey and several other countries. One thing to watch is if Coventry sticks with Bach’s policy of allowing a “preferred bid” to be fast-tracked into exclusive negotiations.If that happens, India will be seen as favourites. Coventry is close to the influential IOC member Nita Ambani, whose family is the richest in Asia. There is no set timetable for a decision on 2036, but Coventry has hinted that she will involve IOC members more in the decision-making process.TheclimatecrisisThe climate crisis not only threatens the traditional slot for the Summer Games of July and August but also raises existential questions for the Winter Olympics. Coventry has called for greater flexibility, pointing to how the marathon in Tokyo 2020 was staged in Sapporo where it was cooler. Do not be surprised if a Games in India in 2036, and perhaps Saudi Arabia in 2040, are held in the autumn.“We have an incredible amount of interest in the Games for 2036 and 2040 from new regions, which is exciting,” she said. “It opens up the question of the timing of the Games and we need to be proactive about that, both summer and winter.”Keeping the Olympics relevantThe Olympics has proven remarkably resilient in a rapidly changing media and entertainment landscape, with the Paris Games a resounding success. Last week, NBC announced this month it had reacheda four-year extension of its rightsfor the Olympic Games, valued at $3bn (£2.5bn), to take them through to 2036. But a key task for Coventry over the next eight years will be to acquire new top-tier sponsors, most likely from India and Saudi Arabia, and keep the Games relevant globally, especially among young people.Explore more on these topicsInternational Olympic CommitteeThe ObserverOlympic GamesWinter OlympicsSport politicsWinter Olympics 2026LA Olympic Games 2028featuresShareReuse this content"

That’s an amazing stat,” said Holloway, whose outdoor successes came in Doha, Eugene and Budapest (2019, 2022, 2023).“It was great. This one was a little bit different. I didn’t have two great rounds, and had to rely on my experience to get me through the final.“But I knew what I had to do, I knew what I was missing. With that being said, a big shout-out to the sports staff. Everybody was telling me, ’You’ve done this a million times before, you’ve just got to do it again’.”Holloway said that the race could well be his last hurrah, with a new discipline on the horizon.“I think I can put grace in it and hang up the 60m hurdles and try out a new event next year,” he said. “That’s something I can think about.”Coming through the NCAA system at the University of Florida, Holloway competed not only in the long and short hurdles, but also in the flat sprints over 60 and 100m, as well as relays. He has a long jump best of 8.17m from 2018.He added that he had his eye on a potential fourth world outdoor title when Tokyo hosts the next championships in September.“We’ve got the 110m hurdles coming up in the next couple of months, so I will put my best foot forward for that,” said Holloway, the Olympic champion whose 12.81sec in the US Olympic trials in 2021 make him the second-fastest man in history at the event.“It’s a world championships, you’ll always have nerves for the world championships wherever you’re at.“I just want to continue to work hard, figure out ways to continue to win, perfect my craft, and continue to challenge myself and my sports staff and coaches to get better.”In other events on Saturday, American Christopher Bailey won his maiden global crown in the men’s 400m in 45.08sec, leading a US podium sweep ahead of compatriots Brian Faust and Jacory Patterson.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Qualifiers matter only in as much as they have to be negotiated.Friday’s win by England over Albaniafell into a very familiar pattern. The brave new world of Thomas Tuchel turned out to look a lot like the faded old world of Gareth Southgate. England had lots of the ball, did not move it fast enough and won by a couple of goals. It does not matter. They could have won 10-0, 8-5 or 1-0 and it would mean almost nothing in terms of the winning of the World Cup.England want to win the World Cup next summer. They have a squad that should make them challengers. Barring pratfalls, there will come a point next year when they will play an Argentina or a Spain or a France, a team of equivalent or greater talent and, almost certainly, that is what will determine whether they are successful.Lewis-Skelly gamble pays off for Tuchel as he balances impatience and reality | Jonathan LiewRead moreBut before that they will have a dozen or so games against teams with less lofty aspirations who, as with Albania, set out in a deep block. There was a period when Southgate’s England were very good at those games: they scored 39 goals in 10 qualifiers for the last World Cup. Butthey still lost to France in the quarter-finals. Fabio Capello’s England scored 34 goals in 10 qualifiers for 2010, then weregrindingly awful in South Africa. Racking up hatfuls of goals in qualifying is evidence of nothing more than that you are good at racking up hatfuls of goals in qualifying.At this stage, there are two things Tuchel has to do. He has to make sure England do get to the World Cup – and Serbia and Albania away will not be easy – while at the same time beginning to construct a side capable of playing against teams who will operate in a very different way from their opponents in qualifying. Much of that work will happen on the training pitch, away from the public eye. Much of it is to do with having a plan and then tweaking and refining it as he goes along and not being distracted by flavour-of-the-month players and the clamour that builds around them. Tournaments are usually won by systems and environments, and almost never by bolters who suddenly hit form in the April and May just before a tournament.Friday was not perfect. England,as Tuchel acknowledged, did not move the ball as quickly as he would have liked them to, did not get it wide soon enough or often enough to stretch the play. There were a couple of moments of defensive anxiety, in part caused by overcommitting against extremely passive opponents. Dan Burn heading the ball out of Jordan Pickford’s hands was not a model of north-eastern communication and cooperation. But fundamentally it was fine. Good enough. Three points. Tick. And there was one moment to offer real hope.View image in fullscreenHarry Kane (right) scored again in a World Cup qualifier. Getting players to run beyond him will be the key England’s success.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The ObserverAt the last Euros, which,despite the fact they got to the final, was Southgate’s worst tournament, there were three major problems. The absence of a left-back was happily resolved by picking a left-back, which leaves two quandaries. England lack a player who can sit deep in midfield, break up opposition attacks and control the tempo of a game – a Rodri, an N’Golo Kanté, a Toni Kroos. It is not that that sort of player is essential for winning tournaments, but having one would balance a midfield with Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham. Curtis Jones may be the answer, although his natural tendency is to push higher than would be ideal. There were a couple of instances when Albania were able to break into space that, say, Rodri would have been occupying, but it was a start. It may come.But probably the most significant flaw last summer was that Harry Kane, quite apart from his fitness struggles, did not fit with the players behind him. One of his great gifts is the capacity to drop deep; to ask him not to do that, to stay high and occupy the box, is to remove a key part of his game and also what should be a valuable weapon for England in dragging opposing defences out of position. But that then needs players who will run beyond Kane, to exploit the space he has created. At the Euros, England did not have that – they had Bellingham, Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka clogging up the zone Kane was moving into – which is one of the reasons they always looked more dangerous when a more frontrunning centre-forward, Ivan Toney or Ollie Watkins, came on.The sort of interaction that became familiar with Kane and Son Heung-min at Tottenham, Kane dropping deep, spinning and pinging a pass into the path of a charging Son, is very difficult to achieve against a side who sit deep as Albania did and leave no space for opponents to run into. But after 26 minutes on Friday it happened: Kane dropped deep, three England players went beyond him and he played a pass to Marcus Rashford. It was a challenging pass, it came to Rashford at an awkward height and his touch was slightly heavy, but it had at least been possible and had been attempted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rashford may not have the technical ability of Cole Palmer or Saka, and he may not have the tactical brain of Foden, but it may be that by having the right attributes to offer balance, he ends up being more important than any of them.It was a glint, no more. Much of Friday’s game comprised the hypnotic retention of possession, the gentle probing, that has become characteristic of home England qualifiers. But in that one pass, there were perhaps the very early signs of what Tuchel’s England may be, of a balance and a method that can succeed.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThe ObserverThomas TuchelFootball tacticscommentShareReuse this content"

The hush of trepidation that filled the Cardiff air approaching the final whistle confirmed what proved an awkward but satisfying night as Wales edged past Kazakhstan, 110th in the world, to preserve Craig Bellamy’s unbeaten record, though an improved performance is surely required if that is to remain in North Macedonia on Tuesday.Wales hope this is the start of another memorable journey. And one with a happier ending than three woeful group-stage performances. This week even Davies, a typically uber-cautious talker, did not dress up Wales’s showing at the last World Cup. “The best moment of Qatar was probably just the Ukraine [playoff] game in getting there,” said the defender, whose header 79 seconds into the second half offeredWalescomfort before Matondo converted Sorba Thomas’s cross. North Macedonia have won their past six matches and Wales can expect a step up in class. “We have to be at our best,” Bellamy said. “I don’t look at everything like I’m living with a knife between my teeth. We have to embrace it and be excited.”Wales 3-1 Kazakhstan: World Cup qualifier – as it happenedRead moreA nervousness pervaded this stadium at half-time when Kazakhstan deservedly headed in level. In truth, Wales made an underwhelming start, with Maxim Samorodov registering the first shot, but led on nine minutes owing to a slice of luck, James’s shot taking a huge deflection to wrong-foot the Kazakhstan goalkeeper Alexandr Zarutskiy after Askhat Tagybergen failed to clear the ball. Bellamy punched the air but Wales did not accelerate clear of their opponents.David Brooks failed to seize on a two v one scenario, undercooking a pass for Thomas, and a couple of minutes later Wales were reeling when Connor Roberts was penalised for handball inside the box. Roberts handled Islam Chesnokov’s cross and the Lithuanian referee, Donatas Rumsas, after a lengthy VAR check, awarded a penalty. Tagybergen sent a tame spot-kick down the middle of Karl Darlow’s goal and the ball, via Darlow’s feet, corkscrewed over the line.Bellamy spent recent weeks delving into the archives to get a flavour of what to expect, analysing the way Ali Aliyev, Kazakhstan’s interim manager, set up his team when in charge of Kazakhstani side Kyzylzhar in his previous job. In reality, Bellamy did not need a database to tell him Kazakhstan would line up in a low block.View image in fullscreenBen Davies heads Wales into a 2-1 lead.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersPatience was key. “The important part is to not get bored of keeping the ball,” Bellamy said. “If you try to force things, you can become even more vulnerable to the counterattack. I still hear the shouts: ‘Get it forward, get it [up] there.’ I know, but I’m not hitting up ‘there’ when we have the numbers ‘here’. The message at half-time was: be patient, they’ll tire and then we’ll pick them off.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It did not pan out quite like that. Wales may have been a little stodgy but there was nothing laboured about Davies’s header after the restart. Zarutskiy flapped at a Thomas corner and the ball zoomed over the goalkeeper’s flailing hands and towards the back post, where Davies powered in. It was the perfect way to erase any fears forming in the minds of those who witnessed Armenia overpower Wales here in a Euro 2024 qualifier or, indeed, Gibraltar hold Wales 0-0 last summer.“In games where you go in as favourites there are expectations to walk all over teams, but it is never the case,” Davies said afterwards. How did Bellamy react at the break? “He came in, Mr Calm, and was clear in the message of what he expected. I think the players were the ones most frustrated, annoyed and angry.”Neco Williams tested Zarutskiy with a smart free-kick but Matondo eventually sealed victory, converting from close range after the substitute Jordan James flipped the ball wide to Thomas. “Don’t take me home,” crooned the locals, for whom those four words were the soundtrack of an unforgettable run to the semi-finals at Euro 2016.

It has been a theme of the Ajax midfielder’s career and it resonates once again with him back in the England squad, winning his 81st cap as a substitute in Thomas Tuchel’s first game as head coach – the 2-0 World Cup qualifyingwin over Albaniaon Friday night. The more sideways take on it came last summer.Henderson was devastated to have been overlooked by Gareth Southgate for Euro 2024 in Germany, having been involved throughout qualification. The determining factor was the muscle injury he picked up last March, which sidelined him for the best part of two months and did not give him the time to get fully fit at the end of the domestic season. That was how Southgate sold it, anyway.Thomas Tuchel’s construction of England’s high-speed monorail begins | Barney RonayRead moreWhen the team with which Henderson had lived so much scrapped their way to the final against Spain, he knew he had to be there. The good news was that Ajax’s pre-season schedule worked out for him. There was a gap. The bad was there were no flights available. Henderson turned to Google Maps. Amsterdam to Berlin by road showed as six hours, 40 minutes. He called a van hire company and thought: “Let’s go.”“I didn’t know until late doors whether I could go with training or times or schedule,” Henderson says. “But we were off or late the next day so I was able to go. Then, when I found out I could go, there were no flights anywhere. I couldn’t go fromEngland, couldn’t go from Amsterdam. So I looked at how far it was and I hired a van for me and the family and we drove across.”Just imagine the reaction of the travelling England supporters when they saw Henderson on the various stops en route. “When we needed the toilet or something, or popping in the garages, it was quite funny to see some of the fans,” he says. “Actually, it was quite nice to be with them. Obviously I would have rather been with the team.“I was watching on the telly and it was hard but all I wanted was the lads to do well and win. I had a good feeling that we were going to win, so I needed to be there to see it. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out. But I was happy that I went to watch them live.”Henderson is at the start of another journey, brought in from the cold by Tuchel after being ignored by the interim England manager, Lee Carsley, for the whole of the autumn programme. Nobody saw the recall coming, with even Tuchel admitting Henderson was not in his initial thoughts. That was until he began work in January and heard the players and staff constantly talking about Henderson; his influence on and off the pitch. Tuchel got in touch in February and within 15 minutes of the conversation, he realised that he had to involve him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They play at PSV next Sunday. But it has not all been smooth sailing, with a storm erupting in January.Ajax are beset by financial problems and they were prepared to move Henderson, one of their highest earners, to Monaco. When the news broke, it was interpreted in some quarters as the captain looking to jump ship, turning his back on the club that had rescued him in January last year from his disastrous transfer from Liverpool to Al-Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia.On 30 January, with Ajax preparing for the Europa League tie at home to Galatasaray that night, the club were so deep in talks with Monaco that Henderson thought he was about to be sold. He said he would play against Galatasaray, to do a job for the team, which he did. But he did not feel comfortable about wearing the captain’s armband, so he passed it to Ajax’s veteran goalkeeper, Remko Pasveer. Cue outrage. Now Henderson was disrespecting the armband. Where was his professionalism?It led to a lengthy exchange between a frustrated Henderson and the Dutch media after Ajax’s next game – in the league against their arch-rivals, Feyenoord. The whole thing was in front of the cameras, Henderson essentially accusing certain outlets of lies as he explained his side of the story. What helped was that Ajax had just won with a stoppage-time goal from Kenneth Taylor. By then, the club’s board had decided to retain Henderson and everybody would move on.It is not always easy to be a midfielder of Henderson’s profile at Ajax, the club of Cruyff and lofty ideals. On the other hand, the manager, Francesco Farioli – who was appointed last summer after a dismal fifth-placed finish – is a results-first kind of guy. Henderson is a fit for him and, it must be said, he has been backed by the club’s hardcore supporters.Henderson does not want to talk about January, when he was also accused of not joining in with his teammates’ celebrations of the goals in the 2-1 win against Galatasaray. Henderson said that was untrue. What he does want to talk about is England and the World Cup dream.“I never thought it was over otherwise I would have retired [from international football],” Henderson says. “Obviously I was disappointed [at missing the Euros] but I still feel physically fit and I was never going to shut that door. Deep inside, I always wanted to come back. Thankfully I got the opportunity.“The balance is important in any successful team. The ones that have won in the past, you see the experience all over the pitch. You also need young players coming through, that blend, and I think we have that with this squad.”Explore more on these topicsEnglandThe ObserverAjaxWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Elsewhere,Evertonran out 3-0 winners againstCrystal Palace.Liverpool’s Jasmine Matthews scored two own goals in the game at the Emirates Stadium, as Arsenal proved too strong for Amber Whiteley’s team and her 100% winning start to life as the Merseyside club’s interim head coach came to an end.The result saw Arsenal score four or more goals in a sixth consecutive home WSL fixture, the longest streak of that kind in the competition’s history, and they did much of the damage in a two-minute period in the first half where they found the net twice in quick succession.Caitlin Foord tucked in the opening goal from two yards after Liverpool defended poorly at a corner, and moments later, after a quick Arsenal break, Kim Little’s attempted pass across goal bounced into the net off Matthews. As Arsenal’s confidence grew, Mariona Caldentey curled a stylish third goal into the far corner a minute before half-time.Matthews’s second unfortunate moment came in the 69th minute when she tried to block Beth Mead’s near-post shot and inadvertently diverted the ball past goalkeeper Rachael Laws, as second-placed Arsenal closed the gap at the top of the league to five points behind the leaders Chelsea, who face Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium today.Liverpool, who had impressed in Whiteley’s three wins from three, with league victories over Crystal Palace and Manchester United sandwiched either side of an FA Cup victory away against Arsenal, never looked close to repeating their Cup heroics and did not register a single shot on target.Frida Maanum also hit the woodwork twice for Arsenal, after linking up well with an in-form Alessia Russo, and their attentions will now turn towards trying to overturn the 2-0 deficit they face in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid.Foord told Sky Sports: “It has been a heavy week, but we had a point to prove, especially against them [Liverpool] as well. We were looking forward to being back here and putting on a show. As a front four we want to be fluent, we want to interchange and we want to make it difficult for defenders, and we just worked really well off each other tonight, and we just want to keep that going.”The day’s two top-flight games attracted hugely contrasting attendance figures, as 35,628 spectators created a din in north London, just hours after a crowd of merely 754 had attended the earlier kick-off at Walton Hall Park, which has a capacity of 2,200.View image in fullscreenEverton’s Sara Holmgaard (left) celebrates after scoring her side’s second goal of the game.Photograph: Barrington Coombs/PAEverton climbed up to seventh with the victory against Palace, who remain bottom. Leif Gunnar Smerud’s visitors had hoped to climb out of the relegation zone but they were second-best against an Everton team that dictated the majority of the game.After a spell of pressure from the hosts, Justine Vanhaevermaet’s far-post header from a Sara Holmgaard corner put Everton in front shortly before half-time, and it was Holmgaard’s turn to head in expertly, shortly after the break, from Kelly Gago’s well-placed, right-wing cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Madsen said “yes”, and the happy couple celebrated the moment with their newborn baby on the pitch with her teammates.The atmosphere was somewhat less joyful in the Palace camp, as they remain a point adrift at the bottom, but Smerud is staying positive. He said: “Today we fought until the end, so this is not a defeated team at all. I see that our shape and our way of working as a unit is better.

At the end of 2023 the former Derby and Everton midfielder was approached by the country he represented 40 times to see if he would be interested in leaving his role withEngland Under-21s.Having held what Carsley described as “informal discussions” with the Football Association of Ireland, he opted to stay put. Their loss has been England’s gain asthe 51-year-old stepped upto fill Gareth Southgate’s shoes whenhe departed after Euro 2024and was only too happy to resume his duties with the under-21s whenThomas Tuchel was appointed as head coachof the senior side.Ekitike’s hat-trick fires France to win against England in eight-goal thrillerRead moreWatching Carsley take charge on Friday of the first match of his second spell as coach of the under-21s, it is clear he is much more comfortable out of the spotlight that the main job inevitably brings. Despitesuffering a 5-3 defeatin an entertaining game against a talented France team, Carsley will relish the chance to lead England in their hunt for glory at this summer’s European Under-21 Championship – a tournament they had not won since 1984 until victory over Spain in the final two years ago.With a squad stacked with young players who could potentially be called up for the senior squad for the World Cup next year, he is under no illusions about where the priorities must lie. “As soon as Thomas needs them, I won’t put a blockage to that,” he said. “The best thing for the players is to play in the senior team.“Ultimately, we’re trying to support the seniors to win the World Cup. That’s the goal. That’s the ambition for all of the players. I think we’ve got to set the bar high. They can see the seniors now, how good they are and how fast they’re progressing.”With only Monday’s friendly against Portugal at the Hawthorns and one more behind-closed-doors game to come before they head off to Slovakia in June, Carsley knows time is of the essence ifEnglandare to defend their title. An experimental side with three at the back were badly exposed by France’s brilliant front three of Hugo Ekitike, Wilson Odobert and Rayan Cherki, even if they did create plenty of chances of their own and could easily have scored more than the three they managed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionLee Carsley hopes to ‘earn the right’ to be senior England manager againRead moreJarrad Branthwaite’s late arrival to the camp on Wednesday meant the Everton defender was not introduced until deep into the second half in Lorient and he is expected to start against Portugal. He would be a shoo-in to start in Slovakia should – as expected – Carsley revert to his usual four at the back. That was the system preferred by Tuchel forhis first game in chargeagainst Albania, although Carsley was adamant he has not been given instructions to mirror what the senior side do. “I don’t think it matters,” he said. “It’s important that we’re both trying to attack, we’re both trying to score goals, we’re both trying to win games.”That much was evident with his selection of Alex Scott and Jaden Philogene as wing-backs against France, even if neither can claim to have excelled defensively. The task for Carsley will be finding a system that best suits a multi-talented squad that is particularly well-stacked in central midfield. Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson started there against France, with Jack Hinshelwood, Jobe Bellingham and Archie Gray also vying for spots. Wharton, who missed almost four months of the season after having surgery on his groin at the end of last year, showed signs of his quality but is still lacking match fitness.View image in fullscreenAdam Wharton is back in the under-21 squad after going to Euro 2024 last summer.Photograph: Dave Winter/ShutterstockHe was part of Southgate’s squad at Euro 2024, even if the Crystal Palace midfielder was an unused substitute throughout England’s run to the final. He believes that experience could prove useful when it comes to this summer. “If you go all the way it’s going to be a long trip, long days but it’s just about getting that togetherness as a group and getting the chemistry,” he said.The 21-year-old trained with the senior squad for the first two days of this camp before linking up with Carsley and he said the World Cup has to be a target for everyone in the under-21s squad. “We’re only one step away and pretty much everyone, or a high percentage of the players, are playing in the top division,” he said.Wharton’s call-up for Euro 2024 was something of a surprise but he now feels at home in the senior squad. “When I’m on the pitch, it doesn’t matter who I’m playing with, it’s the same football. I just try to express myself and play my game when I’m training and playing.”Asked if Tuchel wanted him to improve in any particular areas, he said: “Everything. I’m still only 21. I’m nowhere near where I want to be. There’s a lot of things I can improve on: on the ball, off the ball, tactically, as a leader, a bit of everything.”James McAtee has been one of Carsley’s most consistent performers and scored the opening goal against France. His and Rico Lewis’s participation in the summer is in doubt due to Manchester City’s involvement in the Club World Cup but McAtee intends to be involved in the decision-making process with Pep Guardiola. “I think I’ll get a say in it,” he said. “But I haven’t made my mind up. I think my opinion will matter and the boss back home will listen to me.”Explore more on these topicsEngland Under-21sThe ObserverLee CarsleyEuropean Under-21 ChampionshipEnglandThomas TuchelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If the answer – Carlisle – is easy, the ­reasons why they are stuck to the bottom of England’s Football League with nine games to go remains rather harder to fathom.Perhaps appropriately, Billy Ocean’s hit Red Light Spells Danger greeted fans taking their seats at Brunton Park before kick-off against Bromley on Saturday, but at least, by the end the hazard had diminished, albeit slightly, for a team on their third ­manager of the season.Alienated fans fear money-driven ticket exploitation is pricing out regularsRead moreCarlisle are now seven points adrift of third-bottom Tranmere with a game in hand. Arguably even more ­important, a 2-1 home win against playoff hopefuls here went a long way towards explaining whyMark Hughesremains convinced relegation to the National League is avoidable.This was the second win of his short tenure – he arrived in early February – but an intelligent performance in the balmy Cumbrian air on the River Eden’s floodplain suggested that his message is finally starting to get through.Carlisle’s manager is 61 now but, looking lithe and super fit in a black tracksuit, the former Manchester United, Barcelona and Chelsea striker seemed in good enough shape to turn back time and cause Bromley’s defence a few problems.View image in fullscreenMark Hughes has won two matches since taking charge of Carlisle at the start of February.Photograph: Richard Lee/ShutterstockNot that the home side required any extra help here. Granted, Bromley had their moments but a fine curled goal from Stephen Wearne and deflected one on Callum Whelan’s part arrived either side of Harry McKirdy’s expertly lobbed equaliser to secure three points.Indeed it took a combination of the woodwork and excellent goalkeeping by Grant Smith to prevent Carlisle extending their lead on an afternoon when Kadeem Harris missed a penalty.If Carlisle beat MK Dons here on Tuesday the gap to Tranmere will be cut to four points. “Every game now is huge,” Hughes said. “But I’m really pleased. I could sense determination rather than apprehension, we were brave in and out of possession. It was a really good performance against dangerous opponents.”But how did it come to this? As recently as the autumn of 2023 optimism in Cumbria soared as Tom and Patty Piatak, a married couple from Jacksonville, Florida, bought Carlisle and unveiled plans to invest £8.5m in the club and its infrastructure. Back then the team were in League One and relegation swiftly followed. Although about £7m has been poured into Carlisle by the Piataks, much has been funnelled into a new academy and training ground along with stadium improvements while most of those player signings have underwhelmed.Admittedly, it is still early days in the Piataks’s vision of establishing the team in the top half of the Championship but well before Hughes succeeded Mike Williamson, Tom Piatak’s pledges were ringing a little hollow.Quick GuideLeague One roundup: Rodriguez sends Wrexham secondShowJay Rodriguez scored the only goal asWrexhamdefeated promotion rivalsStockport1-0 to move back into second place in League One.With Birmingham and Wycombe not in action, Wrexham took full advantage, climbing three points clear of Wanderers and nine above Stockport.

After enjoying early managerial success with Wales and Blackburn, he was sacked, arguably rather harshly, by Manchester City in December 2009.Since then, a career taking in stints at Fulham, QPR, Stoke and Southampton has seemed on a downward trajectory. Maybe, rather like the Piataks, he has simply been unlucky. “Mark’s the perfect fit,” says Tom Piatak. “I’m confident he’ll get us out of this.”If his installation provoked hope, his first nine games have tempered it with two wins, three draws and four defeats as the 11 players signed by Williamson take time to gel. Against Bromley, though, there were encouraging indications that a team their latest manager conceded “can lack a bit of aggression” had finally taken his advice that “sometimes you’ve just got to knock people over”.As he led Carlisle’s players on a mini lap of honour after politely shaking hands with Woodman, Hughes certainly looked a man back in his element. “We’ve got to be really on the money,” he said. “But, with a bit of luck I’m convinced we can do it.”As great escapes go it would be right up there.Explore more on these topicsCarlisleThe ObserverLeague TwoMark HughesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tuchel, though, talked about finding the right system for Bellingham and was open when asked if the 21-year-old was too individualistic last summer.“Yes,” Tuchel said. “He is always ready to give everything but we need to help him so that within a structure he can play more economically and still have the same impact, or maybe even more impact.“We need to make sure that the leaders, and he is one of the leaders, and the main players, walk in the same direction and play in the same rhythm and help each other out. And play a little more disciplined maybe, to save some energy for the decisive moments.”Tuchel was still effusive in his praise for Bellingham, saying it is a pleasure to work with him and describing the youngster as a team player who is “always able to make the difference”. He has already noticed, too, that he is one of the most vocal players on the pitch, both with teammates and officials.View image in fullscreenThomas Tuchel wants Jude Bellingham to learn how to channel his emotions better when he’s on the pitch for England.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/Shutterstock“He loves to talk to the referee and the linesmen,” Tuchel said. “He’s a very emotional player once he’s on the pitch and you just see that he hates to lose and does everything that it takes. He expresses himself.“You see the hunger and the desire to win. I think he will keep this hunger and learn to channel the emotions a little bit. That’s never a problem. It’s good to have him as he is. We will try to make the most out of it because he is a key player.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He wascritical of his starting wingers, Marcus Rashford and Phil Foden, and is likely to make changes when Latvia visit Wembley tomorrow. The Newcastle winger Anthony Gordon is being monitored after suffering a hip injury in the second half.“I’m not so sure why we struggled to have more impact with the wingers,” Tuchel said. “Why it was so difficult to find them in open spaces or deliver quicker to them. Or why they relied also heavily on passing and did not have enough dribbling or penetration without the ball. In general, we struggled to dare to take the risk.”Tuchel, who suggested that he does not mind winning ugly, is also learning about his new environment. “I have to adapt to the rhythm of international football,” he said. “Of course, the challenge is to prepare in three days, with 20 players from I don’t know, 10 or 12 clubs, one idea of football. I’m not the most patient guy in the world when it comes to that, but I will learn and push the players.”Explore more on these topicsJude BellinghamThe ObserverThomas TuchelEnglandWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersnewsShareReuse this content"

Clarke’s response has fully justified his remaining in post; Scotlandtake a narrow leadinto the second leg of the Nations League playoff against Greece, with the retaining of status in the top tier within touching distance. From lying on the canvas, the Scots are unbeaten in four and have won three in a row. This feels like a team on an upward curve once more. Scott McTominay, the goalscorer in Greece, has made plain that questioning Clarke was folly.“In the summer it was very fine margins,” McTominay said. “The media will always say it is doom and gloom, stuff like that. It was such slim margins where, if you don’t take your moments in both boxes against top teams, you are going to get punished.Scott McTominay on spot to sink Greece and put Scotland in driving seatRead more“I don’t really read or pay much attention to the criticism but from the general feeling from friends, family members, other players, then sometimes it was a bit unjustified given how well and what Steve Clarke has done for this whole group of players. He has basically transformed us into believing we can go and play against Spain, Germany and teams like that. If there is one game where it doesn’t come off then he still has belief in us the next time. For a player, that is crucial.”Clarke, who seems to have at least one eye on returning to club management after his contract with the Scottish Football Association expires next year, could do worse than turn to McTominay for a reference. While the 28-year-old’s sentiment is generally correct, Scotland werehumbled 5-1 by Germanyat the Euros. It was Hungary, not Spain, who ensured an early tournament exit. Shades of grey exist.Clarke himself is notably cautious over Scotland holding on to League A status. Hampden will rock to 50,000 members of the Tartan Army yet the outcome is no foregone conclusion. The rationale for Clarke’s stance does not so much involve Greece’s 2-1 win at Wembley in October but thedominant showing of Ivan Jovanovic’s teamduring the second half on Thursday. Scotland were fortunate to emerge with a lead, courtesy of McTominay’s hotly disputed penalty.“They will come and play their normal game,” said Clarke ofGreece. “They are very good on counterattack, as they were the other night. I think they showed in the game pretty much what their strengths are. Hopefully we uncovered one or two weaknesses we can build on.“They are a team who play very aggressive football. They want to get forward, they want to score goals. They are not interested in sitting in and defending. There were a couple of times they had everyone in the box then their big goalkeeper catches it and he’s immediately thrown to put us under a counterattack.”Scotland have placed huge stock in remaining in League A. That much is to their credit; it can cause chastening moments. “We have improved,” insisted the manager. “If you look at the world rankings, it will tell you different. That’s a little anomaly that seems to have popped up with theNations League. But as a team we have improved and the players have improved at this level too. We understand what it takes to win a game at this level.”Clarke’s selection conundrum involves who to sacrifice should he restore Ryan Christie to the midfield. Christie was suspended for the first leg but is typically a go-to player for his country. “I’ve seen Ryan a couple of times for Bournemouth,” Clarke explained. “People will tell you that he is playing a slightly deeper role but when you watch Bournemouth play, he is still the one who is leading the high press and is the one that gets after the game and gets forward to the edge of the box.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It does not matter where you play Ryan on the pitch, he brings energy and quality and that is what he always brings for us as well.” There will also be temptation to field Kieran Tierney, most likely in midfield as opposed to his typical defensive role.In big-picture terms,Scotlandview this clash as significant. They will also face Greece when on World Cup qualification duty. “I want to win this tie and show them that Hampden is a difficult place to come,” Clarke said. “So hopefully it will be a difficult game for them and it is going to be difficult when they come back here in October.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandThe ObserverNations LeagueGreecefeaturesShareReuse this content"

That led to negotiations being paused on the eve of the tournament after concerns they were proving a distraction.Spurs’ Lenna Gunning-Williams: ‘A lot of people believe I’m a real-life Jack Marshall’Read moreThe FA agreed to pay bonuses, although the matter wasonly resolved the month after they returnedfrom the tournament. England reached the final in Australia, wherethey were beaten 1-0 by Spain.Negotiations are continuing, with the talks being led on the players’ side by senior figures including Leah Williamson – the captain – and the Chelsea pair of Lucy Bronze and Millie Bright, with support from the Professional Footballers’ Association.Although the FA has accepted the principle of bonus payments and made an initial offer, the players are understood to be disappointed, with sources claiming it is lower than those offered to other leading international sides. Spain’s players received a bonus of about £250,000 each for winning the World Cup and have already agreed a potentially lucrative package for the European Championship.The Lionesses are understood to be seeking an increase on the £55,000 bonus per player they received for winning Euro 2022 on home soil, not least as Uefa has more than doubled the prize money made available to the 16 competing nations to £34m.The federation of the tournament winners in Switzerland will receive £4.3m from Uefa, which has stipulated that at least 30% of the prize money is passed on to the players. Beyond that, however, the level of bonus payments to be paid is discretionary.View image in fullscreenEngland’s players have shown great unity in the past in disputes with the FA.Photograph: Andrew Fosker/ShutterstockTheGuardianrevealed theoriginal bonus dispute two years ago, which led to the players releasing an unprecedented collective statement signed by all 25 members of the squad a week before their opening World Cup game against Haiti, in which they expressed “disappointment” at an issue they described as “key for the growth of women’s football in England”. While relations are better than at that stage and there is hope on both sides the matter will be resolved amicably, the players are understood to be disappointed it has taken this long.An source with knowledge of the talks said: “There are bound to be some difficulties as it’s a commercial negotiation. And that is increased in this instance, as there is a tension between the players’ push for greater equality and commercial realities. The players understandably want equality, but is that fair? There is the will on both sides to reach an agreement, but it’s a matter of time.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the stadium only provides a fraction of this sum, with a large tranche of public funds required to secure the venture.Graham Stringer, a Labour MP and former leader of Manchester city council, hit out at the project last week, describing it on the websiteConfidentials Manchesteras a “tax exile’s half-baked, misbegotten scheme”.Speaking to theObserver, Stringer, a United season ticket holder, said: “The stadium doesn’t happen without public funds. Any representations to local or central government for public money to go into this scheme should be refused.”He said the money could be used more effectively in other parts of GreaterManchesterand it was “outrageous” that Ratcliffe was pushing the government for public funds to help increase the value of his business.View image in fullscreenManchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe wants ministers to help support the club’s plans for a new stadium with public funds to regenerate the surrounding area.Photograph: Lucy North/PARatcliffe, chair of the petrochemicals company Ineos, agreed a deal in December 2023 tobuy a minority stake in Unitedworth about £1.25bn. He extended his shareholdings last year,now owning almost 29% of the club.The businessman, who was born seven miles up the A62 in Failsworth, Oldham, has used his fortune to back a string of sports teams, including the Ineos Britannia sailing team trying to win the America’s Cup and Ineos Grenadiers, one of the world’s most successful cycling teams.It was reported in 2019 that less than a year after he was knighted for services to business and investment, Ratcliffewas planning to avoid up to £4bn in taxby switching his residence and fortune to Monaco. Ratcliffe has responded that he employs thousands of people in the UK and contributes hundreds of millions of pounds to the economy.‘Eiffel Tower of the north’? Manchester United unveil 100,000-seat new stadium projectRead moreThe Glazer family, who made their fortune from shopping centres in the US, still control the majority of voting rights at United. Ineos, meanwhile, is in charge of sporting operations at the club.Since becoming co-owner, Ratcliffe has presided over approximately 450 job cuts at the club and other cost savings, includingclosing down the staff canteen at Old Trafford. He warned this month that United would have been “bust at Christmas” without these measures.Despite the financial struggles and the team languishing in 13th place in the Premier League table, Ratcliffe revealed this month that the club was backing plans for the100,000-capacity stadiumclose to the Old Trafford ground. He said that the proposed £2bn stadium – the centrepiece of a new regeneration project – would become a destination like the Eiffel Tower in Paris.The project envisages a vast canopy spanning the stadium and a public plaza twice the size of Trafalgar Square. The architect Foster + Partners, appointed by the club to develop the master plan for the scheme, said the stadium will overlook a “mixed-use miniature city of the future”.A reportcommissioned by United claimed the project could deliver an additional £7.3bn to the UK’s economy each year. The stadium itself would, however, only contribute an extra £243m a year to the local economy by these calculations, compared with the current Old Trafford ground.View image in fullscreenMan Utd’s current Old Trafford home would be replaced with a 100,000- capacity stadium.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PATony Syme, head of finance and economics at Salford University, said: “The overwhelming majority of economic impact comes from the regeneration, not the stadium itself.” He added that the biggest investment was likely to be from public funds required to prepare the site, create public amenities and build the infrastructure.The scheme has won the support of key backers, including Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, and Sebastian Coe, whochaired the Old Trafford regeneration taskforce, which investigated the options for the club’s home ground and infrastructure.Burnham has insisted no public funds will be used for the construction of the stadium, but has been lobbying for government funding for the wider regeneration scheme and site preparation. The construction of a new stadium would require the relocation of an adjacent rail freight hub at a cost of between £200m and £300m.The area surrounding the stadium, which is part of a growth area in Manchester known as the Western Gateway, would also be eligible for public funding. It is intended the use of public funds would help “pump-prime” private sector investment.Waseem Hassan, a Labour party councillor for Old Trafford, said he fully supported the project, but residents also wanted the club to contribute to the community. He said: “It needs to happen because we need regeneration in the north. We are asking the club to contribute to schools, infrastructure and the environment. ”View image in fullscreenA computer-generated image of the new Man Utd stadium’s interior.Photograph: Foster + Partner/APA Greater Manchester Combined Authority spokesperson said: “The Old Trafford regeneration scheme represents the biggest sports-led regeneration scheme since the London 2012 Olympics. As was the case in London, public sector funding can help to unlock sites and deliver infrastructure, enabling massive private sector investment. Public money would not be used to build a new stadium.”A spokesperson for Trafford council said: “This is a once-in-a-generation chance to totally transform Old Trafford and the surrounding area.“It will breathe new life into the region with the creation of tens of thousands of new jobs and much- needed new homes being built.“The next step will see us shortly appointing a team of consultants to devise a strategic master plan to map out how the regeneration project will look.”United declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedThe ObserverJim RatcliffeManchesterAndy BurnhamBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

David Raya has been excellent at Arsenal and Mark Flekken quietly impressive behind a loose Brentford defence. But that Sels has been the third-busiest keeper in the league (89 saves) behind Flekken and Southampton’s Aaron Ramsdale, yet has conceded the fourth-fewest goals (35) shows his importance, particularly when nine of Forest’s 16 league wins have been by one goal (even if his best stop, aremarkable fingertip save on to the baragainst Brighton, came rather unnecessarily in a 7-0 win).Right-back: Daniel Muñoz (Crystal Palace)With apologies to Ola Aina and Trent Alexander-Arnold, Muñoz gets the nod. The 28-year-old, signed from Belgian club Genk last year, is an elite dual threat, with and without the ball. The onlyPremier Leaguedefender to have more touches than Muñoz in the opposing box this season is City’s Josko Gvardiol and the only player to make more tackles is Everton’s Idrissa Gueye. The Colombian’s engine, tenacity and tactical understanding are fundamental to Palace’s 3-4-3 formation – only Liverpool and Arsenal have conceded fewer goals. “If you define a profile who fits the Premier League, it is Daniel Muñoz,” said Oliver Glasner after his player’s sublime goal at Fulham last month to finish off a lung-busting, box-to-box move.View image in fullscreenDaniel Muñoz (left) shows his tenacity up against Brighton’s Tariq Lamptey.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersCentre-back: Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)The best centre-back in the world, and it’s not even close. Van Dijk can do it all: dominant in both boxes and a supreme one-on-one defender, the 33-year-old also has top-tier passing and anticipation. The Dutchman is a leader and quarterback for his compatriot, Arne Slot – nobody has made more passes or touches in the Premier League this season. “No one is better than him in this position,” his teammate Ibrahima Konaté said in January. “I just want to be better than him one day.”Centre-back: Nikola Milenkovic (Nottingham Forest)There’s room for only one Forest centre-back and Nikola Milenkovic – nicknamed the Serbinator – just edges out his teammate Murillo (and Bournemouth’s Dean Huijsen). Last season, Forest conceded a league-high 23 goals from set pieces but Milenkovic’s aerial dominance during this campaign has been a huge reason why Forest are able to sit deep and absorb pressure and crosses before springing out on the counterattack. Milenkovic’s four goals, including two headers in the narrow wins overManchester Unitedand Aston Villa, have also proved crucial since his £12m summer move from Fiorentina.Left-back: Antonee Robinson (Fulham)Robinson’s 10 assists – onlyMohamed Salahhas more – have made him one of the league’s brightest performers. Marco Silva’s midfield became more defensive as the manager looked to make up for João Palhinha’s departure for Bayern Munich, which has given Robinson more licence to bomb on with his electric pace and much-improved crossing. Bournemouth’s Milos Kerkez can count himself unlucky to miss out to the USA international. Both are being linked with Liverpool – the city Robinson says “all my friends and family are from” after he grew up in Everton’s academy.View image in fullscreenAntonee Robinson challenges Tottenham’s Brennan Johnson for the ball.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersCentral midfield: Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United)In a dismal season for United,Fernandes has been one of the few bright spots. Ruben Amorim’s captain has worn criticism throughout his United career but only Kevin De Bruyne (90) has more assists across all competitions in Europe’s top five leagues than Fernandes (80) since the Portuguese joined United in 2020. Fernandes has eight goals and nine assists this season but what is less noticed is his effectiveness in deeper areas. Only Ryan Christie and Moisés Caicedo have more ball recoveries than Fernandes, who also leads the league (by a distance) in progressive passes (231).Central midfield: Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool)Gravenberch has epitomised the Slot revolution and provides much-needed balance in this midfield. Underwhelming under Jürgen Klopp, Gravenberch has shone as a mobile, silky, powerful No 6 able to pick a pass, carry the ball through midfield and cover ground defensively to stop opposition attacks – nobody in the league has made more interceptions (50). Liverpool’sfailure to convince Martín Zubimendito leave Real Sociedad turned out to be a blessing for Slot.Attacking midfield: Cole Palmer (Chelsea)Form and fitness have abandoned Chelsea’s talisman in recent weeks, but 14 goals and six assists are still ridiculous for a midfielder in March, even one who hasn’t scored in 10 games. Palmer made history against Brighton in September as the first Premier League player to scorefour goals in the first half, but the way he has constantly linked play for Chelsea has been almost as impressive. Don’t forgetthatball to set up Chelsea’s opener against Newcastle, surely the pass of the season so far. Palmer oozes class.Left-wing: Matheus Cunha (Wolves)Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo and Justin Kluivert were contenders but the 13 goals and four assists Cunha has registered for a poor, relegation-battling team move the Brazilian into this XI. Disciplinary problems and body language aside, Cunha has been sensational for Wolves, who would be in the bottom three without him.View image in fullscreenMatheus Cunha lets fly from 25 yards to score a brilliant goal in the FA Cup against Bournemouth.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAStriker: Chris Wood (Nottingham Forest)No centre-forward has had a bigger impact on their side’s fortunes this season than Wood. Forest create far fewer big chances than their top-four rivals – the club are 10th in the Premier League for that metric, just above Everton – yet Wood’s clinical finishing to net 18 goals – scoring 34% of his chances and outperforming his xG by a league-high seven goals – means Nuno Espírito Santo’s side are edging towards a shock Champions League qualification.Right-wing: Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)Well clear at the top of the scoring (27 goals) and assist charts (17), Salah is the first name on the team sheet as he spearheads Liverpool’s title charge and puts himselfinto Ballon d’Or contention. He is on course to smash the Premier League record of 47 goal involvements, jointly held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer from 42-game seasons. It seems preposterous that Liverpool could lose him for free this summer.Manager: Nuno Espírito Santo (Nottingham Forest)Replacing a club managerial legend is not easy: just ask David Moyes (at Manchester United) and Unai Emery (at Arsenal). Where those two failed, Slot has succeeded and he should be lauded for leading Liverpool to the verge of the title. But Liverpool’s success cannot compare with Nottingham Forest’s remarkable improvement: 17th last season, now third. Only one player last summer cost more than £13m, yet Nuno has brought the best out of every squad member and has a clear tactical identity. The Champions League (and possible FA Cup glory) beckons.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueThe ObserverNottingham ForestCrystal PalaceLiverpoolFulhamManchester UnitedChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Draper fell back to earth with an unsatisfying 7-6 (2), 7-6 (3) defeat to the 19-year-old Jakub Mensik of the Czech Republic in the second round of the Miami Open.Emma Raducanu finds ‘third wind’ to overcome Navarro in Miami Open epicRead moreDraper’s Indian Wells title run had begun with him demonstrating his experience against the 18-year-old João Fonseca, the youngest player in the ATP top 100. This time, he was unable to escape another difficult draw against an extremely talented teenager. Mensik, who is ranked No 54, saw off Draper, the sixth seed, with an incredible serving performance that yielded 21 aces.For a short while, Draper seemed to have picked up where he left off fromlast Sunday’s demolition of Holger Runein Indian Wells as he burst into the match lasering forehands and serving efficiently.However, as Mensik warmed into the match, showing off his own potent serve and forehand, Draper’s intensity sharply dropped. He spent much of the set audibly fighting with himself as he tried to reestablish his intensity and range on his groundstrokes. As Draper took those issues into the tie-break, Mensik served immaculately to snatch the set.The second set followed a similar pattern as Draper was a step behind throughout. It took a significant effort from the British No 1 to hold on to his serve and save six break points throughout the set while Mensik rolled through most of his own games. The one-sided tie-break was a logical conclusion to a deceptively one-sided set.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Draper will leave Miami frustrated in his inability to maintain the momentum he built in Indian Wells, but a mental and physical letdown after such a breakthrough was always a possibility. With the humidity in Miami making for heavier balls and different conditions, the transition to Miami is challenging in many ways. For Draper, this should be a valuable lesson as he aims to perform at the highest level on a consistent basis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She improved on the morning’s semis by running 7.11secs in the final, and said: “I can’t believe I’m fifth in the world in an event that nobody thinks I can do apart from me and my coach!“That was one of the most fun races I have ever done in my life and at the end of the day that’s what it is all about. I was smiling at the start line, I was stood next to the world champion and I nearly had them. A few inches off, a couple more metres I would have got them.”There was disappointment for the pole vaulter Molly Caudery, who was unable to defend her title from Glasgow 2024 in a competition plagued by technical issues. The 25-year-old, who has experienced an injury-hampered start to her season, finished fourth.She said: “It was definitely not what I wanted but I am disappointed to say the least. It was a really, really, tough competition and there were a lot of technical issues, but I don’t want to put any excuses out.“If there is an hour wait in the middle of the competition when it’s getting to those medal bars – the really important bars – it shouldn’t be happening at a competition like this. The girls did struggle with that – as did I – it ruins the flow and even I know we were all deflated after, but that’s championships for you.”There are more British medal hopes on Sunday’s final day of competition.

I just wanted to bridge that gap and I did that today,” he said.“With 800m to go, I saw a gap, and thought, ‘why not?’. We’re here on the world stage, we’re here to win, I had to give it my best crack because you never know if you get that opportunity again.“I don’t want to look back in 30 years’ time and think ‘what if?’”Hitting the front with three-and-a-half laps left, Robinson was knocked back to fourth but then rallied on the home straight to edge past American Sam Gilman by 0.1sec to grab third in 7:47.09.View image in fullscreenKy Robinson celebrates his bronze medal.Photograph: Vincent Thian/APUp ahead, Ingebrigtsen outstayed Ethiopia’s Berihu Aregawi (7:46.25) to win in 7:46.09, putting himself in the position to emulate the great Haile Gebrselassie’s 1500/3,000m double in 1999 in Sunday’s metric mile final.Hopes of a third Australian medal sank when Kurtis Marschall (5.80 metres) could only finish fifth in a men’s pole vault final inevitably dominated by the great Armand ‘Mondo’ Duplantis, who completed his 100th vault over six metres before sealing yet another global triumph with a 6.15m clearance.Torrie Lewis couldn’t make the women’s 60m final, unable to get near her recently-set Australian national record of 7.14sec as she bowed out fourth in her semi in 7.23sec.

Her stance was supported by the UK’s data watchdog, indicating that the case will set a precedent for millions of UK users of online platforms.O’Carroll said the support of the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) meant “the writing is on the wall” for Meta and its advertising-based business model.“This is an individual settlement, but I believe its ramifications extend far beyond me,” said O’Carroll. “The key factor is the UK data protection authority, which backed my case and has publicly stated that it will support people in the UK who wish to exercise their right to object to online targeted ads. I think that beyond the life of this case, the writing is on the wall for Meta – people want a choice on surveillance ads, and the right to object gives them exactly that.”On Friday, both sides settled the lawsuit, with O’Carroll claiming a “victory” after Meta committed to stop using her personal data to target her with bespoke adverts. O’Carroll’s argument was supported by the ICO, which said “people have the right to object to their personal information being used for direct marketing”.The ICO added that users should have an “opt out” from their data being used to create targeted ads. It said: “Organisations must respect people’s choices about how their data is used. This means giving users a clear way to opt out of their data being used in this way.”O’Carroll said the ICO’s verdict, which the regulator made clear in a submission to the high court, could pave the way for more lawsuits on a similar basis.“This settlement represents not just a victory for me, but for everyone who values their fundamental right to privacy,” said O’Carroll. “None of us signed up to be trapped into decades of surveillance advertising, held hostage by the threat of losing the ability to connect with our loved ones online.”Meta said it “fundamentally” disagreed with O’Carroll’s claims and took its obligations under the UK’s privacy law, GDPR, seriously. It added that it was weighing the option of introducing a subscription service in the UK, whereby users would pay a fee for an ad-free service. Advertising accounts for approximately 98% of Meta’s revenue.“We are exploring the option of offering people based in the UK a subscription and will share further information in due course,” said Meta.Last year the ICO said it was looking at how UK data protection law would apply to an ad-free subscription service.Commenting on the case, the former UK attorney general Dominic Grieve said: “Big tech companies should not be above the law. If companies like Meta want to operate in the UK, they should be directed to follow the same legal standards as everyone else – respecting people’s privacy rights, not exploiting them at any cost.”Meta already offers ano-ads paid-for service in the EUaftera 2023 rulingby the European court of justice, the highest in the EU.Explore more on these topicsMetaFacebookInstagramSocial mediaTechnology sectorPrivacynewsShareReuse this content"

Norms change, and that’s often for the best. But when it comes to laptops in cafes,falling from favouras owners lose patience with remote workers, I am begging society to reconsider. Don’t take my cafe nook – it’s the only thing keeping the WFH brigade and lonely freelancers like me sane.My kitchen table, where I do most of my work, is fine. It’s got a window next to it. There’s a kettle I can use whenever I like. I can play my own music, make loud phone calls and migrate to the sofa when being upright gets a bit much. But variety is the spice of life, and truly I would lose my mind if those were my only options. Yes, I’m aware of co-working spaces, but they are a) full of awful people and b) I can’t afford one. Luckily, the buzz of the outside world, the soothing white noise of life beyond my keyboard’s tip-tapping, is only as far away as the nearest cafe – for now.Flexibility to work anywhere is one of my favourite things about my job as a writer – yet, this great privilege has been abused by my fellow laptop nomads, to the extent that we risk it being taken away altogether. Shouting into Zoom calls, hogging tableswhile spending a pittance, it’s no wonder that our antics irk cafe owners – buying one cup of tea and sitting there all day is clearly bad manners, not to mention bad business.It’s also true that a sea of laptops changes a place’s vibe, from chatty community hub to co-working space (insufferable, as discussed); no doubt the ratio of we laptoppers to other punters must be as carefully calibrated as our behaviour. Thankfully, after years of field research – I’ve been at this since before the pandemic, if you can imagine – I have developed a code of conduct to ensure the harmonious continuance of the cafe-laptop ecosystem. And you’re going to have to listen, because if we keep messing this up, it’s kitchen tables for ever, OK?Laughter not laptops: cafe culture fights back against keyboard invadersRead moreFirst rule is limiting cafe-laptop time to four hours, spending about £5 every two. If you insist on being in situ all day, you should buy at least one meal as well. Second – absolutely no Zoom or phone calls, no exceptions. It is the laptop worker’s job to integrate seamlessly into the cafe environment, not steamroll it with performative productivity. If you’ve got a call, stay at home or step outside, buddy.Then, it should go without saying that you take the smallest table available – no lounging over a four-top when it’s just you and your MacBook. Also, don’t pester staff for somewhere to charge your phone or your laptop if there isn’t a plug socket evidently available – they’re there to serve food and drinks, not facilitate your makeshift office. And obviously – OBVIOUSLY – don’t play your own music out loud; it shouldn’t need saying, but a guy I encountered in Costa the other day certainly hadn’t got that particular memo. Fingers crossed he’s reading now, because otherwise our exile from cafes across the land is all but assured.In summary, don’t overstay your welcome, pay your way, and behave as though you are grateful – rather than entitled – to be there. Basically: don’t take the mick.Much as manyBrits abroad make me want to crawl under a rock or assume a French accent, the conduct of some of my fellow cafe-laptoppers oftenmakes me ashamed to count myself among them – but despite the understandable ill will towards us, there’s no reason we can’t get the show back on the road.Cafes are not only a pleasant setting for work, but a natural one – as their intellectual origins testify, they’ve always been a place to nurture ideas. Generative and convivial, the atmosphere of a cafe is often just what I need to get moving with a piece of work that’s dragging its feet – but also, it reminds me that other humans exist (I believe most people get this from offices?). Truly, a resource too valuable to lose. Just think, if we really do get turfed out, left only with kitchens and co-working, I might have to resort to getting a real job.Emily Watkins is a freelance writer based in LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Eventually, the tech commentariat decided that there could be only two possible interpretations of this corporate standoffishness: either Apple was way behind the game being played by OpenAIet al; or it had cunning plans to unleash upon the world its own world-beating take on the technology.Finally, at its annual World Wide Developers’ Conference (WWDC) on 10 June last year Apple came clean. Or appeared to. For Apple, “AI” would not mean what those vulgar louts at OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and Meta raved about, but something altogether more refined and sophisticated – something called “Apple Intelligence”. It was not, as the veteranApple-watcher John Gruber put it, a single thing or product but “a marketing term for a collection of features, apps, and services”. Putting it all under a single, memorable label made it easier for users to understand that Apple was launching something really novel. And, of course, it also made it easier for Apple to say that users who wanted to have all of these fancy features would have to buy an iPhone 15 Pro, because older devices wouldn’t be up to the task.Needless to say, this columnist fell for it and upgraded. (Verily, one sucker is born every minute.) As a piece of kit, the new phone was impressive: the powerful new processor chips, neural engine etc worked a treat. And the camera turned out to be astonishingly good. But the Apple Intelligence features enabled by the upgrade seemed trivial and sometimes irritating. It immediately started messing with my photo collection, for example, imposing categories on images that were intrusive, unwanted and annoying. And there was a new pre-installed app called Image Playground that apparently “makes communication and self-expression even more fun” – which might possibly be true if one were a four-year-old with a short attention span, but is otherwise a turkey from central casting and should have been strangled at birth.There was one feature, though, that looked interesting and possibly useful – a serious enhancement of Siri, Apple’s attempt at a virtual personal assistant. Henceforth, thecompany announced: “Siri will be able to deliver intelligence that’s tailored to the user and their on-device information. For example, a user can say, ‘Play that podcast that Jamie recommended,’ and Siri will locate and play the episode, without the user having to remember whether it was mentioned in a text or an email. Or they could ask, ‘When is Mom’s flight landing?’ and Siri will find the flight details and cross-reference them with real-time flight tracking to give an arrival time.”If Apple had stuck to the Jobs playbook, the time to have launched the enhancement would have been June this year at the earliestOn closer inspection, though, Siri – even running on my expensive new phone – could do none of these useful things. In fact, it mostly seemed as banal as ever. And then, on 7 March, came anannouncement from Apple: “We’ve also been working on a more personalised Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It’s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.”For Gruber, who knows more about Apple than anyone I know, this was like a red rag to a bull. The announcement meant,he wrote, that “what Apple showed regarding the upcoming ‘personalized Siri’ at WWDC was not a demo. It was a concept video. Concept videos are bullshit, and a sign of a company in disarray, if not crisis”. And because he has a long memory, it reminded him that the last time Apple had screened a concept video – the so-called“Knowledge Navigator” video– it was heading for bankruptcy. And it never made anything like it again once Steve Jobs had returned to turn it into the most profitable company in history.Until – says Gruber – now.Is he overreacting? Answer: yes. Apple isn’t in crisis, but this mini-fiasco with Siri and Apple Intelligence looks like the first serious misstep in Tim Cook’s stewardship of the company. If there’s one thing Jobs’ Apple was famous for, it was not announcing products before they were ready to ship. It’s clear that the company grossly underestimated the amount of work needed to deliver on what it promised for Siri last June. If it had stuck to the Jobs playbook, the time to have launched the enhancement would have been June 2025 at the earliest. The company had clearly forgottenHofstadter’s Law: Everything takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.What I’ve been readingA million monkeys…ChatGPT Can’t Kill Anything Worth Preserving is amarvellous essayby John Warner on AI and writing.Machines of loving grace?AI: A Means to an End or a Means to Our End?Read Stephen Fry’s unmissable inaugural lecture to King’s College London’s Digital Futures Institute on theobsession du jour.It’s written in the cardsJillian Hess’s account on her Substack of Carl Linnaeus’sgroundbreaking note-taking practiceis illuminating.Explore more on these topicsAppleThe networkerArtificial intelligence (AI)Tim CookSoftwareComputingcommentShareReuse this content"

It is a huge intelligence amplifier’Zoë CorbynThe co-founder of LinkedIn and Democrat donor remains confident that AI can be good for all of us – if its introduction is handled in the right waySat 22 Mar 2025 14.00 EDTShareReid Hoffman is a prominent Silicon Valley billionaire entrepreneur and investor known for co-founding the professional social networking siteLinkedIn, now owned by Microsoft. He’s also staunchly anti-Trump. The longtime Democrat donor threw his support behind Kamala Harris in the race for the White House. Hoffman spoke to theObserverabout technology in the new political milieu and his new book about our future with artificial intelligence,Superagency. The book, while not ignoring the problems that AI might cause,argues that the technology is poised to give us cognitive superpowers that will increase our individual and collective human agency, creating a state of widespread empowerment for society.You have a vested interest in being positive about AI, including a company focused on conversational AI for business,Inflection AI.Why should we listen to you?First, an economic interest doesn’t necessarily make what someone is saying wrong, and I try to be transparent and not hide mine. Second, I tend to start with my beliefs and follow with my money. And sometimes that does mean doing things that are against my economic interests. Not kissing [Trump’s] ring, like many others have, is probably an economic limiter – but it’s better to be principled. I could have put the time and energy I spent writingSuperagencyinto my companies and made much more money, but I want to share in the intellectual discourse.What’s your hope for the book?I want to at the very least make people AI-curious, so they begin to explore what these superpowers we all might be getting are. There’s a flood of discussion around AI that tends to be negative and concerns a decrease in human agency. And, while that is a common response to new technologies, in previous cases it hasn’t come to pass – human agency has increased – and I predict the AI revolution will land in the same place. But there is a turbulent transition. I am calling it the “cognitive Industrial Revolution” not only because of the anticipated superpowers and superagency we will gain, but because, like the Industrial Revolution, the transition will be difficult. We can get through it with less pain and more grace, as well as improve the state that we’re moving towards, if we use a techno-humanist compass that points us towards building technologies that increase human agency.I do believe AI will primarily still end up being a co-pilot, though obviously some job types will disappearYou argue that AI chatbots such asChatGPThave been a turning point in increasing human agency because, comparedwith AI technologies such as facial recognition, predictive policing and algorithmic surveillance, they workforus andwithus rather thanonus and we must affirmatively choose to use them. But they can still guide us towards certain viewpoints, numb our critical thinking and, of course, potentially upend our jobs–which would seem to undermine human agency.To take jobs, they are being transformed, andinformation professionals will need to be using AI tools to do part of their work. If you don’t you will be under-tooled and won’t be competitive. And you may feel that as a loss of agency. You don’t want to change but you can’t choose not to. But then you begin to see the upside: repetitive tasks might be automated, creative processes accelerated. You get a lot more agency and so do other people.So we won’t all become obsolete?I do believe AI will primarily still end up being a co-pilot, though obviously some job types will disappear. We will need to build technologies that can help people whose jobs are changing adapt or, if the job does completely goes away, find other jobs that they can learn and possibly do with AI.You label those who fret about AI’s near-term risks and harms as “gloomers” – but isn’t it important to be critical of new technology?Yes, but where the implication is we should stop or massively slow down – it isn’t helpful. Not least because the countries that adopt the cognitive Industrial Revolution early and firmly will win massive amounts of economic strength, and their values will end up shaping the world. I want western democracies to get there ahead of others like China that are trying to embrace it through autocracy.You get to the good future by steering towards it. Not that you don’t pay attention to the bad futures – but you do so as you’re figuring out how to navigate the right way. You adopt an iterative deployment stance – testing deliberately incremental versions en masse in the real world and then looking at where the critiques play and adjusting (which is how OpenAI has rolled out ChatGPT).Where’s the leadership among wealthyDemocrats against Trump? Or are people lying low fearing political retribution, whichyou have saidyou are worried about?Personally, I am regrouping. The point, for me, isn’t fighting Trump. It is helping humanity and making society better, including American society. And you might say that because this administration is not going to listen to my ideas about what the government should be doing on AI, maybe I should focus on contributing elsewhere. I recently launched Manas AI, centred on discovering drugs to cure cancer, and I also recently became a fellow of the London School of Economics, helping them think about how AI reinvents the university.That said, obviously I’ve been dismayed and deeply concerned about various things that have happened since Trump took office, including seemingly allying with Russia and Putin and standing down our offensive cyber operations.You are among thefew tech moguls who haven’t cosied up to President Trump. What should we conclude about the morality of this industryas it rolls back DEI (diversity) initiatives and drops factchecking, as Meta has done?I do have some quieter friends! The technology industry should be in dialogue and taking some of its cues from a government elected by democratic vote. The fact that you don’t happen to like this government doesn’t negate that. But, on the other hand, there are things being done that are, frankly, bad for society. While one could easily argue some DEI initiatives have gone too far and it’s good to adjust them, some of DEI is civil rights – which, unequivocally, it is good to be for.I obviously disagree with some of the moves that have been made to remove factchecking. We have anti-vax claims in various social networking platforms that are pretty easily false and a double-digit percentage of Americans who believe various vaccine-related conspiracy theories. That kind of level of disinformation within society makes it hard for democracies to operate. LinkedIn gets criticised as boring – but it exemplifies a lot of what I think should be happening on social networks around factchecking.View image in fullscreenElon Musk with Donald Trump outside the White House.Photograph: ShutterstockHow worrying has it been to watch the “move fast and break things” tech approach being applied to the US federal government by Doge[Elon Musk’sdepartment of government effeciency], in some cases reportedly using AI software to identify budget cuts?I expect most business people, including myself, would think that figuring out how to make government more efficient is a good goal. But you can do it in a way that’s less destructive, less cruel and more lawful than is being done. Firing all these experts and then trying to rehire them: it is a hot mess of incompetent behaviour. Even doing it hard and fast, there are ways – they could have asked for memos about the programmes they were thinking of cutting. The “I’ll just cancel all of it and then we’ll see what happens” is a path that comes with massive external costs.You and Elon Musk used to be friends. But he has accused you and continues to repeat the accusation that you were one of Jeffrey Epstein’s clients – which you have said is “slander and a lie” and that your only involvement with Epstein, which you have apologised for, was in helping the MIT Media Lab fundraise.Any plans to take legal action?I have yet to ever personally bring a lawsuit. I tend to be a builder and a maker and legal action of this sort is very difficult in the US. I have thought about also calling for the Epstein files to be released to bring out the truth. But then do I really want to get into that tar pit? I question Elon’s motives for saying these things given now he’s in government. I think he is trying to smear me to try to make my voice less relevant to the American people.How do you AI-proof yourself? What’s your advice to a young adult thinking about a career path?I don’t think it is AI-proofing yourself; it is AI-amplifying yourself. The important thing is to be engaging with AI and learning the tools. And young people have a real advantage: because they are interested in and tend to adopt new technologies readily, they can bring a skill set and mindset to the workplace that can help the workplace transform.Your previous book,Impromptu, is described as written “by Reid Hoffmanwith ChatGPT-4” and it documents your conversations with the chatbot. To what extent did you use AI to write this book?While [my co-author and I] feel we own every word here, we used it a lot! For research, to give us the pros and cons of what we were arguing in various sections, and to suggest rewrites of paragraphs to give them more zing. My recommendation to all writers is to start using AI deeply. It is a huge intelligence amplifier. And I don’t think it is necessary the way we used it – which wasn’t wholesale quoting – to say “written with AI”. It is would be like saying “written with a Mac”.How should we regulate AI? Biden’s 2023 executive order, which was the closest the US had to any federal AI regulation and was aimed at trying to reduce its risks, has been rescinded by Trump, who described it as a barrier to American AI innovation.Regulation should be iterative – like deployment. So certainly, regulation as we go and even some regulation now. The Biden executive order was directionally right, meant as it was to tackle major harms rather than any harm you could think of, and hopefully it is just cancelled in name. But it isn’t just regulation. Feedback from customers, employees, the public are all part of steering the path here. And benchmarks and metrics can be important too as a non-legally binding way of shelving algorithms that perform poorly.Are we going to end up with chatbots built on partisan large language models (LLMs) that steer clear of truth and reinforce our own worldviews?Obviously, it’s not good for us to be in complete filter bubbles. And I think you will get some of that with some LLMs. I am a fan of identifying the principles you are training your LLM on and then articulating a reasoned argument for that. So: I’m the “anti-woke” LLM because I believe this, this and this, or I’m an LLM that will let you know when there’s a big swath of people who disagree with you because I think it is important for you to be informed. Then people will know what they are using.Is technologists’ holy grail of reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI) – in which AI can perform any intellectual task that a human can and which many expect will be achieved before the end of the decade – needed for the cognitiveIndustrial Revolution?Not necessarily, although it would be an even further amplification. LLMs today are enabling us to do things that no human being can do, in terms of the breadth of knowledge, and bringing things together. I do think that within three years the tools will be good enough that, if you’re not using them, it will be like a professional not having a mobile phone. But whether we are talking about AGI or even artificial super intelligence (ASI) [greatly exceeding human cognitive abilities], and which I think is at least decades away, we should try to shape them in a way that’s good for us and good for society. Let’s make sure ASIs are essentially Buddhist in their values.Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right With Our AI Future?by Reid Hoffman and Greg Beato is published by Authors Equity (£22).

His denunciations came as his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) faces sweeping and numerouslegal challengesto its gutting overhaul of the government, which has involved firing thousands of workers and gaining access to sensitive government data.Judge blocks Elon Musk’s Doge from accessing social security recordsRead moreDoge is the subject of nearly two dozen lawsuits, which in some cases have already resulted in judges imposingmore transparencyon Musk’s initiative or reversing parts of its rapid-fire cuts at federal agencies. The legal pushback poses one of the most significant challenges to Musk’s plans, which for weeks after inauguration day involved operating with expansive powers and little evident oversight.While Musk posts online, he is also directing some of his immense wealth towards those who support his cause. Musk donated funds to seven Republican members of Congress who called for impeaching judges, theNew York Times reported, giving the maximum allowable donation of $6,600 to their campaigns.Musk also launched a petition on Thursday against “activist judges” via his political action group America Pac, which offered registered voters in Wisconsin $100 if they signed. Musk’s Pac hasfunneled millions of dollarsinto the state’s 1 April supreme court race, in which he is backing a former Republican attorney general in another attempt to reshape the country’s courts.Musk’s campaign against judges has intensified amid awider clashbetween theTrump administrationand the judiciaryover the rule of lawfollowing court decisions who pushed back against the administration’s mass deportations of immigrants. It follows longstanding behavior from Trump to rail against judges that have ruled against him in cases concerning his businesses or personal matters.The White House’s fight with judges escalated to the point where John Roberts, the supreme court chief justice, issued arare public statementon Tuesday defending the justice system.“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” Roberts wrote. “The normal appellate process exists for that purpose.”Musk responded in apost on Xone day later.“For more than two centuries, there has never such [sic] extreme abuse of the legal system by activists pretending to be judges,” he wrote. “Impeach them.”Legal pushback against Doge angers MuskLabor groups, watchdog organizations and former government workers have filed lawsuits in response to Doge’s blitz through federal agencies in late January and February, alleging that Musk’s initiative acted without legal authority andviolated lawson privacy and transparency. Although the justice system’s response is not as rapid as the breakneck pace of Doge’s cuts, several of the cases against Musk’s efforts are now beginning to throw up roadblocks for him and his team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The justice ordered the Trump administration to halt terminations of employees and reinstate their access to certain computer systems. Doge haddramatically taken overthe agency in early February and moved to close its operations, which Musk boasted involved “feeding USAID into the wood chipper”.Judge Theodore Chuang found that Musk’s actions at the agency likely violated the constitution given his role as an unelected adviser who did not undergo Senate confirmation.Doge faced another setback on Thursday, as a different Maryland district court judge temporarilyblocked Musk’s teamfrom accessing Social Security Administration systems. A lawsuit against Doge argued that granting access to millions of people’s personal data at the agencyviolates privacy lawsand represents a security threat. Another district court ruling last week ordered the Trump administration toreinstate probationary workerswho were fired en masse at 18 government agencies, while a separate case compelled Musk’s team toproduce internal recordsabout its staff and operations.As Musk and Trump officials have ramped up their attacks on judges, multiple justices told Reuters earlier this month that US marshalswarned themthey are facing unusually high threat levels against their personal safety.Musk calls for impeachment and remaking the judiciaryMusk has reacted to the court decisions with outrage and unsubstantiated accusations that the judges are “rogue activists” who must be stopped, a message also shared by Republican lawmakers and Trump. On X, theTeslaCEO has amplified far-right influencers who have called for impeaching justices or targeted specific judges in posts.“An activist judge is no judge at all, just someone wearing a costume,” Musk responded to a post from rightwing commentator Matt Walsh that suggested Trump should “go to war against activist judges”.Musk has also received support from foreign leaders who have attacked their countries’ judiciaries and challenged the rule of law. He responded with a “100” emoji to a post from Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that claimed “when a strong right wing leader wins an election, the leftist Deep State weaponizes the justice system”. Netanyahu attempted in 2023 to weaken the power of Israel’s judiciary, promptingnationwide protestsand fears of a constitutional crisis.Democrats train fire on Musk as unelected billionaire dips in popularityRead moreEl Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele’s partyousted all supreme court judgesin 2021 as human rights groups warned about a slide into authoritarianism, has become a repeated point of comparison for Musk. He retweeted a post from Bukele on Tuesday that claimed the “U.S. is facing a judicial coup” and repeated that language himself in later posts.In another post, Musk responded “it is the only way” to a failed far-right US congressional candidate who suggested that the country should emulate El Salvador by investigating politicians and impeaching “all corrupt judges”. The former candidate, Valentina Gomez,received media attentionlast year for a campaign video in which she burned LGBTQ+-themed books with a flamethrower.Musk, who has met with Bukele and praised his strongman presidency, has also previously suggested he wants to carry out a similar hollowing out of the judiciary.“The only way to restore rule of the people in America is to impeach judges,” Musk tweeted on 25 February, reposting Bukele. “That is what it took to fix El Salvador. Same applies to America.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskUS politicsLaw (US)Trump administrationDonald TrumpUSAidnewsShareReuse this content"

It was for an “AI-assisted sports reporter” at USA Today’s publisher, Gannett. It was billed as a role at the “forefront of a new era in journalism”, but came with a caveat: “This is not a beat-reporting position and does not require travel or face-to-face interviews.” The dark humour was summed up by football commentator, Gary Taphouse: “It was fun while it lasted.”As the relentless march of artificial intelligence continues, newsrooms are wrestling with the threats and opportunities the technology creates. Just in the past few weeks, one media outlet’s AI project was accused of softening the image of the Ku Klux Klan. AI is also playing a part in some British journalists recording more than 100 bylines in a day. Amid the angst over the technology, however, a broad consensus is beginning to emerge about what the technology is currently capable of doing accurately.Yet media companies are already aware of an elephant in the room. Their calculations could be upended should users simply turn to AI assistants to get their content fix. “I think good quality information can rise in an age of AI,” said one UK media executive. “But we need to set the terms in the right way in the next couple of years, or we are all screwed.”The speed at which the technology has arrived has brought some early case studies in journalistic misadventure. In early March, the LA Times launched an AI tool giving alternative perspectives on opinion pieces. Itcaused alarmby saying some local historians regarded the Ku Klux Klan as a “‘white Protestant culture’ responding to societal changes rather than an explicitly hate-driven movement, minimising its ideological threat”. The pitfall, said one media executive looking at AI, was obvious: “It was given a task of making judgments it can’t possibly be expected to make.”The fact that even a tech giant like Apple had tosuspend a featurethat made inaccurate summaries of BBC News headlines shows just how hard it can be to ensure the accuracy of generative AI.In reality, teams of journalists and tech tool designers have been working for years to find the best AI uses. In terms of public content, publishers are clustering around using it to suggest small chunks of text, based on original journalism. In practice, that means headline suggestions and story summaries, easily checked by human editors. The Independent became the latest to announce this week that it would be publishing condensed AI versions of its own stories. Many publishers are trialling or have already deployed similar tools.View image in fullscreenThe Make It Fair campaign was developed to raise awareness among the British public about the existential threat posed to the creative industries from generative AI models.Photograph: Geoffrey Swaine/Rex/ShutterstockSome big organisations have also been experimenting with their own AI chatbots, allowing readers to ask questions using content from their own archives. The problem is that editors cannot possibly know the answers being spat out. Attached to the Washington Post’s chatbot feature is the note: “This is an experiment … Because AI can make mistakes, please verify the response by consulting these articles.”The amount of AI-assisted text that can be safely overseen by human editors is a live issue. Reach, publisher of the Daily Mirror and a series of other local sites, has been using its Guten tool to repackage its own journalism for different audiences. It has contributed to some eye-wateringly high byline counts for some journalists. On one day in January, one regional Reach reporter recorded 150 bylines or joint bylines across the group’s titles. While he did not use Guten himself, the technology was used to repurpose his work for other sites.Some Reach journalists have privately expressed concern. A Reach spokesperson said Guten was only a tool and “needs to be used thoughtfully” by journalists. “We’re encouraged by the progress we’ve made in reducing errors and supporting our everyday work,” they said. “This has enabled us to free-up journalists to spend more time on journalism which would otherwise go unreported.”USA Today Network made the same point about its AI-assisted sports reporter post. “By leveraging AI, we are able to expand coverage and enable our journalists to focus on more in-depth sports reporting,” said a spokesperson.Others doubt whether the time saved will go into original journalism. The former Independent editor Chris Blackhurst said recently he was “very cynical” about the idea, fearing it was more likely to be“freeing people up to work elsewhere”.While publicly visible AI-assisted journalism has created the most debate, it is actually inside newsrooms that the technology is providing gains, interrogating huge datasets. The FT, the New York Times and the Guardian are among the groups exploring the technique. It has already helped find severe cases of neglect from more than1,000 pages of hospital documents in Norway. Transcription and translation are other more everyday uses.Others are using it for “social listening”. The News Movement, which aims content at a younger audience, has built a tool that monitors what its audience are talking about on social media and feeds it back to journalists. “It helps us understand what conversations and topics people are currently having,” said Dion Bailey, its chief product and technology officer. Despite the angst about AI errors, some companies, such as Der Spiegel, are actually trying to use AI to factcheck content.What is coming next? According to academic research, it is “audience-facing format transformations”. In other words, taking a story and turning it into the kind of content that a user wants – be it condensed, audio or even video. About a third of media leaders surveyed by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism said they wanted to experiment with turning text stories into video. Tools can already turn long footage into short, shareable content.Yet hanging over all this newsroom innovation is the fear that it could all be for nought if personal AI chatbots take the place of media companies in producing content. “What keeps me up at night is AI simply inserting itself between us and the user,” said one media figure. Google’s launch this month of a new “AI Mode”, which takes information from multiple sources and presents them as a chatbot, has spooked the industry. Some believe government intervention is the only solution.Some bigger media groups have been signing licensing deals with the owners of the main AI model owners, allowing the models to be trained on their original material with attribution. The Guardian has sucha deal with OpenAI, owner of ChatGPT. Meanwhile, the New York Times is leading a lawsuitagainst OpenAI for using its work.Bailey shares the concerns, but retains hope that the media world can adapt. “If the power goes to two or three big tech companies, then we have some real, significant issues,” he said. “We need to adapt in terms of how people are able to get to us. That’s just a fact.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)NewspapersNewspapers & magazinesNews agenciesInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

There is no satisfying Trump. He will move the goalposts again and againSat 22 Mar 2025 16.30 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 16.36 EDTShareSince early 2024, I’ve been running a journalism ethics center at Columbia University.So perhaps it’s no surprise that I see the university’s capitulation to Trump both in terms of journalism and ethics.I’ve never run a university, but I have run a newsroom. For 13 years (until I moved to New York City in 2012 to be the New York Times public editor), I was the chief editor of the Buffalo News, the regional newspaper in my home town. I had started there as a summer intern. As editor, I made a lot of decisions; the buck stopped at my desk.It’s not a perfect analogy to Columbia’s situation, but I’ve been thinking about what my options might have been if the paper’s biggest and most powerful advertiser – one important to our financial wellbeing – had gotten wind of an investigation they didn’t like the sounds of. Something that would reveal something negative about their business, let’s say.Suppose that advertiser had threatened to withdraw all their advertising unless we dropped the story. In fact, suppose they wanted promises of positive coverage – perhaps a fawning profile of their CEO, and a series about the good things the company was doing in the community.Let’s complicate it more. Let’s say that my boss, the paper’s owner, was on the advertiser’s side, or at least inclined to see their point of view.What would my options be as editor?There really would be only one: to hold fast. To make the case to the owner that if we were a legitimate newspaper, we would have to be brave and not allow ourselves to be bullied. And to refuse to pull the story. Make sure it’s bulletproof – every fact nailed down – and proceed with plans to publish it.What would happen?That’s hard to say. Maybe the advertiser would blink. Maybe the owner would fire me. Maybe I’d feel I had to resign.The point of this imperfect analogy is simply that allowing oneself – or one’s institution – to be bullied or threatened into compliance is never the right answer.Some principles are so central to an institution’s purpose that to betray them should be unthinkableAnd it’s especially important for strong institutions to stand up, to set an example and to insulate those who have fewer resources or are more vulnerable.Columbia has a huge – nearly $15bn – endowment. It could have withstood the withdrawal of federal funds.Columbia’s leadership could have chosen to say “see you in court” rather than “yes, sir”.Some principles are so central to an institution’s purpose that to betray them should be unthinkable. You don’t kill a valid story under pressure. Because journalism, however flawed, is about finding and telling the truth.And a university – which stands for academic freedom, for freedom of thought, speech and expression, including the right to peacefully protest – cannot buckle to demands to undermine those principles.Sadly, that’s what Columbia did, even going so far as to put an entire academic department under highly unusual supervision, and to empower beefed-up campus police to detain, remove or arrest students for various supposed offenses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThis action stains a great university, which could have recovered from a financial threat but may not recover from this capitulation.Of course, Columbia needs to work against antisemitism and against all forms of hatred and discrimination. But that’s not really – or certainly notfully– what’s at the heart of Trump’s move.“It’s all about intimidation,” as my Guardian colleague Robert Reich, a former labor secretary, wrote this weekend, “not only at Columbia but at every other university in America.”Columbia’s capitulation mirrors that of many institutions in recent weeks. A major law firm (Paul, Weiss), under pressure, struck a deal with the White House to donate $40m in legal work to enable Trump’s causes. ABC News settled a defamation suit it probably could have won. And newspaper owners, including Jeff Bezos at the Washington Post, have been cozying up to Trump in many ways that harm credibility and mission.Yet some organizations have decided not to cave, but to be true to their stated and long-held principles.The Associated Press is suing, after theTrump administrationseverely limited its journalists’ access, punishing them for an editorial decision to continue using the term “Gulf of Mexico” on first reference in their stories, not “Gulf of America”. Another large law firm, Perkins Coie, is fighting in court after Trump’s executive order stripped their lawyers of their security clearances and denyed them access to government buildings.Take this to the bank: there is no satisfying the Trumpian demands. The goalposts will always be moved and then moved again.With its huge endowment and sea of rich alumni – some of whom, surely, would be in sympathy – Columbia had other choices. Smaller universities may not.Institutions with resources must resist thuggish bullying, not just for their own sakes, but to protect others who will find it much harder.

The emperor has no clothes to cloak his counterfeit rule. Lacking crown and robes, he resorts to vulgar ties and baseball caps. His throne is but a bully pulpit, his palace a pokey, whitewashed house, his courtiers mere common hacks. His royal edicts – executive orders – are judicially contested. And while he rages like Lear, his critics are publicly crucified or thrown to the lions at Fox News.Yet for all his crudely plebeian ordinariness, a parvenu imperialism is Trump’s global offer, his trademark deal and most heinous crime. He peddles it against the tide of history and all human experience, as if invasion, genocide, racial inequality, economic exploitation and cultural conquest had never been tried before. If it wasn’t clear already, it is now.He wants to rule the world.Trump’s menacing claims to Canada, Panama andGreenlandrevive the elitist fantasies ofElon Musk’s grandfatherandTechnocracy Inc, a 1930s rightwing populist movement that sought to unite North and Central America under US suzerainty – the “Technate”. The mindset feeding such pretensions is rooted deep in the national psyche. It’s a mix of Monroe doctrine, “manifest destiny” and the white man’s burden. It’s evil, it’s pernicious, and it’s back.In 1823, president James Monroe, fending off predatory European powers, defined what Russia’s Vladimir Putin, among others, would today term an American “sphere of influence”. His doctrine was later used to justify US intervention in Latin America. Manifest destiny was the belief, popularised after 1845, that the young republic was divinely charged with spreading its dominion and “civilising influence” across the continent and into the Pacific region.Would Trump attempt ethnic cleansing of the lighter-skinned citizens of war-torn Ukraine? Everyone knows the answer to thatNative Americans, exterminated and dispossessed, were principal victims. Manifest destiny helped spread slavery as new states joined the Union. Subsequent colonisations of the Philippines, Cuba and Hawaii were a natural extension. In 1899, Rudyard Kipling’s infamously racist poem,The White Man’s Burden, urged Americans to emulate the British empire and assume global responsibility for governing “new-caught sullen peoples”.That latter phrase aptly describes Trump’s view today of 2 million Palestiniansensnared in Gaza, whom he wants todeport to Somalilandor some other promised land. Migrants corralled at the Mexico border face the white man’s burdensome prejudices, too. Would Trump attempt ethnic cleansing of the lighter-skinned, mostly Christian, citizens of war-torn Ukraine? Everyone knows the answer to that one. While lacking the older varieties’ surface pomp and majesty, Trump’sborn-again imperialismbears the ugly hallmarks of earlier iterations. As before, it comes down to power and money, military might and economic pressure (such as tariffs), control of land, racial and cultural supremacy and an utterly hypocritical morality. It’s causing uproar at home. It infects every aspect of foreign policy.Trump may not be actively conniving in the killing and expulsion of Ukraine’s Indigenous population, but he’s doing his best to rob them of their birthright. In a travesty of negotiation, he cedes territory to Putin, bullies Kyiv’s leaders into seething submission, then makes a grab forUkraine’s mineral wealth. Now he wants its nuclear power plants, too. This is not about making peace.It’s about making money. In Gaza, Trump picks over the bones before the victim has even died. Basic legalities, let alone humanity, are jettisoned. No matter that Israel’sgenocidaireshave killed about 50,000 Palestinians. He wants the seafront property free of charge, its surviving owners evicted, so he can build a luxury resort. “Welcome to the Rafah Riviera, the Trump Organisation’s Nakba-on-the-Med. Enjoy your stay!”Trump and his advisers envisagethree neo-imperial superpower blocs, the US, Russia and China, united in disregard for the UN charter, international law and human rights and acting as they please in self-allotted spheres of influence. In this upended age, Russia is a lucrative business partner while European and Asian allies must fend for themselves. As ever, developing countries are exploited for their resources. To mangle George Canning, the Old World falls prey to the New.Imperialism has evolved since the time of gunboats and missionaries. Absent now is a sense of higher calling and noble purposeIn the wider Middle East, Trump is infinitely more interested in forging a US-Saudi-Israel security, energy and investment alliance than in ending the Palestinian tragedy. A significant obstacle is Iran, another historical victim of colonialists. In his latest Putin schmooze, Trump asked for Russia’s help incontaining its ally. Mullahs beware: there’s a whiff of betrayal in the air. Like big-power bullies throughout history, Trump picks on easy targets. Danish-owned Greenland and Panama exemplify the type of weak, defenceless country that 19th-century European empires scrambled for in Africa. In contrast, note how abnormally quiet is loudmouthed Trump about China, America’s most powerful 21st-century rival.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Absent now is a sense of higher calling and noble purpose. Pioneering frontiersmen pursuing America’s manifest destiny genuinely believed theirs was a righteous cause. British colonial administrators thought they did God’s (and Queen Victoria’s) work. Today’s conquerors betray few such illusions. Even so, Trump casts himself as compassionate, noble-minded peacemaker. So will he pursue peace in desperate Sudan, Myanmar or Congo? Will he stop those “horrible wars” too? No, he will not. Such places do not feature on his redrawn maps. There’s no money or kudos in it for him.

In 2021, it implemented a near-total abortion ban: themost radical abortion lawin the US. Now it’s going even further in its crusade to outlaw abortion. On Monday, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, announced the first criminal charges under Texas’s abortion ban. Maria Margarita Rojas, a licensed midwife, was charged with the illegal performance of an abortion and with practicing medicine without a license, according to a press releasefrom Paxton’s office. Her employee Jose Ley was also charged.There are still a lot of details that are unclear or unverified when it comes to this case, which apparently caught officials’ eyes after an anonymous tip-off. But I’ll tell you what is glaringly apparent:Texaswants to make an example of Rojas. They want Rojas, who primarily served a low-income Spanish-speaking community, to be a cautionary tale. One that ensures people are too terrified to even think about helping a woman obtain an abortion.The US assault on free speech is not going to end with Mahmoud KhalilRead moreRojas isn’t getting some sort of slap on the wrist; the full force of the state is coming after her. She was reportedly pulled over bypolice at gunpointwhile on her way to a clinic and the abortion charge is a second-degree felony, which comes with up to 20 years in prison. Meanwhile, according to theTexas Tribune, the state recommended Rojas and Ley each be held on a million-dollar bond. A million dollars! (In the end, a judge ordered their bonds each be set at $500,000 for the abortion-related charges and $200,000 for the medical license charges.) To put this in perspective, a Texas elementary school teacher arrested earlier this month after a “large quantity” of child sexual abuse materials was reportedly found on his devices, is being held in jail on a$75,000 bond.Locking up doctors isn’t a popular policy platform – according to a2024 KFF poll, eight in 10 Democrats, two-thirds of independents and about half of Republicans want to protect doctors who perform abortions from facing either fines or prison time. Which seems to be why Paxton went after a midwife. Mary Ziegler, a law professor and leading authority on the legal history of the American abortion debate,notes in Slatethat “this is almost certainly not the first prosecution that Paxtoncouldhave brought”. No, it looks like Paxton was trying to find the perfect victim: someone he could easily smear.“The fact that Rojas isnota physician is central to Paxton’s strategy,” Ziegler writes. “He claims that the prosecution will protect women from unlicensed and presumably unsafe providers … [he wants] to signal that midwives who provide abortions are unsafe, unqualified, and dishonest.” This attack on the credibility of midwives – particularly non-white midwives – isn’t new. TheGuardian notes that: “As abortion bans spread across the country in the 19th century, midwives were often driven out of work or faced criminal consequences, which in turn led white, male doctors to siphon up their patients and dominate the medical field.”Some observers believe that the timing of all this is also strategic. Abortion activist Jessica Valenti (who used to write this newsletter and nowwrites Abortion, Every Day) has noted that Rojas was arrested weeks ago. Why did Paxton wait until now to send out a press release? Valenti reckons he is trying todistract from the factthat Texas Republicans are trying to push throughSB 2880, which she characterizes as the biggest piece of anti-abortion legislation since Roe was overturned. This bill targets Texans’ access to abortion pills and makes it easier to sue people and companies involved in a person’s medication abortion.The bill also protects“any person who impregnated the woman who used abortion-inducing drugs through conduct constituting sexual assault” from being sued.“Flooding the zone” – astrategy put forwardby Steve Bannon to describe the process of overwhelming the media by creating more news than anyone can possibly follow – is very much part of the Republican playbook. But, at this point, I don’t know whether anti-abortion activists really care about distracting us from all the dystopian schemes they’ve got up their sleeves. On the contrary, they seem eager to rub their cruelty in our faces. Still, amid the unceasing torrent of news, it is true that we must stay focused. We must remember that the arrest of Rojas and Ley isn’t some sort of one-off isolated to Texas but part of a much broader attack on reproductive rights. Don’t listen to Donald Trump’s “reassurances” that abortion rights should beleft to the statesto decide: the eventual goal is to end abortion access entirely.Elon Musk’s dad says his son was friendly with their Black servants growing upThe Washington Post recently did a deep dive into why Elon has become obsessed with anti-DEI efforts.

Friday was Mother’s Day in the Middle East, making this even more harrowing. Meanwhile, everyone in Gaza is traumatized. Please watchthis heartbreaking videofrom CNN where eight-year-old Sama Tubail, who has lost all her hair from stress, says: “I want to die and have my hair grow in paradise.”The UN has said“a generation has been traumatized”, and that nearly all of Gaza’s 1.2 million children need psychological support.

There is, in fact, so much happening simultaneously that it is virtually impossible to tackle it all.That is why efforts on the ground, in our communities and in our neighbourhoods are as vital as they ever were. Just like the grassroots civil rights movement of the 1960s forced change at the top, now too is a moment when our work can and must push back against Trump and a far right that is strategically dismantling every measure of progress. We must resist in order to exist.View image in fullscreenUSIllustration: Guardian Design/Guardian Design / Getty Images / ShutterstockWhen Trumpwas being sworn into officeon 20 January, my organisation,National Action Network, held a massive rally at the historicAfrican Methodist Episcopal churchin Washington DC. It was important for us to gather at this church, at a location that has long served as a place of refuge and comfort during dark times. As we once again find ourselves caught in the winds of uncertainty, chaos and injustice, we must organise, strategise and execute our own plan of action in order to save any measure of advancement and our hard-won civil rights.Despite the cruelty emanating from the Oval Office, there is a lot that can be done at the state and local level, and in our communities. In fact, state laws and policies often affect people more directly than federal policies at times. Therefore engaging state- and locally elected officials is vital – let them hear from you. After all, they are in office to serve the people and serve our interests, so our interests must be known. Whether it’s women’s reproductive rights, voting rights, LGBTQ+ rights, protecting immigrants, or any other issue, our concerns must be addressed. This is not a time for sitting back and watching helplessly; there is a lot that we can and must do to peacefully fight back.Here’s how we can push backOne of the first executive orders that Trump signed in office was toeliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmesin federal agencies. Many corporations, such as Target, McDonald’s, Walmart and others, unfortunatelyhave fallen in lineand capitulated to pressure from the right to either scale back significantly their DEI policies, or eliminate them altogether. It is why I announced on Martin Luther King Day that National Action Networkwill lead a strategic boycottof two companies that have dropped their DEI commitments.We’ve put together a group that is engaged in a 90-day study of which corporations have abandoned their DEI initiatives the most – and how much of their consumer base is in the Black community and how much of our wealth they receive. We will announce which companies we’re strategically boycotting at National Action Network’supcoming annual conference, held from 2 to 5 April at the Sheraton Times Square hotel in New York City.Not only will we boycott specific entities that don’t respect us, but we are also simultaneously supporting those who stand with us. After retail giant Costco announced that it will remain firm in its DEI policies, I led hundreds of people in a“buy-cott” at a Costco in East Harlem. That was followed by similar buy-cotts at Costco locations in New Jersey, Los Angeles and all over the south. It is vital to proactively support those who support us. We must remember why we have DEI in the first place – in order to rectify institutional policies that purposefully excluded us. Trump and other businesses may attack DEI, but they cannot dictate where we spend our hard-earned dollars. Our actions will speak for us even as they try to silence us.This is just one example of how we can push back individually and collectively during these challenging and dark times. There is much that we can do at the local community level to protect ourselves and our neighbours, and speak out where needed. When they cut social services, help those less fortunate and help people understand how they can navigate an increasingly confusing system. When they continue to eliminate DEI and voting protections, make sure people are empowered to know how to weather the storms – and how to still participate in the electoral process.When they go after reproductive rights, help women know where and how they can seek the care they may need and stay safe. When they target undocumented immigrants, make sure they know their rights. When they target the LGBTQ+ community, stand with them and continue to push for greater equality and inclusion. Over these next four years, it will be incumbent upon all of us to unite as one because the vile attacks against us are resting on a theory of divide and conquer.During the great civil rights movement, Black Americans and our allies organised, marched, boycotted and put enough pressure on the White House to bring about substantive change that was then codified into law. People didn’t just give us our rights out of the kindness of their hearts; we demanded them. It was pressure from the grassroots that then forced elected officials to act. We once again find ourselves living in an era where our work, our voices and our actions can and must speak volumes and bring about a nation where all of us are valued, protected and afforded the same rights and liberties.Trump and the right are counting on us to be defeated or deflated; we must strategise and push back because there are more of us than them. Those of us who care about diversity, inclusion, equality and justice far outweigh those working to destroy it. We just need to use our power effectively – and as one.The Rev Al Sharpton is an American Baptist minister, civil rights activist and radio talkshow host"

And I can’t possibly disrupt a family of threeSat 22 Mar 2025 19.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 19.36 EDTShareTwo years ago, when I moved into the apartment where I’m still living, a pair of doves moved in too. They started nesting on top of the air conditioning unit on my balcony. It’s up high, so it was often hard to confirm who was home at different times of the day, but I could hear the cooing, the flapping of their wings and the splat of their poo as it hit the concrete below. Some nights they flew in and out for hours, teasing my cat who watched them steadily, dreaming perhaps of how she could climb.I liked the sound of their wings as they powered off the air conditioner each morning, as if they were following a human set of rules and heading to the office. It was the smell I didn’t like. The slightly musty, dank smell that wafted in when the windows were open. And the sticks that dropped and dropped and dropped from their failed attempt to nest.In the middle of cyclone preparation I found a baby bird – one tiny, wild life amid the wind and rain | Jessie ColeRead moreI started dreaming about pigeon germs floating in through the air conditioner and souring the air. I couldn’t sit on the couch with the balcony door open and watch television with my son because of the noise of their wings as they hovered in place, dropping their sticks and dinner on the ground.I scrubbed the ground with green gloves to my elbows, wiping away the poo. But it was back the next morning. They were clearly winning.I told my son thatI wanted them gone. He thought I was being harsh and said if they’d built a nest then they should stay. “What nest?”I asked.The nest was scattered on the ground like a game of pick-up sticks. I went to the hardware store and stocked up on everything they sold to deter birds. Spikes and spikes and spikes. And some flashy tape that was supposed to scare them off.I waited until the doves were out on their hunting mission for more sticks and then placed my ladder under the air conditioner so I could climb up, up, up to where they nested. I reached the bottom of the unit and stretched high on the second highest step, but even standing on the top, the ladder was too short. I couldn’t see anything.When a carpenter friend came to do some repairs, I complained to him about the birds and he promised to take a look. He climbed to the top ofhisladder which was far taller than mine, and balanced like he was doing yoga on the very top step. I passed up sponges and he scrubbed away all signs of the doves, before brushing away the few sticks that had managed to remain, laughing at their efforts to nest.If I’d stuck the spikes up on the air conditioner, I would have just placed them anywhere. But he measured them, and then cut the ends to make them fit the length of the unit. He didn’t waste any double-sided tape as he carefully cut it down the middle. And after 10 minutes the deterrents were perfectly in place. Sparkly silver reflective tape hung in lengths from the pole that the birds usually balanced on, and lines of spikes stood around the edge of the air conditioner unit making it impossible for them to land.We waited.My pet rat is dying. I can’t stop thinking about all the things he taught me | Joseph EarpRead moreMy friend returned to sanding the walls and I sat on the couch with the balcony door open for the first time in days. A dove flew in. It hovered, like it was trying to work out what had changed. And then it left. Then the other one tried. And it left too. They perched on the top of the church’s slate roof, watching. I was hopeful but freaked by their vigilant stares. They flew in and out multiple times over the next few days, trying to find the weak spot. And then on a Thursday, they flew in as a pair and out as a pair and upstairs as a pair.I could hear them cooing one floor away and for a second, I felt guilty that I’d moved them on to my neighbour who I didn’t even know. But the cooing sounded more pleasant dulled by distance. The cat watched the air, hoping perhaps they would be back. And I picked up their sticks for the very last time.Or so I thought.About four months ago the doves returned. Of course, I don’t know for sure they are the same pair, but they have managed to find a weak spot in the wall of spikes and this time they’ve built a nest and stayed. I was tossing up what to do, when a scientist friend came over for a cup of tea. She told me not to worry about the smell of the poo because it won’t return. This time they’ve built a real nest. This time there’s an egg. Which means this time they’ll keep the area clean for their baby who will hatch any day now. And I can’t possibly disrupt a family of three.Nova Weetman is an award-winning children’s author.

She is the Financial Times commentator who predicted the global financial crisis, and later wrote the bestselling Fool’s Gold about the 2008 collapse that revealed the fractures beneath an economic system based on finance not manufacturing.That crisis revealed a naked emperor. But in country after country, most of the emperors sitting in their glass towers in financial districts continued as though nothing had happened, without punishment. The system was deemed too big to fail and their companies received generous bailouts.It was ordinary folk who lost their homes and savings and were forced to endure wrong-headed austerity policies that simply made life harder and further weakened public trust.Over the following 17 years, a small number of billionaires grew ever richer and more influential. As America strives to become even greater, the threats of another global collapse looms.Australia managed the 2008 crisis better than most nations, because of forward thinking, targeted intervention by a proactive government and the seemingly insatiable Chinese need for iron ore.It will be a test to see which countries are the nimblest when it comes to the recalibration that is now needed.As Tett, who is also the provost of King’s College, Cambridge observes: “Every single person assumes that the intellectual framework they grew up with and built their careers around is natural, normal, inevitable and should be universal. That’s just the nature of being human. And everybody is wrong. Ideas change over time. They go in fashions or cycles.”The current generation of policymakers and business leaders have grown up with strong faith in the market, in a globalism based on assessments of national comparative advantage and regulation by internationally accepted rules.So now they throw their hands up in horror and point to established economic theory and expostulate that tariffs don’t work, that government services are essential and point to legal and political theory that demonstrates why a rules-based system has on balance for 80 years served most of us well.Critics have been pointing to the flaws in the global neoliberal system for years, highlighting the increasing levels of inequality, the hollowing out of economies based on narrow definitions of comparative advantage and environmental destruction.But efforts to devise a new model have been slow and unproductive, despite increasing public unease. Those who have done best out of this system will not easily give up. Donald Trump’s courtiers were involved in these bubbling discussions, but from a different perspective. Theyhave developed thick skins from being outsiders whose ideas were marginalised and shouted down.The new reality dawning in Australia: it can no longer rely on the USRead moreThey now have access to power and have pushed the economic discussion into uncharted territory with a president ready to sign another executive order. They are not interested in making the system fairer.Their goal is to make America great, their strategy to reset the global financial and trading system, and their tactics bullying with tariffs, threats and military power.For the past 150 years America has beena dominant power. Despite only having about 5% of the world’s population, it has consistently accounted for about a quarter of the world’s economic output. Over that time the guiding paradigm of economics and social organisation have changed, as old models imploded, or collapsed with war.Australia has been adept at responding to changing economic paradigms. It developed a national ethos that moved beyond a colonial mindset at the beginning of the 20th century. Its economists were at the forefront of developing what became known as Keynesianism to use the resources of the state in conjunction with private industry to maximise public benefit, and when this model ossified Australia developed what was referred to as the third way, an approach to deregulation and privatisation that actively balanced interests but has weakened over time.The question is whether there are the intellectual and capital resources to do so now. Australia is still one of the richest countries in the world butthe economy is now one of the least diverse and complex. Our comparative advantage in resources remains but we have not been as attentive as we should to our comparative advantages in education, research, democratic institution building and fostering equality of opportunity and income.Just like those adult children who discover they were not the favourite find new ways of working together, nations will need to find new ways tocollaboratewithout a manipulative parent in the room.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of AustraliaExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionAustralian politicsUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Intimacy coordinators make sex scenes safe for all, not just A-listersBarbara EllenThe film star is among those undermining a role that was created out of the #MeToo movement to protect the powerlessSat 22 Mar 2025 14.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 14.03 EDTShareHow instructive to hear Gwyneth Paltrow’s views on intimacy coordinators, the people hired to supervise intimate scenes in film and television. Talking toVanity Fairmagazineabout her big screen comeback, in Josh Safdie’s ping pong film,Marty Supreme, the actor, 52, joked of her sex scenes with 29-year-old Timothée Chalamet: “I was like, ‘I’m 109 years old. You’re 14’.”Paltrow also said: “There’s now something called an intimacy coordinator (IC), which I did not know existed.” When the IC spoke to her: “I’m like, ‘Girl, I’m from the era where you get naked, you get in bed, the camera’s on’… We said, ‘I think we’re good. You can step a little bit back’.” She added: “I don’t know how it is for the kids who are starting out, but… if someone is like ‘OK, then he puts his handhere’… I would feel as an artist very stifled by that.”Well, I also don’t know about kids starting out, but I’d imagine it’s much harder for them when rich, famous, powerful players such as Paltrow undermine intimacy coordinators: people specifically hired to safeguard the welfare of everybody on set – not just big stars.I’d love to relay more about the PaltrowVanity Fairarticle: all the darling details about stealth wealth, raw milk, perimenopause, shearling clogs, and the inside track on the financial status of Paltrow’s wellness empire, Goop.A huge dark lie is forming: that now Weinstein and his kind have been dealt with… everything is fineHowever, this is about #MeToo. Specifically, the ongoing soft-cancellation of the intimacy coordinator, whose professional presence, lest we forget, is one of the hard-won gains of the#MeToo movement. How it’s becoming a major Hollywood power flex to declare you don’t need one. How it’s starting to be considered rather chic to dispense with their services. And what the trickledown effect of all this A-list privilege could be.It’s especially mystifying from Paltrow because, as detailed inVanity Fair, she was at the heart of #MeToo, bravelyspeaking out againstconvicted Miramax producer, Harvey Weinstein. Early in her career, Paltrow had a horrible encounter with Weinstein, who was warned off by her then boyfriend, Brad Pitt. Paltrow recalled: “[Pitt]leveraged his fame and powerto protect me when I didn’t have fame or power yet.” One thing that was striking about her experience was that, even with a famous boyfriend, Hollywood director dad (Bruce), respected actor mum (Blythe Danner), and director legend godfather (Steven Spielberg), shestillwasn’t safe from Weinstein.Years later, it’s a little surprising that Paltrow arrived on the set ofMarty Supremeunaware of the existence of intimacy coordinators. (Paltrow lives in prosperous Montecito, outside Los Angeles, not some sea cave in the Outer Hebrides.) But then, there’s a fair bit of this kind of thing about.While some actors (including Emma Thompson and Ewan McGregor) have supported intimacy coordinators, others not so much.Michael Douglas acknowledged Hollywood abusesbut felt that ICs were “executives taking control away from filmmakers”. He also felt it was the man’s responsibility to make the woman comfortable: “Which is hopefully what good acting looks like.”Mikey Madison didn’t feel she needed an ICfor her recent Oscar-winning role inAnora, whose director Sean Baker said: “I have directed approximately 10 sex scenes throughout my career and I’m very comfortable doing so.”In 2023,Jennifer Aniston claimed not to know about intimacy coordinators(“I’m from the olden days, so I was like, ‘What does that mean?’”), refusing one for a sex scene with her friend, Jon Hamm. And so it churns on. How bizarre these anti-stances sometimes look. The claims of being stifled. The pleas for artistic agency. The passive aggression. The faux self-deprecation. The pushing of the idea that not using an IC somehow makes people ballsy, adventurous, down to earth. Never mind how turning one down is a power-play in itself, there is a gigantic missing of the point. It’s wonderful these people feel so safe and protected, but who else is in the room?Intimacy coordinators are not just for lead actors, directors, producers, the people already wielding immense power. They are designed to advocate for everyone, cast and crew alike, including the traditionally powerless/voiceless on set. Not that there haven’t been glitches: last year, the union SAG-AFTRAchanged rules around intimacy coordinators, including around confidentiality, aftertoo many details were given to the pressabout the 2024 film,Miller’s Girl, starring Jenna Ortega and Martin Freeman.How long before people start mocking the idea of being afraid to go for meetings with producers in hotel rooms?Effectively, intimacy coordinators serve as a democratic safety measure. This is why it’s irresponsible for them to be undermined, as an eye-roll, a bore, even an unnecessary wellness-grift (in Gwynnie’s case, oh the irony!). It puts pressure on those without power to be obliging and biddable: “Gwyneth Paltrow didn’t want an intimacy coordinator, so….” It creates a two-tier system: the powerful proclaiming they don’t need ICs; the powerless unable to say they want them.

As much as it was about sexual abuse, it was also about toxic power imbalances. It’s important to remember because a huge dark lie is forming: that now Weinstein and his kind have been dealt with, power-hosed off the streets of Hollywood, everything is fine and, if anything, all the rules and safeguards are starting to get tedious.Striking isn’t it? Outside professionals are routine in Hollywood (stunts; fight scenes; dialect), it’s only with sex, there’s the pushback. From where I’m sitting, this looks like a slow motion asset-stripping of #MeToo. How long before people start mocking the idea of being afraid to go for meetings with producers in hotel rooms?Maybe unfairly, it’s particularly painful when the barely veiled undermining comes from women, especially one who had such a valuable voice during #MeToo. Maybe next time Paltrow comes across an intimacy coordinator, she could remember how most of the hundreds of people she’s working alongside on set don’t have fame and power to protect them.

The Parthenon was completed just before Athens embarked on the devastating Peloponnesian War. Manhattan’s most celebrated skyscrapers went up on the brink of the Great Depression. The British inaugurated the imposing government buildings of New Delhi 16 years before the end of the Raj. I won’t say that this will definitely be the case with the£2bn stadiumdesigned by the Mancunian Norman Foster for Manchester United Football Club, but it’s striking that it’s proposed at a time when the club has closed its staff canteen andmade redundant hundreds of workersto cut costs.Every good thing is promised. It is to be “the world’s greatest football stadium”, iconic AND sustainable, with both rainwater harvesting and a “trident” of 200m-high masts visible from 25 miles away. There is to be a “public space” twice the size of Trafalgar Square and a “mixed use mini-city” around it. There are things to like about the plans, including an attempt to avoid the fortress-like exteriors presented by most stadiums in favour of something more open and lively. But they’d probably do well to concentrate on doing fewer things as well as possible. Otherwise, the building might be like one of those football teams made up of extravagant signings who somehow don’t gel.Exit stage rightView image in fullscreenJD Vance was booed at a Kennedy Center classical music performancePhotograph: Guardian VideoYou can only feel heartened by any sign of resistance to the onslaught of vandalism and cruelty wrought by the Trump administration, as when the audience in the Kennedy Center in Washington DCbooed the vice-president, JD Vance, when he turned up to a performance of Shostakovich and Stravinsky. This was entirely justified, given that Trump hadfired the centre’s chair and 13 trustees, installed himself to preside over the board, and appointed his stooge Richard Grenell as president of the centre (all with minimal complaint from conservatives who allegedly oppose excessive government intervention). On the other hand, one imagines that Vance might have been quite happy with the way this spectacle played out. At least some sections of his base will delight in the outrage he has caused to concert-goers in the nation’s hated capital, paying upwards of $100 a seat to hear music that Vance fans find baffling. Of course, America should be big enough for every kind of culture but – as we’re all finding out – one of the worst things about relentless aggression is that it can be hideously effective.Moving bluesView image in fullscreenBrian Sewell: ‘I have been close to death three times… moving house is far, far worse.”Photograph: Karen Robinson/The ObserverThe renowned art critic Brian Sewell, at a time when he and I both worked for theEvening Standard, lamented the stresses of moving himself and his art collection to a new home. “You know what they say,” I said, “it’s the third most stressful thing after death and divorce.” “Oh no, no, no, no,” fluted Sewell, who suffered from a serious heart condition, “I have been close to death three times, and I can tell you that moving house is far, far worse”. As one who is currently vacating the place where I have lived for half my life, with all the logistical and emotional complexities involved, I am beginning to understand how he felt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Norms change, and that’s often for the best. But when it comes to laptops in cafes,falling from favouras owners lose patience with remote workers, I am begging society to reconsider. Don’t take my cafe nook – it’s the only thing keeping the WFH brigade and lonely freelancers like me sane.My kitchen table, where I do most of my work, is fine. It’s got a window next to it. There’s a kettle I can use whenever I like. I can play my own music, make loud phone calls and migrate to the sofa when being upright gets a bit much. But variety is the spice of life, and truly I would lose my mind if those were my only options. Yes, I’m aware of co-working spaces, but they are a) full of awful people and b) I can’t afford one. Luckily, the buzz of the outside world, the soothing white noise of life beyond my keyboard’s tip-tapping, is only as far away as the nearest cafe – for now.Flexibility to work anywhere is one of my favourite things about my job as a writer – yet, this great privilege has been abused by my fellow laptop nomads, to the extent that we risk it being taken away altogether. Shouting into Zoom calls, hogging tableswhile spending a pittance, it’s no wonder that our antics irk cafe owners – buying one cup of tea and sitting there all day is clearly bad manners, not to mention bad business.It’s also true that a sea of laptops changes a place’s vibe, from chatty community hub to co-working space (insufferable, as discussed); no doubt the ratio of we laptoppers to other punters must be as carefully calibrated as our behaviour. Thankfully, after years of field research – I’ve been at this since before the pandemic, if you can imagine – I have developed a code of conduct to ensure the harmonious continuance of the cafe-laptop ecosystem. And you’re going to have to listen, because if we keep messing this up, it’s kitchen tables for ever, OK?Laughter not laptops: cafe culture fights back against keyboard invadersRead moreFirst rule is limiting cafe-laptop time to four hours, spending about £5 every two. If you insist on being in situ all day, you should buy at least one meal as well. Second – absolutely no Zoom or phone calls, no exceptions. It is the laptop worker’s job to integrate seamlessly into the cafe environment, not steamroll it with performative productivity. If you’ve got a call, stay at home or step outside, buddy.Then, it should go without saying that you take the smallest table available – no lounging over a four-top when it’s just you and your MacBook. Also, don’t pester staff for somewhere to charge your phone or your laptop if there isn’t a plug socket evidently available – they’re there to serve food and drinks, not facilitate your makeshift office. And obviously – OBVIOUSLY – don’t play your own music out loud; it shouldn’t need saying, but a guy I encountered in Costa the other day certainly hadn’t got that particular memo. Fingers crossed he’s reading now, because otherwise our exile from cafes across the land is all but assured.In summary, don’t overstay your welcome, pay your way, and behave as though you are grateful – rather than entitled – to be there. Basically: don’t take the mick.Much as manyBrits abroad make me want to crawl under a rock or assume a French accent, the conduct of some of my fellow cafe-laptoppers oftenmakes me ashamed to count myself among them – but despite the understandable ill will towards us, there’s no reason we can’t get the show back on the road.Cafes are not only a pleasant setting for work, but a natural one – as their intellectual origins testify, they’ve always been a place to nurture ideas. Generative and convivial, the atmosphere of a cafe is often just what I need to get moving with a piece of work that’s dragging its feet – but also, it reminds me that other humans exist (I believe most people get this from offices?). Truly, a resource too valuable to lose. Just think, if we really do get turfed out, left only with kitchens and co-working, I might have to resort to getting a real job.Emily Watkins is a freelance writer based in LondonDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Has it changed him?Sat 22 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 12.39 EDTShareSeth Rogen is itemising all the ways in which, when he’s producing a film or TV show, he’s inclined to agonise about his contribution. “Are my notes helping?” he says. “Am I making things worse? Am I actually inspiring the writers to create better things? Or am I imposing my outdated vision? Will they think spending time with me is a worthy use of their time?” And the big one – the one that, when he’s working with his heroes, as he did recently onThe Studio, a new TV comedy Rogen has produced, directed, co-written and starred in, and which features cameos by, among others, Ron Howard and Martin Scorsese – really keeps him awake at night: “Do they like me?”It is a very Rogenish thought spiral: neurotic, self-deprecating, delivered with the tremulous comic undertone that characterises most of his speech. Since the devastating fires in LA in January, it is also the kind of moan, Rogen says, that has to be prefaced in Hollywood by an awkward new protocol. “Whenever you talk to anyone, the first thing you do is check, like, before we get too far into trivial subjects, did you recently lose all your worldly belongings? Before I whine to you for 20 minutes, it’d be good to know.”Did Rogen lose anything? “I did not, thank God.” He laughs his famous, wheezing laugh that sounds like a van trying to get up a hill. “So be as trivial as you like.”I suspect Rogen, who is 42, can get away with a great deal more whining than most people in Hollywood purely by virtue of the firm and affectionate idea of him we have from his movies: funny, nerdy, beardy, affable,Canadian,for God’s sake, a man whose side hustle is running a weed business and making ceramics. He is speaking via video call from the LA production office of Point Grey Pictures, the company he runs with Evan Goldberg, his writing and business partner of 30 years, which, according to IMDb, has a whopping 16 projects in the works – though, Rogen says, with assiduous self-ridicule, “a lot of that may not be real”. Still, his recent output has been terrific. The TV comedyPlatonic, which just shot its second season for Apple and in which Rogen stars opposite Rose Byrne, is a pitch-perfect rendition of friendship in middle age.The BoysandGen V, teen superhero comedies for Amazon, were funny and well received. Even the old stuff bears up, just about. Knocked Up, the 2007 comedy in which he co-starred with Katherine Heigl, tried to persuade us a twentysomething babyman is not, by today’s standards, a shirking nightmare but a cute creature, and the film, along with Pineapple Express and Superbad, succeedsin large part thanks to Rogen’s persona. It’s a misleading emphasis, because he is now at least as successful as an executive as he is as an actor and writer. At one point, while discussing the intricacies of the movie industry, he says casually, “Like, we very rarely don’t get what we want.”View image in fullscreenWith Ron Howard in The Studio …Photograph: Apple TV+View image in fullscreen… and James Franco in Pineapple Express.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockGetting what you want – and the old question of art versus money – is the subject of The Studio, in which he plays Matt Remick, freshly appointed head of a fictional movie studio called Continental. He’s a classic Rogen character: well meaning, shambolic, full of big ideas and poor execution. Remick’s appointment coincides with the steep decline of the movie business in favour of television, something “we thought was funny – a show about saving film where the only way you can tell that story in a well resourced way is on television”. And it is a well resourced show, shot with a dreamy, golden-hour filter designed to evoke Hollywood’s heyday and stuffed with cameos pulled from Rogen’s contacts list: Charlize Theron (with whom he starred in the 2019 comedy Long Shot), Paul Dano (the 2023 movie Dumb Money), Zac Efron (the 2014 frat-house comedy Bad Neighbours), Adam Scott (who appeared in Rogen’s road-trip comedy of 2012, The Guilt Trip), Olivia Wilde and Steve Buscemi. Rogen acknowledges that, unlike a behind-the-scenes show such as Extras, in which Ricky Gervais skewered the movie industry via the people on set with the least power, focusing on the studio head is risky. But it works, he believes, because most people can identify with a delusional boss – in this case, one who fights to maintain his integrity in the face of people who “don’t truly give a shit about movies”.“We talked a lot about The Office,” Rogen says, “which I love, and how the boss is the most tragic figure on the show.Just because you’re at the top of the power structure, it doesn’t mean you’re less relatable or funny.”The difference between The Studio and The Office, of course, is that the latter wasn’t conceived as a “love letter to the paper industry”, while the former is infused with absolute faith in the communicable charm of the glitzy world it inhabits. Rogen says they were aware of the dangers of self-indulgence: “We took great care to make sure the comedic premise itself was relatable to anyone watching.” In one episode, Remick goes on an absurd journey to try to force Zoë Kravitz into thanking him in her acceptance speech at the Golden Globes. “I think people with regular office jobs have that feeling of, ‘Oh! There’s a presentation I helped on and the person giving it isn’t going to acknowledge I helped on it!’”It is an arresting fact about Seth Rogen that he has never had a regular office job; he started in show business at the age of 13, doing standup in his home town of Vancouver. By 17, he’d been cast in Judd Apatow’s single-season TV comedyFreaks and Geeks. By 22, he and Goldberg were writing jokes for an Emmy-nominated comedy and on the brink of breaking into Hollywood as serious comedy writers. The pair met at the age of 12 when they attended the same barmitzvah class and they both went to Point Grey secondary school, which would later lend them its name for their company. Even now, more than two decades after leaving for LA, some of Rogen’s likability – the sense that he comes at Hollywood from a slight angle – feels connected to these Canadian origins. When I ask if he’d enjoy belonging to Trump’s 51st state, he says, deadpan, “I’d rather not.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Dylan Coulter/The Guardian. Jacket and trousers:Brunello Cucinelli. Top:Christian Joy. Shoes:Adidas. Sunglasses:Vada at Gogosha OptiqueRogen’s relatability is also connected to his parents, Mark and Sandy, who worked for a nonprofit and as a social worker, and whom he has called “radical Jewish socialists”. Neither believed in a “career path” as such, and while Danya, Rogen’s older sister, is also a social worker, his parents remain baffled by the son they’ve produced: a highly driven, success-oriented individual who has made a ton of money. “They think I’m a fucking nerd,” Rogen says ruefully. His dad also “views me as a suit”. He doesn’t agree: “I was just very fortunate in that my passion had a job ascribed to it, that I could find a way into at a relatively young age.” Things could have ended up very differently: Rogen got into pottery early, too, and “there’s not a lot of gold at the end of the pottery rainbow”.In the mid-90s, he and Goldberg quit high school to move to LA where, after Rogen’s short stint in Freaks and Geeks, they spent a few years trying unsuccessfully to sell the scripts for Superbad and Pineapple Express. This is as close as Rogen’s been to the wilderness. The pair had just started to discuss moving back to Canada when Apatow recommended them to Sacha Baron Cohen, then writing the US version of The Ali G Show which, Rogen says, was then the “coolest show” on TV. At 22, they became not only joke writers for Baron Cohen but sort of cultural translators for a newly transplanted Briton in the US. “We told Sacha what ‘spring break’ was.We were like, ‘You cangoto spring break’; he said, ‘How do yougoto spring break?! It’s a time, not a place!’ So we went to Miami Beach.” Thisdiscovery by Baron Cohen would ultimately lead to Borat’s mankini. Ali G was nominated for an Emmy, and Rogen and Goldberg were launched in LA. (He’s still good friends with Baron Cohen – “I saw him two days ago.”) Within a few years, both the movie scripts Rogen and Goldberg had been hawking were made and they were earning millions.Given the modesty of his background, does he ever feel squeamish about the money? “I don’t feel that bad about it.” He laughs. “I came from no money. I help a lot of people with mine, so I feel relatively unburdened.”View image in fullscreenWith Diana Bang and James Franco in The Interview …Photograph: Ed Araquel/APView image in fullscreen… and Katherine Heigl in Knocked Up.Photograph: Suzanne Hanover/Universal StudiosThe question of goodness and what it means to be a valuable member of society is one Rogen goes after in The Studio. In his favourite episode, his character starts dating a paediatric oncologist played by Rebecca Hall. The couple go to a medical fundraising gala where he gets into a fight with the doctors about whether curing child cancer is inherently more worthwhile than making fart jokes in movies. It seems to me Rogen’s character argues his corner with real conviction; he concedes it’s a sensitivity that comes from real life. “I’m involved with an Alzheimer’s charity” – Rogen’s wife lost her mother and grandparents to the disease – “and we go to a lot of medical galas, and I’ve been bothered by how little regard doctors have for what I do for a living.”Yikes. “Yeah,” he says. “They’re so unimpressed by me. And I know it’s acomedicallyincorrect mental place to be, and I understand I’m wrong, but I would go home and say I feel I deserve to be on the same level as these people. Because if you make movies, you convince yourself you’re doing the most important thing in the entire world. It’s not true, but the illusion is very convincing.” In the show, Remick is driven so mad by a lack of respect from the medics that he “would rather not have a relationship with Rebecca Hall than acknowledge that what doctors do is more important”.Rogen is married to Lauren Miller, an actor and screenwriter, whom he met through a producer on The Ali G show and with whom he’s been for 20-odd years. His apparent uxoriousness stands in contrast to some of Apatow’s other male prodigies, among them James Franco, who was accused by female students on his acting course of sexual misconduct (he denies the allegations), and Jonah Hill, accused by an ex of emotional abuse (about which he has made no comment). Last year, Franco, Rogen’s old pal going back to Freaks and Geeks, expressed sadness that Rogen had dropped him after the accusations surfaced in 2018. “I haven’t talked to Seth,” he saidin an interview. “I love Seth. We had 20 great years together, but I guess it’s over.”Rogen won’t comment, but his reputation as a wife guy is fairly solid. He and Miller don’t have children and he has become an unofficial spokesperson for that decision – which is unusual, I say; it’s generally women who are held to account for whether or not they have kids. “It’s about time!” he laughs. It was even a storyline in Platonic, a show written by Francesca Delbanco and Nicholas Stoller in which Rogen’s childless character, Will, is subjected by an old friend to the assumption he will be interested in photos of her kids. “Yup,” he says, flatly, as she holds up her phone. “There they are.”View image in fullscreenWith his wife, Lauren Miller.Photograph: CraSH/imageSPACE/REX/ShutterstockRogen says he and his wife talk about it a lot – not the decision, but the extent to which it remains curious to others. Obviously, he says, “it’s much more loaded for my wife – the number of people who talk to her about it versus talk to me about it.” Rogen is baffled by this: “If anything, I’d have thought there’d be more questions about why peopledohave kids. Choosing to bring a child into this world we live in is a much more confounding choice in many ways than choosing not to.”A few years ago, Rogen wrote Yearbook, a collection of memoir-ish essays he undertook because Goldberg was off having his second kid. Did he resent his writing partner for being unavailable, making different choices? “No! One of the keys to our long-lasting relationship is that we’re very understanding and accommodating of one another. There have been times when he’s wanted to work on something and I’m gonna go act – I have a whole other job he doesn’t do that takes me away from the job we do together. I’m constantly making choices that make me inaccessible to him.” So Goldberg going off to have another kid was as morally neutral to Rogen as if he’d been off making a movie? “Oh, I’d be way more mad if he was shooting a movie without me.”Can a trashy movie, expressly made to make money, actually be any good? This is the question that underpins The Studio, and Rogen has an answer for it. Two years ago, he and Goldberg wrote the script for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem and, he says, “I think we made a great film – not a cash grab, but something resonant, and funny, and exciting. And the people at Paramount let us do it.” He can think of other versions of this: “I love a lot of the Marvel movies. And Barbie is a perfect example: you could’ve made the dumbest fucking movie in the world out of Barbie, but instead someone was like: what if we let it be good? If you’re a good studio head, you let it happen. If you’re one who’s not confident enough to do that, they’ll make the most middle of the road, easy to digest version of it.”In Hollywood, middle of the road often wins out because miscalculated risk can be career-ending. Meanwhile Rogen’s own success as an executive who does take risks suggests powers of persuasion so fine he should be running the UN. “I think my diplomatic skills are more of a blunt instrument than a fine scalpel. But what we’ve gotten better at is choosing our battles; learning when to make a big deal out of something and when to let it go.” The fact is, he says, “If you’re passionate, conflict will arise. I was brought up in some of the most outwardly conflict-filled environments you can imagine in the industry – the first show I was on, Freaks and Geeks, was a great show, and the network hated it, and I got to listen to these conversations where everyone was fucking screaming at each other.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Dylan Coulter/The Guardian. Jacket and top:Kenzo. Trousers:Hermès. Necklaces:David Yurman. Sunglasses:Jacques Marie Mage at Gogosha OptiqueThis is not, he says, an exaggeration: “People really do scream at each other in Hollywood. Friction is just part of the process.” And when things fail? “The Interview would come to mind as a thing that went … I would say poorly.” This was the Sony movie in which Rogen and James Franco starred as two hapless TV hosts sent by the CIA to North Korea to assassinate Kim Jong-un and that, through a series of improbable events, resulted in the Sony email hack that revealed toxic and racist remarks in company emails that went on to bring down Amy Pascal, the head of the studio. Sony cancelled its cinematic release, citing security concerns; Rogen and Franco cancelled their promotional interviews. Rogen shrugs. The only lesson to take away, he says, is that these scandals get old very quickly. “Now that movie is on basic cable at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon – it’s like any other comedy movie you see on TV: it’s like The Rock at noon, The Interview at three, Con Air at four.”Still, he’s been actively seeking out gentler pursuits of late. Earlier this year, he lent himself to the Canadian spin-off of the UK show The Great Pottery Throw Down, a kind of Bake Off but with clay. Save for a few “unsavoury personalities”, he says, the pottery world is “very welcoming and communal … And the entertainment industry is the complete opposite, where people are like, ‘How much money will I make from this interaction and if the answer is not enough, I’m ending it right now.’” Unlike reality shows such as Top Chef, which Rogen loves for their “very American energy – pitting people against one another for a huge, life-changing prize” – in Pottery Throw Down “you don’t win anything! You’d think that would make it less competitive, but in a way it’smorecompelling because you are seeing a group of creative people trying to create their best work.”View image in fullscreenWith an ashtray from his cannabis business.Photograph: courtesy of Seth RogenFor different reasons, his weed company and the products it promotes offer Rogen similar respite from the movie business.Houseplantis an online boutique he set up in 2019 that sells cannabis products and accessories, including a “standing ashtray” in bronze and walnut for $295, and a $95 “glass grinder”. Some of the products are ceramics he has designed. Rogen has spoken often of the beneficial effects of weed on what he has called his mild Tourette syndrome and ADHD. What I don’t understand is how being even mildly high the whole time doesn’t affect his productivity? “Some strains do put me to sleep,” he says. “Just not the weed I smoke all day.” Public safety announcement: this makes Rogen very unusual. “For sure I process it differently than other people do. I’ve been at parties with people and we’ll share a joint, and I’ll be fine and go about my day, and they’ll enter, like, a new dark period for three months. Years will go by and then I’ll run into them at a party and they’ll be, like, ‘The last time I saw you was the last time I smoked weed, and it wasterrible.’”Rogen starts to laugh. “I’m not physically gifted in many ways, but there’s one way in which I am, which is in my ability to process weed. And to me it’s a very therapeutic part of my day to day journey which I don’t even question or think about any more, honestly.”You should leave your body to science.“Oh, I will.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Dylan Coulter/The Guardian.

Styling and grooming throughout: Anna Su and Kristen ShawWhat’s interesting is that Rogen, with what looks like a reflex instinct for commerce, has turned his hobby into a booming business which is venture capital backed, has 36 employees and has just expanded into THC-infused drinks. Between that and the number of shows and movies he has coming down the pipe, it looks as if he’s having some kind of mid-life … “Manic episode?” He laughs. “No. I’ve found ways to become productive in concentrated bursts. I’m good at focusing.”In any case, he says, while it took a few years to get going, their production company is running so smoothly these days, “me and Evan have a lot of time to focus on individual projects and I think that helps. His kids are a little older now, which gives him more time to work. And I work the same amount as everyone else; you know, 10am to 6pm, and when we’re filming, 9am to 9pm.”And at the weekend? “On the weekends, I don’t do shit.” Through the usual combination of luck and hard work, as well as Rogen’s peculiar genius and the pass afforded certain types of celebrity, his life at the moment is very good. Rogen grins. “On the weekends I watchReacherand smoke weed.”The Studio airs on Apple TV+ from 26 March.Explore more on these topicsSeth RogenTV comedyComedy filmsTelevisionDrugsCeramicsComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But why is it framed as a London story? Bradford-born writer Lanre Bakare explores how it reaches far beyond the capital – and farther back in timeLanre BakareSat 22 Mar 2025 07.55 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 08.53 EDTShareThe DVD slips into the loading tray, and I watch in hope rather than expectation. I’ve been told Tony Palmer’sThe Wigan Casinois the greatest ever depiction of a northern soul all-nighter, and I want to see it for myself. The film is a window into the underground scene that emerged in the 1970s, powered by soul records that had flopped years earlier. But I’m not interested in the music or the dancing – it’s the crowd I’ve got an eye on.I spot what I’m after. A young man, glistening under the spotlight as he spins balletically in a yellow vest. Then another person catches my eye with his perfectly picked-out afro. It’s a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment, so I rewind to check, and yes, it’s true. A few minutes later, two girls clamber on to a coach, and one waves goodbye down the camera lens. Another boy squeezes through the crush at the front door. These young people are there for the same reason as everyone else: hard-to-find soul music that’s perfectly crafted for dancing. But all of them stand out. They’re different from the majority of the 1,200 dancers crammed into Wigan Casino. They’re Black and British.View image in fullscreenA Black dancer at a northern soul event at Wigan Casino in 1978.Photograph: Kevin Cummins/Getty ImagesSeeing those Black faces contradicted what I’d heard about the scene. Northern soul was about white working-class audiences falling in love with and coveting forgotten Black American music. My bookWe Were Therestarted as a cultural expedition. I wanted to find something that wasn’t supposed to exist: Black northern soul fans from the 1970s and 80s. When I tracked them down, I found their stories changed the way I thought not just about northern soul but about Britain at the start of the Thatcher era. I wanted to know why. I began to wonder what other stories I might have been mistold or had never explored at all – and what those stories could reveal to me, and others, about Britain then and now.No European country has been changed by Black culture more than the UK. British music, fashion, sport, literature, TV and film have had their DNA altered by the influence of millions of people who have come to this small island from across the African diaspora. Our sounds, food, languages, intellect and sartorial choices have meshed with what was already here to create modern British culture. Some of our biggest Hollywood stars – Daniel Kaluuya, Cynthia Erivo, David Oyelowo, Letitia Wright, John Boyega – are Black; designers such as Nicholas Daley and Grace Wales Bonner transmit our styles globally; artists such as Sonia Boyce and John Akomfrah represent Britain on the biggest stages; much of England’s men’s football team is of Black heritage.Black British cultureis an inseparable part of British culture.Modern Black Britishness, which has spread and morphed into myriad forms, was forged in the late 1970s and the 80s, a time of huge ruptures and tumult – social, economic and political. Everywhere you looked, a battle was taking place, and every single gain had to be fought for: fromBirmingham, where academics such as Stuart Hall and Rastafarians were taking on racism in the media, to Leeds and Sheffield, where pioneering music producers would express a new Black British confidence, and even to the countryside, where the Black Environment Network would battle for their own place in the UK’s rural idyll.This was a time of artistic and cultural creation unrivalled in the 20th century. A period when Black British culture flourished and contemporary British culture began to form. But our understanding of that influence is limited, and for many, it starts and ends in one place:London.View image in fullscreenGreat Britain rugby league star Ellery Hanley, who grew up in Leeds.Photograph: Bob Martin/Getty ImagesI was born in the middle of the Thatcher era: 1984. My memories are fuzzy, softened by time; half-remembered fragments. Images of the poll tax riots, milk breaks at primary school, Ian Wright’s gold tooth and Norman Lamont’s eyebrows. But when I think of my home town ofBradford, there are details that come into focus. I can still run through the surnames like a Rolodex in my head: the Taylors, the Sarrs, the Davids, the Ibegbunas, the Ekongs, the Fehintolas, the Cookes, the Oakleys and the Braithwaites. The families you knew and the families you knew of – either by reputation or connection. I can still plot a chart that links the Black families in my area of Bradford: the faces, the cars, the haircuts, the living room furniture and the intellects.I left Bradford at the age of 18 and lived all over the UK –Liverpool, Newcastle, Sheffield, Bristol – in my early 20s before settling in London 14 years ago. In the capital, I’ve often been met by other Black people who express amazement at the fact Black life existed beyond the M25. Their responses weren’t hostile – there was an anthropological desire to understand this otherness. My time away didn’t make me reassess the Black culture I grew up with in Bradford, but it did make me question why it was so rarely acknowledged and little understood by everyone from the average person on the street to the institutions and centres of power in London.View image in fullscreenWarp’s Winston Hazel and DJ Parrot in Sheffield, 1990.Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty ImagesIf you want to understand the unrest that spread around the country in 1981, you’ll most likely be pointed towards events in Brixton. While the south London neighbourhood was a centre of Black culture and resistance, it wasn’t the only one – there were dozens around the UK, like in Liverpool, which had a different, older connection to the unrest. If you want to understand the far right and resistance to groups such as the National Front, you’ll find documentary-makers, journalists and writers referring to thebattle of Lewishamin 1977 as a moment,themoment, when communities came together to fight back against the provocative marches. The Rock Against Racism concert in London’s Victoria Park one year later, where 100,000 people turned out to see the Clash, X-Ray Spex and Steel Pulse perform, is held up as the exemplar of when culture was used to counter rising fascism. If you want to understand the hostile relationship between the police and Black communities, you’ll find accounts of the unrest at Notting Hill carnival in 1976 as the totemic battle when Black Britain fought back.All those events were crucial, but all feed into a simplistic narrative about Black Britishness, which suggests that a group of people, most of whom arrived in the UK after the second world war, took to the streets to rebel – with anger and with violence. This consensus view allows little room for nuance, and obscures a bigger, more complex tapestry of life in Britain during the Thatcher years. There are people in my book whose families go back five or six generations in the UK – long before the Empire Windrush arrived; there are artists and authors, legal campaigners, feminists, ravers, rude boys and rugby league superstars.Some of the stories completely upend established cultural lore. Take the one about how house music came to the UK: the established narrative is that four intrepid Londoners – Danny Rampling, Johnny Walker, Nicky Holloway and Paul Oakenfold – went to Ibiza in 1987 and imported house music, providing the building blocks for the rave scene in the UK. But before acid house went mainstream, Manchester’s Black dancers were the first to interpret the sounds that Chicago DJs such as Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles were playing across the Atlantic. They did so in clubs like Moss Side’s The Reno, Black-owned establishments that operated from the margins while acting as incubators for the Black culture that in turn fed into mainstream British life.As the tumult of Margaret Thatcher’s first term took hold, Black British people were confronted by a country that was becoming more hostile to their presence. Far-right groups marched through immigrant areas and made substantial gains at the ballot box. Mainstream politicians, including Thatcher, weaponised race in a way no other prominent politician had done before. But in 1981, thousands took to the streets, causing unrest that spread around the country, from Bristol to Bradford, as a whole generation rejected what little they were being offered in Britain. This was a time of conflict, not just in the Falklands but here, on the home front, in cities and towns up and down the country, wherever Black Britons were found.In many – but by no means all – cases, the protagonists in these stories are the children ofWindrush. Their parents – or in some cases, grandparents – came to Britain in that great wave of immigration that reshaped Britain in the postwar era. Their parents might have felt they were British because of their new citizenship, but once they got to the UK, they found they were “West Indian”, a catch-all term that no one from the Caribbean would use. Their children were in a different position – yes, they were born in Britain but the question that hung over them was: did that make them British?View image in fullscreenVisual artist Claudette Johnson from Manchester.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianOther Black Britons have a different origin story. Their parents weren’t from the Caribbean or Africa. Neither were their grandparents nor, in many cases, great-grandparents. In Liverpool andCardiff, we find communities with roots dating back to before slavery was abolished across the British empire in the 1830s. These communities were the original multicultural Britain, and they often faced hostility that saw them segregated and attacked. Their stories are hiding in plain sight.For many years, London was where the majority of Black British people lived – hardly surprising given its economic power and the opportunities it offered. Notting Hill, Ladbroke Grove, Hackney, Peckham and Brent: all over the capital Black communities were growing and adjusting to life in Britain. But that is changing. The last census showed that, for the first time since ethnicity was included in 1991, the majority of Black British people live outside the capital.As these communities develop, it’s becoming increasingly unlikely they’ll see themselves represented in popular culture. After the watershed moment of the global Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in 2020, a difficult and stilted conversation about race was forced in the UK. The creative industries tried – often cynically – to address longstanding absences in their collections or portfolios where Black British art should have been. Books, TV shows and films were commissioned and became part of a cultural wave that broke in the wake of BLM.Series about frustrated creatives (Dreaming Whilst Black), opulent family sagas (Riches), Black kids in public schools (Boarders), sci-fi films set on dystopian housing estates (The Kitchen), award-winning gang tales (Top Boy), mould-breaking urban drama (Blue Story), unique accounts of trauma and creativity (I May Destroy You), Black women navigating love and life (Queenie) – there have been so many, yet every single one of those shows or films is set in London or is about Londoners. These aren’t Black British stories; they are part of an ever increasing Black London canon. For commissioners and editors, London is the Black story. But for me and thousands of others, it isn’t – and never could be. The Black London experience doesn’t map neatly on to every Black British experience. There are similarities and staples – food, language, music, hair products – but what makes the experiences different is history.View image in fullscreenBirmingham reggae group Steel Pulse.Photograph: Echoes/RedfernsI’ve found that as soon as you widen the parameters of Black British culture beyond the capital, there’s an untapped reserve to draw from. There are stories that make us reassess moments in our recent history; by examining them, we can understand ourselves and our impact on culture and life in the country as a whole. That reassessment is necessary.Just as I was finishing my book, new research was released showing that 50% of Britons couldn’t name one Black British historical figure. The UK, the authors said, knew “shockingly little” about its own Black history. We’ve had an important wave of corrective histories from David Olusoga, Jason Okundaye, Jim Pines, June Givanni, Ferdinand Dennis, Stella Dadzie, Paterson Joseph, Hakim Adi, Marika Sherwood and Stephen Bourne, but clearly we need more. Perhaps one way of addressing this lack of cut-through is to make these stories truly Black and British – rooting them in locations that have been overlooked, in areas that people don’t think of as Black. Maybe then more British people will pay attention to the history of this small but important island and think of Black history as having taken place in their own towns, cities or parishes, as well as in London.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The journey sent me into dusty archives and on internet trawls searching for names scrawled down on yellowed paper. I spoke to people at the centre of extraordinary events who’ve never been asked about them. I managed to get hold of some interviewees a few months before they died and discovered that many others I wanted to speak to had already passed on. This history might have been staring us in the face, but it’s fragile.There are so many more stories waiting to be unearthed, in cities like Nottingham and Belfast, and towns including Luton and Plymouth. Black history is everywhere on these islands. Without Black people in Wigan, Bradford, Ambleside and Wolverhampton, the country we live in and the culture it has produced would look completely different. What I’ve discovered made me reconsider what I thought Black Britain was and is, what it can encompass and where it might go next.This is an edited extract from We Were There, which is published byBodley Headon17 April.To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Among their number were dozens of Black northern soul fans who influenced the scene and navigated the late 70s in Britain, a time when the far right was on the rise.BradfordThe wrongful arrest and conviction in 1978 of George Lindo, a textile worker from Bradford, triggered an international campaign for his release. At the same time, an American film crew came to the UK to record the reality of life in Britain for its Black residents. The film they made,Blacks Britannica– which captured some of the Lindo campaign – would be banned and censored but its warning proved prophetic.BirminghamAs a moral panic about “Black muggers” and Rastafarians spread in 1979, an academic from Jamaica called Stuart Hall turned the lens around on the media, including the BBC, and accused British journalists of being complicit in the hugely negative coverage Black Britons received. His main inspiration would be the world outside his door in Birmingham, especially the multicultural area of Handsworth.View image in fullscreenHandsworth-born poet Benjamin Zephaniah.Photograph: Michael Ward/Rex FeaturesLiverpoolIn 1981, violent unrest moved around the country, leaving many city centres looking like war zones after clashes between Black communities and the police. Unemployment, poverty and policing fuelled the disturbances in Liverpool, where documentary-maker Bea Freeman captured the thoughts of Black scousers who worked with her on landmark Channel 4 film They Haven’t Done Nothing.WolverhamptonIn the city that was home to Enoch Powell, who became notorious after his “Rivers of Blood” speech, a new generation of Black British artists gathered. Their work reflected the chaotic and racist place Britain was in the early 1980s, but also questioned colonialism and the British empire. In October 1982, they invited other Black artists to a convention that became a launchpad for some of UK art’s biggest names.ManchesterIn Moss Side, behind a small black door, there was a club that acted as a hub connecting all parts of Black Manchester.The Renowelcomed guests including Muhammad Ali, and was linked to the Pan-African movement that had deep roots in the city. As Manchester was reshaped after the second world war, Manchester’s Black population was caught up in the churn and the club became a refuge and incubator for Black British culture.The countrysideAway from the cities, Black Britons were trying to get a foothold as the 80s progressed. The Black Environment Network took on the complacency of politicians who refused to see rural racism as an issue, and included Ingrid Pollard whose artwork Pastoral Interlude tackled the reality for Black Britons who ventured into the green and pleasant land.View image in fullscreenTwo of the Cardiff Three, Yusef Abdullahi (left) and Tony Paris, in 1992, freed after being wrongfully convicted of the murder of Lynette White in 1988.Photograph: Press Association ImagesCardiffCardiff’s Black population was one of the most significant in the country, known as the melting pot that had produced the pop star Shirley Bassey. But it had always been maligned, fetishised and – on occasions – attacked. In the late 80s, as an urban renewal plan sought to transform its Butetown area, a horrific murder saw a group of men framed and an entire community slandered.EdinburghIn January 1989, a Somali asylum seeker’s murder in the Scottish capital appalled the small Black community north of the border. The Lothian Black Forum, which included the former Guardian columnist Gary Younge, campaigned to force the Scottish public and politicians to see the reality of life for Black Scots who were constantly told racism was the “English disease”.Leeds and SheffieldAs the 1980s drew to a close and Thatcher finally faced defeat, a new sound – created by working-class Black Britons – took hold of the rave scene. Bleep’n’bass emanated from places including Leeds and Sheffield. At the same time, a group of Black rugby league players, including Ellery Hanley and Martin Offiah, took the game to new heights and created the blueprint for modern sporting celebrities.Explore more on these topicsBlack British cultureBritish identity and societyHistory booksSocial historyRaceNorthern soulSoulextractsShareReuse this content"

This hard-hitting series about the malign influence of the online “manosphere” arrived just as news broke about a story that had been making UK headlines for nine months: that of notorious crossbow killer Kyle Clifford, who raped and murdered 25-year-old Louise Hunt last year after she ended their relationship. The latest update showed that Clifford had searched the web for Andrew Tate’s podcast mere hours before killing Hunt, her sister Hannah and mother Carol at their family home in Hertfordshire.The show’s star and co-creatorStephen Grahamwas originally horrified by a spate of violent incidents across Britain in which teenage boys committed deadly knife crimes against girls. The actor said these shocking stories “hurt my heart” and asked of him: “What’s going on in our society where this kind of thing is becoming a regular occurrence?” He teamed up with screenwriter Jack Thorne – a regular collaborator who has worked with Graham on such acclaimed British dramas as This Is England, The Virtues and Help – to create a potent drama interrogating this distressing trend. Thorne says they wanted to “look into the eye of male rage”.The gritty, emotionally charged result follows the working-class Miller family from Yorkshire. Their world is blown apart when 13-year-old schoolboy Jamie is arrested in a dawn raid on suspicion of murdering a female classmate, Katie Leonard. Poignantly, Jamie wets himself with panic when armed police burst through his bedroom door. He repeatedly insists he’s innocent. However, it’s no spoiler to say that chilling CCTV footage makes clear who was responsible for the frenzied multiple stabbing. This isn’t a whodunnit, it’s a whydunnit. Exploring what motivated this shocking crime is why Adolescence has struck such a chord.The series tackles the devastating and sometimes fatal consequences of toxic masculinity. The manosphere and Andrew Tate are name-checked in the script but the central character, says Thorne, has been “indoctrinated by voices a lot more dangerous than Tate’s”.Jamie has fallen under the spell of misogynistic influencers and suffered cyber-bullying for being an “incel”. His parents admit that he would shut himself in his bedroom and be on his computer long into the night. They assumed he was safe but he was secretly being radicalised. His story highlights the corrosive impact of social media on impressionable minds and has resonated profoundly with audiences. Parents of teenagers have been watching rapt, heartbroken and horrified in equal measure – with the show clocking up an astonishing 24.3m views in its first four days of release, four times more than the number two show. It tops the Netflix ratings in 71 countries, ranging from Chile to Vietnam. One British police force has even said it should be a “wake-up call for parents”.Labour MP Anneliese Midgley has called for the series to be screened in parliament and in schools, arguing that it could help counter misogyny and violence against women and girls. PM Keir Starmer backed the idea, praising Adolescence and saying that he’d watched it with his own teenage children. Starmer added that violence against girls was “abhorrent … a growing problem … we have to tackle it”.View image in fullscreenSir Keir Starmer talking about Adolescence in parliament.Photograph: House of Commons / PA WireThere have been discussions on the BBC’s Newsnight and Today programmes. Graham appeared live on CNN yesterday, reflecting on how the internet “is parenting our children just as much as we are”. This was followed by an interview on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in which Graham said: “We’re all accountable – the education system, parenting, the community, the government and especially social media.”Thorne has called for the introduction of a “digital age of consent” by banning smartphones for under-16s. Pundits have suggested that social media giants should do more to regulate algorithm-driven extreme content. A recent survey came to the depressing conclusion that more than half of young women are now frightened of their male peers.The debate was further fuelled by former England football manager Sir Gareth Southgate delivering a televised lecture this week, warning about the dangers of “callous, manipulative and toxic influencers” and demanding better male role models. His pleas were echoed by feminist writer Caitlin Moran, author of What AboutMen?, on Channel 4 News. She said toxic masculinity was “very joyless and very depressing”, expressing the hope that Southgate’s speech and Adolescence would be a watershed moment.The series has won widespread plaudits both for its tour de force performances – expect all the cast to be in the mix for major acting awards next year – and for its technical virtuosity. Each episode is filmed in one hour-long continuous take, without any cuts, edits or CGI. The camera never leaves the action, adding an immersive tension that suits the unflinching content. As Adolescence fever has gripped audiences worldwide, Netflix has cannily released behind-the-scenes footage of how the filming was achieved via a cleverly choreographed system of cameras being passed between operators, who fixed them to cranes, vehicles and drones on the fly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The opening part is a police procedural. Subsequent episodes switch gear into a school drama, a two-hander play, then finally a kitchen sink soap opera. These chapters combine into a coherent, gut-punchingly powerful whole. Adolescence currently holds a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and has received unanimous five-star reviews.The Guardian’s critic Lucy Mangan called it“the closest thing to TV perfection in decades”. This view was echoed in the US. Rolling Stone’s Alan Sepinwall hailed it as “among the very best things – and an early contender forthebest thing – you will see on the small screen this year”. In the New York Times, Margaret Lyons described it as “a rich work of social critique”, describing the third episode as “one of the more fascinating hours of TV I’ve seen in a long time”.Safeguarding minister Jess Phillips said: “Netflix’s brilliant Adolescence is not just a drama. It’s a disturbing glimpse into the minds of thousands of young boys warped by the violence and abuse they are witnessing every day online.”Social media is similarly overflowing with praise. Film director Paul Feig saluted the first episode as “one of the best hours of television I’ve ever seen”. While Bafta-winning screenwriter Sarah Phelps saluted its “God-tier writing”. Adolescence looks set to become an all-time TV classic. However, its most lasting legacy could be the urgent questions it asks, the vital conversations it starts and the societal change it kickstarts.Explore more on these topicsAdolescenceTelevisionViolence against women and girlsSocial mediaMenSexual harassmentDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

That may be true, though my own definition of a movie star is looser, less money-minded and very much alive: someone, put simply, who holds your attention in pretty much anything.Florence Pugh is one. Her most recent film,We Live in Time– currently on VOD and hitting DVD shelves on 24 March – is more or less a monument to her star quality, and that of her leading man, Andrew Garfield. Without their combined charisma and unforced chemistry, this time-hopping romantic drama wouldn’t amount to an awful lot. Playwright Nick Payne’s script essentially uses the same building blocks that madeLove Storya smash 55 years ago: two young, beautiful people meet, fall in love and plan the rest of their lives together – only for cancer to suddenly decree that they haven’t long left.Payne and director John Crowley twist their reliable tearjerker formula by scrambling its chronology, showing us the couple’s first fight before their first kiss, and their meet-cute some time after the end is signalled. It’s a cosmetic rejig, since we’re never in doubt as to the overall shape of the story, and it sometimes stalls the emotional momentum of proceedings – but Pugh is so compellingly radiant as the dying woman, spiny and resistant and actively angry in the face of her fate that we feel along with her.View image in fullscreen‘Vulnerability and sangfroid’: Pugh, with Cosmo Jarvis, in Lady Macbeth (2016).Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyIt’s a little over a decade since I interviewed Pugh, then just 18, for theObserver’s“Rising stars of 2015” feature, which remains one of the better professional calls I’ve made. Back then, it was based on a single screen appearance: her eye-catching debut as an ill-fated schoolgirl in Carol Morley’s slippery psychological mysteryThe Falling. An object of obsessive desire for Maisie Williams’s protagonist, she exits proceedings early, but her bright, beguiling presence haunts the remainder of the film. That brief promise was more expansively confirmed two years later inLady Macbeth, William Oldroyd’s rigorous, ruthless study of a headstrong 19th-century child bride taking violent revenge on the patriarchy, which rested heavily on its young star’s capacity for simultaneous vulnerability and sangfroid, all while brazenly rejecting easy sympathy. It was the role that really turned Hollywood on to her talents: few star-is-born vehicles have been quite so uncompromising.What followed were some standard stepping stones for an ingenue on the rise – lively but disposable supporting part in the Liam Neeson action filmThe Commuterand David Mackenzie’s epicOutlaw King(Netflix); creditably headlining the entertaining-enough horror flickMalevolent(Netflix) – along with the less expected prestige assignment of the BBC’s chic, Park Chan-wook-directed Le Carré miniseriesThe Little Drummer Girl(BBC iPlayer), to which Pugh brought a certain intriguing modernity. Also on the Beeb that year, she was a fine Cordelia to Anthony Hopkins’sKing Lear(BBC iPlayer).View image in fullscreenOscar-nominated Pugh, second right, with Emma Watson, Saoirse Ronan and Eliza Scanlen in Little Women (2019)Photograph: Columbia Pictures/ AllstarIt was 2019 that showed the full breadth of Pugh’s gifts. She was warmly rowdy and physically committed as an aspiring wrestler in Stephen Merchant’s underrated sports biopicFighting With My Family, before returning to the intensity with which she made her name in Ari Aster’s brilliant folk horrorMidsommar. Here, she played an unwilling, trauma-ridden cult recruit with an air of abandoned desperation, gradually lapped by numb resilience. And she got a much-deserved Oscar nomination for the best Amy March yet put on the screen in Greta Gerwig’sLittle Women, imbuing the youngest sister of Louisa May Alcott’s oft-adapted chestnut with an unashamed brattiness, giving way to a more mature, cunning pragmatism.The Marvel machine came for Pugh next. As Yelena, the arse-kicking adopted sister of Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow, she was game in both the filmBlack Widowand the spin-off seriesHawkeye(Disney+), though neither repaid her with much in the way of inspiration. (Perhaps the forthcoming 2 May releaseThunderbolts*, elevating Pugh/Yelena to first billing, will serve her better.)View image in fullscreen‘Arse-kicking’, with Scarlett Johansson, in Black Widow.Photograph: Marvel Studios/ AllstarPugh hasn’t let the Marvel Cinematic Universe consume her career, however. Sebastián Lelio’s lithe period psychodramaThe Wonder(Netflix), in which she plays a doughty nurse investigating a supposed miracle child, is certainly a more generous fit for the flinty curiosity she projects on screen. The same was even true of Olivia Wilde’s slick but narratively shambolic thrillerDon’t Worry Darling, a sort ofStepford Wivesupdate that accidentally amplified Pugh’s talents by casting her opposite a floundering Harry Styles. And her unvarnished performance as a guilt-plagued recovering addict in her ex Zach Braff’s earnest grief dramaA Good Persondeepened and sharpened a soft script.Christopher Nolan’s Oscar-guzzlingOppenheimerand Denis Villeneuve’s ravishingDune: Part Twoare better films, of course, though ask less of her;Puss in Boots: The Last Wishand the English-language dub of Miyazaki’sThe Boy and the Heron(Netflix) require only Pugh’s distinctively throaty voice. I eagerly await her turn in a forthcoming new TV adaptation of Steinbeck’sEast of Eden– though I’m confident her movie star status isn’t going anywhere.All titles in bold are widely available to stream unless otherwise specified.Also new on streaming this weekAll We Imagine As Light(Amazon Prime)Payal Kapadia’s wistful, sapphire-toned character study of two Mumbai nurses and flatmates, each bearing their own personal frustrations and romantic yearnings, was a high point in cinemas last year.View image in fullscreenKani Kusruti and Divya Prabha in All We Imagine As Light.Photograph: APRita(Signature)Spanish actress Paz Vega makes her directorial debut with this tender but unsentimental child’s-eye study of a broken home.

Heavy rocker versus cute populist. Working-class rebel v smug bourgeois clone. Tormented genius v girly sentimentalist. Strawberry Fields Forever v Penny Lane.Ian Leslie takes on these tired polarities by reframing the story as a volatile bromance: “passionate, tender and tempestuous, full of longing, riven by jealousy”. However much at odds temperamentally, John and Paul were an indivisible twosome, the driving force of the Beatles, with George and Ringo (not much featured here) as add-ons. The emotional ties they shared, not least the early loss of their mothers, weren’t ones they could talk about, so they sang them instead. As Paul put it: “You can tell your guitar things that you can’t tell people.”To Beatles aficionados, the cast and chronology will be familiar: the Quarrymen, Hamburg, the Cavern, Beatlemania, Abbey Road, the Apple rooftop concert; Brian Epstein, George Martin; Cynthia Lennon, Yoko Ono, Jane Asher, Linda Eastman. But Leslie’s approach is fresh because focused on the double-consciousness (“a duet not a duel”, “a group within the group”) and their “shared ownership of each other’s talent”. He follows them from the teen years when they bunked off classes to strum at each other’s houses (“Paul’s reversed guitar meant that the two of them could act as mirrors for each other”) through jamming sessions in hotel rooms to late-night studio recordings. Their work rate was phenomenal (at the Kaiserkeller they played seven nights a week till two or four in the morning). But so was the intimacy and sense of fun.John had been hurt by Paul’s neglect of him and bullying assumption of command“It’s like you and me are lovers,” John once said, to which Paul grunted assent, and even after the band’s breakup they spoke of their relationship as a marriage. John referred to Paul as “an old estranged fiance” and described how getting together with Yoko reminded him how he’d picked Paul “as my partner”. Maybe, John conceded, “it was a marriage thathadto end”. Still, “I would do anything for him, and I think he would do anything for me.”As Leslie sees it, the marriage didn’t end because of musical differences, but because they were spending less time together, and others had intruded. John’s marriage to Cynthia, and Paul’s long romance with Jane Asher (plus countless flings), didn’t seriously threaten it. But Yoko Ono was a force of nature, and with John quiescent in her domineering presence she became a replacement for Paul; John told her he liked her “because you look like a bloke in drag. You’re like a mate.” Linda Eastman was even more of a threat because Paul allowed her well-to-do family to take over Apple’s financial affairs, much to John’s rage and resentment.After the Beatles broke up, his denunciations of Paul, both in interviews and in music, were ferocious.The Beatlesyears had been humiliating, he said, with Paul “a pretty face” who made muzak, rather than a true artist; Yesterday, a Beatles song with only one Beatle on it, was the epitome of his soppiness. Paul was hurt and John backtracked, describing him as “my closest friend, except for Yoko”. But John had been hurt too, by Paul’s neglect and bullying assumption of command, and there were further outbursts. Nonetheless, his idiom (“dear one”, “brother”) was still tinged with affection.For Leslie, the intensity of their relationship is imprinted in their songs. He spends many pages dissecting them musically and is thorough in identifying influences: behind Hey Jude, for example, he discerns Bach, doo-wop, Broadway, Anglican church music and gospel. But it’s what John called the “eyeball-to-eyeball” collaboration with Paul that interests him most: “They liked to put their faces close together and stare, unblinking, until they felt themselves dissolving into each other,” he writes, a tad mystically. Laughter was crucial (the Beatles loved to lark about). So was whistling: “The way we work,” Paul said, “John will whistle at me and I’ll whistle back to him.” Some of their songs were composed within a couple of hours.Leslie doesn’t shirk the question of how much each contributed to the lyrics and melody of their classics. When John, jealous of Paul’s versatility, claimed to have written half of Eleanor Rigby, it was a wild exaggeration. But the emphasis here is on Lennon-McCartney as a joint enterprise, and the miracle of the songs they wrote together, with their singing voices sometimes indistinguishable and credit to one or the other beside the point: “They were so far inside of each other’s musical minds that it doesn’t matter.”Reading songs as autobiography is dangerous. Leslie’s previous books have been works of psychology, and he’s an armchair shrink in places here, with Freudian digging to find lines that shed light on the John-Paul relationship. His tone can become overexcited. Please Please Me “a cruise missile carrying a payload of joy”? Twist and Shout “a carnal joyride”? Getting Better a “self-help narrative” in which John acts as “a Greek chorus in the drama of his own maturation”? Well, maybe. Attributing the self-assurance John and Paul displayed on stage to “the arrogance of the damaged” is pushing it, too. Then again, John described Strawberry Fields Forever as “psychoanalysis set to music” and Leslie enjoys the complex identity swaps in the collaboration, such as Paul thinking up the title for John’s book In His Own Write: “There is something delicious about a third-person title being suggested by a second person who co-created the first person’s sensibility.”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

He has read all there is to be read, from the pioneering Hunter Davies to therecent Craig Brown, and has consumed many a film and podcast in between. He’s not afraid of terms such as postmodernist and metatextual. But the tone is chatty and engaging, with the emphasis where it should be, on the songs.There’ll still be fans wedded to the old binaries. And though Leslie didn’t interview McCartney for his book, he’s not wholly impartial; it was a 10,000-word lockdown essay about Paul that prompted him to go on and write this. Still, his portrait of John’s fragility and self-destructiveness is sympathetic. And his Paul isn’t a winsome poster boy but tough, cynical and prone to cold fury. “‘I realise now we never got to the bottom of each other’s souls,” Paul once said. The dynamic remains mysterious, but this book takes us closer to understanding it.John & Paul: A Love Story in Songs by Ian Leslie is published by Faber (£25).

Their answers were fascinating, funny – and could help us frame our days on EarthJames BaileySat 22 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 11.35 EDTShareIn September 2015, I was unemployed, heartbroken and living alone in my dead grandad’s caravan, wondering what the meaning of life was. Where was I going to find happiness, or purpose, or meaning? What was the point to all of this?Like any millennial, I turned to Google for the answers. I trawled through essays, newspaper articles, countless YouTube videos, various dictionary definitions and numerous references to thenumber 42, before I discovered an intriguing project carried out by the philosopher Will Durant during the 1930s. Durant had written to Ivy League presidents, Nobel prize winners, psychologists, novelists, professors, poets, scientists, artists and athletes to ask for their take on the meaning of life. His findings were collated in the bookOn the Meaning of Life, published in 1932.I decided that I should recreate Durant’s experiment and seek my own answers. I scoured websites searching for contact details, and spent hours carefully writing the letters, neatly sealing them inside envelopes and licking the stamps. Then I dropped them all into the postbox and waited ...Days, and then weeks, passed with no responses. I began to worry that I’d blown what little money I had on stamps and stationery. Surely, at least one person would respond?When someone finally did, it turned out to be a rejection. My heart continued to sink as I received a spate of letters returned to sender. Eventually, rather excitingly, replies started to drop through my letterbox.During the three months I spent living in the holiday park, walking the cliffs and trying to figure out my life, these responses greatly inspired me. Perhaps, as Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel alluded to in her answer, meaning had emerged through the practice of the quest.What follows is a small selection of the responses, from philosophers to politicians, prisoners to playwrights. Some were handwritten, some typed, some emailed. Some were scrawled on scrap paper, some on parchment. Some are pithy one-liners, some are lengthy memoirs. I sincerely hope you can take something from these letters, just as I did.My letterIn 1931, the philosopher Will Durant wrote to 100 luminaries in the arts, politics, religion and sciences, challenging them to respond not only to the fundamental question of life’s meaning but also to relate how they each found meaning, purpose and fulfilment in their own lives. I am currently replicating Durant’s study, and I’d be most appreciative if you could tell me what you think the meaning of life is, and how you find meaning, purpose and fulfilment in your own life?As Durant originally instructed, “Write briefly if you must; write at length and at leisure if you possibly can.”‘It’s like alchemy’: Hilary Mantel, late authorView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Hilary Mantel/ Robinson/ Little BrownI’ve had your letter for a fortnight, but I had to think about it a bit. You use two terms interchangeably: “meaning” and “purpose”. I don’t think they’re the same. I’m not sure life has a meaning, in the abstract. But it can have a definite purpose if you decide so – and the carrying through, the effort to realise the purpose, makes the meaning for you.It’s like alchemy. The alchemists were on a futile quest, we think. There wasn’t a philosopher’s stone, and they couldn’t make gold. But after many years of patience exercised, the alchemist saw he had developed tenacity, vision, patience, hope, precision – a range of subtle virtues. He had the spiritual gold, and he understood his life in the light of it. Meaning had emerged.‘It might be an idea to find meaning with something smaller, say a pickled walnut’: Michael Frayn, playwright and novelistView image in fullscreenThank you for inviting me to contribute to your anthology of views on the meaning of life. It’s not something I can respond to, I’m afraid, because it’s not clear to me how “life” can have a “meaning” in any ordinary sense of either word. It might be an idea to start with something smaller, say a pickled walnut. Once we’ve got it clear how a pickled walnut could have a “meaning”, we might move on to something larger – the borough of Haringey, say, or influenza – and work our way up.‘I’ve seen death many times. What matters most isn’t success, or wealth’: Kathryn Mannix, palliative care consultantView image in fullscreenEvery moment is precious – even the terrible moments. That’s what I’ve learned from spending 40 years caring for people with incurable illnesses, gleaning insights into what gives our lives meaning. Watching people living their dying has been an enormous privilege, especially as it’s shown me that it isn’t until we really grasp the truth of our own mortality that we awaken to the preciousness of being alive.Every life is a journey from innocence to wisdom. Fairy stories and folk myths, philosophers and poets all tell us this. Our innocence is chipped away, often gently but sometimes brutally, by what happens to us. Gradually, innocence is transformed to experience, and we begin to understand who we are, how the world is, and what matters most to us.The threat of having our very existence taken away by death brings a mighty focus to the idea of what matters most to us. I’ve seen it so many times, and even though it’s unique for everyone, there are some universal patterns. What matters most isn’t success, or wealth, or stuff. It’s connection and relationships and love. Reaching an understanding like this is the beginning of wisdom: a wisdom that recognises the pricelessness of this moment. Instead of yearning for the lost past, or leaning in to the unguaranteed future, we are most truly alive when we give our full attention to what is here, right now.Whatever is happening, experiencing it fully means both being present and being aware of being present. The only moment in our lives that we can ever have any choice about is this one. Even then, we cannot choose our circumstances, but we can choose how we respond: we can rejoice in the good things, relax into the delightful, be intrigued by the unexpected, and we can inhabit our own emotions, from joy to fear to sorrow, as part of our experience of being fully alive.I’ve observed that serenity is both precious and evanescent. It’s a state of flow that comes from relaxing into what is, without becoming distracted by what might follow. It’s a state of mind that rests in appreciation of what we have, rather than resisting it or disparaging it. The wisest people I have met have often been those who live the most simply, whose serenity radiates loving kindness to those around them, who have understood that all they have is this present moment.That’s what I’ve learned so far, but it’s still a work in progress. Because it turns out that every moment of our lives is still a work in progress, right to our final  breath.‘It means, above all, preserving the board on which we play this game’: Bill McKibben, author and environmentalistView image in fullscreenI’ve thought about this a good deal since you wrote.I think the meaning of life is to keep the remarkable game of being human going forward. In the past, this meant reproducing, above all. But, now, it means, above all, preserving the board on which we play this game. And since we’re now setting that board on fire, it’s our job to put that fire out. In our time, that’s the most important task we can undertake, since all depends on it. The best thing about the human game is that it, potentially, can stretch far out into the future – but only if we act now.‘Reading is my cubicle and my treehouse’: Gretchen Rubin, author and happiness expertView image in fullscreenIn my study of happiness and human nature, and in my own experiences, I have found that the meaning of life comes through love. In the end, it is love – all kinds of love – that makes meaning.In my own life, I find meaning, purpose and fulfilment by connecting to other people – my family, my friends, my community, the world. In some cases, I make these connections face-to-face, and in others, I do it through reading. Reading is my cubicle and my treehouse; reading allows me better to understand both myself and other people.‘The secret of life is a very simple thing’: Matt Ridley, science writerView image in fullscreenThere never has been and never will be a scientific discovery as surprising, unexpected and significant as that which happened on 28 February 1953 in Cambridge, when James Watson and Francis Crick found the double-helix structure of DNA and realised that the secret of life is actually a very simple thing: it’s infinite possibilities of information spelled out in a four-letter alphabet in a form that copies itself.‘The first awareness, in Bergen-Belsen, was that kindness and goodwill had survived’: Susan Pollack, Holocaust survivorView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Susan Pollack/ Robinson/ Little BrownIn response to your letter, here are a few thoughts that assisted me to look forward in my youth after those bleak, horrendous times in 1944. I am a camp survivor from Auschwitz and was liberated from Bergen-Belsen on 15 April 1945. I was totally dehumanised, fearful, distrustful, lost to contemplate the future, all alone, unable to comprehend the values for a life in a modern civilisation.Fourteen years old – unable to walk, to express the latent, suppressed anguish – the realisation I only speak Hungarian, no skills, no education, no finance, no support system, no knowledge.The first awareness, in Bergen-Belsen, was the discovery that kindness and goodwill had also survived. When the British soldier lifted me up from the mud hole – seeing a twitch in my body – he gently placed me in one of the small ambulances. From that experience, miraculous goodwill is one of the guiding lights to this day. I often think of that moment and ask, “What part of that goodness with your heart do you take from that soldier?”Kindness, generosity comes in small everyday events. Small measures of goodness have an enormous impact – to this day I take nothing for granted. I remember the effect and appreciation this first helpfulness had on my life – it gradually removed the heavy iron cover on me, and sparks of “I can do” and “I want to do” gradually came into my existence.In Sweden, where I was taken for recuperation for my devastated physical corpse-like being, one of the facilitators had a large collection of classical records. These he played every evening, and we sat around and listened in awe to Beethoven symphonies and other pieces. In my interpretation, I could feel the energy of the music, from sorrow and despair to the drive of supreme human effort to rise above those destructive memories. I must say not completely – personally, I don’t want to let it go completely – but I am free of the chains which deprived me in the camps. Music, generally, has an enormous effect on my life.I moved on. I became a Samaritan helper for some eight years. I took a degree at the age of 60 and then a diploma in psychology. For me, life is full of possibilities, like a search engine – find your meaning for existence that makes me feel worthy – self-esteem is the reward.I was fortunate in having a family and could play with my grandchildren, reclaiming those years of persecution.I remember the doctor in Sweden who took me in his arms to teach me walking, and turned to me saying: “I have a little girl like you.” What a discovery about myself – powerful words that still ring in my ears long after 70 years – I cherish kind words. These are the propelling force to continue our journey and many more small events that had a huge impact on my life.‘I could not be happy if the only things that motivated me were purely mercenary’: John Major, former prime ministerView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: The Rt Hon Sir John Major/ Robinson/ Little BrownIt is not easy to respond to this, except perhaps in the negative: life would have no meaning without family and friends, nor without an incentive for getting out of bed each morning. I could not be happy if I were idle, nor if the only things that motivated me were purely mercenary, with no personal interest or connection. We all need a purpose – large or small – and that, to me, is what gives life its meaning.‘I want to show up fully, or as fully as possible, for my time on Earth’: Oliver Burkeman, author and journalistView image in fullscreenI agree with the scholar of mythology Joseph Campbell, that it makes more sense to say that what we’re seeking isn’t a meaning for life, so much as the experience of feeling fully alive. There are experiences that I know, in my bones, are “why I’m here” – unhurried time with my son, or deep conversations with my wife, hikes in the North York Moors, writing and communicating with people who’ve found liberation in something I have written. I would struggle, though, if I were to try to argue that any of these will “mean something” in some kind of timeless way, for example, 500 years from now.What’s changed for me is that I no longer feel these experiences need this particular kind of justification. I want to show up fully, or as fully as possible, for my time on Earth. That’s all – but, then again, I think that is everything. And so I try, on a daily basis, to navigate more and more by that feeling of aliveness – rather than by the feeling of wanting to be in control of things, which is alluring, but deadening in the end.‘The meaningless cruelty of my niece’s death taught me about life’s purpose’: Monica Heisey, author, essayist and screenwriterView image in fullscreenYours is a big question, certainly, and one I have been thinking about a lot this year. Last spring, my niece Rosemary was born, squirming and healthy and pink, with my sister’s big blue eyes and my brother-in-law’s button nose. Nine days later, she died in her sleep. On the phone with my sobbing mother, I realised my sense of life’s meaning had been undefined, or at least had never been tested. I’d been chugging along, untouched by capital-T tragedy, oblivion feeling blissfully abstract.Confronted for the first time with the Real Deal, I searched for meaning, and found none. There had been no warning, would turn out to be no cause, and of course it had not happened “for a reason”. Something terrible had occurred from nowhere, and now our lives were changed for ever, and Rosie would not get to have one. I felt nihilism like a riptide, swirling around me and tugging at my ankles. It would have been easy to go under.But the days and weeks after the meaningless cruelty of Rosie’s death also taught me about life’s purpose, or at least showed me a way I might define it. I had anticipated a week of quiet mourning punctuated by a kind of depressed chaos as everyone scrambled to arrange a funeral and perform grim and foreign administrative tasks. I assumed tragedy on this scale would feel lonely. But my memories from that period are densely populated: old friends rallying, travelling long distances to hold my sister and her husband and look at pictures and remember a person they would never get to know; my long-divorced parents coming together to provide a soft place to land for their three long-grown children; distant relatives with stories we’d never heard about cousins we’d also never be able to meet; a cluster of colleagues surrounding my sister, huddling like a football team about to break for a challenging second half; the unlikely presence of my divorce lawyer with a box of homemade scones and clotted cream.Instead of numb or adrift, I felt almost painfully alive. We were surrounded, I realised, by Rosie’s community, who were, of course, ours too. There were faces I hadn’t seen in years – due to life and geography and the pandemic – and I saw then that they had not been gone, not really. We hadn’t “lost touch”, we had just been busy, all of us, with work and children and the business of living, but now they were needed, and so here they were. Increasingly, I think this is the only purpose we have: to be in connection with each other, to batten down our collective hatches against life’s many and various brutalities. To me, everything else that feels like purpose – making and consuming art, engaging in collective efforts to better society or the planet, listening deeply to loved ones – is really an avenue to connection, providing it and being enriched by it, too.In terms of happiness, many people more intelligent than I have suggested shooting for contentment instead, and I think they are right. Still, there are some things that make me reliably happy, and I have found much contentment in cultivating opportunities to experience them. These include: friends’ laughter, reading at the bar, unrealistically flattering denim, good gossip, morning sex, coffee and a walk with a slight hangover, a sunny day experienced from a safely shaded area, cornbread, cats, the exhilaration of being bad at something new, boxing (relatedly), and making a sauce for three to five hours. There are more, of course – the list grows all the time – and keeping track of them feels important.I suppose happiness is knowing what is personally meaningful to you, and engaging with it, which is kind of a nice full circle to come to in this letter. A natural conclusion that returns to the beginning makes me happy, too. Another for the list.‘Four and a half decades of my life have been in a hole, but I’ve still enjoyed it’: Charles Salvador, aka Charles Bronson, one of Britain’s longest-serving prisonersView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLetter from Charles Bronson, for Saturday magazine - Meaning of Life, Mar 22Photograph: Charles Bronson/ Robinson/ Little BrownLife is, to me, a gift.You have to respect it.Appreciate it.Hold on to it for as long as possible.People who let go don’t deserve it.Four and a half decades of my life have been in a hole, But I’ve still enjoyed it.I made it work for me.Coz I found “myself”.[Overleaf] Never piss on a rattlesnake!‘Failure is fine. It’s how you respond to it that makes all the difference’: Fatima Whitbread, retired British javelin throwerView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Fatima Whitbread/ Robinson/ Little BrownIf you add value to other people’s lives, you’ll never be at a loss for living a life of purpose. The purpose is what ultimately leads to happiness. Society emphasises success a great deal, and some people overreact to it by being overly harsh on themselves, on their perceptions of what success is. Rather, ask yourself, how can I add value today? And then do it.My learning is that you’re going to fail. If you do anything at all in life that is noteworthy. On the other hand, if you play it safe you might not fail. But then you probably didn’t reach your fullest potential, either. Failure is fine. It’s how you respond to it that makes all the difference in the world.Don’t blame anyone for the failure, least of all yourself. Simply acknowledge what has happened, note what you’ve learned and how you’d do it differently next time, and move on. Make no excuses. They are simply a waste of everybody’s time. Worst comes to worst, you’ve learned something new that makes you a more multi-dimensional person, an interesting person. After all, it’s not failing that matters, but learning from our failures.And if you don’t try, how can you possibly fail in the first place?‘I asked my mother what she thought it was, from her now frail vantage point’: Anil Seth, professor of cognitive and computational neuroscienceView image in fullscreenIt feels strange to be writing to you about the meaning of life while my mother is struggling to hold on to hers. At the age of 89 she’s had a long life by the standards of human history, but any human life is the briefest glimmer in the vastness of time. The inconceivable brevity of human existence brings questions about meaning, purpose and fulfilment into sharp relief.My mother was born in York in 1934, on Christmas Day, and grew up playing in the ruins of bombed-out buildings. She was a teacher, and later an artist and a landscape photographer. Lately, before her recent illness, she would wonder to me at the prospect of nonexistence. She knows she will die, as most of us do at some level, but she cannot imagine not existing. As the horizons of her life have contracted, she has been able to find contentment in simpler and simpler things: the rhythms of the garden, the play of light on the leaves of a tree. This flexibility suggests to me that meaning, purpose and fulfilment are not only different things, but moving targets, if they are targets at all.I’ve spent my career trying to understand more about the mystery of consciousness. About how the mess of neural wetware inside our heads can give rise to the everyday miracle of experience. Consciousness is intimately familiar to each of us. We all know what it’s like to be conscious, and what it’s like to lose consciousness when we fall into a dreamless sleep. The nature of consciousness is also endlessly perplexing, confounding scientists and thinkers for thousands of years.Some people worry that pursuing a scientific perspective on conscious experience might drain life of meaning by reducing us to mere biological machinery. I have found the opposite to be the case. There is no reduction. There is rather a continuity with the natural world, and with this continuity comes an expansion, a wider and deeper perspective. As we gradually pull back the curtains on the biological basis of conscious experience in all its richness, there are new opportunities to take ourselves and our conscious lives less for granted. We can see ourselves more as part of, and less apart from, the rest of nature. Our brief moments in the light of existence become more remarkable for having happened at all.A recognition of the precarity of consciousness can help defuse some of our existential fears. We do not usually worry much about the oblivion that preceded our birth, so why should we worry about the equivalent oblivion that will follow our death? Oblivion isn’t the experience of absence, it is the absence of experience. As the novelist Julian Barnes put it, in his meditation on mortality, there is “nothing to be frightened of”.I’ve come to think of consciousness as the precondition for meaning. An argument can be made that without consciousness, nothing would matter at all. Meaning, purpose and fulfilment can take many forms against this backdrop. The Aristotelian concept of eudaimonia best captures what I have in mind here. Eudaimonia means living well, flourishing, doing that which is worth doing. It is not about pleasure or hedonic satisfaction, nor is it about selfless sacrifice for some greater good. It involves realising one’s potential through cultivating virtues such as reason, courage and wisdom. Fundamentally, it comes down to doing a bit of good and feeling good about doing so.For me, participating in some small way in the scientific and philosophical journey to understand ourselves and our place in nature, and communicating some of this journey to others, offers the promise of a slice of eudaimonia. In practice, frustration lurks at every turn. There is the risk of hubris when dealing with such apparently grand matters. And the dramas of everyday life get in the way.Which brings me back to my mother. Today she has rallied, unexpectedly confounding the prognosis of the doctors. I asked her what she thought the meaning of life was, from her now frail vantage point. She told me it was about relationships with other people, and who can argue with that.‘My brief answer: what the hell?’: Alan Ayckbourn, playwright and directorView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alan Ayckbourn/ Robinson/ Little BrownSixty years ago, with a burgeoning career, on the verge of being a professional playwright and director, I would probably have readily answered your question. I felt, as they say, that the world was at my feet. These days, alas, I sense very much it is on my back. I have no idea why I write, nor indeed why I’m still alive. Probably the writing is as much a reflex for me as breathing. That’s all I can say.Sorry, but you caught me at the wrong end of my existence. My brief answer: what the hell?‘I do not need to know it’: Charles Duhigg, author of The Power of HabitView image in fullscreenWhat is the meaning of life? I can honestly say: I have no idea. But I write this in London, where I am visiting with my wife and two boys. And they are healthy and safe, and (mostly) happy, and there’s joy in watching their delights: a clothing stall with a jacket they’ve long wanted; the way the double-decker bus carries us above the fray; a monument to scientific discoveries beside a flower garden and goats.I’m surrounded by evidence – of the blitz, D-day, colonies despoiled, JFK and MLK and 9/11 – that all could be otherwise. I hear about bombs falling on innocents, an uncertain election, a faltering climate, and many of us lacking the will (or charity) to change.Yet still I marvel that we flew here in under 12 hours – while my ancestors required months and tragedies to transit in reverse – and that I will send this note simply by hitting a button, and we can love whomever we want, and see and speak to them at any hour, and a pandemic did not end my life, did not kill my children’s dreams, did not make society selfish and cruel.And, for now, that’s enough. I do not need to know the meaning of life. I do not need to know the purpose of it all. Simply breathing while healthy and safe, and (mostly) happy is such a surprising, awe-inducing, humbling gift that I have no right to question it. I won’t tempt fate. I won’t look that gift horse in the mouth. I’ll simply hope my good fortune continues, work hard to share it with others, and pray I will remember this day, this moment, if my luck fades .This is an edited extract from The Meaning of Life: Letters from Extraordinary People and their Answer to Life’s Biggest Question, edited by James Bailey and published by Robinson on 3 April.

We did between 180 and 200 shows a year. But driving up and down the motorways is the hard part because the traffic is so much heavier than it ever was … There was never a problem with recovering from a show because that’s the thing that brings you to life. We were always fit to do a show. It’s just the driving up and down motorways.”McNally, who formed the band when he was 16 in 1957, said: “The traffic is now an absolute nightmare.”View image in fullscreenJohn McNally of the Searchers on stage at Theatre Royal Wakefield.Photograph: Paul Thompson/West Yorkshire ImagesThe Merseybeat band found fame playing in the clubs ofLiverpooland Hamburg. Their debut No 1 hit Sweets for My Sweet in 1963 was followed by the chart-toppers Needles and Pins and Don’t Throw Your Love Away, establishing them as a global act by the mid-1960s.But they have never played Glastonbury until now. “No one’s asked us,” Allen said. “The Searchers are finally performing at the greatest music festival of them all. What a way to round off a tour and a career.”McNally added: “A Glastonbury debut at 83! Can anyone top that? … We can’t wait to see our fans again for this incredible final farewell.”Glastonbury has long championed ageing stars, including Paul McCartney, who headlined in 2022 at the age of 80. Those playing this year include Rod Stewart, 80, and Neil Young, 79.Watch the Searchers performing Needles and Pins on the Ed Sullivan show in the US, 1964.McNally – the son of a Liverpool docker and a barmaid – said some of the veterans keep on playing because there is now money to be made. The Searchers were among many musicians who did not earn much in the past: “In the 1960s, no one had a rulebook to follow, no person to look after them. We just went through the motions and got ripped off.”He added: “You think: hang on, where’s the money going? We did our first tour of America in 1964 and, when we got back, it was like: ‘tuppence for you and tuppence for you and tuppence for you …’. What? We were paying for everything.

He was once described by the former education ministerPap Ndiayeas “very close to the most radical far right”. Bolloré, in a senate hearing in 2022, denied political or ideological interventionism, saying his interest in acquiring media was purely financial and his cultural empire was about promoting French soft power. He said his group was so vast, it contained all views.But some independent booksellers say it is dangerous for democracy for one conglomerate to have such a huge influence on cultural output. Hachette Livre, which was part of the Lagardère group bought by Bolloré’s Vivendi in 2023, is the No 1 publisher and book distributor in France. It owns scores of publishing houses, producing the bestselling Asterix comic books, literary fiction, thrillers, political titles, Manga comics and school textbooks. The group also owns the Relay bookstores at French train stations. Hachette has more than 200 publishing imprints worldwide. It is the second biggest publishing conglomerate in the UK, where it owns Hodder & Stoughton, and is the third biggest in the US.As well as the moves by some booksellers, protest groups on the left have started a “bookmark rebellion”, where individuals hide bookmarks inside paperbacks in large commercial stores with messages such as “boycott Hachette”, detailing the scale of the Bolloré empire.View image in fullscreenHearts and reviews for books in Le Pied à Terre.Photograph: Ed Alcock/The GuardianThese bookmarks have regularly been placed inside the memoirs of the former UK prime ministerBoris Johnson, published in France by a Hachette imprint, and ofJordan Bardella, the young president of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally, whoseCe que je cherche(What I’m Looking For) has sold more than 150,000 copies, with the might of Bolloré’s publicity machine behind it.Willems acknowledged it was hard to rebel against a group that controlled such a large part of distribution. “We’d like to be able to stage a boycott,” he said. But this was impossible because of Hachette imprints’ vast back- catalogue, which includes key authors such as the punk feministVirginie Despentesand writers including Lola Lafon. “A boycott would be damaging for customers who want to read those writers. So we do what we can,” he said.This meant not ordering certain new books, or taking fewer copies and placing them away from prime positions on tables. Willems will also limit events for Hachette books, with one recent exception for a local novelist friend of the bookshop.View image in fullscreenA customer browses in Le Pied à Terre.Photograph: Ed Alcock/The GuardianWillems said customers had been interested to learn about Bolloré’s presence in publishing. “But it’s hard for people these days. They’re wary of what food to buy, what clothes to buy and now it’s what books they buy. It becomes exhausting.”In Lyon, Martin Beddeleem, from the independent bookshopLa Virevolte, said: “In the book world, we’ve been worried for some time about the concentration of ownership that runs from book editing to publishing and distribution.” In the current polarised political landscape in France, he felt that books could become “a weapon”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bookshop will host a public debate on the issue in June.Benoît Grange, from the climate protest collective Les Soulèvements de la Terre, part of the bookmark protest, said: “This is about informing readers. Around 700,000 bookmarks have been printed. People keep asking us for more so they can slide them into books in shops. It’s ongoing.”The French Nobel-winning novelistAnnie Ernauxsaid at the time of the Hachette takeover thatshe would refuseto be published by the group.This week, the representative body for staff at Hachette Livre,expressed concernsover what it called an editorial line close to the far right in Bolloré’s other print and TV media.Jean-Yves Mollier, a historian of French publishing and professor at the University of Versailles-Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, said Bolloré’s expansion had added “an enormous publishing conglomerate” to a media empire. Mollier likened this to the expansion of the media mogulRupert Murdochinto book publishing in the US. “I think for freedom of expression, pluralism and democracy it can represent a risk,” he said.Hachette Livre was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsBooksFranceParisPublishingEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

Elegantly scripted by Suri,Santoshcombines gripping, gritty storytelling with a deft acknowledgment of some of the murkier aspects of modern India: the police corruption and brutality, the baked-in sexism, the caste prejudice and anti-Muslim sentiment. It strikes a tricky balance between perceptive, issue-led film-making and propulsive entertainment.The movie was this year’s UK submission to the international Oscar category, but due to problems with the censors is yet to be released in India. It follows the journey of the eponymous central character. Recently widowed Santosh (a magnetic, watchful turn by Shahana Goswami) is, thanks to a government scheme, offered her late husband’s job as a police officer. It’s an opportunity that grants her independence from her hectoring, judgmental in-laws and a growing self-respect. Level-headed, serious and diligent, Santosh is instinctively suited to the job. When a scandal involving the murder of a Dalit (the lowest caste) girl threatens to ignite local unrest, Geeta (Sunita Rajwar, excellent), the veteran female cop brought in to quell the rising tension, immediately spots Santosh’s potential and brings her on to the case as her second-in-command.It is, Santosh soon realises, a dubious honour. Geeta’s slippery charisma and ruthlessness earn the respect of her male colleagues, but her methods are suspect and her motives, in supporting her younger colleague, opaque. Through the quiet intelligence of Goswami’s impressive performance, we grasp, as she does, that a case closed doesn’t necessarily mean that justice has been done.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for Santosh.Explore more on these topicsDrama filmsThe ObserverIndiaCrime filmsWorld cinemareviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s exquisite and confounding. For one, it demands its audience be extremely tall to witness anything unless they are in the first dozen, tightly packed rows. The view is not great for the rest of the 4,800 people here – a shame, because there’s so much to take in.Since her career began more than a decade ago, twigs’s work has been doggedly conceptual, with a keen eye for visuals – physically grounded in movement as well as musically abstract. Defying convention is baked into her offering. Now it feels as though Tahliah Debrett Barnett has the audience, and the big label budget, to really go nuts with set design.A mysterious black cube broods centre stage as shrouded dancers contort their bodies. Encased in a hard-edged khaki bodice and flowing gown, twigs begins Act I a cappella, her delicate soprano in contrast to the harsh, monochrome environment. Her back catalogue is full of these contrasts, artfully delivered, but this set dials them up: the gossamer within the hard-edged, the sad inside the sexy.When twigs does grab a microphone, her range is magnificent, from coo to trill to bawlMary Magdalene, from her 2019MagdaleneLP, finds twigs intoning about “a woman’s work, a woman’s prerogative”, quoting Kate Bush as disembodied, polyphonic backing vocals fill the space. Soon, though, we’re in the judder of a warehouse rave. The set plunges into the club-oriented physicality ofEusexua,an album about a feeling that – roughly – translates as a kind of orgasmic flow state where the self dissolves, leaving pure inspiration in its wake. Everybody on stage is in their pants.Part throb, part sob,Eusexua’sRoom of Foolsaccurately restates the joyous abandon of dancing it out. We now refer to this as “somatic healing”, but – in one coining or another – expunging mental suffering through the body has always featured in human ritual movement. “We’re open wounds, just bleeding out the pressure,” twigs sings.Watch the video for Room of Fools by FKA twigs.The context here is that twigs unexpectedly found liberation at Prague warehouse raves while filmingThe Crowa couple of years back. The backstory to that, however, is gruelling – including, but not limited to, her relationship with the actor Shia LaBeouf. Histrial for alleged assault, battery and emotional distresswas postponed until September this year. “I was hanging on by an eyelash,” twigs toldImogen Heap in an interview hosted by Spotify.Anyone wanting to pursue the Tahliah Debrett Barnett technique, meanwhile, should search for the 11-step somatic healing sequence twigs came up with to reattune:The Eleven.A few months back it became another movement piece,performed at Sotheby’s.Later tonight, twigs and her dancers will find themselves trapped inside the stark cube’s smothering, diaphanous walls, fighting their way out in a sort of 3D shadow play with impressive depth of field. Later still, the structure will be revealed as a skeleton of girders with pulleys, an industrial space with chain swings and a pole to dance on – play as torture, or the other way around. Twigs spends a lot of time spinning upside down, her physicality ecstatically sinuous and masochistically racked.View image in fullscreenFKA twigs and her A-game dancers.Photograph: Richard Saker/the ObserverGreat swathes of this gig pass in choreography. Her troupe know they are working for a dancer who went pro in childhood, so bring their A-game to every twitch. One indisputable highlight comes with the terrific percussive workoutDrums of Death, which re-enacts theSeveranceoffice vibe moves of the track’s video. Another occurs onGirl Feels Good, an homage to Madonna that also takes its choreographic inspiration from her line dancing-themedDon’t Tell Mevideo (2000).Purists will grouse that, with dance given equal billing, twigs does not actually sing every note. “Live” is, admittedly, an elastic concept at many pop shows where the music so often arrives via playback. There’s no band, but twigs’s producer Koreless DJs and plays piano. Two dancers, Eddy Soares and James Vu Anh Pham, double as instrumentalists, with guitar, clarinet and piano given live cameos. And when twigs does grab a microphone, her range is magnificent, from coo to trill to bawl.View image in fullscreenFKA twigs at Aviva Studios, ManchesterPhotograph: Richard Saker/the ObserverQuestion marks must also hover over – spoiler alert – the prop beast that turns up in Act III, a winged demon that, eventually, appears to peel back its own head to reveal a giant baby-like mask of twigs’s face. In a production laced with impactful moments delivered with elegance – the goring of a dancer in silhouette at the culmination ofNumbers, the funny, affecting mid-set faux interview skit that segues intoKeep It, Hold It– the monster feels overbaked.All is forgiven, though, as twigs’s back catalogue dovetails into some of the most accessible music of her career.Perfect Stranger– the most commercial pop she has yet made – is an absolute banger that deserved vertiginous chart placings. It all ends with the 2019 track that she used to be most famous for,Cellophane. Long pregnant gaps between her sung lines climax into a pained howl. By this point, unscripted visuals have become part of the show – giant backlit silhouettes of twigs playing out on the venue walls.Explore more on these topicsFKA twigsKitty Empire's artist of the weekPop and rockElectronic musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

It also requires a steely determination to cope with both the paucity of work at home and the bureaucratic nightmare abroad after Brexit.Successive Tory governments presided over the decline of our leading opera companies, withhuge cuts in funding at English National Opera, where seasons are shorter, productions recycled and the orchestra, chorus and music staff put on short-term contracts. And Glyndebourne and Welsh National Opera haven’t escaped the knife, forcing them to cease touring; so much for levelling up.Boris Johnson’s chaotic Brexit agreement simply forgot that pulling away from Europe would not only make life difficult for exporters – it would place huge barriers in the way of musicians. There’s talk of trying to ease these restrictions, but is there the political will to do some joined-up thinking too? Music is a huge earner for this country, but music education is becoming the preserve of those who can afford it. If our new government is serious about supporting the arts (and growth), it must make music a natural part of the curriculum and help create real opportunities for those who want to progress. That sounds like a vain hope when disability benefits are being cut and defence spending rising, but we know that access to music-making – in whatever form and at whatever level – can have a positive effect on young people’s health and wellbeing. It’s better than staring at a screen.How ironic, then, that Britain, seen across the world as a leading centre of excellence for music training at conservatoire level, has so few opportunities for graduates once they are ready for work. Traditionally, new British singers have had to head to Europe to gain the experience they cannot find at home, but now the paperwork around visas and work permits makes this a daunting prospect, both for the singer and the employer. And the opportunity for worldwide audiences to hear young artists diminishes even further with the threatenedwithdrawal of BBC Radio 3 from digital services overseas. Given all this, it’s gratifying to see that roll numbers have remained consistent at two of our top royal colleges, and – judging by two new Mozart productions staged last week – whatever the hurdles, there are new stars emerging.Having cast members in gowns and masks wrestling with breathing apparatus felt uncomfortable on the fifth anniversary of lockdownOne name to watch is Ross Fettes, who sang Figaro in the first of two casts in the Royal College of Music’sLe nozze di Figaro,directed with wit and charm by Jeremy Sams. Fettes is the whole package, possessing a fine, lyrical bass-baritone and a nimble way with comedy when outwitting his lecherous boss, Count Almaviva, sung by Sam Hird, a strong performer who grew in stature vocally as the evening progressed. Charlotte Jane Kennedy triumphed as Susanna, Figaro’s equally crafty fiancee, her creamy soprano voice carrying her effortlessly through one of the most demanding roles in the repertoire.Soprano Madeline Boreham brought an admirable, dignified grace to her portrayal of Countess Almaviva, and fine control to her centrepiece aria Dove sono. Mezzo Cecilia Yufan Zhang was wonderfully energetic as the page Cherubino, and notable among the smaller roles were tenor Marcus Swietlicki as Basilio, Alexandria Moon as Marcellina and Bella Marslen as Barbarina. Diction was strong throughout and ensemble singing particularly impressive.The RCMOperaOrchestra responded well to conductor Michael Rosewell’s measured tempi, with some fine woodwind playing particularly evident. Movement director Scott Howland enhanced the comedy with some witty footwork, in a production that was set in a crumbling 1980s French chateau, designed by Alex Doidge-Green and lit by Tim Mitchell.Lighting by Charlie Morgan Jones played a central role over at the Royal Academy of Music in its production ofDie Zauberflöte, the bare stage dominated by dozens of fixed floodlights and about 20 neon strips that hovered, rose and descended in a balletic emulation of the action – one even transforming into the magic flute of the title. Mozart’s singspiel is endlessly adaptable, and here director Jamie Manton and designer Justin Nardella chose to make the sage Sarastro a charismatic surgeon and his temple a hospital, with patients as his devotees. But having cast members in gowns and masks wrestling with tubes and breathing apparatus as the overture progressed felt uncomfortable on the fifth anniversary of the pandemic lockdown.View image in fullscreen‘Instantly engaging’: Conrad Chatterton as Papageno in Die Zauberflöte at the Royal Academy of Music.Photograph: Craig FullerIn the first iteration of this double-cast show, however, we had a fine Papageno to lighten the mood. Mellifluous baritone Conrad Chatterton was instantly engaging, making the most of his role as birdcatcher/hospital cleaner in this extended post-operative hallucination, complete with cart, mops and disinfectant. Spectacular Queen of the Night Binny Supin Yang electrified the audience with her superb coloratura, which contrasted nicely with the velvety soprano of her disillusioned daughter, Pamina (Grace Hope-Gill). Daniel Vening made an impressively sage Sarastro, noble in his aria O Isis und Osiris, with tenor Owen Lucas a suitably menacing Monostatos and bass Theodore McAlindon a sonorous Speaker. Conductor Olivia Clarke kept the sparky Royal Academy Sinfonia on their toes with some enjoyably lively tempi.Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the evening was the quality of the voices in the excellent chorus, promising more standout solo performances in future productions. Most of the principals in both of these shows will be going on to engagements in summer opera seasons in the UK and abroad, but what comes after depends as much on political will as it does on their undoubted talents.Star ratings (out of five)Le nozze di Figaro★★★★Die Zauberflöte★★★Le nozze di Figarois at the Britten theatre, Royal College of Music, London, until Saturday 22 MarchExplore more on these topicsClassical musicThe ObserverOperaRoyal College of MusicRoyal Academy of MusicreviewsShareReuse this content"

She is best known for the 2010 novelRoom, narrated by a child who has been raised in a single room by his kidnapped mother.The Wonderis set mostly in a cramped 19th-century rural Irish cottage, then in 2020 cameThe Pull of the Stars, located, with eerie prescience, in the pandemic isolation ward of a Dublin maternity hospital in 1918. Most recently, there was 2022’sHaven, where Donoghue isolates three seventh-century monks on a speck of rock in the Irish Sea.A 19th-century express train is a neat way to contain a bigger slice of life, a social history with passengers pre-divided into first, second and third class (third at the front, naturally, to absorb coal dust and the impact of possible collisions). Each carriage is “as intimate as a dinner party, but one with no host and guests assembled at random”. And as the maids and anarchists, artists and playwrights, medics, engineers and politicians mingle, we glimpse issues of race, sexuality and poverty through concerns ranging from the petty (bad smells, needing the loo) to the cataclysmic (impending childbirth, possible mass murder).The passenger we spend most time with is an angry young class warrior, Mado, “upright as a toy soldier in a straight skirt, a collar and tie, brilliantined hair cut to just below the ears”. Early on, we discover that the lunch bucket she clutches might contain something more sinister than sandwiches. Blonska, an elderly Russian in gauzy hand-me-downs, is the only one to clock this. We also meet 22-year-old Marcelle, a half-Cuban medical student who can’t resist diagnosing her fellow passenger, a sick 18-year-old girl who bruises easily and suffers night sweats. In another carriage we find Alice Guy, secretary at the photographic company Gaumont, trying to convince her dull boss that the Lumière brothers’ technique of stringing images together has more than documentary potential; it could be “something really captivating”.In less skilled hands, all these characters might become a roster of types, but Donoghue is too deft and intelligent to let us lose our wayThis train, then, contains real historical figures. Some (the politicians and the crew) were indeed there; others, as Donoghue writes in an afterword, are “plausible guests”. These include Irish playwright John Synge, seen scribbling in a notebook, and one-armed civil engineer Fulgence Bienvenüe, who tells his fellow travellers, husband and wife Émile Levassor and Louise Sarazin-Levassor, about his plan for underground electrified trains in Paris. Levassor, a motorcar enthusiast, pooh-poohs this ludicrous notion; in 10 years, he says, everyone will have a motorcar. (The real Émile, Donoghue’s note tells us, pioneered the motorcar industry, and Louise became “Mother of the Motorcar” after he died from – yes – car crash injuries.)These knowing winks are fun, if a little pantomimic. There is a sense of people swapping historically pertinent information. Showgirl Annah, once an artist’s model, tells Synge how one painter, Gauguin, treated her badly so she sold all his belongings, except the “stupid pictures” no one would buy. In less skilled hands, all these characters might become a roster of types, or simply meld, but Donoghue is too deft and intelligent to let us lose our way, giving them props – hummingbird earrings, a bucket of oysters, a wooden arm – so that we may move in and out of carriages and still recognise people.Very occasionally, a more intriguing consciousness muscles in: the train itself. “Since Granville, Engine 721 has been scenting danger somewhere along her flanks.” This is curious, unexpected, and has weird potential. I longed for more.But there is no time for that. The form offers frustratingly limited scope for character complexity or nuance. Instead, there is a lively Agatha Christie feel, with potted biographies and neat social commentary fuelled by the key question: can anyone survive this? As Engine 721 clatters towards Paris, we bounce between stories while Mado’s lunch bucket provides what Blonska calls the “agony of this suspense”. But Donoghue’s central concern is more existential. It is almost Beckettian, really, this vision of life as individuals crammed into metal containers, enduring clanking discomforts and talking at each other as they move towards the inevitable end. The real question is human and timeless and, frankly, rather apposite. As Blonska puts it: “How to carry on minute by minute, when you don’t know how long you’ve got.”The Paris Express by Emma Donoghue is published by Picador (£18.99).

I’m only loosely familiar with the concept ofPac-Man, having played it a handful of times. There is something about being relentlessly pursued around an inescapable maze that I’ve always found quite stressful and I am fearing that the real-life experience will be that but on steroids.Manchester’s Pac-Man Live, which opened on Friday, is the latest in what is becoming a rapidly blossoming market for live experiences, following the success of immersive nostalgic exploits such as theCrystal Mazeand life-size Monopoly.A total of 45 years after Pac-Man launched, the game has chomped its way into our cultural hall of fame and there is no doubt the live version will be incredibly popular.The game can accommodate up to eight players at a time – there are seven of us from the Guardian’sManchesteroffice – and we’re pitted against each other in a hyper-competitive high-energy arena with giddy lights and a barrage of sounds.Our vibrant host introduces himself as Wakka Wakka Bob, a name I assume he wasn’t born with. He says we can call him Bob.View image in fullscreenWakka Wakka Bob, or Bob.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianWe don what is perhaps best described as a digital tabard, with a yellow lit-up Pac-Man on the front, and we’re handed an iPad to enter our names, which then appear on our backs.Only one of us is imaginative enough to put in a nickname, “Jess-Man”, which prompts our host to jokingly ask in a mock-Geordie accent: “Are you from Newcastle, like?”“Yes I am actually,” comes the reply from the Guardian’s social affairs correspondent, Jessica Murray.Bob explains the rules, which are broadly the same as the traditional arcade game: each player aims to eat as many pellets as possible, collecting fruit and avoiding ghosts, which are projected on the ground.View image in fullscreenRetro computer game with Pac-Man and his enemy character.Photograph: M-Studio/AlamyHe then gives a dizzying list of different types of fruit and explains the points values associated with them. I remember cherries are 100 points but after that I’m lost.Strawberries are worth something, apples are worth more. The big one is something that looks like a grapefruit. And then there’s a key and a bell? I soon realise I should probably have paid more attention to the details.Each ghost has a name, says Bob, but I don’t have the brain capacity to learn them. The only bit that sinks in about the ghosts is that the red one is the worst one. I make a mental note to avoid that specific one.We stand in our spots in the maze. There’s a dramatic countdown. And the game begins. Suddenly, I am no longer Robyn Vinter, the Guardian’s north ofEnglandcorrespondent. I am a small yellow chomping machine. I am Pac-Man. Any loyalties to my colleagues are gone. It is me, alone in the maze, with a desperate hunger for fruit and a crippling terror of ghosts.Gameplay comes in the form of short rounds, each a few minutes long. Rests are built in, with water available (and gratefully received).The tabard buzzes constantly, I assume as a result of my many infractions, which include walking into the maze’s walls, colliding with other players and, of course, being eaten by ghosts. Every time it does, I’m unable to score any points for a couple of seconds.‘I ate so many ghosts,’ says my colleague, uttering a sentence that does not make sense anywhere but hereI work out fairly early on that the fruit mostly appears at the centre of the maze. But that is also where the ghosts are, and after a while, I can’t help feeling I am particularly appetising to them. My cavalier, and frankly, reckless, gameplay puts me in constant contact, particularly with the red one.Bob keeps telling us to pace ourselves – in theory it’s walkable but we are sprinting. Time is somehow going both slower and faster. Before we know it, it’s over and the final leaderboard is revealed.“I ate so many ghosts,” says my colleague Hannah Al-Othman, uttering a sentence that does not make sense anywhere but here.I am not ashamed of the sheen over my face. It is the pink, sweaty visage of a Pac-Man champion.Pac-Man Live opens in Manchester on Friday 21 March, with tickets starting from £26 per person.Explore more on these topicsDay tripsGamesManchesterEnglandreviewsShareReuse this content"

I have trees, shrubs, vegetables and flowers, roses, snapdragons and geraniums, which are very easy to grow in our part of the world. At the moment I am mostly pruning, which is convenient because I can do it standing up, only crouching and stooping a little. I consider pruning to be like editing – you decide how you want a shrub to grow. Every house here used to have a garden but now that land is so expensive it is mostly used for more buildings. Gardens are unusual, unfortunately.2.TheatreA Knock on the Roof by Khawla IbraheemView image in fullscreenKhawla Ibraheem in A Knock on the Roof.Photograph: Joan MarcusI saw this at the Traverse theatre inEdinburghlast year. It’s a wonderful one-woman play about a woman living in Gaza and having to respond to the small warning bombs that the Israeli army throw on your roof to let you know that you have five to 15 minutes before they destroy your house. In the play, she practises how to react quickly, what and who to take. It’s very tense and a very good account of life under these terrible conditions. It’s about the earlier war of course, the 2014 war. I think they have stopped this practice – now they just destroy without warning.View image in fullscreen3.ExhibitionPalestine from AboveThis was on at the AM Qattan Foundation in Ramallah and is now at a gallery in Istanbul. The foundation is a philanthropic organisation and it does very good exhibitions. This one investigates the ways in which Palestine has been looked at from above – surveillance, cartography, photography – and puts this in context by showing, alongside those images, pictures, art and interviews by the people living there. Viewing Palestine from the sky has long been part of a colonial war of subjugation, and Palestinians try to escape and counter this through their own works.4.MusicBehind the Symphony with Antonio Pappano: Mahler (Symphony No 1)(Marquee TV)Watch a trailer for Behind the Symphony.I very much like classical music but I have never really appreciated Mahler and always felt as if I was missing out on something. This is a documentary about the life story, history and artistry of three symphonies, one of which is by Mahler. Antonio Pappano does a very good job of describing his Symphony No 1 and I found it enlightening. Before I didn’t really understand what Mahler was trying to do, but when someone guided me through it step by step it was an entirely different experience. It grabbed me. I like Beethoven, Schubert, Bach and now Mahler!View image in fullscreen5.BookDon’t Look Left: A Diary of Genocideby Atef Abu SaifI had been following theGazawar and it got to the point where I couldn’t take any more: news of one massacre after another. I was numb and started withdrawing, but then I picked up this book by the Palestinian Authority minister for culture, who went to Gaza from the West Bank to do an event there. He took his son with him so that they could swim in the sea, then the war started and they were stuck. He wrote this diary, which exactly evokes the feeling of life there under a war against civilians as well as Hamas. If you survive, it is by chance.6.PlaceEdinburghView image in fullscreenA view over Edinburgh old town to Arthur’s Seat.Photograph: GettyThis is a place I have been visiting since 1991 and that has been very kind to me. I come every summer for its culture and music, and to walk in the gardens and parks. Many of my books have been launched here and I have made friends and feel at home. It gives me respite from the rigours of the West Bank. It’s a place where, if you love something, when you come back you find that it is still there, that it hasn’t been destroyed. That’s very comforting for someone who lives in a place that is constantly under attack.Explore more on these topicsCultureOn my radarWest BankGazaMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warGustav MahlerPalestinian territoriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As we travelled through these little-known mountains, the message began to take on a whole other meaning: a call to embrace the unknown, wolves and all.I was on an ambitious journey – from Siena in Tuscany roughly 2,000 miles to the north-west tip of Spain at Finisterre, which literally means “the end of the earth”. I thought that a perfect place to finish. The idea came while working in London as a stable boy and (out of work) actor. Restless and desperate for a sense of purpose, I came across a copy of Don Quixote, Miguel de Cervantes’s 17th-century picaresque adventure. It lit my imagination and a quest began to take shape.View image in fullscreenGrowing up in Scotland, I had gone on treks in the Highlands, and in 2020 I rode the length of the UK for charity.But this trip was on an altogether different scale, and nothing could have prepared me for what lay ahead.After scouring Italy for a horse (it had to cost less than €4,000), I found Sasha at a stud in the Apennines. He was strong, wilful and incapable of going in a circle; ideal for a trek headed west. We set off on a clear spring morning, and the thrill of travelling by horse came alive: an electrifying sense of boundless possibility. Using the ancient Via Francigena trail, we passed Monteriggioni, Montopoli and Lucca. After a week, we reached Ceparana, a town in the foothills of the Ligurian Alps. This marked the end of the smoother contours of Tuscany and the beginning of rock and mountain.We fashioned a route we thought passable by foot and hoof, pinpointing remote villages for possible refuge. The enormity of the challenge became clearIn the months leading up to the trip, I had tracked down two locals who were keen on long-distance horse trekking, Serena and Lara. I told them what I hoped to achieve, and how unprepared I was for the Alps, and they agreed to help me make a plan. They had been wanting to make an officially recognised horse trail into France since childhood – would Sasha and I consider becoming guinea pigs for this route? On behalf of both of us, I agreed.For three days we planned the Alpine crossing in Serena’s house, with the help of local wine and a warm fire. Using a mixture of local tracks and an existing hiking path – theAlta via dei Monti Liguri– we fashioned a route we thought passable by foot and hoof, pinpointing remote villages for possible refuge. The enormity of the challenge became clear to me. Trails neglected due to the pandemic; mudslides; fallen trees; wolves. Most of all, I was concerned about feeding Sasha. Through a combination of local stables and grazing, we’d managed through Tuscany. But it was April (I wanted to reach Spain before the scourge of summer), snow was on the way and there would be nothing for him to eat.View image in fullscreenHow to feed Sasha was a concern in Italy’s Ligurian Alps.Photograph: Kiki HoFortunately, my younger sister, on a break from university, offered to come out to deposit feed at designated points along the route. With a raincoat to cover me and the horse, a tent, a handsaw and the uncharted route, I said goodbye to Serena and Lara, and began the crossing with Sasha – into the mouth of the wolf.We journeyed 70 miles in four days and ascended 4,479 metres. We were now alone with only rivers, gulleys, peaks and dark forests for company. Dependent on each other, a unity quickly formed. On the fourth night, we found my sister at a mountain hostelnear the village of Giaiette, 40 miles east of Genoa. Theserifugioscan be found all over the Ligurian Alps, reachable only on skis, foot and (now) horse.Local people offered what they could of the little they had: food and shelter; hay, wine, water, a stable and sometimes even a bedThe landladylooked out of the window and mentioned wolves. “Are they a danger?” I asked. “Not for you, but they will be for the horse,” came the reply. I decided to camp. With Sasha tied up next to me under the cover of a pine tree, snow fell and I heard boars barking all night. In the morning I found pugmarks in the snow. The wolves had been enjoying a nocturnal game: circling horse and man.In these conditions, riding a horse each day would only get us so far – its back may become sore and feed must be regular – so I decided to continue on foot. Walking alongside, mounting only when needed, would allow us to travel for weeks. I now headed to Cabanne and then on towards Ferrania; 110 miles to cover in four days.Looking lost is the best way to make friends. That and being with a horse. The kindness we received from people all over Liguria was fierce in its candour, raw like the mountains from which they came. They offered what they could of the little they had: food and shelter; hay, wine, water, a stable and sometimes even a bed. Each morning I would say goodbye, and the mouth of the wolf softened.View image in fullscreenLouis crossed the border near La Brigue, France.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyAfter 10 days spent with Sasha, a young woman from the Netherlands joined me with her horse, Istia. She had heard about my journey through a friend and, managing a personal loss, sought an escape – or perhaps a beginning. She found me after Pontinvrea. We forged a bond through our duty to our horses and the dangers of each day. We made it to Nava, a village in a valley. Ahead of us, one day away, was France.The final crossing was bitter. We began at seven in the morning. Ice-rain fell and a rolling mist smothered everything. Surfaces were clotted by mud and snow. After seven hours we crossed the invisible frontier. Soaked to the bone, we descended the mountain to La Brigue at 7.30pm. A hotel, food, wine, beds and showers awaited. The horses slept soundly nearby, in the shelter of a local muleteer.The trek across the Alps took 14 days, 230 miles, and in total we ascended 17,000 metres. With the help of others, Sasha created the first officially recognised horse trail across the Ligurian Alps in modern times. But we still had a long way to go. As a newfound team of two horses and two humans, we continued west.View image in fullscreenLouis and Sasha on the steps of the Arles amphitheatre.Photograph: Kiki HoSoon the weather warmed. We cantered along poppy fields, climbed the steps of Arles’ amphitheatre, travelled with flamingos in the Carmargue, and crossed the Pyrenees. We followed theCamino de Santiago de Compostelaalong the north coast of Spain until there was nowhere else to go but Finisterre. Shimmering in the sun, only the Atlantic lay before us.I walked 1,000 miles alone through Europe – and learned that fear is the price of freedomRead moreIt was hard to let go of the adrenaline. The exhilaration of riding into new places, meeting new people, and cultivating an arcane, silent understanding with a horse; becoming a herd – I couldn’t conceive this ever ending. Finally I had found a sense of peace, with no need to escape. Upon returning to the UK, I began to form theBig Hoof, a charity dedicated to creating adventures for others, reconnecting with the land, and helping individuals realise new possibilities – with Sasha and Istia leading the way.The journey took 111 days in total. Many months have passed since then and recollections blur, but it is the Ligurian mountains that I remember most vividly. They were transformative. The silver mountains, the storms, the echoing isolation, the stalking wolves that pushed us on: we found answers in each other, and through a faith in the unknown way that lay ahead.Louis D Hall is the author of In Green: Two Horses, Two Strangers, a Journey to the End of the Land (Duckworth Books, £18.99).

And avocados? Forget itSat 22 Mar 2025 13.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 22 Mar 2025 15.48 EDTShareAt a party not so long ago, a friend told me that she was about to leave. “I’m hungry,” she said, her eyes sliding towards the coats. “I’m going home for a bowl of Weetabix.” I greeted this with some surprise, if not outright derision. Wouldn’t she prefer a pizza with me? But already she was entering an ecstatic state. “Weetabix islovely,” she went on. “Sugar, cold milk … ” Half a century of eating the stuff had taught her the optimum point at which to devour it, a fleeting moment she could judge by sight. Its biscuit-dryness had to be gone, but it needed to be soft rather than soggy. Her eyes half closed, she wantonly mimed pushing a spoon into this late-night ambrosia.I thought of this the other day, when Alan Titchmarsh, TV gardener and aspirant steamy novelist, informed the nation it should stop eating avocados on the grounds of their environmental impact (to summarise: many of those sold in the UK are grown on land that was formerly rainforest; their cultivation involves huge amounts of water in places where it’s scarce; they must be shipped 5,000 miles or more to reach us). “There’s a lot to be said for cornflakes, Weetabix and Shreddies,” he announced, deploying the homely tartness that made him such a hit onPebble MillandGround Forceto deal with the 21st-century hipster breakfast of choice. Ha! Next time my friend refused a dinner date on the grounds that she would rather commune with a bowl of cereal, I would have no choice but to mention him. Several times. In my best (native) Yorkshire accent.First, eggs benedict mounted a gooey putsch – then things turned fully shakshukaTo be serious, though, there is a circle here – for me, and perhaps for you. Titchmarsh’s edict, a statement to which theTimesdevoted a leader column, plots the story of our lives in breakfasts. Once, after all, it was so simple: cereal, toast and tea came as standard; a full English was a treat if you were away for the weekend. But then, eggs benedict having already mounted its gooey putsch, about a decade ago things turned fully shakshuka. If it sounds spoilt to talk of the tyranny of choice in the context of breakfast, all I can say is don’t you always feel slightly anxious when you utter the words “just toast, please” at a hotel, as if you’re somehow letting down your waiter?In my childhood, breakfast was only ever toast. Cereal was eaten first thing by kids in TV ads, but in our house it was reserved for post-school hunger, to be consumed in the moments between taking off your coat andGrange Hill.Avocados, of course, were highly exotic, even rare: in restaurants, they were the starter that succeeded (after decades) fruit juice or half a grapefruit. Did this exoticism lie behind the sudden craze, in the early 1980s, for avocado bathroom suites? I’ve always wondered about this. But either way, according to memory, they tasted much better then – by which I mean that they tasted ofsomething, even if it was only the olive oil you lugged home from France in the Datsun and a little light social progress.When I was a student, I rarely ate breakfast: if I was up early enough for there to be a wait for lunch, a Mars bar would do it (I was like Prof Tim delay-your-breakfast-for-the-sake-of-your-gut Spectoravant la lettre). In my twenties, I ate bad Danish pastries that were delivered to our desks in the newsroom via a trolley as compensation for the fact that we were indentured. My thirties were the restaurant years, when I spent far too much on what was by now called brunch. My forties, when I was newly and happily married, was the era of devotedly making bacon sandwiches for my beloved (OK, I still do this). And now, here we are, preparing to cancel avocados.Personally, I won’t be bereft; I never got with the programme so far as smashing them goes. Yet still I salute their unlikely journey. In their huge stones, knobbly skins and propensity for causing hand injuries, I see an island nation desperately seeking sophistication. To pinch from TS Eliot, in our beginning is our end. In succession, breakfast dishes rise and fall. We turn back now to our Weetabix gratefully, tasting its particular nothingness afresh.Explore more on these topicsBreakfastRachel Cooke on foodFoodAvocadoscommentShareReuse this content"

Not a drop passes their lips. Those are the consummate athletes. I was a mischievous athlete. You know the little miniature bottles of Drambuie? My roommates would notice at the end of a competition that Lewis would have a little Drambuie. Delicious! But when I won the gold medal [at the 2000 Olympics] I actually had a bottle of bubbly for that. My roomies must have thought it was going to happen, so they had a little bottle for me.My early memoriesare of foodassociated with my heritage and my mum: a lot of big flavours, a lot of curry chicken. One dish I can actually taste in my mouth now is snapper, which is a very popular fish in the Caribbean. Especially on Good Friday – we only had fish, so she would prepare whole snapper in a pan, with onions, peppers, a lot of black pepper and fish seasoning. It was just heaven. Whether you ate it hot or cold, that snapper would just be exquisite.My mum worked two jobs,but we’d stock up at the weekend and she was probably batch-cooking a bit. So up early to the market and on the bus, because my mum didn’t drive. I was part of a team: Mama and I carried the bags – I think that’s where my early weight-training days came into play. We’d go to the big marketplace in Wolverhampton: the butchers, fresh produce, that fresh fish smell. I hated the smell, but looking back, I didn’t realise how blessed we were really.How often do I have a G&T moment? This is not a therapy session. You don’t need to knowIt’s welldocumented:I love an apple crumble. An apple crumble, with cinnamon and custard – mmmm! Just don’t talk to me while I enjoy myself.My boys are 18 and 16,6ft 4in and 6ft 2in. They’re big boys, and you can’t shop enough. They’ll go through half a pack of bacon and four eggs, and that’s just one of them. I’m like, “Have you seen the price of eggs?” So now I keep the really good eggs for myself, but I literally have to squirrel them away. I hide my Burford Browns in the top cupboard. He’ll probably read this now and know where they are. But we have talked about it in jest: let’s get some chickens, because this is the only way we’re going to stave off that insatiable appetite.I had the privilege of being a guest judge on Great British Menu.Oh. My. Goodness. I was so excited. I don’t think they even got the words out before I was like, “Yeah, I’m there.” You think you can cook until you see a professional. It’s all in the sauces, isn’t it? It’s just genius.If I’m cooking,I love a little G&T, prepared well. It’s an occasion, so the cucumbers will go in, lime, a little bit of music. It’s not just flung in the glass. You know everyone’s got their stock of really nice glasses they don’t really use? I bring mine out for the G&T. It’s my moment, my time, the G&T moment. How often are G&T moments? This is not a therapy session. And you don’t need to know. As and when.I knowI look well.But definitely my body has changed. It’s not as lean as it used to be, but that’s OK, because I’m not training for a purpose any more. I’m not trying to be the best athlete in the world.When you retire,there is an element of blowout, because I lived a very routine, meticulous but not obsessive lifestyle: sleep, food, rest, recovery, all part of the big game. And, naturally, you can’t sustain that to the levels you used to do, and I wouldn’t want to. So I’m glad I had that period [after retiring] where I danced with the devil for a bit. I delved into the fun side of food, which is great.My favouritethingsFoodOxtail with rice and peas, the Caribbean dish. It’s just divine and very comforting. And, actually, we talk about the importance of collagen: back in the day, that’s where you’d get your collagen, by sucking that bone dry. So I’d say there’s health benefits.DrinkMy go-to is a cup of herbal tea. It’s the last thing I have at night, no matter where or what time I come in.Place to eatIt’s closed now, but I remember having a really fantastic taster menu at Maze, Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant. That was exquisite.Dish to makeI’ve cooked a lot of salmon, and I’ve got that down pat. Just pan-fried salmon, very easy, but the key with fish is not to overdo it, so it’s still succulent. Some wilted spinach, a little squeeze of lemon at the end and maybe a herb salt. I feel very saintly when I’ve done that.Adaptability: Seven Lessons for Success in a World of Competing Demands by Dame Denise Lewis (Piaktus, £25)is out nowExplore more on these topicsFoodLife on a plateAthleticsCaribbean food and drinkinterviewsShareReuse this content"

I make eggs – soft boiled, scrambled or an omelette – sliced cucumber, toast with butter and a bowl of yoghurt on the side. Whether I eat too depends on how much I ate the previous night – and how late.Last year, I decided I’d skip breakfast altogether. I was reading everywhere about thebenefits of intermittent fasting(IF) and it didn’t feel like a huge sacrifice. Apparently, if I managed to avoid food for 16 hours, half of it spent sleeping anyway, I was more likely to sustain weight loss compared with following any other diet. On top of that, fasting periods are said to allow the body to repair cells and, as a result, help to reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, general inflammation, memory loss, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and other maladies.So much gain for so little pain; it would be silly not to, right? And it did, for a while, give me that satisfying feeling of an empty stomach, a kind of lightness and a sense that I’d instantaneously lost weight, even before I’d shed a single kilogram. Looking in the mirror, my belly seemed flatter.After a few days, I noticed that as soon as the 16-hour fast was up, I was starving. I had to have something, immediately. At 10, I had a handful of nuts and an apple, just to keep me going. It was not enough, so I had more nuts at 11 and then the big meal that I “earned” through fasting at 12.30pm. Unfortunately, my job involves trying food throughout the day, which meant that by 3pm I felt too full to work. All I wanted was to lie down and sleep, for ever. Having a wholesome meal at 6pm, before going on the next fast, was a small torture.I always wanted to shrink my belly and love handles, but it wasn’t an obsession. Now, after trying intermittent fasting, it wasI ended up gaining weight. My belly now looked plumper than when I started. The irony is that before hearing about IF and its benefits, I wasn’t thinking that much about my size. Yes, I always wanted to shrink my belly and its associates, the love handles, but it was far from an obsession. Now, suddenly, it was. In short, intermittent fasting messed with my brain and contributed zilch to my physique.I may be overegging the effect of this fleeting episode, but it serves to make a point. We have all been there. With turmeric and avocado, fermented foods, superfoods, low-fat, just fat, an apple a day, five a day, the Mediterranean diet, keto,paleo, protein. The list goes on and my memory isn’t sharp enough (do I need more oily fish?) to recall half of it. But the impossible length of this list goes to show how ephemeral these dieting diktats are.It seems to me that if we stopped for one second and allowed ourselves to ignore all this noise, and instead follow the well-established routines we grew up with surrounding cooking and eating, we wouldn’t need such “solutions”. Eating regimes foster self-doubt where there is no need for it. They make us overthink our relationship with food instead of just living it. The world of diets is a trap that locks you in by messing with your head.The trouble is that there is much to be said for many of these notions. Who would deny the goodness of vegetables or the benefits of fermented foods for our guts? The idea of taking a break from eating for a good few hours every day also makes sense. That’s what our hunter-gatherer ancestors did and they didn’t suffer from our cardiovascular conditions. The point is, adopting a “regime” comes at a cost, there’s a balance to disrupt.View image in fullscreenStyling: Victoria Twyman. Grooming: Carol Morley at Arlington Talent. Thanks to: littlemousecheese.com and cacklebean.com.Photograph: Jay Brooks/The GuardianAs 21st-century humans, we are always on the lookout for simple ideas that would solve all our problems and eradicate the constant anxiety we suffer. For the past few decades, it seems that nutrition has been the fount of many such simple notions. Mental health, physical health, longevity, wellbeing – everything can be fixed if we sort out our diets.Others have already pointed out that the problem lies with equating food with nutrients. Nutrients alone don’t make you healthy, but food can make you healthy – and you can also be unhealthy even if you eat an incredibly “healthy” diet.TheAmerican thinker Michael Pollanpointed this out with prophetic clarity in the late 00s, when the media, scientists and food manufacturers were colluding in promoting an ideology he describes as “nutritionism”. The term relates to the unexamined acceptance that food is just the sum of its nutrients. Chicken thigh, potato salad, hummus or a cookie are described using terms such as carbohydrate, protein, saturated fat, fibre, vitamin C or amino acids. This way, we can look right through them. We can forget about food and talk about things that are easy to define, prescribe and sell.This is completely wrong.It has been shown, time and again, that our understanding of nutrients is always superficial and partial. For a long time, it was assumed that we can conceive of everything in terms of just three categories: carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Later on, vitamins and the importance of fibre were discovered. This doesn’t even scrape the surface. The deeper we dig, the more we realise how complex our foods are. Pollan lists more than 30 antioxidants in garden thyme alone.We need to reclaim our meals from the field of nutrition and take them back to the realm of human interaction, conviviality and cultureWe have a limited idea about all the elements that make our food and, more importantly, we really don’t understand the myriad intricate ways in which they interact with each other and with our bodies, which are all different and have particular needs.The desire to reduce food to nutrients and then come up with the right set of those as a solution to our daily needs assumes that there isn’t something out there to fulfil those needs. And there is. It is simply food with ingredients that are recognisable and aren’t excessively messed with. I know that the definition ofultra-processed foods, a category that’s much discussed right now, isn’t clearly agreed on yet, but we all know them when we see them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Replacing one “bad” nutrient (fat) with another “good” one (starch) has, most likely, been a major culprit in making us fatter and less healthy.Yet, even if we accept that nutrients tell a very partial story and that we should probably be talking about a potato, and not about carbohydrates and fibre in isolation, we need to understand that the food we eat, the meals we enjoy, are all part of our very particular cultures, culinary traditions and circumstances.You would be surprised to hear that even the Mediterranean diet riles me. I don’t dispute that fruit, vegetables, nuts and olive oil are great choices. I eat them all the time and my desert island food is, probably, a Greek salad – tomato juices, olive oil, vinegar, bits of onion – mopped up with fresh bread. The trouble with the Mediterranean diet is that most of us don’t live in Crete, and we don’t necessarily have access to all the fresh ingredients that are cultivated there.The idea that we can transform our diet in a radical way to make things simple – nutrients, Mediterranean, healthy, happy, satisfied – is an illusion. There aren’t simple solutions.We know best what we need to eat – and when. The food our parents cooked us, the meals we made together, the things that come naturallyWhat we eat and when needs to be removed from most conversations about health. We need to reclaim our meals from the field of nutrition and take them back to the realm of human interaction, of conviviality, culture and the daily activities that define us as humans. As I said, we don’t need food solutions, we have them! They are called meals and recipes; they are called a birthday cake.The breakfast that I was so willing to give up in favour of intermittent fasting has proved itself for millennia as an effective way to sustain us and to mark the beginning of the day with a social gathering. If I forgo breakfast, what do I replace it with? Isn’t it just like the fat in the yoghurt? Give it up at your peril.The solution to the bogus question of what to feed ourselves is in front of our eyes. It comes in the form of roast chicken with roasted potatoes. It’s joyful, intuitive cooking: beans on toast, a cheesy omelette, dal with rice, a quick salad or a slow stew. We all know these things. We don’t need to break them down into nutrients or question their credentials.We know best what we need to eat – and when. The food our parents cooked for us, the meals we made together, the things that come naturally, instinctively, as we walk into the kitchen. That’s what we should be cooking and eating. If we slow down, spend time gathering real ingredients and paying attention as we cook them, we’re already there.Cook for yourself, cook for others, invite them over, give them a bowl of soup. The rest will follow.Explore more on these topicsFoodDiets and dietingNutritionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I love how the florets take on flavour and fat. I enjoy how the personality of the cauliflower pops out when you roast the bejesus out of it to reveal a caramel-like bitter sweetness. And I am a fan of how cheap and comforting it is. This recipe is a celebration of the roast cauliflower and, since the oven is on anyway, I’ve made a baked rice to go with it (credit toYotam Ottolenghifor the technique) that is herby, nutty, hot with harissa and brought together with a thwack of lemon juice.Roast cauliflower with harissa pilafThe baked rice needs a tight foil lid for the steam to cook it, so don’t skimp on the time it takes to seal it properly.Prep15 minCook50 minServes4For the cauliflower2 red onions, peeled and finely sliced1 cauliflower(1.1kg), trimmed and cut into 4cm florets6 tbsp sunflower oil– I likeMr Organic2½ tsp ground cumin2½ tsp ground kashmiri chilli2 tsp turmeric2 tsp fine sea saltFor the rice350g basmati rice, unwashed4 tbsp sunflower oil4 tbsp rose harissa paste2cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated1½ tsp fine sea salt1 lemon, juiced, to get 3 tbsp20g mint, leaves picked and finely chopped20g coriander, leaves and tender stems finely chopped60g roasted cashews, finely choppedHeat the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9.

Although there are some companies, usually smaller operations, that make non-dairy cheese out of fermented nuts or soya beans, more often than not it’s manufactured by big companies who are adept at recreating flavours, but who use ultra-processed ingredients such as emulsifiers, stabilisers and additives to get there.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

For a food writer, that makes it tricky to use and make sure there’s consistency in the journey between my kitchen and yours.So here is my chance to dig a little deeper. In testing these cheeses, I’ve led with flavour first, looking for anything on the spectrum between buttery, sweet and mild to full-blown extra-sharp, tangy and pungent. Following closely behind, the texture has to be right, too, because so much about eating cheese is about mouthfeel and that satisfying, creamy fattiness. Finally, credentials: my vote will always be in favour of products made with natural ingredients, because, ultimately, I believe that’s where the best food comes from.The best vegan cheeseBest all-rounderLa Fauxmagerie Shoreditch smokedView image in fullscreen£4.50 for 100g at Waitrose★★★★★Absolutely delicious, and with the same instant gratification as dairy cheese – and I know because I can’t stop nibbling it. It melts beautifully in the mouth, has a potent, cheesy flavour akin to a medium mature cheddar and it comes in a pleasing wedge that can be cut or spread. Boasts a recognisable ingredients list, too.Best bargainCathedral City plant based matureView image in fullscreen£3.60 for 280g at Tesco£3.60 for 280g at Asda★★★★☆Great, sharp, pungent, mature cheddar flavour. Melts well into a creamy texture in the mouth. Faint powderiness that I can forgive because it hits the flavour and mouthfeel on the nail. Yes, it’s highly processed, but it is also a tasty, plant-based cheese. A solid block that could be used any which way.Best splurgeKinda Co FarmhouseView image in fullscreen£6.50 for 120g at Kinda Co£6.95 for 120g at Abel & Cole★★★★☆A very soft, organic cashew nut- and miso-based cheese. It almost melts in the fingers and then does so in the mouth. Very sharp, almost lemony at first, then gives way to a flavour that’s more “pungent miso” than cheddar. That said, it has umami in spades, the mouthfeel is spot on and it has the purest ingredients list of all these “cheeses”. With its spreadable texture, would be best between two slices or melted through pasta.And the rest …C’é Dairy? MaturedView image in fullscreen£6.99 for 120g at I Am Nut OK★★★☆☆Very soft, and hard to extract from the packaging without smooshing it. Tastes like a fermented, very sharp, savoury, cheddary … cashew paste, which is exactly what it is. Has the fewest ingredients and could be an option for those looking for purity and good flavour, and are happy to sacrifice texture. Best spread on toast.Bute Island Sheese cheddar flavour blockView image in fullscreen£2 for 200g at Ocado£2.49 for 200g at Alternative Stores★★★☆☆Mild, gently tangy and impressively cheesy at first, with a good, creamy texture, too. Actually, perhaps the flavour is too mild because it gives way to a faint but detectable starchy finish. It comes in a block and cuts better than it crumbles, but is comprised of lots of processed ingredients.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Tastes somewhere between cold unsalted butter and the mild, sweet wrapped sliced cheese that I ate (and enjoyed) in the 1980s. The mouthfeel starts at polypropylene and transforms to cream. I ate one and didn’t hate it, but I didn’t feel particularly well afterwards, either.Tesco Free From coconut oil mature cheddar alternativeView image in fullscreen£2.60 for 200g at Tesco★★☆☆☆Tastes like ground powdered rice held together by fat. On checking the ingredients, it turns out I’m wrong about the rice – it is actually four different types of starch held together by water, coconut oil, a regulator and a phosphate. On the plus side, it has a nice, smooth and solid texture that not every plant-based cheddar can boast.Nurishh cheddar flavour plant-based slicesView image in fullscreen£1.75 for 120g at Sainsbury’s★★☆☆☆Comes in slices andtastes like the mild, buttery and plasticky love child of a Baby Bel and a Laughing Cow triangle, which is weird but apt, seeing as it’s produced by the same company that makes both those cheeses.Applewood vegan blockView image in fullscreen£2.30 for 200g at Asda£2.45 for 200g at Waitrose★☆☆☆☆Tastes of nothing until masticated vigorously. The texture is a touch rubbery and a touch powdery, and the flavour eventually makes an entrance as a not-unpleasant salty smokiness. Excellent firmness to the knife.Violife CheddartonView image in fullscreen£2.75 for 200g at Ocado£2 for 200g at Asda★☆☆☆☆Tangy and salty, but not in any discernible cheese- or cheddar-like way, plus it disintegrates into a disgusting powder in my mouth.Explore more on these topicsVegan food and drinkThe FilterCheeseFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As part of my ongoing mission to use up every part of any vegetable, I dehydrated some celeriac leaves to use as a garnish for a savoury cheese and mushroom porridge (see next week’s column), and was astounded by their rich, umami flavour. It was then that I realised they could be ground with sea salt to make that old kitchen staple, celery salt. Celery salt can be used to replace regular table salt and as a flavour enhancer for just about any savoury dish, from soup to salad; it’s also delicious as a seasoning for meat or fish and, of course, makes a sublimely savoury bloody mary.Homemade celery saltCelery leaves are a common byproduct from a bunch of celery, and other uses for them are simply to add some flavour to all manner of stocks, soups, stews and salads. They can also be preserved by dehydrating them to make the umami-rich seasoning that is celery salt.Celery is a natural source of sodium nitrate, which, like salt, is a natural preservative. Traditionally, celery salt was used as a preservative for meat and/or pickles, not least because it adds flavour – that’s why a steak seasoned with celery salt, for example, is notably delicious.Leaves from 1 bunch celerySea saltPick all the leaves off a bunch of celery – the light-coloured ones at the core as well as the darker, outer leaves. Next, dry the leaves in the oven. To save on energy, I often roast them alongside something else that I’m already cooking, or I’ll use the residual heat after I’ve used the oven. The leaves will take about eight minutes to dry in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven, though they may take a little longer if you go down the residual heat route (depending on the original oven temperature, of course). Once the leaves are completely dry and crisp, but not browned, take them out and leave to cool.Either grind the cooled dried leaves to a rough powder with your hands or finely chop with a knife, then stir into a jar of sea salt, but add only just enough salt to make sure it still has lots of celery flavour. Aim for aboutone part dried celery leaf powder to three parts sea salt, or a tablespoon for every three tablespoons of salt. Your celery salt will now keep indefinitely in a sealed jar.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesWaste notFoodFood wastePickling, fermenting and preservingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You can easily swap them with chickpeas or other legumes. Look online for a quick guide on how to spatchcock a chicken. It really is very simple and it makes the chicken cook evenly. All you need is a pair of heavy-duty scissors or standard garden secateurs.Prep15 minCook1hr 10 minServes4-61 whole chicken (2.3–2.5kg),spatchcocked8 garlic cloves, crushed1 tsp ground turmeric150ml olive oilFine sea salt and black pepper2 x 700g jarsbutter beans, drained20g oregano150g round shallots, peeled and cut in half1 cinnamon stick1 lemon, cut in halfPreheat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.Place the chicken in a large, high-sided tray (about 30cm x 38cm). Mix the garlic, turmeric and olive oil in a bowl with two teaspoons of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Rub three-quarters of this mixture all over the chicken and under the skin. Scatter the beans, oregano and shallots around the chicken and nestle the cinnamon among them.Add the remainder of the garlic, turmeric and oil mixture to 100ml water and pour over the beans and shallots, mixing well. Generously crack over some black pepper and add the lemon halves to the tray.Place in the oven and roast for one hour, until the beans have burst and are crispy in places.
