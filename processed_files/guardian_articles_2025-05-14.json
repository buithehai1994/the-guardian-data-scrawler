And with this film’s anti-AI and internet-sceptic message, and the gobsmacking final aerial set piece, Cruise is repeating his demand for theechtbig-screen experience. He is of course doing his own superhuman stunts – for the same reason, as he himself once memorably put it, that Gene Kelly did all his own dancing.Final Reckoning is a new and ultimate challenge (actually the second half of the challenge from the previous film) which takes Cruise’s buff and resourceful IMF leader Ethan Hunt on one last maverick, deniable mission to exasperate and yet overawe his stuffed-shirt superiors at Washington and Langley. And what might that be? To save the world of course, like all the other missions.With his doughty team including Grace (Hayley Atwell), Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), Hunt must now confront a sinister and metastasising AI brain called “the Entity”, the ultimate MacGuffin-slash-baddie which is undermining truth all over the world with lies and deepfakes, setting nation against nation, nuclear power against nuclear power, so that it will be the anti-God, the evil ruler of all. And to stop it, Ethan has to take the low-tech “cruciform key” he salvaged in the last film and apply it to the “Podkova” device which is on board a wrecked Russian sub, the Sevastopol somewhere on the seabed. (Wait - should they actually have called in James Cameron in some sort of nifty submersible?) The combination of the two will be a “poison pill” which will destroy the Entity.View image in fullscreenSimon Pegg, left, and Tom Cruise Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning.Photograph: Paramount Pictures and Skydance/APIt is a wildly silly, wildly entertaining adventure which periodically gives us a greatest-hits flashback montage of the other seven films in the M:I canon - but we still get a brand new, box-fresh Tom-sprinting-along-the-street scene, without which it wouldn’t be M:I. Moreover, this eighth film gives us a terrific new character, US sub commander Capt Bledsoe, played with suavity and the tiniest hint of camp by Tramell Tillman (from TV’s Severance) who has the chops for M:I9 whenever that happens.And just as it wouldn’t be M:I without a sprinting scene, it wouldn’t be M:I without Tom hanging on for dear life at some unfeasible altitude; here he gets to cling to the wing of an old-fashioned prop plane in the blue Empyrean.

That is what Cruise has done: forever young, forever fit, never saying die in the face of this preposterous Armageddon clock. What a rush!Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning screened at theCannes film festival, and is out in Australia on 17 May, the UK on 21 May, and the US on 23 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalTom CruiseAction and adventure filmsThrillersHayley AtwellSimon PeggreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what you need to know.Hasn’t Romania already had a presidential election?Yes. The original vote last year was annulled and its shock far-right winner disbarred amid widespread concerns over Russian interference and other irregularities. So the vote on Sunday is the second round of the second presidential election in six months.This time an ultranationalist, EU-critical Trump admirer is in a run-off against a centrist independent in a vote that analysts have called the most important in the country’s post-communist history.George Simion, 38, who sports Maga caps, promotes a socially conservative agenda and wants the “Melonisation” of Europe and to halt military aid to Ukraine,won the first round comfortablywith 41% of the vote, nearly double the score of his rival.The second-placed Nicușor Dan, the 55-year-old mayor of Bucharest, has cast the runoff as a fight between “a pro-western and an anti-western direction for Romania”. Polls show the gap between the two narrowing, with one putting them neck and neck.Riding a wave of voter frustration with Romania’s mainstream parties, Simion has promised, if he wins, to appoint as prime minister Călin Georgescu, thewinnerof last November’s cancelled vote.Romanian presidential electionsThe first-round defeat of the ruling Social Democrat-Liberal coalition’s candidate triggered the resignation of the pro-European prime minister, Marcel Ciolacu, and the de facto collapse of the government. A new coalition must now be formed.Analysts have said a Simion victory could lead to the country swinging sharply to the right. A confidence-and-supply deal between Simion’s AUR party, the second largest in parliament, and Coalacu’s Social Democrats is seen as a post-vote possibility, as are snap elections.The ballot is being closely watched by the EU, which could do without another disruptor in the region alongside Hungary and Slovakia. Also interested are nationalists – including in Washington – who accused Bucharest of trampling on democracy after the original vote was cancelled and Georgescu barred from standing in the rerun.Romania’s president has a semi-executive role with considerable powers over foreign policy, national security, defence spending and judicial appointments. They also represent the country, a Nato member, on the international stage and can veto important EU votes.Sounds pretty high-stakes. How about in Poland?Also high-stakes, certainly, at least, for Donald Tusk’s government. Sunday’s vote will narrow down the list of contenders to be the country’s next president, a role that carries some influence over foreign and defence policy, as well as robust powers to veto legislation passed by parliament.Since 2023, the country has been governed by Tusk’s Civic Coalition, an ideologically diverse and politically fragile alliance of pro-democratic parties.Its central promise has been to reverse the controversial and expansive changes pursued during the eight years of rule by the national-populist Law and Justice (PiS) party.But the government’s ability to deliver on these promises remained hampered by the veto power vested in the president, a position held since 2015 by Andrzej Duda, a close political ally of the ousted administration and a firm supporter of Donald Trump.Winning the presidential race would consolidate the government’s position and could help it fulfil some of its liberal promises on social issues such as abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.Poland opinion pollHaving consistently led the polls, Rafał Trzaskowski, the 53-year-old centrist mayor of Warsaw and a senior member of the Civic Coalition, is the candidate to beat.His main rival is a 42-year-old conservative, Karol Nawrocki, who is formally independent but endorsed by PiS. The previously little-known historian hopes to offer a fresh face and a break with the populist-right government’s polarising legacy while sticking to its core messages on sovereignty, illegal migration and frustration with green policies.Trzaskowski and Nawrocki are almost certain to win the top two positions and go through to a runoff on 1 June.Sławomir Mentzen, 38, a leader of the far-right Confederation party, is the outside candidate, who briefly challenged Nawrocki for second place but has faded over the past month.Presenting himself as a spokesperson for a younger generation disenchanted with mainstream politics, he campaigns on a ticket of radical deregulation and tax cuts. An outspoken critic of the EU and opponent of liberalising migration, LGBTQ rightsand abortion laws, he is believed to be positioning himself for the 2027 parliamentary elections.What about in Portugal?This one is expected to bring fewer fireworks. Portugal is heading to the polls for its third snap general election in three years. The centre-right prime minister, Luís Montenegro, triggered Sunday’s vote in response to growing questions over his family’s business activities.Montenegro, the leader of the Democratic Alliance (AD) platform that has governed Portugal since itsnarrow victory in last year’s election, has come under growing scrutiny relating to a data protection consultancy that he founded in 2021 and which he transferred to his wife and sons the following year.Faced with questions over possible conflicts of interest, Montenegro – who has denied any wrongdoing or ethical breaches – staged a confidence vote in his administration in March, saying he wanted“to end the atmosphere of permanent insinuations and intrigues”. But he lost the vote and a fresh election was called.Portugal opinion pollRecent polls suggest a similar result to last time, putting the AD on about 33%, the opposition Socialist party (PS) on 26% and the far-right Chega party on 17%.Montenegro appears likely to once again fall short of a majority – even if he strikes a deal with the small Liberal Initiative party, which is polling at about 6% – and will struggle to govern, especially if the PS makes good on its threats to oppose his legislative agenda.Although Montenegro has maintained his blanket ban on any deals with Chega, his government has been accused of pandering to the far right after it announced the expulsion of 18,000 irregular migrants during the election campaign. There has also been speculation that Montenegro’s own Social Democratic party could replace him with someone more amenable to working with Chega should he fail to deliver on Sunday.Last time round, the AD won 80 seats to the PS’s 78, while Chega, which isled by the former TV football pundit André Ventura, enjoyed a surge in support and increased its seat count from 12 to 50.Explore more on these topicsEuropeRomaniaPolandPortugalEuropean UnionexplainersShareReuse this content"

At Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions we were spared the spectacle of Keir Starmer andKemi Badenochcompeting over who could sound tougher on foreigners. That would have been a squalid death match.But both leaders appeared to have sated their blood lust for the time being. Keir lost in a half world where his policies were a lot less unpleasant than his language. Kemi just lost. All she knows is that her rock bottom is a lot lower than the government. Not that anyone’s planning to give her the chance.Maybe it’s the weather. A sense of it being too nice to be bothered. Or maybe it’s battle fatigue. It’s just too hard to keep on caring when every day is a new shitshow. Or maybe it’s that Keir has finally given up on Kemi. Has stopped treating her and the Tories as serious opposition.He’s done his best to engage with Kemi over the past six months but has now come to the same conclusion as many of the Tory leader’s own MPs: that enough is enough and she won’t be around on the shadow frontbench for much longer. That she’s achieved the status of little more than irritation. And who could blame Starmer? KemiKaze isn’t stupid. She too can read the room. She also knows that she is the real experiment that has failed.It’s been a rough few days for both leaders. For Keir, because he’s been getting it in the neck from all sides. From the left for channelling his inner Nige and from the right for being inauthentic. A fake Farage pub bore. His hatred for immigrants does not run nearly deep enough. For Kemi because … Just because. Every day is a bad day for her. She hasn’t had a good one so far this year. The only thing keeping her going is her denial. That and a misplaced sense of pride.There were few cheers from the backbenches for either leader as they took their seats just before midday. The chronicle of several deaths foretold. Both Keir and Kemi are running low on political capital with their own MPs.Labour are longing for Starmer to give them a direction. A feelgood mission. Too often he just looks as if his only purpose was to achieve power and he has no idea of what he wants to do with it. The Tories have reached the point where they only dare share their deepest fears with their therapists. Given the choice, most would quite like to book themselves into the Priory for a couple of months, only their shrinks worry about the effect they might have on the other patients.You can tell Kemi has had enough. It’s in her smile. The resigned expression of the condemned. All the dice have been rolled and she’s now completely out of chances. She’s done her best and still been found wanting. She was the wrong person at the wrong time. Any leader would have failed with the current Tory party. She has just failed spectacularly. Her one saving grace is that, increasingly, no one is paying her much attention. All eyes are on Reform. That’s where the real opposition lies.Preparation has never been Kemi’s strong point. She prefers to lead by vibes. Not many people’s preferred modus operandi, but KemiKaze will be KemiKaze. It didn’t end well. Even on a low-key day whenPMQsfelt more meta than usual – politics for performance’s sake – she crashed and burned.This time it felt terminal. Because not even her own MPs could bring themselves to care that much. They – along with Starmer – are looking ever further right.It wasn’t even that Kemi’s line of questioning was misguided. The cost of living crisis is a legitimate line of concern. More that her research had all been done on X. So it was almost entirely wrong.She began by insisting unemployment had gone up by 10%. No one knew where she had got this figure from. Least of all her. Though it was entirely false. Keir replied with his own dreamland. The country had never had it so good. Everything was just tickety-boo. He seemed to have forgotten that on Monday he had been talking of acountry broken and ruined by immigrants.This only inspired KemiKaze to greater insanity. Actually, now she came to think about it, the country had been an economic and cultural nirvana when the Tories had been in power. One day she may work out just why the voters thought otherwise.Moving on, she went on to trash the trade deals with India and the US and the one that is being done with the EU. Starmer had to point out that he had saved the jobs of workers in Solihull, Scunthorpe and Scotland.In the end, Keir appeared to just lose it. It wasn’t worth taking time out of his Wednesday schedule to answer six pointless questions from a time-limited leader of a time-limited party. The Tories, he said, were heading for oblivion. A dead party walking. A deeply unserious party. There aren’t many who would disagree.Not least Farage, who used his question to compliment Starmer for coming round to his way of thinking on immigration. He had enjoyed Monday’s speech. But could he just conflate the illegal immigration figures with the legal to further muddy the waters? For Nige, everyone in a small boat is a potential terrorist. Keir didn’t exactly thank Farage for his contribution. Though he has learned to treat him with courtesy. The real leader of the opposition.Courtesy was in short supply when Liz Saville Roberts, the group leader of Plaid Cymru, took the prime minister to task for his language on immigration and asked if there was any belief that Starmer held on to for more than a week. “Yes,” said Keir. “My belief that everything you say is rubbish.” It was a funny putdown. But one that came with edge. Unnecessarily rude. There was no need for that.Liz shrugged it off with better grace than Starmer deserved. She knew she had got under his skin. Had highlighted an inconvenient truth. That the prime minister’s beliefs were only skin deep. That, after nearly a year in power, we were still waiting to find out what Labour did believe in.Explore more on these topicsPMQsThe politics sketchKeir StarmerKemi BadenochLabourConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s what happenedOnline dating advice: five ways to stay safe, according to the expertsOlivia PetterWed 14 May 2025 10.04 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 10.07 EDTShareIf you want to make a single person angry, ask them about dating apps. Chances are they’ve tried using them at least once – just under 5 million adults in the UK visited an online dating service in May 2024, according to Ofcom’sOnline Nation report– and will have a diatribe ready to go.They might lament how the apps have gamified dating, turning us all intoCharlie Brooker-engineered ciphersplaying aimlessly with one another until we get bored. Perhaps they’ll carp on about how vacuous it all feels, making snap judgments about whether or not someone is a potential life partner depending on their “typical Sunday afternoon”. Or they’ll complain about how the apps have plagued the dating landscape with callous cruelty, giving us myriad new methods to hurt one another. There’s no shortage of complaints.And yet, despite adip in popularity, dating apps are still helping plenty of people fall in love at first swipe: roughly 10% of US adults who are in a relationship say they met their long-term partner online,according to the Pew Research Center.I’ve been single for three years, so I was happy to put six of the best apps around to the test. After two months of using them all, and trying to keep an open mind about who I might meet and what could happen, I found out which dating apps are best for every type of dater, whether you’re looking for lasting love or a summer fling.At a glanceBest dating app overall:HingeBest for casual dating:TinderBest for inclusivity:FeeldBest for relationships:BumbleBest for beginners:BreezeBestfor older daters:HappnWhy you should trust meI’m a journalist, broadcaster and author with a decade of experience covering dating and relationships. I hosted the chart-topping podcast Millennial Love (later renamed Love Lives) for six years and published anonfiction bookof the same name in 2021, which examined the contemporary dating landscape through a feminist lens. I’ve created content around dating for BBC Three, Benefit and Student Beans, as well as hosting panels for Netflix, Cheltenham literature festival and Women of the World. I wrote a sex column for Soho House and am also a regular on the radio, having spoken about dating on BBC Woman’s Hour, LBC and BBC Radio London. Relationships were a key theme in my debut novel,Gold Rush, which was published last summer.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘Using six apps at once is not for the faint-hearted.’Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianI downloaded six dating apps and actively used them for two months. My choices included three of the most commonly used apps across the globe – Hinge, Tinder and Bumble – as well as three outliers that are becoming popular: Feeld, Breeze and Happn. For fairness, I discounted apps that were tailored to particular niches, such asKippo(for gamers),Bristlr(for people who like beards) andGlutenFree Date(I love bread), as well as any designed for specific sexualities, religious groups or age ranges. These are worth exploring, but as a straight, agnostic, 30-year-old cisgender woman, I’m not best placed to do that.All the apps were free, but I also tested a paid-for upgrade on each one to see if it was worth the money. I opted for the second cheapest where it was available (some apps have only one paid-for option while others have several tiers) because, in most cases, the cheapest upgrades offered fairly few features compared with the free versions, and I wanted to see how much my experience could change as a paid user.My profiles were different on each of the apps and featured different photos. On Hinge, I went for sun-kissed holiday snaps. Bumble was similar, with the addition of selfies with my cat. On Feeld, I chose mostly festival pics: Glastonbury, Wilderness and All Points East. Breeze was the same. And by the time I got to Happn, it was a selection of recent Instagram snaps (mostly because, at this point, I was tired of trawling through photos of myself). On each of them, where possible, I stated my star sign (Gemini) and that I was looking for a long-term relationship.Using six apps at once is not for the faint-hearted, not least because it makes it quite hard to take any of it seriously, let alone keep up with the admin. In some ways, the process is not unlike applying for a job or looking for somewhere to live. I’d suggest picking one app based on the features that appeal the most, and what you’re looking for, as some apps are better for hook-ups while others are best suited to relationships.That said, it always boils down to the individual. People defy the odds, stats and trends all the time. It’s best to take the whole dating app experience with a hefty pinch of salt and humour. My advice is to try to have fun while being open, intentional and honest.The best dating apps in 2025View image in fullscreenOur writer checks her matches at Brickwood Coffee & Bread, Clapham.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianBest dating app overall:HingeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Imago/AlamyPrice:freePaid subscription options:Hinge+ £14.99/week: unlimited likes, view all incoming likes at once and advanced filtering preferences.HingeX £24.99/week: all of the above plus enhanced recommendations, priority likes, and “skip the line”, which means your profile is always boosted to other users.Of all the dating apps I’ve included, Hinge is the one used by most people I know. Disclaimer: I’ve used this app before but had recently deleted it in a PMS-induced rage. So I redownloaded with fresh eyes. Creating a profile is straightforward: six photos or videos, three “prompts”, and basic info such as age, height and location, which is always visible. You have the option to add your education level, job, star sign, family plans, Covid vaccine status and vices, including drinking and drugs. Hinge allows you to answer all of these without showing them on your profile, but still tailoring your algorithm accordingly. The prompts (“my simple pleasures”, “change my mind about”) can also be answered via voice note. You can add what you’re looking for in a relationship, too.You can send a message alongside a like (tapping, not swiping) by responding to a photo or prompt, as well as undoing your decision to say no to someone, features that most apps reserve for paid users. This is a good thing if, like me, you’re someone who can swipe through dating apps somewhat mindlessly, like online shopping. You can also see who has liked you. Your likes, however, are limited; free users can send only eight a day. Users are given one “rose”, AKA a superlike, to distribute for free each week to help get the people you’ve liked to notice you. Messages are limited, too: you can’t match with new people when you have eight or more unanswered messages in your inbox. This forces you to actually talk to your matches instead of using the app as a potential dopamine booster.View image in fullscreenHinge works out your type pretty quickly: within a week, I’m being served exclusively tall, bearded film-makers. Chats turned to dates quite quickly; most men asked for my number (or Instagram) within the first few messages. They’re generally polite and flirty. If we’ve been consistently chatting for a day or two, they ask to meet. I say yes to a handful. One never replies to my WhatsApp about what time to meet after we’d already set the date. Another looks different from his photos and is also completely uninterested in me; we say our goodbyes after two drinks. A third is excellent. We date consistently for a few weeks until he moves to another city and reveals he isn’t ready for a relationship. I’m not sure I can blame that on Hinge.When I pay for HingeX, the second-cheapest upgrade at £24.99 a week, I am able to refine my searches, be recommended to matches sooner and enjoy enhanced recommendations based on what the app identifies as my type.I fancy everyone. I whittle my search results to the nth degree so that I’m only looking at men who want a long-term relationship, are open to having children and stand at least 6’0, which elicits guilt, shame, and shallowness. These feelings pass faster than I’m willing to admit publicly. Aside from this, the experience isn’t all that different. I don’t receive more matches or likes than usual (despite my likes being “prioritised”), and in all honesty, the excessive search filters make me feel less like I’m looking for love and more like I’m shopping for a dress.Number of users globally:about 23 millionAge range:three-quarters (73%) of users are 18-34, according toOfcom datafrom 2024Is the paid-for upgrade worth it?Yes, if you’re extraordinarily pickyInclusivity: three genders, nine gender identities, and 22 sexualitiesNumber of ghosts:oneNumber of dates:five and a several-weeks-long situationshipNumber of emotionally unavailable men that sent me back into therapy:oneBest for casual dating:TinderView image in fullscreenPrice:freePaid subscription options:Tinder+ from £9.99/week gets you unlimited likes, unlimited rewinds, Passport to any location, hide ads, go incognito.TinderGold from £14.99/week gets you the above plus two free Super Likes a week, one free Boost a month, see who likes you, and new top picks every day (browse through a daily curated selection of profiles).Tinder Platinum from £19.99/week gets you all of the above plus prioritised likes, one free boost a month and three first impressions a week (you can send a message before matching).The most popular dating app in the UK, according to Ofcom’sdatafrom 2024, Tinder is generally considered the behemoth of the industry. It’s owned by the same company as Hinge: Match Group, which also owns Plenty of Fish, OkCupid and Stir. No longer a simple swipe-to-snog app, as it once was, today, Tinder has all sorts of bells and whistles. You can add up to nine photos or videos to your profile, three prompts (“a surprising thing about me is …”, “my hidden talent”) and a 500-word story of your life in a dedicated “About Me” section.You can include up to 10 interests, with everything from “Disney” to “Britpop” on the table. The usuals (height, star sign, relationship goals) are all there alongside some niche additions, including “personality type” and “love style”, referring to Myers & Briggs test results and love languages, respectively. There are also sections for dietary habits, social media activity and how much you sleep. On top of all that, you can answer quizzes about how you spend weekends and what you like to do on nights out.It’s a lot. Not to mention far more time-consuming than some of the other profile setup processes. Using the app itself requires a similar degree of dedication. Yes, you can swipe. But you can also filter your searches – a service most apps reserve for paid users – using categories such as “long-term partner”, “short-term fun”, and “free tonight”. It’s useful. But perhaps less so when the categories get increasingly niche: is swiping through fellow “self-care” proponents or “pet parents” really going to help me find lasting love?View image in fullscreenUsing the app feels like playing a game: the interface is full of cartoonish graphics and fluorescent colours. Swipe left and you elicit the words “NOPE” in pink. Whereas you get a giant yellow “LIKE” for a right swipe. The free version doesn’t allow you to backtrack on swipes, meaning you have to be a little more careful, nor does it let you see who has liked you.The men I speak to are friendly, attractive and polite. But in all honesty, I don’t fancy any of them enough to go on a date. And my conversations mostly run dry. One 38-year-old man who works in tech speaks to me exclusively in platitudes that sound as if they’ve been ripped from ChatGPT: “I’m looking for having fun and doing activities together right now.” Another immediately tries to lure me to WhatsApp so he can send photos of his recent hike (I decline) – generally, dating apps don’t let you send images on their platforms. And a lot of them ghost me after just a few messages.Tinder Gold, which costs from £14.99 a week and allows you to see who likes you, boost your profile once a month so that more users see you, and gives you curated profiles based on your previous likes, is overwhelming. After boosting myself for 30 minutes, I suddenly have more than 2,000 likes awaiting my response. I can filter these down by age, location, and whether they like film and travel, which I promptly do purely because I can. This efficiently reduces my search results, but sadly, I don’t fancy anyone. I send a few super likes, which feels a little like poking someone on Facebook, and browse through my daily “top picks” of profiles the app thinks I will like. This includes a very attractive 32-year-old athlete, but he’s looking for something short-term. Though his bio says long-term is “OK”. I know better than to swipe right on this one.Number of users globally:about 47 million monthlyInclusivity: 22 gender identities and more than 10 sexual orientationsIs the paid-for upgrade worth it?No. If anything, it made the dating experience feel too stimulatingNumber of ghosts:sevenNumber of dates:zilchNumber of potential ChatGPT husbands:oneAge range:more than half (almost 60%) of users are 18-30Best for inclusivity:FeeldView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Koshiro K/AlamyPrice:freePaid subscription options:You can get most of what you want from the app on its free version, but a Majestic Membership is available for £17.99 a month. Benefits include: unlimited likes, one free Ping + Note a day to help other users notice you, seeing who likes you, filter by desires, go incognito (hide your profile from Discover but still send likes), last seen, go back, private photos.Launched as an app for threesomes, named 3nder, in 2014, Feeld was founded by Bulgarian-born Dimo Trifonov after he and his partner, Ana Kirova, opened their relationship. Last year, the company reported it had almostdoubled its turnover to £39.5m. Today, it’s a leading sex-positive, kink-friendly app that’s slowly entering the mainstream, much to the chagrin of some of its OGs, who lament that Feeld has become “too vanilla”.Setting up a profile takes no time at all: six photos, a chosen “Feeld name” (most people I come across use one initial), gender, sexuality, and an “About” section you can fill with whatever you want for 1,500 characters. You can also list up to 10 desires as chosen from a selection that ranges from “dates” and “singles” to “bondage” and “being submissive”. You can include 10 interests, too, though this section is left open-ended; most users I see fill this section with sexual interests.I’ve been on this app before – and the first person I saw was a 90-something Frenchman looking for a threesome. I’d advise setting your age range early on. With a straightforward and simply designed interface, Feeld is easy to use. It can be quite an intense experience at first if you’re used to more conventional dating apps. One man asks what I’m interested in, and I naively waffle on about the latest series of Hacks. When I ask the same question, he replies with a paragraph about the societal benefits of oral sex. Another user I come across is simply called “daddy issues”; his “about me” section includes a reference to “eight inches”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

So I’m not sure why I see photos of six vaginas in one man’s profile. A glitch in the sexual matrix, perhaps – Feeld told the Guardian that it uses automated tools to help identify and flag this type of content, and while its detection thresholds are set quite strictly, “unfortunately there is always a margin for error”.People move fast on Feeld: almost everyone I match with strikes up a conversation immediately, which is refreshing. On more than a handful of occasions, they suggest meeting the night we start speaking. This intimidates me, so I decline. Some men unmatch with me immediately for this. The dates I do manage to organise go well and in many cases, aren’t dissimilar from those I’d have from other apps. These are professional, funny and attractive men. I’m certainly not one to kink shame, but some want to talk about sexual proclivities and BDSM dynamics right away, which I find a little jarring. But I don’t have a spark with any of them, so nobody makes it past the first date.On Feeld Majestic, which costs £17.99 a month,you can filter searches according to desire, send unlimited likes and see who likes you.I suddenly have 99+ likes to trawl through. It’s fun to scroll through them all, and I like being able to go incognito – a Majestic-only feature–so that only the people I’ve liked see my profile. Feeld does feel more sex-focused, so the privacy is welcome. The most interesting paid feature, however, is that I can filter people according to their desires. Feeling coy, I choose “dates”, “intimacy”, and “kissing”. In all honesty, I don’t know what a lot of the kinks mean (“being a brat tamer”, anyone?), but regardless, I find plenty of people I fancy. I start talking to one I’m hopeful about, mostly because I’m familiar with all of his kinks. But he chastises me for forgetting I was going to be on holiday the week we agreed to meet: “So when you said next week, you could have said you were going away.” I find this weirdly aggressive and ghost him.Number of users globally:Feeld keeps this data private, but tells the Guardian that membership has grown by more than 50% year on year since 2022.Inclusivity: 20 genders and 20 sexualitiesAge range:Feeld also keeps this data private, but says it’s mostly millennialsIs the paid-forupgrade worth it?Yes, if you’re a very private person with specific kinksNumber of unmatches:fourNumber of dates:threeNumber of unsolicited photos of vaginas:sixBest for relationships:BumbleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Timon Schneider/AlamyPrice:freePaid subscription options:Bumble Boost: £24.99/month for unlimited likes, unlimited backtrack, five “SuperSwipes” each week (your likes are more likely to get noticed), one spotlight a week (be shown ahead of other users for 30mins), unlimited backtrack, unlimited extends (add an extra 24 hours to start chats), unlimited rematch (get a second chance to chat).Bumble Premium: £39.99/month for all of the above, plus see who likes you, advanced filters, incognito mode and travel mode.Bumble Premium+: £69.99/month for all of the above, plus fast-track your likes (be seen sooner by the people you’ve liked), Bumble will boost your profile at the best times every day, photo insights that tell you which photos people like the most, 10 SuperSwipes a week, two spotlights a week, two compliments a week (send a kind note before you match).From its inception in 2014, Bumble’s USP was that women made the first move, a premise that earned it a reputation as being an app for hot, feminist straight men. Last year, the app did a U-turn, allowing women to add prompts to their profiles that men can respond to. For same-sex and non-binary users, either person can initiate the conversation or set and respond to a prompt. Still, if you don’t start a conversation, the match expires after 24 hours. If you’re indecisive, you can extend one match every day. Sadly, you can’t backtrack on the free version. So swipe with caution.The profiles are comprehensive: six photos or videos plus space for five interests and – a unique one – three causes or communities you care about. Options include Black Lives Matter, feminism, trans rights and reproductive rights. You can also choose three qualities you care about in a partner, such as kindness, ambition and sassiness. In addition to the usual basics, you can also write a short bio and share information on your exercise habits, your star sign, your politics and what you’re looking for. For music lovers, you can also connect your account to your Spotify, which might provide some easy talking points.You can swipe through users quickly and easily, or choose from a “recommended for you” section filled with users Bumble chooses based on your profile and past matches. The quality of men seems high to me: plenty of people I fancy and find easy to flirt with. I also like how many of them ask what I’m looking for right away. One man responds to a Giphy I send showing Simon Cowell shrugging his shoulders with “Guess you’re going to need a lot of attention”. He later tells me that 50% of online interactions these days could be with bots and asks how he can know I’m not a bot. I’m unsure how to prove this. Forgive me, Reader: I ghost him.As usual, a few chats peter out, while some move over to WhatsApp where they also eventually peter out. Still, I wind up having two dates with a dog-loving engineer (not my usual type; I’m trying something different), but after our second, the initial spark has fizzled. We say our goodbyes, and neither one of us contacts the other again. I should also mention the man in town from Australia for a few days, who invited me to his hotel mere minutes after we match. By the time I check the conversation again the following day to politely decline, he has deleted his account.I upgrade to Bumble Premium, which costs £39.99 a month and gives you advanced filters, unlimited likes and five SuperSwipes a week, as well as being able to see who likes you. I’m told 627 people have liked me. Where are all these people when I’m out and about, I wonder? I can filter my likes according to their star sign, which thrills me because it’s usually one of the first things I ask men. I choose all my most compatible ones – Aries, Libra, Aquarius – and begin browsing. There are some solid discoveries, including a handsome 34-year-old mountaineer and a downright gorgeous 37-year-old neurologist – I open with a terrible joke about the nervous system (“How are your dating nerves?”) and he doesn’t reply. One perk of Premium that I enjoy is being able to backtrack on old matches that have expired; I do this on a few I regret having missed. But none of them reply to me. You snooze, you lose, I suppose.Number of users globally:about 50 millionInclusivity: 25 genders, nine pronounsIs the paid-for upgrade worth it?No. It takes up too much time to make the most of the featuresNumber of dates:twoNumber of times I was asked to explain ‘sex positivity’ because I’d chosen it as an interest on my profile: oneNumber of hotel invitations:oneBest for beginners:BreezeView image in fullscreenPrice:free until you match with someone, after which you have to buy a date token or package of date tokens that will be used to fund your date. A date typically costs one date token, however, costs may vary depending on the chosen date. If you cancel the date after you’ve scheduled and paid for it, you won’t be refunded. If your date cancels, you can get a refund.Paid subscription options:There is no upgraded paid version of Breeze; you simply pay for the dates.Among the newest apps on the dating scene, Breeze is all about fostering real-life connections with the help of its app. Unlike all the other apps listed here, Breeze doesn’t allow users to actually talk to each other. Instead, every day at 7pm, it shows you a series of profiles. The options are either “not for me” or “go for a drink”; if it’s a match, you each fill in a date planner form, pay for the date, and then Breeze organises your first date for you with one of its partner bars. It’s a unique, if slightly intimidating concept, one I was excited to try. There are two types of dates on offer: drinks at a bar (£9.50) and a walk and talk (£4.75). The price includes Breeze’s service for matching and organising the date, as well as, in the former instance, a deal on your first drink with one of the app’s partner bars.Profiles comprise six photos or videos, up to 10 hobbies and interests, and three questions you can answer, eg “my perfect holiday” and “my core values”. You can also add up to 10 “lifestyle” tags, including traits (“passionate, chaotic”) and your star sign. As usual, in addition to the basics, you can also put your drinking and smoking habits alongside your family plans and what you’re looking for from dating.It’s easy to use; you can also add a filter for height, which is unusual. I’m only ever shown nine profiles at a time, so I whiz through them rather fast. It lacks the usual dopamine rush I’ve come to expect from dating apps, although I suppose that’s the point. The algorithm favours active people; after a few consecutive days of diligently making decisions on my nine daily profiles, Breeze congratulates me and reassures me that my profile will be prioritised as a result and shown to more users. This is good news because for weeks, nobody matches with me. Then along comes Matt (not his real name), an attractive 34-year-old teacher. It’s daunting having to commit to a date by paying £9.50 before I’ve even sent them a flirty emoji, and we have some difficulty agreeing on a time, not least because you can only arrange this through the app. Eventually, a date is set for two weeks’ time.I don’t have Matt’s contact information, or any way to speak to him on the app, so we can’t actually chat until we meet in person. Two days before the big day, he cancels. I receive an apology, explaining he has to work late that night. We rearrange for the following week. But on the morning of our date, I receive another note. He has injured himself running and asks to reschedule for two days’ time. This excuse seems tedious to me; and given it’s the second time he has cancelled, I lose interest. I cancel the date and get my date token refunded to use with someone else. But I can’t get the £9.50 back because I cancelled, which seems a little unfair given Matt was the flaky one, but there we are.Regardless of Matt, I love the premise for Breeze; it’s an antidote to dating app fatigue cultivated by endless swiping and insipid small talk. It claims to have organised 389,892 dates across more than 20 cities at the time of writing and has led to five babies.Number of users globally:972,000Inclusivity: three genders, though you can specify how you want to identify, and as for sexuality, this isn’t listed on your profile. Instead, you can simply say you’re interested in men, women, or “people who identify differently”Age range:average age is 32 in the UKNumber of dates:one cancelled oneNumber of wistful daydreams about mysterious biotech consultants:threeBest for older daters:HappnView image in fullscreenPhotograph: picsmart/AlamyPrice:freePaid subscription options:Premium subscription from £22.99/month offering unlimited likes, no ads, see who likes your profile, and five SuperCrushes a day, backtrack and more extensive search filters.The premise for Happn is to date the hot people you walk past. The app was launched in Paris in 2014 and uses geolocation to help users match with people they’ve crossed paths with within a few kilometres’ radius. Don’t let the somewhat creepy USP put you off: nobody finds out your exact location. But you can see how many kilometres someone is from you.You can have up to nine photos on your profile, and the information you can add knows no bounds. On top of the basics, you can include 10 hobbies and 10 places you like to visit, whether it’s your local pub or favourite park, which the app uses to help align you with people who favour similar spots. You can write a short bio, too, and include your exercise habits, as well as whether you want children and how you like to eat; one option is “junk food 4 eva”. In the “what you’re looking for” section, options range from standard (“long-term relationship” and “open relationship”) to ambiguous (“hangout” and “sex friends”). You can also choose three “teasers” AKA prompts, many of which are based around location, eg “If I could visit one place it’d be …”It’s extensive, as is the rest of the app. You can decline someone by tapping a small yellow “x” or like them by tapping a pink heart. Or you can “SuperCrush” them, sending a message with your like, which Happn says means you’re five times more likely to match. You can filter your searches quite extensively: whittling down your results by what someone is looking for, their views on kids and cigarettes, and their height. At first, I take this a little too seriously and put in all my preferences only to find my potential matches for the day reduced to, erm, five. After that, I either need to go out and about again to cross paths with more men or widen my scope somewhat. I choose the latter.View image in fullscreenGenerally speaking, the men I chat to are attractive and charming, trading recommendations for coffee spots in south London and favourite Japanese dishes. But the conversation never goes far beyond that, and I end up turning down the men who ask me out, because I don’t think I’ll have anything to talk to them about in person, and I’m not sure how much I’ll fancy them, either.There are other ways to find prospective suitors, though. Via Happn’s “Hub”, you can browse a map to see who has added different places to their favourites list, as well as find someone you might’ve crossed paths with there. So I can zoom in on Battersea Park and see who has chosen that as one of their favourite places in London. I can also, rather strangely, zoom in on an area just a few roads away and see the 265 single men I’ve crossed paths with there.There are also lifestyle and travel categories you can browse through to find matches. I can tap on “hiking and backpack”, for example, and look through users who’ve specifically put this as one of their hobbies. These are good ways to find common ground from the outset, giving you instant conversation starters. Happn also gives you daily roundups of users it thinks you might like. But if none of that floats your boat, you can also play a game called CrushTime to “guess” who has liked you; if you guess correctly, you have the option to match with them.It’s overwhelming, to say the least. But it certainly offers single people something new and different in a pursuit that can easily slip into monotony, which is no bad thing.Premium, which costs from £22.99 a month, offers unlimited likes, no adverts and gives me access to more in-depth search filters.I’m regularly encouraged to use my SuperCrushes, which means the people I like will see me first, and apparently be more likely to match with me. To be honest, I struggle to find enough people to send the SuperCrushes to; maybe I’m not crossing paths with enough men I’m attracted to, or this whole experience has made me so picky I’ll never find love again. Regardless, I do once again enjoy looking through the people who’ve liked me. I’m not given a total number, which is rather helpful because it’s less overwhelming, but unlike on the other apps’ paid versions, I’m not able to filter my likes in any way. You win some, you lose some – a lot of time is also lost to endless scrolling.Number of users globally:165 millionInclusivity: three genders plus 20 additional identities users can add (though you need to contact customer services to change your gender on the app)Age range: More than half of users are between 35 and 54Is the paid-for upgrade worth it?No. There are already plenty of unnecessary features in the free versionNumber of dates:zilchNumber of restaurant recommendations:fourOlivia Petter is ajournalist, broadcasterand author with more than a decade of experience in lifestyle, pop cultureand cosplaying as Carrie Bradshaw.

How can I manage my time better?How you pass your days is how you pass your life – mine seem to slip through my fingersElle HuntWed 14 May 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 18.20 EDTShareThe other day, a visiting friend and I planned a trip to the seaside. I was taking her on the scenic route to the station, ambling happily along, when she pointed out: we might miss our train.We made it with seconds to spare. My friend was very understanding, but it was a wake-up call.In general, I prefer to go with the flow. Being self-employed (and without dependents) makes this possible, but I also hate feeling pressured by a schedule.Part of my motivation for leaving my job five years ago was to avoid the morning rush. Despite my best efforts to make the daily 8.45am meeting, I’d always end up slinking in at 8.47am, already feeling like a failure.Working from home has allowed me more day-to-day ease – but my friend’s visit made me think I’ve perhaps become too comfortable with cutting things fine.It’s not just trains (and planes – a costly mistake). I’m often optimistic about how long a task will take, resulting in a last-minute rush and entirely preventable stress.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Behavioural scientistscall this “event time”, meaning my internal sense of time guides me more than the clock. “Clock-timers”, on the other hand, instinctually organise their lives around external cues – eating lunch at the same time every day, for example. At work, they might spend a set amount of time on a work task, then declare it finished.For an event-timer, the “end” is open-ended: how long is a piece of string?Day-to-day, time can feel like it slides through my fingers; hours pass in a blur. The shapelessness of time – that sense of days rolling into one – troubles me, while those peaks of stress are all the more misery-inducing for being self-imposed.Could I be managing my time better?Your relationship to time is the “essential ingredient” in how you experience your days, argues Ian Taylor in his new book Time Hacks: The Psychology of Time and How to Spend It.When you feel that your time is well spent, there’s a sense of flow, says. Taylor – like when I know that I’m free to take the scenic route or fall into research rabbit holes. But if how you pass your hours doesn’t align with your values or wellbeing, for example, this can derail and degrade your life.It’s more subtle than being overworked or burned out, says Taylor, who researches the science of motivation at England’s Loughborough University.Sometimes a sense of having “no time” can speak more to your outlook and environment than your workload. “If you’re surrounded by people who are frantically going from one thing to another, then you’re just going to get sucked along,” he says.I’m disagreeable – and it’s backed by science. Can I change my personality?Read moreBut Taylor cautions me against striving to “manage” my time: paying too much attention to the clock can actually be counterproductive. “This idea that time is completely inflexible and obdurate is, I think, putting a lot of pressure on.”It’s natural to go in and out of high-pressure periods and downturns, he says, but fluidity – aiming for a lack of friction or strain in one’s schedule – might be a better goal than, say, an equal split between work and leisure.One studyfound that people who report having very little free time “yet seldom feel rushed” are happier than others, he points out. Seamlessly going from one activity to the next, being busy but not feeling out of control, “is an optimum state”, he says.For me, that means trying to shift, if only a bit, from event-time to clock-time – to recognise hard deadlines, give myself sufficient time to meet them, and prevent those uncomfortable sprints to the finish.I need more clarity on where my time is going. For three days I track my activity on a spreadsheet, in 15-minute increments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAlmost immediately, Taylor’s warning against email (“the lowest form of work”) is borne out: I spend twice as much time on my inbox as I had imagined, or intended. I realise some emails are busywork, sent mostly to make myself feel productive.The other revelation of my schedule is a pronounced mid-afternoon slump. From 2pm to 5pm, my focus wanes so much that I struggle to even record what I’m doing. Looking back on the spreadsheet, I see I’ve coded hours-long chunks as “writing”, omitting a lot of brain-dead social-media scrolling.There’s a mismatch here: I should tackle thinking-intensive tasks first, rather than ease into the day with email, errands and admin that could be done on low-power mode. I tend to exercise at 9am or 10am, but pushing it to lunchtime could extend my productivity.Why do I feel like I’m stuck in a ‘waiting room’, hoping for my life to get started?Read moreTypically, Taylor says, your willpower erodes over the course of the day, meaning your best hours can easily be lost to admin. “Getting a bit of nourishment in first thing – making some small progress on your dreams or ambitions, however you want to phrase it – is particularly important.”But seeking to wring the juice out of every hour isn’t advisable either. “I’m a big fan of scheduling nothing,” he says. A well-balanced schedule, powered by a mix of motivations – not just willpower – feels more effortless, Taylor says.Identity is a powerful, often hidden influence on behaviour. For instance, a self-described bookworm doesn’t have to use willpower or external incentives to find the time to read; it’s easy. Similarly, thinking of yourself as a runner or a writer can be the first step to making that a habit.If time is dragging or slipping away, there might be a disconnect between your sense of self and how you are spending your days.More from Why am I like this:I’m an adult. Why do I regress under my parents’ roof?I like my own company. But do I spend too much time alone?People say you’ll know – but will I regret not having children?“Think about your character and your values, and live in line with that,” says Taylor. “It takes a lot of effort and thought and reflection, but life will be a lot easier.”If I want to start really giving myself enough time to catch a train or meet a deadline, I could try channelling my values – focusing on the unpleasant physical sensations of stress, the threat it poses to my sleep and good humour, and my desire to be a dependable friend.I could also begin thinking of myself as a punctual person. But, Taylor says, what’s really important is avoiding “dead time”, or hours that feel wasted – and that will differ between individuals.Those who get to the airport early aren’t necessarily more virtuous than I am. If they spend those hours anxiously spiralling, any peace of mind from arriving early might be negated, Taylor points out.On the other hand, I’ll confess – for me, there’s no more life-affirming thrill than making my flight with a minute to spare.Time Hacks: The Psychology of Time and How to Spend It by Ian Taylor is published by PiatkusExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyWhy am I like this?featuresShareReuse this content"

A former volunteer with the Peace Corps, which sends young Americans overseas to projects in emerging economies, Anderson had expected to spend her whole career in international development.“I had taken this job two years ago expecting to stay here for at least 10 years, and you know, we had started to make a community and build up our life here. In January, we had started looking at buying a home,” she says.Now Anderson is having to consider giving up the apartment in the Washington DC commuter town of Reston, Virginia, that she shares with her husband and their four-month-old baby and almost two-year-old toddler.“Financially, it’s a little bit precarious, and honestly we’re not sure what we’re going to do,” says Anderson, who is also an activist with the local branch of the AFSCME union and dabbles in selling political merchandise. “We’re thinking about moving back to Ohio, where I’m from, where my family is. You know, it’s a lot cheaper there.”Anderson is far from alone. “In our apartment complex, there’s been lots of yard sales, people selling things and moving away. It really does seem like people are just picking up and leaving, because it’s too expensive to live here without a job,” she says.Tough life-decisions like these have been forced on hundreds of thousands of former federal employees in the past couple of months, as the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge), which is headed up by Donald Trump’s favourite tech billionaire, Elon Musk, hasslashed jobs in a cost-cutting spree.Data from the latest monthlyChallenger jobs reportsuggests Doge has been responsible for 281,452 job cuts so far – almost eight times the number of workers the government let go in the entire year to April 2024.Brendan Demich is among those to be dismissed, losing his job as an engineer at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. All his colleagues working on mine safety, as well as those in their sister laboratory testing equipment such as respirators, are also leaving – more than 200 in total – as part of a wave of cuts initiated by Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr.“So many people are devastated,” says Demich, chief steward of the local AFGE union branch. He says so many workers have been removed at once that their colleagues have barely been able to give them any kind of send-off. “It’s just unceremoniously leaving, because they had their package processed and they had to walk out the door.”Each of these cuts has its own human impact, but experts are warning of a growing risk that they combine to trigger an economic retrenchment – particularly in areas with a heavy concentration of government jobs.View image in fullscreenLiz Shuler: ‘The economy is being impacted in such a stark way, that ripples out across all of the industries that we represent.’Photograph: Bonnie Cash/UPI/Rex/ShutterstockLiz Shuler, the president of the AFL-CIO federation of 63 trade unions, which together represent more than 15 million US workers, is trying to build a nationwide campaign to highlight the devastating impact.“The trick is connecting the dots because there’s already a national narrative around what’s happening but it’s not quite being felt yet,” Shuler says. “Elon [Musk] has his ‘department of government efficiency’. We established the ‘department of people who work for a living’. That’s kind of cheeky, but it’s kind of serious, because we’re saying we’re the ones working on the frontlines. We know what’s efficient and what’s not.“Obviously as the labour federation we’re worried about jobs and people’s livelihoods, but it’s also connected to community, and the fact the economy is being impacted in such a stark way, that ripples out across all of the industries that we represent,” she adds.These ripples are being felt especially strongly in the towns and counties around Washington DC, where job losses and government cuts crop up constantly in conversation.Kate Bates is the president of the chamber of commerce in affluent Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River from the US capital. She compares the current uncertainty to the pandemic, “but during Covid, the federal government was the backstop, whereas right now it’s the federal government that’s causing a lot of this,” she says.Bates reports that her members are warning of a slowdown across real estate and hospitality, as well as among government contractors, with several reporting they have already had to make job cuts.“What we hear from a lot of people is that if they could plan for the cuts, they would be in an OK position, right? But because things are changing, going back and forth, that’s causing a lot of stress,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘If the whole year is on the margin then restaurants like ours will go under,’ says the general manager of Arlington’s Barley Mac.Photograph: Greg Kahn/The GuardianBusinesses that rely on government workers for custom are also feeling the chill. Saamir Nizam, the general manager of Arlington’s Barley Mac restaurant, which is part of a small family-owned chain, has noticed trade declining in just about every one of their usual customer groups.The nearby hotels are less occupied; bookings for “happy hour parties” by the accountants and consultants who serve the federal government are down by two-thirds; and many older local residents have been spooked by market volatility.“We can only do so much to turn things around: we can’t pull people to Washington, or convince companies to go out and do things,” Nizam says. “Barley Mac serves great food, it gives great service, but it exists, like many restaurants, on the financial margin. And if the whole year is on the margin then restaurants like ours will go under, because we’re not part of a huge national chain which has deep pockets.”View image in fullscreenReal estate agent Jessica Miller says clients are responding by pulling out of deals and trying to negotiate unusually short leases.Photograph: Greg Kahn/The GuardianJess Miller, who set up Rock Spring Real Estate Solutions a couple of years ago, has been hosting a breakfast roundtable for clients, on the top floor of an as yet unoccupied new office block in Arlington.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The owners of this building are splitting the floors instead of looking for one anchor tenant.“Just how they’re making decisions is different – the cutbacks we’re seeing,” Miller says. “It hit the NGOs first and then it hit, you know, the corporations and the contractors, and it’s a lot of the senior management.”Katherine D’Zmura Friedman is a co-founder and the chief executive of Thumbprint, an Arlington-based startup offering an artificial intelligence platform for designing office layouts.View image in fullscreenKatherine D’Zmura Friedman says she seen family friends and neighbours losing their jobs, people who would not ‘normally be subject to layoffs’.Photograph: Greg Kahn/The Guardian“There’s no universe in which something like the last few months happens and there’s not serious consequences,” she says. “We’ve had family friends, we’ve had neighbours lose their jobs, and these are not people who would normally be subject to layoffs. These are people who are at the peak of their career, and hyper-specialised.”As far as the business effects are concerned, D’Zmura Friedman says: “Certainly on the commercial side, there’s been hesitancy about launching into things.”At her office nearby, Renata Briggman, a residential estate agent, plays down the idea that the housing market in Arlington could be hit, pointing to the many local employers broadly unaffected by federal spending – such as Amazon, which is headquartered here.However, she does acknowledge signs of change. “It’s definitely shifting. We’re not seeing any fire sales, it’s too soon for that. It’s very, very slow, and we’re just going to start seeing it, it’s just on the cusp … end of June, we’ll have a better idea.”View image in fullscreenRenata Briggman: ‘It’s definitely shifting. We’re not seeing any fire sales, it’s too soon for that.’Photograph: Greg Kahn/The GuardianSuch challenges are being replicated across the region. Jimmy Olevson, the president and chief executive of National Capital Bank, which serves Washington DC and the surrounding areas, says the bank is not yet seeing signs of financial distress, such as rising arrears, but the mood is “uneasy”. Many customers who have had a recent mortgage application approved seem to have put house-hunting on hold.Some experts fear this widespread mood of unease bodes badly for the coming months. Analysis by Dr João Ferreira, an expert in regional economics at the University of Virginia, suggests more than 320,000 people in the state are employed directly by the federal government – and another 441,000 jobs depend on taxpayer-funded contracts, of the kind that are being cut.In some sectors – construction, for example – the same firms fretting about whether their contract will be cut are also contending with the rising price of materials, as a result of tariffs. Although some of the border taxes have beenpaused or reduced, those restrictions that remain mean costs are still far higher than at the start of the year.In theory, the Trump administration could lift the gloom by drawing a line under budget cuts as Musk headsback to his day jobrunning the electric carmaker Tesla. But key members of the cabinet, including Kennedy and the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, have boasted of how much they plan to slash from their budgets – and White House trade policy continues to see-saw.Ferreira says: “I think, as an economist, I’ve never seen so many things happening at the same time. But they all lead to the same direction, and that’s a recession.”He says Virginia has often been cushioned from economic downturns in the past by federal funding, but in this cycle he expects the state to lead the way. “We definitely might see that Virginia, and other regions like Maryland, will be the frontrunners in this recession period,” Ferreira says.Meanwhile, for many of the affected individuals, the future looks highly uncertain – despite the US treasury secretary Scott Bessent’s suggestion theyshould go work in manufacturing. “For us on our team, we work in international development,” says Anderson. “We have a background in humanitarian work, and the Trump administration is trying to cut international foreign aid.

That was more than one meeting every week on average, and nearly 70% more often than his predecessor as science and technology secretary, Michelle Donelan.The findings have brought renewed criticism from those who believe Kyle has used his position to push the sector’s agenda even in the face of concerns about online safety and protections for the creative industries.UKAI, a trade body representing the UK’s artificial intelligence industry, said smaller players were being squeezed out as a consequence of the government’s focus on big tech.“Our concern is that there is a huge imbalance between a handful of global players who are able to influence directly what No 10 is thinking about on policy, and the thousands of other businesses that make up the AI industry across the UK,” said Tim Flagg, the UKAI chief executive. “Our voice is not being heard but the economic growth that the government seeks will come from these companies.”Labour has put the technology sector at the heart of much of what it is promising to do in government. Keir Starmersaid in a speechearlier this year that artificial intelligence could “turbocharge growth”, and the prime minister is now pursuing a tech-focused trade deal with the US, havinglast week agreeda range of tariff reductions.Kyle has been at the centre of the government’s outreach to the sector,calling those who work in it“the bold people building a new future for Britain”.A Labour source said the figure showed Kyle was “clearly working nearly 70% harder than his predecessors”. They added: “He is meeting many more inventors, investors and innovators as well as technology companies, victims, campaigners, academics and scientists. That’s the job. And it is a privilege to do it.”Some in the creative sector blame Kyle for piloting controversial proposals to allow AI companies to circumvent copyright protections and use creative material to train their tools. The Guardianrevealed last monththat ministers had drawn up concessions to those plans after a backlash from some of the UK’s best-known artists, including Elton John and Paul McCartney.On Wednesday, ministers sought to block a Lords amendment to the data bill that would have required AI companies to disclose their use of copyright-protected content.Some in Labour circles now believe Kyle has become so close to the industry he is supposed to monitor that he will be moved in the next reshuffle, possibly to replace Bridget Phillipson as education secretary.Victoria Collins, the Liberal Democrats’ science and technology spokesperson, said: “Peter Kyle has rightly got a reputation for being too close to big tech – unable to defy his friends atMetaand X when it comes to standing up for our kids’ online safety or the rights of British creatives. Kyle rubbing shoulders with so many big US tech bros, instead of our great UK startups trying to get their foot in the door, shows he’s missing a trick.”Caroline Dinenage, the Conservative chair of the culture, media and sport select committee, said: “It’s great that [Kyle] is taking a keen interest in the growth of this sector. But he needs to ensure he’s hearing balanced voices from across the high-performance business sectors the UK economy depends upon, to avoid irrevocable unintended consequences of advancing at the expense of others.”A spokesperson for the science and technology department said: “As the department for technology, we make no apologies for regularly engaging with the sector – one that employs nearly 2 million people in the UK. Regular engagement with technology companies of all sizes is fundamental to delivering economic growth and transforming our public services.”Information published by the government shows that from July 2024 until December 2024 – the most recent period for which there is data – Kyle held meetings with people representing or advocating for technology companies 28 times.Google, Amazon andMicrosoftwere present at five of those meetings, the data shows, while Meta attended four.Five of Kyle’s meetings, all in early August, were to discuss online disinformation and how it had contributed to the spread of violence during that summer’s riots. But apart from that, almost every one was to discuss “investment”, “opportunities”, or both.In August Kyle met all four of those companies, and others from the industry, to discuss AI regulation.This year he has met AI companies several times, according to documents obtained under freedom of information rulesby the website tech.eu. Those meetings include three with the US AI company Anthropic, as well as a two-day flurry of meetings in February during which he saw executives from OpenAI, the chip designer Arm, Google DeepMind, ElevenLabs and Synthesia.Many of those meetings were also attended by Matt Clifford, the prime minister’s adviser on AI, who has been criticised for carrying out his role while also holding shares in dozens of AI companies.Earlier this yearthe Guardian revealedthat the government was delaying its plans to regulate the AI sector.Last September, Kyle met Tony Blair in a meeting designed to “discuss [his department’s] priorities”. However, information obtained by Politico last week under freedom of information laws shows Blair used that meeting to suggest Kyle meet the Ellison Institute of Technology, which is funded by Larry Ellison, the billionaire tech mogul who also funds the Tony Blair Institute.Kyle wasalso involvedin watering down proposals from a Labour backbencher to ban addictive smartphone algorithms aimed at young teenagers.Explore more on these topicsPeter KyleTechnology sectorMetaGoogleAmazonMicrosoftArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

The planned attack was averted when an undercover officer infiltrated the self-styled Nazi cell.The three men were Christopher Ringrose, 34, from Cannock, Marco Pitzettu, 25, from Derby, and Brogan Stewart, 25, from West Yorkshire, who formed a virtual cell and had never met.They admired Adolf Hitler and spouted anti-immigrant rhetoric, shared material from the far-right activist Tommy Robinson and discussed attacking places housing migrants to Britain.They were convicted by a jury at Sheffield crown court of multiple terrorism and firearms offences and warned by the judge they faced lengthy jail sentences.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Brogan Stewart, Christopher Ringrose and Marco Pitzettu.Composite: Counter Terrorism Policing/ReutersAmong their weapons were deactivated guns that they were trying to restore, crossbows, hunting-style knives and a tomahawk.The 3D gun was built from instructions found on the web and needed only a firing pin, bolt and barrel to be turned into a lethal weapon.They identified an Islamic centre in Leeds to attack, and discussed abducting and torturing an imam, the route they would take, how they would avoid detection and their escape.Stewart chose himself as the “Fuhrer” or leader and laid down uniform rules for members to be clad in Nazi-style clothing.He called the group Einsatz 14, referencing Nazi paramilitary death squads, and appointed Pitzettu and Ringroseas “armourers”.The group members, who believe in a race war, criticised other extremist far-right groups for not taking action.Using the messaging app Telegram, Stewart wrote that other far-right groups just “sit around and talk”.“I want to get my own group together because action speaks louder than words,” he wrote.Stewart added: “I would love to beat faggots up too” and “I want to storm the government buildings and hang the politicians. The government are full of Jews and other enemies.”View image in fullscreenThe 3D-printed firearm found in the possession of Christopher Ringrose, 34, from Cannock.Photograph: Counter Terrorism Policing North East/PAThe men were arrested on 20 February 2024 after the group was infiltrated by an undercover officer called Blackheart.Targets they had discussed for harassment and attacks included mosques, Islamic education centres and synagogues.Ringrose, a manager at a car parts supplier, posted a photo of his one-year-old son wearing a skull mask and the words “choose violence” while Pitzettu, a mechanic, shared videos of the Christchurch mosque massacre.Stewart, the self-appointed leader, had never had a job and lived with his mother.In a group telephone call on 5 February, two weeks before their arrest, Stewart laid out an attack plan to “cruise around” looking for “human targets” near an Islamic education centre, “do what whatever we do then back at mine for tea and medals and a debrief”.Stewart said he wanted the members to “hang out, bring ourselves closer together and just cement that brotherhood”. But the meeting was cancelled because of bad weather.Opening the trial, prosecutor Jonathan Sandiford KC said: “The defendants had identified potential locations and targets and it was the imminent threat of an attack that led to the defendants being arrested.”The court heard Stewart said of the group’s ideology: “Personally, I’ve taken inspiration from the SS,” and added: “I also hope that we can extort political rivals and potentially plan operations to meet migrants landing on our beaches and deal with them.”DCI James Dunkerley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said: “They were a group that espoused vile racist views and advocated for violence, all to support their extreme rightwing mindset.“All three took real-world steps to plan and prepare for carrying out an attack on innocent citizens.”Bethan David, head of the Crown Prosecution Service’s counter-terrorism division, said: “These extremists were plotting violent acts of terrorism against synagogues, mosques and an Islamic education centre.“By their own admission, they were inspired by SS tactics and supremacist ideology.“Had Christopher Ringrose managed to completely finish building the 3D-printed semi-automatic firearm that he had started to, it could have been used leading to devastating consequences.”They will be sentenced on 17 July.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

These include the share of children on free school meals who achieve passes in GCSE maths and English; who complete a degree by age 22; and who make it into the top 20% of earners by age 28.The trust finds that all of the top-scoring 20 constituencies on this index, and 42 of the top 50, are inLondon. The highest-ranked constituency outside the capital is Birmingham Perry Bar, in the West Midlands, in 23rd..The research shows the dramatic differences in children’s prospects, depending on where in England they happen to be born.Children receiving free school meals in the best-performing constituency, the social security minister Stephen Timms’s seat of East Ham, are a startling 30 percentage points more likely to achieve grade 5 in English and maths than their counterparts in the area at the bottom of the list, Newcastle upon Tyne Central and West, represented by Labour’s Chi Onwura.As they go on through life, these same children are three times as likely to complete a degree if they came from Timms’s east London seat than they are if they were born in Onwura’s Newcastle seat. The latter is one of three of the 10 lowest-scoring constituencies in north-east England.Nick Harrison, the Sutton Trust’s chief executive, said: “This research paints a startling picture of inequality of opportunity across England. The life chances of disadvantaged young people remain strongly tied to where they grow up.”As a child I needed free school meals, as mayor, I provide them. And this policy works – here’s the proof | Sadiq KhanRead moreThe report, which is based on data covering 10 million people over 25 years, also reveals big differences in the likelihood that children from low-income families leave the area they grew up in when they become adults.Despite the familiar narrative of young people moving to London to seek their fortune, the Sutton Trust finds that the capital is one of two regions, with the east of England, where the highest proportion of children on free school meals go on to move elsewhere, at 13%. That is more than twice the 6% in north-east England who do so.Anthony Breach, a research director at the Centre for Cities thinktank, said the Sutton Trust’s research suggested that aside from London, many English cities are not offering the economic opportunities they could.“It’s striking that only London among our major cities consistently performs the role we’d expect of a big city – driving progression, opportunity and advancement for its residents. This aligns with the evidence that Britain’s other big cities are underperforming,” he said.The Sutton Trust makes a series of policy recommendations for narrowing these regional gaps in social mobility, including incentivising the best teachers to work in disadvantaged schools, and improving financial help for children from low-income families who attend university.As negotiations between the Treasury and Whitehall departments intensify, the trust also calls on the government to make improving social mobility a guiding principle in the forthcoming spending review.“Opportunities for social mobility will only be available nationwide if there is a more even spread of economic opportunities across the country,” the report says.“This should be a sustained effort across government, potentially including greater devolution of powers and reforms to funding for local government, as well as greater investment in infrastructure regionally – including transport, and opportunities for education and training.”.Priya Edwards, a senior policy and advocacy adviser at Save the Children UK, agreed that ministers should be prepared to commit significant resources to improving children’s prospects.“This report shows how children’s life chances are sadly limited by both poverty and geography and it should serve as a wake-up call to the UK government,” she said.“Ministers must act to level the playing field for all children, regardless of where they live. They should start by scrapping the two-child limit and benefit cap at the comprehensive spending review on 11 June, or in the forthcoming child poverty strategy.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “High and rising standards are at the heart of the government’s mission to break down barriers to opportunity and ensure where you come from does not determine your future success.“This government has inherited a system with baked-in inequalities, which we’re tackling head-on through our plan for change by rolling out free breakfast clubs, improving mental health support, investing over £3bn to support those children who need it most and delivering a rich and broad curriculum so pupils are set up for life, work and the future.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mobilityChildrenPovertySchoolsInequalityEconomic policyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump had previously suggested he would travel to Turkey only if Putin were present.Medinsky, the ultra-conservative former Russian culture minister, will be joined inIstanbulby a deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, a deputy foreign minister, Mikhail Galuzin, and Igor Kostyukov, the head of Russia’s military intelligence agency.Russia’s decision to appoint Medinsky to lead the talks suggests it aims to revive negotiations along the lines of the fruitless 2022 Istanbul round, which included maximalist demands such as limiting Ukraine’s military and blocking it from rebuilding with western support – terms Kyiv has rejected as unacceptable.Notably, the Kremlin is not sending its two most senior diplomats, Yuri Ushakov and Sergei Lavrov, who have previously taken part in multiple high-level talks with the US in Saudi Arabia.Pressure had built on Putin to attend the talks since Zelenskyy and then Trump called on him to travel to Istanbul to discuss a potential peace deal.Zelenskyy challenged Putin to a personal meeting in Turkey after the Russian leader used an unexpected late-night Kremlin address to call for direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations in Istanbul.Much is still unclear about Thursday’s talks, which are taking on growing importance amid escalating rhetoric and strategic posturing by Russia and Ukraine.Zelenskyy was en route to Ankara on Wednesday evening, where he is scheduled to meet the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Thursday, according to his aides.The Ukrainian leader said he would be ready to fly to Istanbul at a moment’s notice if the Russian leader showed up. “If Putin does not arrive, and plays games, it is the final point that he does not want to end the war,” he said on Tuesday.Late on Wednesday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, posted on social media pictures of a meeting in Turkey with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the US senator Lindsey Graham. Sybiha said the three men met to “further peace efforts and coordinate positions during this critical week”.He added: “It is critical that Russia reciprocate Ukraine’s constructive steps. So far, it has not. Moscow must understand that rejecting peace comes at a cost.”Trump had previously urged Zelenskyy to accept the offer of negotiations and said he hoped Putin would attend.On Wednesday the US leader had said there was a “possibility” he would divert to the country if the Russian president was there. Trump, however, noted that he was scheduled to be in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, on the third and final leg of his Gulf tour. But, when asked about visiting Turkey, he added: “That doesn’t mean I wouldn’t do it to save a lot of lives.”Brazil and China, which have warm ties with Moscow, also backed talks between Russia and Ukraine.Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said he would push Putin to take part in the talks with Zelenskyy. “I’ll try to talk to Putin,” Lula said, adding that he planned to travel to Moscow. “It costs me nothing to say: ‘Hey, comrade Putin, go to Istanbul and negotiate, dammit.’”Brazil and China had issued a joint statement on Tuesday calling for direct negotiations as the “only way to end the conflict”.Putin and Zelenskyy have met only once, in 2019, and Moscow has repeatedly portrayed the Ukrainian leader as illegitimate.In Istanbul, Ukraine is expected to call for a full 30-day ceasefire as a starting point for further talks.Moscow has consistently rejected extended ceasefire proposals, arguing they would give Ukraine time to rearm and regroup at a moment when Russian forces are advancing on the battlefield.Russian officials have indicated they will press for maximalist demands in Istanbul, similar to those made during the failed round of talks in Turkey in spring 2022.European leaders have promised to increase pressure on Russia if the talks in Turkey failed, but the question remains whether they can bring Trump onboard with their efforts to tighten the screws on Moscow.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Wednesday that there must not be any settlement in Ukraine in the form of a “dictated peace” from Moscow.Addressing parliament, Merz warned of “militarily created facts against Ukraine’s will”, telling lawmakers it was “of paramount importance that the political West does not allow itself to be divided”.Explore more on these topicsVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaUkraineIstanbulBrazilDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

That starts with delineating which minerals are really critical for what end, and prioritising those needed for public goods of a green future – not the likes of arms companies’ profits.”By 2040, the world is expected to need four times as many critical minerals as it does today, and while theUS deal with Ukraine for access to its mineral wealthhas hit the headlines, deals have also been struck more quietly around the world, away from public attention.The UK government has already signed non-binding agreements with Saudi Arabia, Australia, Kazakhstan and Zambia in an effort to corner their mineral resources, and is this year poised to publish a 10-year critical minerals strategy to support the “industries of tomorrow”.But in a joint briefing released on Thursday, 17 organisations, including the Trade Justice Movement, Global Justice Now, Corporate Justice Coalition and Friends of the Earth say that without safeguards, the UK and other powerful nations risk perpetuating a system of neocolonial exploitation that “sacrifices justice for the sake of convenience”.The increased levels of mining needed to extract minerals risks disrupting ecosystems and creating water scarcity, as well as workers’ rights abuses, violation of Indigenous rights and occupational safety and health issues.The new strategy, they say, must clearly differentiate between minerals needed for the energy transition, and commit to limiting extraction and the principles of the circular economy. It must also ensure that bilateral agreements with producer countries respect core UN and International Labour Organization human rights and labour rights conventions, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the Paris agreement on climate change.Tom Wills, the director of the Trade Justice Movement, said: “The UK’s approach to securing critical minerals must not repeat the mistakes of the past, where the drive for resource extraction left behind a trail of environmental degradation and human suffering.“The UK has a responsibility to lead a sustainable and fair global transition to clean energy which prioritises both environmental protection and human rights. We cannot afford to perpetuate a system that sacrifices justice for the sake of convenience.”The Department for Business and Trade, which is responsible for the UK’s critical minerals strategy, has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsCommoditiesGreen politicsMining (Environment)Mining (Business)newsShareReuse this content"

While those taking semaglutide (Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) lost double the amount of weight compared with people using older jabs – 16kg on average – patients put on 9.6kg within a year, meaning they could expect to regain all 16kg again in just over 20 months.The researchers studied 6,370 adults in eight randomised controlled trials and three observational studies. Of these, 1,465 patients were taking semaglutide and tirzepatide – higher-dose jabs recommended specifically for weight loss.Previous analysisof trials into the efficacy of different diets, not including drugs, by the same researchers, found that while people also regained weight after stopping diets, the rate of regain was much slower, taking at least five years to get back to the weight they were before.“These drugs are very effective at helping you lose weight, but when you stop them, weight regain is much faster than [after stopping] diets,” said Susan Jebb, the co-author of the study and professor of diet and population health at University of Oxford.The findings raise issues for the NHS, asNice guidelinesstate people should not be on weight loss injections for more than two years. Additionally, many patients give up the treatment, whether because they are buying it privately so cannot afford it, because the side-effects do not suit them or because they are not losing weight any more.“Is it going to be worth the NHS investing in these drugs if they only have them for a short time and then they pile all the weight back on, or does the NHS have to accept that these are going to be long-term therapies?” Jebb added.“Either people really have to accept this as a treatment for life,, or we in science need to think really, really hard, how to support people when they stop the drug​.”While the study did not show causality, Jebb speculated that the difference in how fast people put weight back on could be due to the fact that diets are hard and people have to practise restraint to lose weight, whereas if you are taking a drug that knocks your hunger out completely, you don’t have to​ make that effort. “So when the drugs are then taken away, you haven’t got those sort of behavioural strategies in place that help keep the weight off.”Responding to the findings, Tam Fry, the chair of the National Obesity Forum, said: “It shouldn’t surprise anyone if people regain weight having used GLP-1 drugs without seriously attempting to improve their lifestyle … Using GLP-1 is not the quick fix which many users believe it to be.”Jane Ogden, a professor of health psychology at Surrey University, said there was no point “just throwing people back out into the world of their own lives, carrying on their own behaviours from before” after coming off the injections.“They’re going to need psychological counselling, behaviour change, nutritional support from that moment on to help them sustain healthier behaviour in the long term, to keep the weight off,” she said.“The NHS should introduce a stepped care approach through online support available to large numbers of people at low cost, online or in-person group support or more intensive 1:1 support.”Jason Halford, at the European Association for the Study of Obesity, said: “We need to ensure patients have the support to make the changes in their behaviour they need to sustain the benefits of treatment. [Weight loss jabs] are an adjunct to behavioural change, not a replacement.”Explore more on these topicsHealthObesitynewsShareReuse this content"

But the author of the paper himself believes there has been a miscarriage of justice – and so too do other doctorsDavid ConnWed 14 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 05.40 EDTShareOn 4 February 2025, Lucy Letby’s barrister, Mark McDonald, convened a press conference at the grand baroque Westminster venue One Great George Street. It became a landmark moment, the culmination of months in which a number of distinguished experts had spoken out to question the former nurse’s convictions.The media were addressed for an hour by a Canadian medical professor, Dr Shoo Lee. He said that a panel of international expertsdisputed the prosecution casethat had led to Letby being found guilty in two trials of murdering seven babies at the Countess of Chester hospital in 2015 and 2016, and attempting to murder seven others. She was sentenced to 15 whole-life orders, and the court of appeal unanimously refused her permission to appeal.“We did not find any murders,” Lee said. “In all cases, death or injury were due to natural causes or just bad medical care.”Lee is one of the world’s leading neonatologists – doctors who specialise in the medical science and care of premature babies. Before his retirement from clinical practice in 2021, he held senior leadership positions in Canada, headed up international collaborations and conducted extensive research. His journey to becoming so involved in a criminal process pursued in the provinces of north-westEnglandis a remarkable feature of the Letby case. It springs from Lee being told, after Letby was convicted, that a medical research paper he authored more than 30 years ago had been used as a basis for one of the prosecution’s central allegations – that Letby killed babies by injecting air into their veins.Lee was dismayed, he told the Guardian, adding that the use of his paper was “incorrect” and a “categorical error”, and he was concerned Letby may have been wrongly convicted. He agreed to give evidence to the court of appeal but the judges dismissed it as “irrelevant” when they refused Letby’s application. He then committed to assembling a world-class panel who would fully assess the evidence. Lee’s eminence meant that the peers he could call on comprised leading specialists in Canada, the US, Japan and Europe, including two distinguished UK-based consultants,Dr Neena Modi, a pre-eminent neonatologist, and the renowned perinatal pathologistDr Marta Cohen. Lee flew across the Atlantic at his own expense to present their findings at that bombshell press conference.He explained the acute medical problems some of the premature babies had suffered, and said the panel found “no medical evidence to support malfeasance” or deliberate harm. But they had identified “so many problems” with the babies’ care, in a unit that had “inadequate numbers of appropriately trained” staff.“If this had happened at a hospital in Canada,” Lee said bluntly, “it would have been shut down.”The neonatal unit at the Countess ofChesterhospital was a small, cramped, concrete facility, built in 1971. NHS neonatal units are classified for staffing and expertise at three different levels, according to how premature the babies are, because the earlier they are born short of the 40-week full term of pregnancy, the more severe their physical underdevelopment and medical difficulties tend to be.In 2015, the Chester unit was level two, which meant it accepted very premature babies, born after 27 weeks’ gestation, including those with high medical dependency needs and requiring intensive care.The agonising series of premature babies dying on the unit began in June 2015 with three infants, anonymised at Letby’s trial as babies A, C and D. It was recognised as a crisis a year later when two of three premature triplets died, babies O and P. That prompted the hospital’s executives to downgrade the unit to level one, so it could only admit babies of more than 32 weeks gestation.Central to understanding the Letby case is that across almost a decade of inquiries and investigations since then into the collapses and deaths of the babies on the unit, the criminal trials – the verdicts that the babies were deliberately harmed – are the exception. Before Cheshire police became involved in May 2017, there were extensive examinations and reviews: within the hospital by the neonatal clinical lead Dr Stephen Brearey, lead for children’s services Dr Ravi Jayaram, and others, postmortems by consultant pathologists at Liverpool’s Alder Hey children’s hospital, a coroner’s inquest for Baby A, a review of the unit by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), then further reviews by the pathologists and independent consultant neonatologists. None found that the babies had been deliberately harmed. Now, after Letby’s trials, Lee’s international panel wholly disagrees with the prosecution case, as do many UK-based specialists, including consultant neonatologists Svilena Dimitrova and Neil Aiton, who are alsoproviding expert reports on individual babiesfor McDonald.In 2015-16, the Countess of Chester hospital’s neonatal unit was caring for more premature babies, with more acute medical needs, than in previous periods, and was struggling with staff shortages. But the precise causes of the individual collapses had not all been explained by the doctors or postmortems. Brearey and Jayaram had noted that Letby had been at work when babies collapsed, then in June 2016, after the two triplets died when she was on shift, they became more vocal about their suspicions. They had no evidence of any wrongdoing, nor of any deliberate harm caused to the babies.Jayaram then discovered the 1989 article that Lee had authored with another doctor, Keith Tanswell. Jayaram later said that he and other doctors had begun to wonder about skin discolorations observed on three of the babies: A, whom he attended; B and M, who had had collapses and survived. Jayaram said he did some research, and came across “the possibility of something called an ‘air embolism’”. He then found “an old academic paper, written in the 1980s”.View image in fullscreen‘The ordeal of the infants’ families is very sad. However, fair justice is paramount’ … David Davis and Dr Shoo Lee unveil their evidence at a press conference.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPANow that it has come to feature so prominently in the prosecution case, and Lee has appeared in person to respond so emphatically,the paper itselflooks strangely modest: three and a bit pages of a medical journal, the authors’ full names not even given: SK Lee and AK Tanswell. Entitled “Pulmonary vascular air embolism in the newborn”, it was a study of babies’ fatal collapses caused by air in the bloodstream. Based on that paper, Letby would be accused of injecting air into babies’ veins, although the study also comprised babies undergoing high-pressure ventilation. In some, particularly the more premature, their lungs leaked, so air entered the bloodstream, then, when it travelled to the heart, it blocked the circulation.The key observation that the prosecution’s medical experts would later cite as a guide to air embolism in the Chester babies is a single sentence, a description of skin colour changes.“Blanching and migrating areas of cutaneous pallor were noted in several cases and, in one of our own cases we noted bright pink vessels against a generally cyanosed [blueish-grey] cutaneous background.”Jayaram has said he found that description “chilling”, because it matched the blotches observed on the Chester babies, including Baby A. He began to raise air embolism, and the Lee and Tanswell paper, as possible evidence that Letby was murdering the babies by injecting them with air. He first mentioned it to hospital executives on 29 June 2016, then to the RCPCH review team, when they arrived two months later.The RCPCH team did not find the accusations against Letby compelling. They found that the unit was not compliant with professional standards for level two, it had too few consultants who were doing only two ward rounds per week, and junior doctors were reluctant to call on them. The hospital’s medical director, Ian Harvey, commissioned Dr Jane Hawdon, a consultant neonatologist at London’s Royal Free hospital, to review the individual babies’ collapses, based on their medical records. Hawdon found no evidence of deliberate harm, but many instances of “sub-optimal care”. Harvey explicitly mentioned to Hawdon that the consultants had suggested air embolism. She replied that “there were insufficient details in records” and it would probably have been impossible “to record in anything but real time” the precise causes of some collapses, including if there were any “sinister” cause. But she emphasised she had “concerns” about the unit’s response to babies’ medical conditions, referring to “subtle signs” being missed “or not escalated or responded to”. There may have been “an inherent system or leadership problem,” she said.Harvey also asked Dr Jo McPartland, one of the Alder Hey pathologists, to review the postmortems, and asked her about air embolism. McPartland replied in January 2017 regarding Baby A that “there wasnoevidence of air embolism”.Brearey and Jayaram, in particular, did not accept the adequacy of the reviews. They maintained their accusations against Letby, and began to press hospital executives to involve the police. The executives were reluctant as there was no evidence against Letby, only the consultants’ suspicions due to the statistical coincidence of her having been on shift. Nobody ever saw her harm a baby or commit any of the acts – injecting babies with air, or lacing two feeding bags with insulin – of which she would later be accused and found guilty, and there has never been any tangible or forensic evidence of her doing so. She was well respected as a committed young nurse, who had taken intensive care qualifications, and would volunteer for extra work and overtime when the unit was stretched. Senior staff believed that this explained why she was often on shift for the sickest babies.Eventually, the executives agreed to the consultants’ pressure to contact the police.Minutes of a meetingon 12 May 2017 show that the assistant chief constable, Darren Martland, did not believe there were grounds to investigate, as there was “no specific allegation at this point to suggest a criminal act”. He also pointed out that Cheshire constabulary “are not clinical experts”.Martland said officers would, though, meet with Jayaram on 15 May 2017, as he had sent an email raising concerns. At that meeting, Jayaram told the police that “unusual rashes” were seen on some babies and he raised the possibility of air embolism. Three days later, on 18 May 2017, Cheshire police announced a criminal investigation. Paul Hughes, who became the senior investigating officer, was at the meeting with Jayaram.In Jayaram’sfirst formal police statementon 18 September 2017, he referred to his research that found air embolism, and the Lee and Tanswell paper. He gave a very precise description of discoloration he said he had seen on Baby A, that tallied closely with the paper: “flitting patches of pink areas on the background of bluey-grey skin”.Jayaram said in his statement that “this strange blotching”, which “didn’t fit with anything I’d ever seen before in my 27 years as a paediatrician”, also appeared on Babies B and M.“The paper described what I had seen on the babies,” Jayaram said.It would emerge at the trial, when he was challenged by Letby’s then barrister, Benjamin Myers KC, that Jayaram had never noted that skin discoloration on Baby A before. He did not include such a description in the medical notes he wrote on the evening Baby A died in June 2015, nor in his evidence to the coroner’s inquest. Myers accused Jayaram of making up this discoloration, two and a half years after Baby A died, to fit with the Lee and Tanswell description he had read since.View image in fullscreenThe neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester hospital where Lucy Letby worked.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAJayaram replied that he had not realised its clinical significance at the time. “You’re suggesting I didn’t see it? No, absolutely I saw it, and I have no reason to confabulate why I might have seen it,” he said. “As a professional, as a paediatrician of 30 years, as a doctor of 32 years, if my character was such that I would make things up, I would hope that friends, colleagues, managers, nurses, patients, parents, would have picked that up well before now.”Jayaram has also faced intense scrutiny and criticism for another key allegation he made against Letby, that he came upon her after she had dislodged Baby K’s breathing tube, in February 2016. However he did not mention that to anybody for months afterwards. This allegation led to a charge of attempted murder, for which the jury in the first trial could not agree a verdict. Letby was convicted in the retrial, whose jury was told she was by then a convicted serial killer. Asked why he waited so long to mention it, Jayaram has said he wasn’t courageous enough: “It’s been suggested to me that I just made that up, which is … I will refute, it is nonsense. There is no reason I would.”Serious further criticism has been made recently of his evidence: he said at the Baby K retrial that when the baby deteriorated, Letbydid not call for assistance. But in a May 2017 email only disclosed to Letby’s lawyers last September after she was convicted, recently reported by the UnHerd website, Jayaram wrote to his fellow doctors: “Staff nurse Letby at incubator and called Dr Jayaram to inform of low saturations.”Last week, the Conservative MP David Davis,who has spoken in parliamentarguing that Letby has suffered a “clear miscarriage of justice”, made a formal complaint to Cheshire police calling on them to investigate Jayaram for potential perjury.Asked about his evidence by the Guardian, Jayaram declined to comment.Key to understanding how Cheshire police came to construct a case against Letby, and the allegations of injection with air that no previous expert found, is that one doctor, Dewi Evans, had a very significant role. Hughes’s team took him on within weeks, after Evans read about the investigation being launched and put himself forward, emailing a contact at the National Crime Agency: “Sounds like my kind of case.”Evans was a consultant paediatrician with experience of neonatology, at Singleton hospital, Swansea, who retired in 2009. After that, he worked prolifically giving medical opinions as an expert witness in the adversarial battlegrounds of the courts.Concerns have been raisedabout his objectivity: expert witnesses must restrict their evidence to an impartial analysis in their own particular specialism, not advocate for the side instructing them. But Evans has talked repeatedly about having “won” all his cases, except one. He explained this to the Guardian last year, arguing it is proof that he is impartial, as “partisan witnesses don’t last long”.Evans began suggesting the injection of air as a possibility to Cheshire police from an early stage. He ultimately gave as his medical opinion, for the police and prosecution, that five babies, A, D, E, I and O, had been killed by air embolism due to the injection of air into their veins. He also referred to the Lee and Tanswell paper to support this opinion, in particular that it explained the skin discolorations seen on some of the babies.Myers suggested to Evans at the trial that the police must have told him about suspicions of air embolism, putting that in his mind. Evans said that was “completely untrue”.“The first person I know of to raise the issue of air embolus in this particular series of cases was me,” Evans said.Evans’ reputation was seriously undermined by an extraordinary intervention in the middle of the trial. A senior court of appeal judge, Mr Justice Jackson, issued profound criticism of Evans’ integrity as an expert witness in a separate case, and took the step of emailing the Letby trial judge, Mr Justice Goss, to inform him.Jackson was vitriolic in his ruling, writing that Evans made “no effort to provide a balanced opinion”, and his approach “amounts to a breach of proper professional conduct”. He appeared to have wanted a particular outcome in the case, Jackson said, and sought to achieve it by “working out an explanation”. Jackson said the report included “tendentious and partisan expressions of opinion that are outside Dr Evans’ professional competence and have no place in a reputable expert report”.Myers argued throughout the Letby trial that Evans was not impartial, and had been doing what Jackson found in the other case: “coming up with ideas and theories” to support the prosecution case that Letby harmed the babies. Evans consistently denied that. Myers then applied for all of Evans’s evidence to be disregarded. Goss refused, ruling instead that the jury should be told about Jackson’s criticisms, and decide themselves how credible they found Evans’ medical opinions. During those exchanges, Evans said that the opinion Jackson criticised in the other case had only been a letter to a solicitor, that he had not expected to go before the court.Myers also applied for the allegations of air embolism to be thrown out, for lacking evidence. Goss refused that application, too. He acknowledged that the prosecution’s expert radiologist and pathologist did not find any “diagnostic” medical evidence of air embolism. But he said that this crucial question – the medical opinions that air had been injected into the babies’ veins, based in part on the skin discolorations linked to the Lee and Tanswell paper – should also be left to the jury.The other method of murder alleged by the prosecution, which Evans also provided as an opinion, was that Letby injected air into babies’ stomachs via the nasogastric feeding tubes connected to their noses. Many experts since the trialhave dismissed and even ridiculedthat as a means of harm; several clinicians told the Guardian last year that it was not practically feasible, and even if it was, the air would leak out or the baby would burp or vomit it up, or pass it as wind. When the Guardian put their criticisms to Evans, he said his opinion had been that injecting air or fluid into the stomach destabilised the babies, and “was not directly responsible for any of the deaths”. McDonald argues this is a change of opinion from the trial, when Evans said that excessive air in the stomach could cause a baby to stop breathing. Thecourt of appeal judgmentstates “air via nasogastric tube” as the mechanism of murder for three babies, C, I and P. Evans has since changed his opinion on Baby C, saying he now firmly believes air embolism was the cause, and has sent a new report to Cheshire police. They have refused to provide it to McDonald.View image in fullscreenLady Justice Thirlwall, chair of the public inquiry, who said she could not ‘set about reviewing the convictions … the court of appeal has done that, with a very clear result. The convictions stand.’Photograph: Peter Byrne/ReutersReplying to questions from the Guardian, Evans stood firmly by his opinions on air embolism. He has pointed out that he was cross-examined on them, supported by other doctors in the trial, and that his opinions were also considered by the court of appeal. Evans said he has been “in good standing” with the General Medical Council since the start of his career in 1971, and began giving evidence as an expert witness in 1988. He said he “flagged up” air embolism as a cause of several babies’ collapse in his preliminary, 2017 reports, and only read the Lee and Tanswell paper later.“The allegation of ‘misusing and misinterpreting Prof Lee’s 1989 paper is erroneous,” he said. “I had reached a diagnosis of air embolus long before (re)discovering Lee and Tanswell’s publication.”Lee was quite unaware of the Letby case until her lawyers contacted him in October 2023. He was immediately troubled to discover how his research had been used. To the court of appeal, Lee carefully explained air embolism, and emphasised that only the one skin colour change identified in his paper, pink blood vessels against a bluish background, was diagnostic. He said none of the rashes described as having been seen on the Chester babies conformed to that; they had many possible medical causes, including hypoxia, and he disputed Evans’ opinions.But the judges, while recognising that Lee was an eminent neonatologist,dismissed his testimonyas “irrelevant and inadmissible”. It was irrelevant, they said, because the prosecution’s medical witnesses had pointed to the babies’ rashes as “consistent” with air embolism, not diagnostic of it. And Lee’s evidence was inadmissible because he had theoretically been available for the trial so Letby’s legal team should have called him then.The judges also upheld Goss’s rulings that left the questions of air embolism, and Evans’s credibility, to the jury.Lee told the Guardian: “Lucy’s lawyers told me that she had exhausted all avenues of appeal and would remain in jail for the rest of her life. That troubled me greatly because no one should be convicted based on wrong medical evidence.”He then agreed to assemble his panel of “the best experts in the world” to examine the evidence. With a neonatologist colleague in Toronto, Dr Qi Zhou, Lee also researched air embolism specifically caused by injecting air into veins. Lee explains that his 1989 paper did not distinguish between cases where air entered the circulation from the high pressure ventilation, and those where air was injected into the veins. There was no research specifically into air embolism caused by air injected into the veins. “This was not pointed out at the trial or to the court of appeal,” Lee says. It was, he says, “a categorical error” to use his paper to allege air was injected into the babies’ veins.In their newscientific paper published in December 2024, Lee and Zhou found that no “patchy skin discoloration”, such as observed on the Chester babies, appeared from air injected into infants’ veins.“This is new evidence,” he says.It was striking that when the trials ended in July last year, amid the storm of publicity, a growing number of experts immediately spoke out in disagreement, even outrage, at the evidence that led to Letby’s convictions. The government had rapidly set up a public inquiry, chaired by the court of appeal judge Lady Justice Thirlwall, to learn lessons from how a serial killer had apparently been operating in an NHS hospital unit. Before it started, 24 distinguished specialistswrote tothe health secretary, Wes Streeting, and justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, calling for the public inquiry to be paused or widened, to grasp the opportunity to consider whether the legal system may have produced a miscarriage of justice.But Thirlwall and the inquiry lawyers refused to engage with that possibility. In her introductory speech, Thirlwalldismissed the mounting concernsas “noise”. She had to focus on the inquiry’s terms of reference and could not “set about reviewing the convictions”, she said. “The court of appeal has done that, with a very clear result. The convictions stand.”The convictions are unsafe and should be overturned as soon as possibleDr Shoo LeeFor six months, until the hearings finished in March, the inquiry proceeded on that basis: an unchallengeable assumption that the prosecution case was right, and that the truth was only established once the police became involved.The scale and weight of the expert challenge to the criminal trial have not been acknowledged by Thirlwall and her lawyers, by Streeting, Mahmood or any other government minister. The legal and political establishments appear to have struggled to recognise that the concerns over Letby’s convictions are far from conspiracy theory or internet noise. It is unprecedented that so large a group of experts with such distinguished reputations have so rapidly, publicly and comprehensively spoken out to dispute convictions for murder.The lawyers representing the parents of the Chester babies at the Thirlwall inquiry have criticised the raising of concerns, and said they are increasing the families’ distress. They have dismissed the possibility that Letby could be the victim of a miscarriage of justice, and don’t accept that Lee’s panel’s work or his new research may undermine the safety of the convictions. On 18 March, Kate Blackwell KC, representing Harvey and three other hospital executives of the time, applied for Thirlwall to pause writing her report, arguing that the purpose of a public inquiry, to “fully and fearlessly” establish the truth, would otherwise not be fulfilled. Blackwell’s stance signalled that the executives, who have been relentlessly criticised at the inquiry for commissioning the external reviews and not going to the police sooner, question the safety of the convictions. It was the final day, and the first time anybody involved had said the experts’ concerns should be taken seriously. Streeting andThirlwall refused the application.On 3 April, McDonald submitted to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) the full report, 698 pages, compiled by Lee’s panel, on all the babies. They found no evidence that any were deliberately harmed, and rejected the prosecution case of air embolism or air via the nasogastric tube. The panel set out detailed findings on the babies’ vulnerable medical conditions, their opinions on the cause of the collapses, and alleged a catalogue of poor medical practice by the doctors on the unit.Seven other leading experts also produced a separate report for McDonald, which rejects key prosecution evidence that led to Letby being convicted of attempting to murder two babies by poisoning them with insulin.“The convictions are unsafe and should be overturned as soon as possible,” Lee says. Of the parents, he says: “The ordeal of the infants’ families is very sad and unfortunate, and we all feel for them. However, fair justice is paramount.”Some experts who also believe the convictions are unsafe are known to have taken issue with some medical detail in the panel’s findings, while agreeing with the conclusions that there is no evidence of deliberate harm to any of the babies.The CCRC, founded after a1993 royal commission reportinto a series of catastrophic miscarriages of justice including the Birmingham Six, is the legal system’s last chance for convicted people whose appeals have been turned down. It decides whether applications raise sufficiently serious questions about convictions for a case to be referred back to the court of appeal.Timeline of Lucy Letby’s attacks on babies and when alarm was raisedRead moreThe CCRC has had its funding severely cut in recent years, while miscarriage of justice applications have dramatically increased, so the organisation is taking a long time to even consider them. The commission can only refer cases back to the court of appeal on the narrow ground that there is a realistic possibility the judges there may overturn a conviction. So it has to take into account judges’ reluctance to accept new expert opinion, however eminent.Thirlwall continues to work on her report. She appears certain to recommend that, in future, if any accusations are made of wrongdoing by people in healthcare settings, they must immediately be referred to the police.A spokesperson for the inquiry said: “It is not for a public inquiry to examine criminal convictions. That is the role of the Criminal Cases Review Commission and the court of appeal.”A government spokesperson said: “We should all remember what the families and those affected by this appalling case are going through and keep them in our thoughts. A criminal trial has taken place and Lucy Letby was found guilty. There is an ongoing independent process to review cases through the Criminal Cases Review Commission.”Meanwhile, Letby remains in prison, convicted as Britain’s worst ever child serial killer. She has always maintained her innocence.Explore more on these topicsLucy LetbyHospitalsEnglandChesterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thewar in Gazahas seen the country’s public diplomacy face its greatest test – as was made clear on Wednesday morning with arobust exchangebetween David Mencer, a spokesperson for the Israeli government, and Nick Robinson, a presenter of the BBC’s flagship Today programme.Mencer stressed that he was speaking on behalf of the prime minister and made an uncompromising statement of Israel’s arguments, including the accusation that Hamas – described as a “genocidal death cult” – uses civilians as human shields.“Israel faces a moral paradox right now. It’s been created by Hamas. We have an opportunity to strike every military target, but when we do, we get condemned, you know, or we don’t strike them, and we reward the use of human shields,” he told Robinson.But the core of the confrontation was Israel’s blockade ofGaza. Here some listeners may have decided Mencer was involved in a deliberate attempt to obscure the reliably reported reality on the ground for political, ideological and strategic ends.Certainly, the key Israeli argument that there is “no hunger in Gaza” is hard to sustain. The same goes for Mencer’s accompanying claim that there is food in Gaza, and that markets are open.It is true that there are some basics still available in the territory, even after 11 weeks of a total blockade by Israel, and that a few stalls and shops still offer some basics. But the vast majority of the 2.3 million Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip cannot afford to buywhat they need to survive, and, if they could, stocks would suffice only for a tiny number.There is a limited amount of often spoiled flour, of which a standard 25kg sack costs hundreds of dollars, and of fresh food such as potatoes and tomatoes, a kilo of which costs between $10 and $15. There is no dairy and almost no meat. Free bakeries shut weeks ago for lack of fuel and flour, while community kitchens which once served 1m meals a day are closing fast. Almost all the main warehouses run by big international NGOs, such as the World Food Programme or Unrwa, are now empty.Many people are living on canned peas or dried beans, of which there is a finite supply.There are, however, thousands of tonnes of food, medicine, shelter, fuel and everything else necessary for survival ready to be sent into Gaza, but that can happen only when Israel opens the checkpoints it controls along its perimeter.It is true, as Mencer said, that a substantial amount of aid was brought in and stockpiled during the 10-week ceasefire that came into effect in mid-January, but this has all gone – and this influx did not offset the consequences of a war that has devastated agriculture, water supplies, sanitation systems and health services, leaving the population gravely weakened and vulnerable to disease.Essential medicines used to treat malnutrition are now being rationed, aid workers say, and medical supplies are running low.Then there is the obvious evidence of images of clearly malnourished people – often children. Mencer suggested that such cases may not be proof that thousands or tens of thousands of others are in the same dire condition, but a report on Monday fromthe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a consortium of experts that has for decades advised the UN and governments, said that Palestinians living there faced “a critical risk of famine”.The IPC, which has developed a five-level famine warning system, found that between 1 April and 10 May this year, 244,000 people in Gaza were in the most critical food security situation: level five, “catastrophe/famine”. The IPC noted that there had been a “major deterioration” in the food security situation inGazasince its last assessment in October 2024.Mencer denied that Israel was using starvation as a deliberate strategy, asking why, if that was the case, would Israel have sent “enough food aid to fill Wembley Stadium in London to the brim 80 times over” into Gaza during the conflict.But the aid allowed into Gaza through much of the 19-month conflict has been inadequate, unpredictable and subject to much-criticised bureaucratic procedures that blocked many shipments and slowed more. It was also hard to distribute given the widespread destruction and continuing violence.Almost 53,000 people have been killed since the Israeli offensive began. Sanitation systems, water supplies and health services are in ruins. Roads are choked with rubble, and bulldozers are systematically targeted by Israel.Israeli officials argue thatHamas steals and sells aidto fund its military and other operations. Therefore, they say, the restriction of aid is necessary to defeat the militant Islamist organisation, which killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in its raid on Israel on 7 October 2023, and to secure the return of the 57 of the 251 hostages taken that day who are still held in Gaza.Instead, Israel has made its own plan to distribute aid from six major hubs in southern Gaza, which would be run by private contractors and defended by Israeli troops.Aid agencies say they have robust mechanisms to prevent leakage of aid, and that Hamas steals little, if any. They also say they believe the new Israeli scheme is impractical, inadequate, likely to be dangerous and is potentially unlawful as it would displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, forcing them into ever smaller parts of the territory. Given this, they said they cannot agree to cooperate with it.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesanalysisShareReuse this content"

Wrapped in an “ultra-hard, 30X, cold-rolled stainless steel exoskeleton”, the Cybertruck was touted as the ultimate doomsday chariot – avirtually indestructible, obtuse-angled, electrically powered behemoth that can repel handgun fire and outrun a Porsche whiletowinga Porsche, with enough juice leftover to power your house in the event of a blackout. At the launch,Tesla’s CEO,Elon Musk, said the truck could tackle any terrain on Earthand possibly also on Mars – and all for the low, low base price of $40,000. “Sometimes you get these late-civilization vibes [that the] apocalypse could come along at any moment,” Musk said. “Here at Tesla, we have the best in apocalypse technology.”Six years on, Covid and Musk’s political alignment withDonald Trumphave kicked upthe apocalypse vibes, and Tesla’s good sense has only become more questionable as the Cybertruck has been reduced to an object of universal scorn and derision further raising a host of questions: is the Cybertruck even a decent doomsday chariot? Could it reallysurvive end times? Will it survive Musk himself? “There’s no doubt it’s a heavy-duty vehicle that can take some punishment, even from small arms fire,” says Arthur Bradley, a prepping expert who oversees the building of satellite systems at Nasa’s Langley research center in Virginia. “But you can’t weigh the pros without also asking: ‘Are people shooting at me because they think I’m an idiot or a bad guy, or they don’t support my political views – or they don’t support me supporting this company?’”View image in fullscreenElon Musk introduces the Cybertruck at Tesla’s design studio in Hawthorne, California, on 21 November 2019. The windows were broken during a demonstration intended to show the strength of the glass.Photograph: Ringo HW Chiu/APPost-armageddon transport has a simple but specific brief: be tough, durable and drive through anything – and no vehicle ticks those boxes more reliably than trucks. Fictional concepts such as Mad Max’s tanker-based War Rig are often the inspiration for real-world creations like Ford’s custom-built F650 Supertruck, a tractor-trailer sized monstrosity that can carry 120 gallons of fuel, tow 30,000lb, and be reinforced with bulletproof armor. The truck is how insurgent fightersget around war zonesand what storm chasers use torun down tornadoes. “They’re certainly pretty good for prepping purposes,” says Sean Gold, a former air force emergency manager who has worked in the prepping industry for nearly a decade. “They’re large, off-road-capable, able to get off roads that might be congested – that sort of thing.”I have never physically felt the air leave a room in the way that it did when the Cybertruck rolled out on stageSimone Giertz, DIY robotics inventorThe Cybertruck, however, broke from a century’s worth of truck-building orthodoxy, eschewing the typical three-box layout for a wedge-shaped silhouette that took inspiration from the movie Blade Runner and cyberpunk motifs. It mocked the F-150, the US’s top-selling vehicle for the last 47 years, asprehistoric tech. On its website, Tesla featured imaginative images of the Cybertruck crawling around Mars. Few knew what to make of it. Simone Giertz, a DIY robotics inventor whobuilt a Tesla truckon her popular YouTube channel, was among a select group invited to Tesla’s Hawthorne, California, studio for the Cybertruck unveiling. “I have never physically felt the air leave a room in the way that it did when the Cybertruck rolled out on stage,” she recalls. “People were so confused.”Since Musk’s hard-right turn, however, the Cybertruck’s design has gone from aesthetically polarizing to politically so. A recentSlate articlenods at the truck’s uncanny resemblance to the Casspir, the apartheid-era military transport that patrolled South African townships inMusk’s boyhood. “As violence and flames engulfed the streets of the nation, Black South African children drew and wrote about the apartheid security forces and its tools – dogs and Casspirs – chasing and shooting at them in their schools, streets, and homes,” the article says. “By the 1990s, the Casspir had become an iconic global symbol of apartheid oppression.”View image in fullscreenCasspirs, armored personnel carriers used by South Africa’s army and police, patrol the streets of a township before the nation’s first democratic election in 1994.Photograph: Peter Turnley/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesIt’s no surprise then that the Cybertruck would become a status symbol for security forces. One California police department spent $153,000 on a Cybertruck for “community outreach efforts” (though it didn’t rule out using it to “respond to emergencies” as needed), and a Chechen warlord showed offa machine-gun mounted Cybertruckhe claimed was purpose-built to help his army fight alongside Russia in the Ukraine war. “I am sure that this ‘beast’ will bring a lot of benefit to our fighters,” Ramzan Kadyrov said while heaping praise on “the respected Elon Musk”, who has denied making the vehicle for Kadyrov. Ultimately, the Cybertruck had to be towed from the battlefield after randomly shutting down on Chechen forces, and Kadyrov accused Musk of switching it off remotely –a nagging concernamong Tesla owners.In Tesla’s early days, the catastrophe thinking was small – a “bioweapon defense mode” button on each vehicle’s climate control, something Musk reckoned might come in handy “if there’s ever an apocalyptic scenario of some kind”. But even as Musk’s winking references to the apocalypse manifested into a bulletproof rig made of stainless steel, there was no denying that he may have been right to think the Cybertruck could be a hit with consumers. After the 2019 unveiling,Teslareceived about 2m preorders from customers plonking down $100 each. But in the end the enthusiasm wouldn’t last because Musk couldn’t keep his promises.The Cybertruck came to market two years too late, which was time that allowed Tesla’s rivals to get in the game; more Cybertruck reservation holders might have hung in there if Musk hadn’t marked the truck’s base price up to $99,000. Perhaps most detrimental for Tesla: the Cybertruck’s purported utility appeared to beworsethan advertised. The average truck is undergirded with a steel frame to handle the rigors of hauling and towing – but the Cybertruck’s underbody is made of aluminum, much lighter metal that can bendand even breakunder heavy strain. Stainless steel is also susceptible torust– which is to say the Cybertruck is an iffy proposition to survive regular winter, let alone nuclear winter.The internet teems with video of the Cybertruck spinning its wheels ina snowy parking space,on the beachand farther off the beaten path; meanwhile the Rivian R1T, a legitimately capable electric vehicle rival to the Cybertruck, was apparently no worse for wear after beingtossed around during Hurricane Helene. (“What a dream marketing opportunity for Rivian,” Giertz says. “Your truckactuallysurvived a natural disaster.”)Dan Neil, the Wall Street Journal’s Pulitzer prize-winning car critic,slid off a hillwhile test-driving the Cybertruck with his teenage daughter. “We took it on class three and class four trails, which it is technically capable of,” he says. “But it’s also 2ft wider than any trail at any national park could generally accommodate. That’s the part I don’t get. It’s definitely anon-roadcar.”View image in fullscreenPolice officers stand near a Cybertruck as people protest against a rally by Elon Musk, who is supporting a conservative state supreme court candidate, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on 30 March 2025.Photograph: Vincent Alban/ReutersThat makes the Cybertruck an even tougher sell to doomsday preppers – many of whom already had their doubts about the viability of EV technology during and after a major disaster, says Gold, the former air force manager. The Cybertruck’s 300ish-mile range in particular becomes a much riskier proposition when plugs stop working. “The beauty of EVs is you don’t have to hunt for fuel,” says Bradley, the Virginia-based prepping expert. “But the drawback is most people don’t have a large solar power generation system. If you get a little too far out, or run into a situation that causes you to use up your energy, you might not get back home.”Daisy Luther, a former automotive service manager who went into the prepping business after the 2008 financial collapse, wonders how anyone in the post-apocalypse would go about fixing a Cybertruck (which has already been recalledeighttimes) – especially in the event of an electromagnetic pulse or similar event. “I generally recommend that if someone is getting a vehicle to last them through some kind of apocalyptic situation that it have as few computer chips and electronics as possible,” says Luther, who drives an old Jeep. “I can do small repairs on something mechanical, but I can’t do anything that requires a computer flash or a satellite upgrade because I don’t have the equipment.”Last month I rented a Tesla Cybertruck to get a feel for it as a family vehicle and found it to be ill-equipped forthesetimes, let alone the end times. (And I say that as the owner of a Model Y, an exceedingly versatile family hauler that’s also massively fun to drive.) At over 6ft wide, 18ft long and 3.5 tons, the Cybertruck was a bear to maneuver around Atlanta’s narrow streets; its obtuse-angled shape made identifying traffic hazards through the car’s windows and mirrors a virtual impossibility. Even when I find myself considering the Cybertruck just for its potential as a standby home generator, I was soon reminded that Hyundai and Kia EVs offer similar capability for a fraction of the cost.I don’t think that [Doge] is the issue. Actually, it’s that people despise Elon Musk even more than they hate TrumpRoss Gerber, Tesla investorFor my toddler boys the Cybertruck is what the Lamborghini Countach was to me in my youth,the apogee of poster cars– but the truck isn’t what I would call kid-friendly. Mostly, it kept me worried about them gouging out an eye, losing a finger or getting static shock from touching the steel doors as they explored.“You’re driving a meme car!” Ezra Dyer, the Car and Driver columnist, helpfully reminds me. “You have to buy into the idea that it’s kind of funny,wink-wink.” When my wife asked if the children would be safe inside, I hesitated to tell her that Alijah Arenas – the highly regarded USC basketball recruit and son of former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas – had to be put into a coma after losing control of his Cybertruck andcrashing into a fire hydrant in Los Angeles. Suffice to say, had Alijah Arenas been driving a Rivian (the safest pickup on the roadfull stop) orTiger Woods’s 2009 Escalade, he would have been able to walk away from the accident; but somehow, bystanders managed to pry open the Cybertruck’s doors, which don’t have exterior handles (!), and pull him away from a fiery scene made scarier by the truck’stough to extinguish high-voltage battery– the last thing you’d want to deal with when the world’s already burning.View image in fullscreenA Cybertruck is parked with other Tesla vehicles on the south lawn driveway in front of the White House in Washington DC on 11 March 2025. Trump has said he will buy a Tesla to support the company and Elon Musk after recent calls for boycotts of Tesla products.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockUnlike modern cars, the Cybertruck was expresslynot designed to deform on impact– further ratcheting up the safety risks during and after a cataclysmic disaster. (This is also why Cybertrucks are banned in the UK, EU and China, the world’s largest EV market.) Gold, who drives a Model 3, could envision a bad actor hacking into the truck remotely or even Musk himself shutting them down out of spite as may or may not have been the case with the Chechen warlord. “I know it doesn’t really make sense [for him to do that],” Gold says, “but thepossibilityis concerning”.Then there’s Gold’s point: the Cybertruck is such a ripe target, it sticks out so much. Early on the Ford CEO, Jim Farley, dismissed it as the kind of status mobile you might find “parked in front of a hotel”. In its relatively short life, the Cybertruck has gone from being a status mobile for Kim Kardashian, Pharrell Williams and other tastemakers to the ultimate meme-mobile – a Maga hat on wheels. (SNL’s Colin Jost called it the answer to the question: “What if Kanyewas a car?”) When the truck isn’t being flipped off in traffic (although that wasn’t my experience driving it in Atlanta, asaturated Tesla market), it’s being used as aslate canvasforpolitical protestsagainst Musk. “I mean, I wouldn’t want to drive one around towntoday,” Bradley says.Read more from The Armageddon complex seriesWhy apocalypse-minded shoppers go to CostcoLefty preppers are taking a different approach to doomsdayThe rise of end times fascismThe irony of Tesla’s apocalypse machine is it couldn’t even overcome Musk’s worst nature, or even live up to the Earth-saving principles that Tesla used to espouse. “Maybe this explains it: he’s working really hard on bringing down civil society; maybe that was just to increase the market?” Giertz jokes. “It’s interesting because when the environmentalists turned on Elon, he immediately pivoted to another target group: the preppers who want to be self-sufficient. But at this point when civility is out the window and we are even more pissed at the guy who brought the apocalypse in, I’d rather be in a Toyota Prius than a Cybertruck.”On the company’s earnings call last month Musk vowed to step back from running the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to devote more time to Tesla amid speculation that he could bereplaced as CEO– but the catastrophe may be unsalvageable. “I don’t think that [Doge] is the issue,” Ross Gerber, a major Tesla investor, toldCNN. “Actually, it’s that people despise Elon Musk even more than they hate Trump. And that’s not something that he can solve at this point.”Despite being the world’s top selling EV pickup, Cybertruck sales are still so poor that the company doesn’t even bother reporting them – butrecord high inventoryandsteep depreciation curvesgive the game away. Quietly, Tesla shifted marketing strategies for the Cybertruck, pivoting away from the Martian imagery to more classic pickup truck iconography – but it’s too little, too late, and now just gaslighting the public. In recent months Tesla’s board chair made $198m unloading the company’s stock amid falling profits.Ford, Rivian and other competitors are fast gaining ground in the market. “It’s really interesting to see how far Tesla has fallen,” says Benoit. “At this point it’s beyond political.”If anything, the Cybertruck becoming the Titanic of cars is the fate weactuallyshould’ve prepared for. History tells us anytime a vehicle is touted as future-proof, it’s all but doomed to become a monument to unchecked hubris. “My guess is this incarnation of the Cybertruck has a very limited life,” Bradley says. “I think there will be another Cybertruck, but it will probably be more modern-looking – like a regular pickup truck.”"

We are probably not even in the same city. So I actually have no idea what the weather is doing where and when this finds you. After all, the only thing you can be sure about the weather at this time of year is its unpredictability.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.So getting a May wardrobe right is tricky. Summer makes a big entrance, and is then liable to make a French exit, disappearing without warning. It can be T-shirt and sunglasses weather on the sunny side of the street, but scarf and sweater time in the shade. Grey and moody enough to have you leave the house in black opaque tights, and then so muggy by lunchtime that you are dying to take them off. To complicate matters further, there tends to be a lot going on around now, what with bank holiday weekends and the compressed working weeks.What you need are clothes that feel fresh and spring-like but don’t leave you at the mercy of the elements. That celebrate the blue sky moments, but won’t leave you out on a limb if clouds roll in. This is equal parts practicality and vibe. It is about shoulder coverage and hemline length. It is about weight, transparency and wind-resistance of fabric. It is adaptability, and layering potential, and how to add warmth with pieces you can roll up and tuck in your bag. But it is also about colour and mood and attitude.There is something about early summer that compels us to go full bucket-and-spade, and it’s not a great lookHere’s the thing: a May wardrobe will be useful all year round. Your spring bank holiday weekend wardrobe is also your staycation wardrobe and your coolcation wardrobe if you opt to swerve sweltering Mediterranean climes for a fresh Scandi destination this summer. And it will do you proud as the building blocks of a wardrobe any time between spring and autumn .Let’s start with what we are not going to do, which is that typical British thing of celebrating the first rays of sunshine by stripping off. There is something about early summer that compels us to go full bucket-and-spade, and it’s not a great look, to be honest. Go into any pub garden on a warm night and you will find folk who are usually quite sophisticated dressed as if for a saucy seaside postcard, with goosepimpled flesh crisscrossed with exposed bra straps and flushed with sunburn.I know the first flush of summer is exciting, but can we at least try to play it cool? Sunny weather does not necessitate stripping off. Nothing to do with prudery, it’s just not that chic to look as though you’ve lost your mind because it has finally stopped raining. Unless the temperature is truly sauna-hot – and I know I said I didn’t know what the weather was like where you are today, but I’m going to stick my neck out here and say that it is probably not – a cool, loose, long-sleeve top will keep you cool enough, but will also ( crucially) give you a coverage when the temperature drops.You do want some bare skin, though. Just a glimmer or two. Never underestimate the power of a subtle flash of skin. I’m not pretending that this is completely not about sex, but it’s not just about sex. A glimpse of skin is appealing just because it creates a human-to-human connection with other people. You don’t need to be in a strappy vest, though: I’m talking about trousers worn sockless with flat sandals so that you can see a bit of bare foot. Or jacket sleeves turned back to the elbow. Or go ahead and wear that sleeveless vest, but under a jacket.May dressing is about reading the mood, not just about reading the mercury. You can hint at warm weather adventures with the texture of what you wear. The artisan-style blanket stitching on these sandals, or the relaxed frayed edges of this coord set. Or a bold jewellery piece that looks like you picked it up at the market. These things will work. Do you need the sunglasses? I’ll leave that one up to you.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But her painful renditions of a-ha and Pearl Jam aren’t just cringe – they signal a much bigger problemStuart HeritageWed 14 May 2025 07.21 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 20.22 EDTShareThis week’s episode ofThe Last of Uscontained a moment that froze the blood. For a split second, the hearts of the viewing audience rose into their throats in horror. This is a show that has presented us with terror after nightmarish terror but, even by these exceptional standards, this was almost too much to bear. I am talking, of course, about the scene where Ellie started playing a Pearl Jam song on a guitar.Within the broader world of The Last of Us, the song – entitled Future Days – is of enormous importance. If you’ve played the game, you’ll know the scene it hints at. It’s devastating. You’ll also know that, if the show hews closely to the source material, the general theme of guitars will eventually reduce the audience to emotional husks, teeing up the saddest, most hopeless ending to any major piece of storytelling in years.But if you haven’t played the game, the sight of Ellie picking up a guitar for the second time in as many weeks will have been a cause for alarm. Last week’s episode ground to a standstill so Ellie could sing Take on Me by a-ha all the way through, and the worry was that the same thing would happen again. And, without wanting to sound like one of those dismal review-bombers, I didn’t sign up for no musical.The fact that there could have even potentially been two consecutive acoustic sing-along episodes is indicative of a bigger problem with the shape of season two. It finds itself falling between two stools. On one hand, Joel is dead. He died in episode two, in what is likely to be the high point of the entire series. On the other hand, season three will turn the whole show on its head. Again, if it sticks to the blueprint laid out by the game, the focus will turn to Abby, the young woman who killed Joel. It promises to be a bravura piece of storytelling, recontextualising a character who seems like a complete monster.But now we find ourselves stuck in the doldrums. We have had three episodes without Joel or Abby, leaving us with the story of Ellie going to Seattle to get her revenge. And, boy, those three episodes have dragged. There have been meandering side plots about religious cults, long soliloquies by Jeffrey Wright, a love story that might be sweet but feels relatively unearned and, of course, the entirety of Take On Me by A-Ha played on an acoustic guitar.The biggest problem is Dina. As Ellie’s love interest, she should play an important role in the show, awakening her to a world beyond pure survival. This is something the show knows how to do, the stand-alone season one episode starring Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett being a shining example. But right now Dina feels a little grafted on, like a makeshift Joel replacement who exists solely to prevent the show from turning into a series of episodes where Ellie grunts in a succession of corridors by herself.View image in fullscreenDina gazes on adoringly as Ellie sings a-ha’s Take on Me … in full.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.Again, this might all pay off down the line. Dina, Abby, the cults, even the guitars will eventually have satisfying conclusions. But we’re talking a long way down the line. This week it was revealed that season three of The Last of Us won’t start filming until next year. Given that there has typically been a year and a half gap between filming and broadcast, this means that we’re expected to hold all these glimpses and hints in our heads until the last half of 2027.The Last of Us has two episodes left this season. One of them will be a stand-alone story about a character who, in the game, is seen only as a photograph. There’s a good chance that the episode will be sweet and moving, but it doesn’t offer a lot of hope in terms of plot propulsion. We’re still left with the sense that The Last of Us has been spinning its wheels since Joel’s death.Perhaps, in the grander scheme of things, this stretch was always designed as a breather, a resting spot between the intensity of what has been and what’s yet to come. But given the yawning chasm between seasons, that breather is starting to look a little like suspended animation. Let’s hope things pick up in 2027.Explore more on these topicsThe Last of UsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This week, I review Michelle Obama’s new podcast, IMO, which is surprising in the ways it breaks with the Michelle of the past.I came to sneer – and stayed to cheerView image in fullscreenDouble act … Michelle Obama and her brother, Craig Robinson.Photograph: Higher Ground MediaFirst, a disclaimer: I had never fully bought into the Michelle Obama hype. I felt her now legendary line “When they go low, we go high” encapsulated atroubling and complacent form of respectability politics, in which Black people have to maintain coolness and grace under fire to be taken seriously. As the first lady, Michelle often seemed like a sanitising presence, wheeled out so that her national treasure status could serve as a smokescreen to obscure more honest and damning assessments of Barack Obama’s political record.Also, I am not a huge fan of the celebrity podcast genre, which is a vehicle forhigh-profile figures to chat to their friendsin return for huge pay packets. So I was sceptical when Michelle’s podcastwas launched in March. Yet when I listened to it, I was immediately charmed and hooked. In truth, I came to sneer and stayed to cheer. She is honest, reflective and vulnerable in ways that are profoundly resonant of a universal Black female experience, something that her icon status had rarely spoken to previously. The irony is that just as Michelle is finding her voice, her popularity appears to be falling – the podcast received poor ratings on launch, though it’s arguably the best thing she’s ever done.A great orator has the conversation of her lifeView image in fullscreenFamily values … Michelle Obama with her mother, Marian Robinson, in 2008.Photograph: Ted S Warren/APThe most arresting thing about IMO, despite the genuinely interesting high-profile Black guests such as Keke Palmer and the Wayans brothers, is Obama herself. She has always been one of the great orators inUS politics– one of the superpowers that made her and Barack, another impressive public speaker, such a compelling couple on the world stage. In her podcast, Michelle uses this talent to reflect on her life and the challenges of ageing, losing her parents and the constant demands placed upon her.The fact that she co-hosts the show with her brother, Craig Robinson – a genial and down-to-earth foil for her confessions – gives the podcast such an intimate air that you feel like you’re in the presence of everyday people, not celebrities. I found myself listening not to hear any snippets of political gossip or insight into the Obamas’ lifestyle, but to receive some exceptionally articulated wisdom from an older Black woman who has seen a lot and gone through milestones we will all experience.She is also funny. Her account of how differently men and women socialise is familiar and hilarious. Michelle describes catching up with her female friends as a“multiday event”, something that leaves Barack perplexed as to why it takes two days for a basic meetup.There is pathos and uncertainty, too. In a recent episode, Michelle talks about the death of her mother, who lived in the White House during the Obamas’ tenure. Michelle says that, at 61, only now does she feel that she has finally become an adult, having had to reckon with her own mortality after the loss of her parents. The former first lady has revealed that she is in therapy, and that she is still trying to navigate this phase of her life.And, in a striking segment, she speaks with barely restrained annoyance about her reasons for not attending Trump’s inauguration, an absence that triggereddivorce rumoursthat have been swirling for months. She says “it took everything in [her] power” to choose what was right for her in that moment. Yet that decision was met with “ridicule” because people couldn’t believe she was saying no to the inauguration for any other reason than she just did not want to be there – they had to “assume my marriage was falling apart”. Oof. It caught my breath.Beyond Black Girl Magicskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The publishing juggernaut and icon of Black social mobility, who rose to first lady from a bungalow in the south side of Chicago, was the product of a particular moment in feminist and racial discourse.The start of that decade broughtthe rise of Black Girl Magic, a cultural movement that focused on the exceptional achievements and power of Black women. Itintersected with Black Joy, which moved away from defining the Black experience primarily through racism and struggle. Both unfolded against the backdrop of“lean in” feminism, which glorified hard graft, corporate success and having it all. The result was themarketing of women such as Michelleto promote popular narratives of inspiration and empowerment.That energy has since dissipated, losing steam culturally and overtaken by more urgent battles. The gains of the Black Lives Matter movement triggered a rightwingbacklash against diversity and inclusionthat is spearheaded by Trump. Now the Obamas seem like relics of a naively optimistic and complacent time.‘We got out of the White House alive – but what happened to me?’View image in fullscreenTruth teller … On stage during a recording of the IMO podcast in Austin, Texas, in March.Photograph: Marcus Ingram/Getty ImagesBut all that change and disappointment seems to have freed Michelle from the expectation that she should project graceful power and guru-like wisdom at all times. The podcast may not be the runaway hit it might have been 10 years ago, but that speaks to its authenticity and refreshing lack of a cynical big marketing campaign. Michelle is not trying to catch a moment – she even looks different. Gone is the silk-pressed hair, the minimalist jewellery and the pencil dresses. She now embraces boho braids, long colourful nails and bold gold jewellery.In an episode of IMO, she asks herself: “What happened that eight years that we were in the White House? We got out alive; I hope we made the country proud. But what happened tome?” There is so much urgency in her voice. And though her high-octane political experience may not be relatable to the average person, that question is one that I and many women of a certain age are asking as we emerge, blinking into the light, from the tunnel of navigating racism, establishing careers against the odds and having families.

Now more than ever we need itMartin Bell is a Unicef ambassador and a former BBC war reporterWed 14 May 2025 09.41 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 21.31 EDTShareIn a short space of time, the British government has made two decisions that will negatively affect the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world. The first was the severe cut in foreign aidannounced in March. The second was the similarly severe reduction in Foreign Office support for theBBC World Service. And these from a supposedly progressive government. It doesn’t seem progressive to me, but cheap and reactionary.I have double interest to declare. I am a long-term BBC loyalist who served the corporation for more than 30 years in the unquiet corners of the world, from Vietnam to Bosnia and from Belfast to Angola. My loyalty survived even such daft editorial decisions as to give aninterview with Prince Harryprecedence over real news. (That was little more than 10 days ago.) I have also been an MP. And since I left the House of Commons in 2001, I have served as a goodwill ambassador for Unicef UK, the British national committee of the UN children’s emergency fund. It introduced me to still more war zones, in Africa and the Gulf.It was in that capacity that I fully endorsed Unicef’s objections to the decision on foreign aid.We wrote at the time: “Now is not the time to break our promise to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable. Millions of children globally rely on UK aid to survive and have never needed it more.” We asked the government to rethink and to retract. It has not yet done so.The effect of the BBC cuts, to a service that wasalready due to cut 130 jobsthis year, is harder to quantify. They reflect the unique and ambiguous position of the corporation itself. It is not by any means a governmental organisation, but its World Service is – or has been until now – largely subsidised by the Foreign Office as a projection of British interests, values and soft power. I have no problem with that: it is my opinion that Foreign Office resources were never better spent. But all this is now in jeopardy, along with the surviving language services. It is hard to see what will remain but a shadow and skeleton of what the World Service used to be.And consider the timing, which could hardly be worse. Agents of disinformation are spreading their toxins through the world. Where the BBC withdraws and its wavelengths grow weaker, all sorts of national and international malefactors are ready to move in – not with news but with propaganda. Even today, under siege at home and abroad, the BBC remains the world’s most trusted news organisation. Its American rival and former counterpart, the Voice of America, is beingput to the swordby a White House whose megaphone is the partisan Fox News. It is challenged at home by a so-called news channel that offers a floodtide of rightwing opinions.The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, speaks of a “borderline crisis in public service broadcasting” and he is better placed than anyone to know. Not only is the World Service at risk. So is the identity and survival of the national broadcaster – the model for so many others – as we have known and (dare I say?) loved it.BBC boss says disinformation ‘trust crisis’ putting social fabric of UK at riskRead moreI find it paradoxical, having risked my life for the BBC in so many war zones, that its World Service’s funding is apparently at risk of being confiscated, among other sources, to pay for an increase in defence spending. Having served so effectively during the old cold war, it is now to be the casualty of a new one. I sense that we are living in the most dangerous times since Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. You may argue that we need sharper swords and fewer ploughshares. I would reply that, more than ever, to make sensible decisions we need trustworthy sources of information. So do the people of Russia, China, Ukraine and India, among others. This is the point of the BBC: the truth is its currency.Wherever I travelled as a foreign correspondent, in times when communication was technically more difficult, I would find my colleagues from other countries crouched over their shortwave radios to find out what was going on around them and elsewhere. And what were they listening to? It was never Moscow. It was occasionally Radio Free Europe. It was usually the BBC.And would we willingly let this go? I hope and believe not. And I urge the government to think again.But I also believe this: once we have relinquished it, we shall never get it back.Martin Bell is a Unicef UK ambassador.

Was that the Netflix effect?Zoe WilliamsIt is hard to prove the judicial impact of two shows inspired by the notorious double murder case. But undoubtedly, they heightened public scrutinyWed 14 May 2025 13.18 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 18.18 EDTShareWhen the true-crime documentary Menendez Brothers: Misjudged? aired in 2022 on Discovery+,its impact was not immediate, except on TikTok, where – chicken and egg-style – it was hard to determine whether people were talking about the case because of the show or because a general cultural osmosis had brought the topic to the fore.Erik and Lyle killed their parents in 1989, when they were 18 and 21. They alleged a childhood of sexual, psychological and physical abuse by their father, which their mother knew about but didn’t act on. The judge disallowed what was called the “abuse excuse” at the time, and the prosecution successfully landed the argument that they had murdered their parentsfor their inheritance, resulting in whole-life sentences without the possibility of parole.Two years later, Netflix brought out the dramatisationMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, closely followed by a documentary, The Menendez Brothers, which featured Erik and Lyle speaking from Donovan correctional cacility. They split the water-cooler crowd. Many felt that, had the brothers been tried today, with our superior understanding of abuse and how it can affect the brain and behaviour, their sentences would have been far less severe. Others still felt that given how rich the family was (their estate was worth about $14m at the time), cash was most likely the real motive; and as for the rest, the only people who could contest the charges of abuse were dead.A California judge yesterdaybrought their sentence downto 50 years to life, which makes them immediately eligible for parole since the crimes took place before they were 25. The judge framed his decision not as some post-hoc adjudication on the credibility of their abuse claims, but rather because “they’ve done enough in the past 35 years” to earn their chance at freedom. Thebrothers also saidthey have taken “full responsibility” for the murders. The interplay between true-crime drama and the judicial process is simultaneously very subtle and incredibly pronounced.View image in fullscreenErik Menendez (left) and his brother Lyle.Photograph: APDrama, whether it is based on a true story or merely a truthy one, influences outcomes all the time, and we are always freshly surprised as though it’s unprecedented. Mr Bates v the Post Office, which said nothing that hadn’talready been unearthedby media investigations, animated that injustice to such an extent that it briefly stood in for everything dishonest in faceless institutions. By the start of this year, many of the 4,000 victims of the Horizon scandal had still not been compensated, and there weremore than 2,000 new claims– so it was by no means a perfect delivery of justice via ITV, but it was still important.Of another Netflix show, Adolescence, the even more abstract claim was made that it “started the conversation” about kids today and how they relate to one another, to social media, to the world. When you look at much more concrete consequences – Ken Loach’s Cathy Come Home, in 1966, led to theestablishment of Shelterthat year and then invigorated provision of social housing in the decade after – they often stand as a dispiriting reminder that it takes more than fervent public opinion to bed in a social principle. The late Dawn Fosterwrote furiouslyin 2016 that, “We did not learn from the [drama] … Fifty years on, the government has pushed through a Housing Act that seems destined to create thousands more Cathys across the country.”Adolescence’s message has echoed around the world – but a social media ban is the wrong move | Katrina vanden HeuvelRead moreIt takes astronomical humility for the law to rethink its verdicts on the basis of what is, in essence, entertainment. A programme uncovering new evidence isn’t unheard of, but just as often what it uncovers is a paucity of existing evidence.The first season of the podcast Serial, covering the case of Adnan Syed, who was convicted in 1999 of killing his girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, helped pave the way for hisresentencing, though his conviction still stands – he has been out of prisonsince 2022. The podcast and its aftermath were a rollercoaster of mystery, outrage, triumph and disaster, so that it fell to Young Lee, Hae Min’s brother, to remind everyone: “This isn’t a podcast for me. It’s real life.” The outcome of In the Dark, about Curtis Flowers, the American tried six times for a murder he didn’t do, had a much more satisfying outcome: in 2019, a year after the podcast aired, its details in essence a grisly narrative of racial injustice, Flowerswas released, and charges against him were formally dropped the following year.Ultimately, neither Menendez documentary proved motive, and neither led to this possibility of parole. Did the chance to speak and be heard onNetflixallow the brothers eventually to voice the remorse that the judge found decisive? That would be hard to prove. But true crime, at its best, fosters curiosity in the putatively open-and-shut, empathy for the supposedly worst, and reminds us that people shouldn’t be forgotten entirely, whatever their crime. It’s an adjunct to the law, not a thorn in its side.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That isn’t trueWed 14 May 2025 07.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 11.17 EDTShareYou’ve been deceived by the campaign for assisted dying. It has told you who the proposed law is for: people on their metaphorical deathbeds, no hope in sight, desperate to spare themselves and their loved ones the experience of an agonising death. And no wonder – these cases obviously merit sympathy and concern. These are the people campaigners want to talk about; this is the narrative that pushes people into unquestioning support for their cause.But what of the people the law would include who they don’t want you to consider? Proponents keep saying that the bill is tightly drawn to exclude disabled people, because it limits eligibility to those with only six months to live. But this is patently false. The line between disability and illness – a line this bill relies on – is not a sharp distinction. It is blurry, ever-moving and dependent on social factors far more than biological ones. This knowledge complicates the simple narrative the pro campaign is reliant on.Let’s take, for example, someone with a progressive neuromuscular condition such as motor neurone disease. Prognoses for such conditions are notoriously hard to get right, and even when everything is above board, it is not uncommon for people to vastly outlive their initial life expectancy. This, it is important to recognise, does not doom them to years of misery. With the right care, including social care and appropriate pain relief, people can and do live happy lives with terminal conditions. (Of course, one of the central issues is that many people do not receive such care.) But the many people living well with “terminal” conditions have been roundly excluded from the debate, because they do not fit the narrative. Instead, we are told that being terminally ill is, quite literally, a fate worse than death. The public – and MPs – need to ask themselves if they believe the wheelchair user they see enjoying time with friends in their local cafe would really be better off dead.Here, the bill’s supporters cry out that assisted dying will be voluntary; that someone who felt they could enjoy life while terminally ill could simply choose not to die. This is, at best, a deeply naive position. Because the truth is, not everything is always above board. Society is not equal, and plenty of evidence exists that medical bias and negligence are systemic issues. It is not beyond the realm of imagination to consider that a doctor (with or without consultation with the patient; the law gives them extraordinary power) could offer up a shortened life expectancy in order to help, or indeed nudge, a patient along the road to an assisted death. Talk of how much money and resources assisted dyingcould save the NHS, along with the bill’sweak definition of coercion, only makes this horrific scenario more likely. But proponents say nothing about concerns that newly disabled or newly diagnosed people, who have not had time to process their shock or secure the help they need, could be at risk from actual or perceived pressure, because they don’t fit the narrative, either.Then there are the people you would never even think might qualify. When MPs last voted on the bill, those with concerns about safeguarding and eligibility were repeatedly told that the bill could be strengthened at committee stage, where a group of MPs would scrutinise the bill’s language and table amendments. Yet over and over, the committee voted down anything that would have tightened criteria in order to protect vulnerable people. While proponents were busy telling the public that the bill was safe and only for those for whom there was no hope of recovery, their supporters in parliamentrejected amendmentsto exclude homeless people and prisoners – some of society’s most at-risk people – from its provisions. What a surprise that they are also beyond pro campaigners’ rhetoric.Perhaps most shockingly, the committee alsovoted down an amendmentthat would have excluded anyone whose physical health is so affected by a mental health condition that it warrants a six-month prognosis – in other words, people with eating disorders so severe they might die. (Having severe anorexia, for example, is not enough to render someone incapable of decision-making under the Mental Capacity Act, and therefore they would qualify to access assisted dying.) This is obviously a horrific choice for the committee to have made. Anorexia, even at its most devastating, is not necessarily a fatal disease (but it is one, let’s not forget, that disproportionately affects young women). People get better. They go on to live full lives. Nothing about anorexia deaths is inevitable. Yet allowing people with eating disorders an assisted suicide may, in the depths of their despair, create perverse incentives to get sicker. Are these the people the pro campaign wants you to think about, or the people they talk about when they lobby MPs? No. But they matter, too.Of course, the people who are the pro campaign’s focus also deserve better from this badly designed and dangerous bill. But if we are to accurately debate it, and if we are to honestly reckon with the consequences of such a monumental change, we need to at least be completely transparent about who this bill affects. And we need to ask ourselves why it is that assisted dying campaigners aren’t being so forthcoming.Lucy Webster is a political journalist and the author ofThe View from Down Here: Life As a Young Disabled WomanExplore more on these topicsAssisted dyingOpinionDisabilityDeath and dyingEnglandWalesHouse of CommonscommentShareReuse this content"

It is a strange combination. He is not challenged by Kemi Badenoch, who is weak in parliament and irrelevant outside it. Nor is the prime minister in immediate peril from Reform, the Liberal Democrats or the Greens. They pose electoral challenges in the coming years but they can’t stop the government passing laws in the meantime. The Labour leader is not in danger from backbench rebellion. Dissenting MPs grow in number but not at the rate that presages regicide.Starmer has been dealt a tough hand in some ways. He inherited a rotten economy in a volatile world. But he also has advantages not enjoyed by many of his predecessors: a vast Commons majority, an obedient cabinet, a splintered opposition. His greatest problem isn’t a politician or party. It isn’t an industrial lobby or foreign power. It is a question, small but deeply penetrating: why?Labour has done lots of stuff, often making people cross. Winter fuel payments have been rationed; businesses have been landed with a higher national insurance bill. There have been winners, too. Junior doctors and train drivers got a pay rise to end their strikes, but trouble averted doesn’t win political friends as efficiently as pain makes enemies.It is hard for any government to earn credit forwhatthey do if voters cannot easily intuitwhythey are doing it. This is Labour’s big problem.“Why” is a deceptively simple question, containing two different concepts. It inquires into process and motive. It asks “from what cause?” and “to what purpose?” One is an explanation about the past, the other is a story about the future.For example, one answer to the question of why cut benefits is that the Tories left a£22bn budget black hole. But that doesn’t explain why it has to be winter fuel or personal independence payments. The Conservative legacy is a cause of budget choices, not a moral compass pointing to the better path.Another answer might be that the benefits bill is a poor use of public money, going to people who don’t need it or could replace it with wages if only they would work harder. But if that is the argument, the Conservative legacy loses its potency. If there are savings to be made anyway, and that’s the right thing to do, why blame it on the black hole?It should be possible to recognise that there are perverse incentives that need ironing out of the benefits system, while also striving not to drive vulnerable people into destitution. But that is an agenda to reform the state, not shrink it under fiscal duress. So which is it? It is hard to sound authentic in defence of a policy when your party’s core economic argument and its collective body language all scream reluctance and queasy compulsion.The same problem now arises with Labour’s immigration policy. Starmer has declared that he wants to bring net migration down. Why?One answer is that voters say they want it and will back Nigel Farage if they don’t get it. The prime minister insists that isn’t the reason. In a speech launching animmigration white paperon Monday, he rejected any suggestion that government policy was about “this or that strategy, targeting these voters, responding to that party”.That wouldn’t need saying if his audience found it easy to imagine less cynical motives. But if we take Starmer at his word, what does he say is the reason for this particular set of policies?The argument is that the Tories ran an open-door policy, importing workers to do jobs that might otherwise have been done by British citizens. That the domestic workforce lacked the skills to do those jobs was also a symptom of Conservative neglect. The influx of foreigners undermined social cohesion. Without reversing these trends, Britain risks becoming“an island of strangers”, the prime minister said. The damage already done is “incalculable”.The proposed remedy is to stem the flow of migrants. The shortfall in workers will be supplied from a glut of millions who are classified as“economically inactive”in labour market data, but capable of work (or will soon be deemed as such by the Department for Work and Pensions).The gap in skills will be mended with funding from higher levies charged on businesses that request visas for migrant workers. Employers that want to bring in foreigners must also have an approved plan to boost the capabilities of domestic workers.There is a dubious simplicity in a labour market equation that neatly cancels out net migration with re-activated benefits claimants.Assuming the switch is even possible it is gargantuan in scope – a fundamental reconfiguration of the way Britain works. The white paper concedes, with unintentional bathos, that the process “will take time to establish”.It doesn’t acknowledge the cost. The Home Office could turn off the visa taps and hope for a miracle in the domestic jobs market before the NHS, social care and other services are crippled by staff shortages. More likely, the Treasury will intervene, insisting that the transition be incremental enough to keep the economic wheels turning. Net migration will come down –it is falling already– but not with such tangible demographic effect that voters will notice a change in the national complexion and thank Starmer for it.If the harm done by the Tories was “incalculable”, how will Labour calculate the reduction in harm after just a few years of running its own marginally less permissive regime? The lurid rhetoric that was chosen to define the motive behind the white paper – answering the question ofwhyStarmer is doing this – guarantees that it will be judged a failure by the very people to whom that language is addressed.And yet most of the actual policy could have been presented with the opposite inflection. The emphasis could have been on Britain’s historical record of successfully integrating migrant communities and the vast economic and cultural contribution they have made. The argument that unmanaged borders undermine confidence in government and put community cohesion at risk could still be made. So might the case for rebalancing the labour market.But there is a way to narrate those issues as a confrontation with cynical opportunists who revel in division and foment mutual suspicion. Immigration reform could be sold in terms that demolish the economic illiteracy of parties whose business model is burning bridges and turning neighbours into strangers. Labour could still talk about rules, fairness and border control, but make it a challenge to Farage instead of a tribute to him.But that would be out of character for a prime minister who has reached the top by swerving hard choices, flinching from difficult debates. His method has worked. It iswhyhe is prime minister, but only in one sense of the word. It is the reason for his victory, not the purpose.The lack of that second part, a better answer to the questionwhyStarmer is prime minister, explains how he has come to look so constrained, even with parliament at his command; beleaguered when his enemies are divided. It defines the strange spectacle of the unchallenged leader who besieged himself.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinionMigrationKeir StarmerLabourEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

Is anyone still there for last orders?Adrian ChilesI couldn’t find a single pub that stayed open late for VE Day last week. No wonder when they’re so often empty by 11pmWed 14 May 2025 11.35 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 13.11 EDTShareThere was a time when I never left a pub before last orders. Whether or not I was enjoying myself – and on reflection I often wasn’t – I’d be in there until the bitter end. I think this is because, having spent most of my teenage years desperately seeking pubs prepared to serve me, once I was in there, even after I’d turned 18, I was going to make the most of it.A while ago, an old friend was back in the area. We met at our teenage haunt – the Station Inn, West Hagley, since you ask. It was great to see him. But come 9.30pm there was a general feeling it was time to call it a night, and off we went. And I realised I couldn’t remember the last time I’d stayed out late enough to hear last orders called.I took this to be a sad, if not unhealthy, sign of my advancing years. But I’m starting to wonder if it’s not just me. Once upon a time a pub wasn’t really a pub if it didn’t stay open until 11pm. These days, many a pub calls it a night an hour or two earlier if trade is quiet. Last Thursday, to markVE Day, pubs were allowed to stay open until 1am. Announcing the move last month, our prime minister said, “Keeping our pubs open for longer will give people the opportunity to join in celebrations and raise a glass to all of the men and women who served their country, both overseas and at home.”Back in the day, I’d have been bang up for this. As it was, not only did I know I’d not be taking part, neither could I imagine many pubs or their patrons doing so either. Yes, I know lots of people don’t go in to work on Fridays, making Thursday the new Friday etc, but I still couldn’t see it. Something has changed. It was almost as if the PM had made a nice-sounding announcement that, in practice, would have little or no impact.My big ambition? To have a pint in each of Ireland’s 32 counties | Adrian ChilesRead moreI asked around the pubs near me and was met with shrugs and shakes of heads. I didn’t find one that opened late last week. In my local they didn’t even know it had been an option. I cast around for a landlord elsewhere and remembered a lost Saturday afternoon in a pub in Brighton, back in the deep midwinter of January. The Station Hotel – another “Station”; weird that – is next to Preston Park station. It’s worth a visit if you’re in the area because a) it’s a really nice place and b) for added interest Steve the landlord also works as a professional John Terry lookalike, which is exactly the kind of randomly intriguing stuff you come across having random conversations in random pubs. It’s what pubs are for.I called him up and asked him if he’d stayed open late on Thursday. He hadn’t. Had he even considered it? He hadn’t. He said there would have been no point – no demand for it any more. I asked him what had changed. “Covid, mate,” said Steve. “Everything changed during Covid.” His view is that many pub-goers stopped going to pubs, and younger people don’t drink like they used to. And then there’s his rising overheads, employment costs, the NI increase and so on. He’ll be fine, I’m sure. He’s tackling these challenges with the determination of, well, John Terry at his best.I called up my old haunt, the Station Inn, West Hagley. Did they open late last Thursday? “Nah, mate.” Did anyone else round there? “Don’t think so.” No bad thing, I suppose, as long it’s not a sign, a portent of doom, that pubs’ days are numbered.To do my bit, I’m going back there soon, determined to make it all the way to closing time. As long as I get a nap in first, I think I’ll be fine.

After all, the president’s primary domestic policy deputy, Elon Musk, gained his position in the administration more or less by purchasing it: he is the richest man in the world, and the primary funder of Trump’s last presidential campaign, and it is seemingly by this virtue – does he have any others? – that Musk has been granted the authority to dismantle large swaths of the federal bureaucracy.This is something of a pattern for Donald Trump. In his first term, it became de rigueur for foreign dignitaries tostay at Trump’s hotelon trips to Washington, a practice long perceived to be a way of currying favor with the president by spending money at his businesses. Trump funneled money to his hotel business from domestic sources, too: when Secret Service agents were required to stay at Trump’s hotels, they werecharged exorbitant rates– including after he left office. Before their recent worldwide jaunt making deals with foreign governments and businesses that willfinancially benefit their father– including plans for a major new golf course in Qatar, built in partnership with a company controlled by the royal family – Trump’s sons launched$Trump, a cryptocurrency coin – that ever-popular scheme of shameless millennial grifters.Foreign powers, major businesses and wealthy individuals whose interests might be affected by Trump administration policy have all rushed to invest, a not-so-subtle way of ingratiating themselves to the president with money. Last month, Trump announced that the biggest investors in the scheme could meet with him personally, either at one of his clubs or at the White House: a literal auction of access to the president. His ear is for sale to the highest bidder.This kind of behavior from the Trump administration has gone on for so long that it is hard to rouse the media to attention to cover it. Their standards for the ethical conduct of politicians – or, at least, of Republicans – have lowered so dramatically that it’s hard to tell if they have any. Personal enrichment by politicians is no longer treated as a scandal, a state of affairs that’s been helped along not only by how pervasive corruption has become, but by the US supreme court’s repeated and dramatic efforts to narrow federal anti-bribery statutes and the longstanding non-enforcement of the constitution’s emoluments clause.Amid this non-response to influence peddling and back-scratching more broadly, it is sometimes difficult to get Americans to notice just how flagrantly their president is on the take. If Trump has been selling access and influence for years – if he has not divested from his companies, which are now supposedly run by his sons, and continues to profit from the largesse of billionaires foreign and domestic, is it really a story that he still does so now?And so it is a testament to the brazenness and almost cartoonish excess, of Trump’s dealings that one of them has gained so much coverage: his willingness to accept a$400m luxury 747 plane, decked out so lavishly that it has been called a “palace in the sky”, from the royal family of Qatar.The plane, Trump says, is a gift. “It’s a great gesture from Qatar. I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer,” he told reporters. Trump has long bemoaned what he considers the inadequate state of the two aircraft that currently serve as Air Force One; he has been angling for a fancier plane since his first term. As that has been slow to materialize, the Qataris appear to have stepped in with an alternative: they will give Trump a “palace in the sky” to serve as Air Force One, and the plane would then be transferred, after he leaves office, to his presidential library.The mainstream media has been reluctant to name this exchange as a bribe. After all, Trump insists that the aircraft is being gifted to him, in exchange for nothing. “The Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE,” he wrote on social media. Responding to suggestions that he pay for the plane to avoid the appearance of impropriety, he countered, “Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!!”Later, in an interview with the New York Times’ Maggie Haberman, Trump elaborated further: “I mean, I could be a stupid person say, ‘No, we don’t want a free, very expensive airplane.’ But it was – I thought it was a great gesture.” He went on to explain that he does indeed believe that the “gift” of the airplane is a recognition of his own stance toward Qatar, which has changed dramatically since he called the nation a sponsor of terror and endorsed a regional blockade during his first term. “I think it was a gesture because of the fact that we help,” he said of Qatar. “If it wasn’t for us, they probably wouldn’t exist right now.”What is remarkable about the plane episode is not just Trump’s willingness to accept a lavish gift from another state, but the impotence and indifference of Congress and the judiciary to punish him for it.To accept a gift from a foreign government is a plain violation of the unambiguous text of the constitution. That the US supreme court has made federal anti-bribery laws nearly impossible to prosecute has made a legal response to this kind of behavior even harder. That Congress – controlled by a Republican majority more interested in benefiting from Trump’s largesse than in checking his excesses or asserting their own constitutional prerogatives – is both unable and unwilling to stop him does not change it either. Trump will get away with his plane stunt: we know he will, because the constitutional checks on his power have been made deliberately useless. But no one should be confused about what he is doing.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

That was a rhetorical question, because you’re coming with me immediately to the far depths of TikTok, where there is a furious argument raging about a hypothetical transatlantic brawl. Riffing on an onlinedebate about whether 100 men or a single gorilla would win in a fight, someone posted a viral video asking: “100 British people v 100 Americans. One big room. No weapons. Who’s winning?”Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueI have not conducted a thorough analysis of the answers, but from my cursory glance it would seem the consensus is the Americans would win. For science’s sake I polled a real-life American (my wife), and her opinion, largely based on the whole 1776 thing, was also that there would be a US victory. “We just care more about winning,” she told me (a Brit). The country certainly has a funny way of showing that right now.The citizen science doesn’t stop there. To add another data point, I asked ChatGPT its opinion. Alas, ChatGPT also told me it thought Americans had the edge, but it did note Brits have “a high tolerance for physical discomfort”. Which is true. Turn off the air-conditioning, or make them drink room-temperature water or use a crunchyair-dried towel, and the Americans would surrender immediately.Anyway, I think we should just settle the argument with a real-life match. You know how creepy tech billionaire Peter Thiel wants to set up theEnhanced Games– a drug-friendly Olympics? I think he should scrap that and set up an Unhinged Games, in which random people are called up, jury duty/Hunger Games style, to work through ridiculous thought experiments. Think of all the national pride and unity you could conjure up with events like “Can 100 British football hooligans out-mayhem 100Philadelphia Eagles fans?” or “Can68 million Britsout-drink 330 million Americans in beer?”Frankly, I think it’s a genius idea.

Thankfully, jurors last week cleared the 45-year-old ofillegally terminating her pregnancy. But more than four years of police and criminal proceedings have had a lasting impact on a woman already traumatised by discovering that she was 26 weeks pregnant, not about 10, when she acted. The trial dragged her private life – even her sexual preferences – into the public eye. Understandably, she called it “humiliating”. But it is prosecutors who should feel shame.Ms Packer was prescribed abortion pills in a remote consultation, due to a Covid lockdown. Prosecutors alleged that she deliberately breached the abortion time limit. Jurors believed Ms Packer, who said that she was horrified to realise how advanced her pregnancy was when she saw the foetus and that she “wouldn’t have put the baby or myself through it” had she known.Her case is an extreme one, but part of a growing trend. About 100 women are believed to have been investigated for possible illegal abortions in the last five years, with five cases coming to court in 2023. Before then, only three women were thought to have been prosecuted since abortion was made illegal in 1861.The judgment of the CPS was appalling. But the underlying issue is the criminalisation of abortion. The 1967 Abortion Act did not repeal the Victorian law but created exemptions under set conditions, leading to the wide availability of the procedure. Theremote prescriptionof pills for early abortions has more recently expanded access. Many campaigners and politicians have been reluctant to re-open the abortion issue for fear the debate could be exploited and lead to reduced availability, for example through pressure to lower the term limit, now 24 weeks apart from in exceptional circumstances. Abortion’s legality, and the conditions of its availability, are distinct though related issues. But the surge in investigations, along with the influx of money and influence from anti-abortion activists invigorated by their triumph in the US, have persuaded many people that legislative change is now necessary.Medical opinion hasswung decisivelybehind decriminalisation. More than 30 organisations – including the British Medical Association and the royal colleges of midwives, obstetricians and gynaecologists, nurses and GPs – have condemned the “trauma and cruelty” caused by the law and said that abortion should be simply a healthcare matter. In Canada, whereabortion has been legal for more than three decades, rates have been stable and the proportion of later abortions has fallen. Criminalising the rare women who obtain abortions after the term limit, often vulnerable individuals in difficult circumstances, is unlikely to deter such cases. But it may deter them – and other women who have acted near the term limit or havemiscarried naturally– from seeking medical help.MPs have already decriminalised abortion in Northern Ireland. In coming weeks, they havethe opportunity to do so in the rest of the UK, thanks to two amendments tabled to the policing bill by Labour backbenchers. The first, from Tonia Antoniazzi, has widespread backing, including from more than 50 MPs across parties. Stella Creasy believes heralternative amendmentwould ensure that decriminalisation did not open the door to abortion access being tightened via secondary legislation in future. MPs may well be concerned, however, that it raises constitutional issues, and this additional complexity could deter them from backing change. The choice between two amendments, introduced with the best intentions, must not hole the campaign for decriminalisation. MPs must coalesce to push through change. There must be no more Nicola Packers.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The president has discussed trade, investment and defence. But the boundary between statecraft and self-aggrandisement is blurred. To honour the US president, the government of Qatar has  offered him a Boeing 747 aircraft. This “flying palace”, worth around $400m, would serve as a substitute for Air Force One as Mr Trump’s personal jumbo.The US constitutionexplicitly forbidsanyone holding a government office from accepting any “present, emolument, office or title” from foreign powers without congressional consent. White House lawyers, obedient to their master, say the Qatari jet doesn’t cross that line.Accepting gifts from foreign regimes is not the worst constitutional violation committed by theTrump administration. The contempt for due process and rule of law in cases where innocent Americans have been abducted and deported for unproven and spurious immigration offences is more alarming.But corrosion of civil rights and flouting rules of financial propriety are symptoms of the same condition. Mr Trump doesn’t believe in submission to rules of any kind. He recognises no distinction between business conducted in the White House and deals done at Mar-a-Lago. On the eve of his inauguration, Mr Trump launched a crypto asset, $TRUMP, literally monetising the presidency. Last month, it was announced that the top 220 holders of the coin would beinvited to dinnerwith the president.Previous occupants of the Oval Office sold investments or set them aside in blind trusts. Mr Trump’s business empire, managed by his sons, operates as before, except with the added commercial privileges that accrue to association with the most powerful man on Earth.Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, runs a private equity company that mostly deals with the state-backed investment funds of Gulf states that Mr Trump is visiting this week.Theconflicts of interestare so densely woven that it is difficult to separate the presidency from the commercial ambitions of the presidential entourage. That is a defining feature of state capture in regimes that lack democratic safeguards and where law enforcement is incapable of policing corruption. It is an affront to the principle that public office should be sought with a view to advancing public interest, not exploited for personal enrichment. It is the mark of a kleptocracy.That is not incompatible with the more ideological side of Mr Trump’s project – the promise to make America great again. The president sees himself as a champion of the American people – an incarnation of a national will – so his soaring wealth is synonymous with collective greatness. But if ordinary Americans do notfeel themselves enriched, they will turn resentful, perhaps wanting regime change, at which point the president may feel threatened by democracy and seek to disarm it.This is the cycle of authoritarianism permitting corruption, which in turn feeds more authoritarianism. Plenty of dysfunctional states have exhibited this pattern before, but rarely has it been displayed on a scale and a stage as vast as those available to a US president.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Anyone with an ounce of common sense could see the potential for the International Football Association Board’s offside protocols in the era of the video assistant referee (VAR) system to cause serious injury. Needless collisions are inexcusable. It should not have been allowed to reach the point where we are wondering whether Nottingham Forest’s Taiwo Awoniyibeing placed in an induced comawill act as a red flag for the authorities.Injuries happen. What is not acceptable is the safety of players being compromised as a result of technology warping the game and officials being instructed not to flag for offside if a goalscoring opportunity is on the cards. Thankfully, he was reported to have woken from his coma on Wednesday evening.Taiwo Awoniyi set to be brought out of induced coma after surgeryRead moreThe hope is that the sight of Awoniyi colliding with a post and suffering a serious abdominal injury during an attack that should never have been allowed to unfold duringForest’s 2-2 draw with Leicester last Sundaywill finally shake some sense into people.It is worth pointing out, of course, that Sian Massey-Ellis, who was running the line at the City Ground, was not at fault when she chose not to raise her flag when Anthony Elanga ran past the Leicester defence at the start of the move and crossed for Awoniyi. Elanga looked offside to the naked eye but these days officials are told to wait.The logic is that it is better to allow a move to play out and leave it to VAR to verify whether someone has strayed offside. The thinking is sound at a superficial level: in theory the law, brought in for the 2020-21 season, guards against goals being chalked off when someone was half a yard onside, rewarding attacking play, and means that nobody can complain about the unknown consequences of moves being brought to a premature halt by an incorrect offside flag.But the sweeping application of the law opens up officials to accusations that the fear of making a mistake has become too great. It seems that the smooth running of VAR, which looks increasingly impossible in a sport as dynamic as football, is a bigger priority than player safety and the quality of the spectacle.Few things about the modern game are more frustrating than watching play continue even when the offside is clear and obvious. The effect is artificial, a kind of non-football being allowed to unfold while an attack develops in hesitant fashion. I shared Pep Guardiola’s irritation when he erupted on the touchline after such an incident duringManchester City’s win against Chelsea last August.Everyone inside Stamford Bridge could see that Nicolas Jackson had mistimed his run. So much energy was wasted. The crowd’s excitement at Chelsea scoring wasn’t real. City’s defenders should not have been made to scramble back to keep the ball out of their net. Jackson’s teammates should not have been sprinting forward to support him.View image in fullscreenThe moment the ball is played, with Anthony Elanga (left) clearly offside.Photograph: BBC SportView image in fullscreenAn arm goes up for offside.Photograph: BBC SportView image in fullscreenElanga makes a run on to the ball.Photograph: BBC SportTaiwo Awoniyi clatters into the post after attempting to meet Elanga’s cross under pressure from Facundo Buonanotte.Photograph: BBC SportThere is a feeling within the game that this application of the offside law has contributed to the rise in hamstring injuries in the Premier League. It is not ideal that defenders playing in high lines are repeatedly having to turn and set off on a series of unnecessary explosive runs. Defenders, managers and fans have every reason to complain when the flag eventually goes up.Awoniyi is not the first to suffer. City’s Ederson and John Stones picked up injuries in similar circumstances last season. There should have been a reaction. Footballers are taught to play to the whistle. It does not matter if a defender knows that the attacker has been caught offside. There is no option but to play on if the flag stays down. There is always a chance of the offside trap malfunctioning and the goal being allowed to stand. But the uncertainty helps no one. Elanga was clearly offside. Play continued and Leicester’s Facundo Buonanotte had to track back to help out. Buonanotte was involved in the challenge that led to Awoniyi’s injury.It is the latest example of how the desire to use VAR to turn refereeing into a precise science is causing more problems than it solves. At the 2018 World Cup, when the technology was first used at a major tournament, the protocol was for assistant referees to keep the flag down for tight offsides. That makes sense. Some offsides are impossibly difficult to call. Leaving aside whether chalking off a goal for a toenail offside is in alignment with the original spirit of the law, as long as VAR exists there is a benefit to letting some moves play out before taking a closer look at a replay.Yet football is a game of collisions and fast movements. Its appeal lies in its imperfect lines, its shades of grey. We need to be mature enough to accept that human error is part of the game. It is time to be more flexible and allow assistant referees to raise the flag if they think they have seen a clear offside. And if that leads to teams missing out on goals that might have been? Better to have that than the constant stoppages and the increased risk of injury. Football is supposed to be fluid and chaotic. Attempting to turn it into an exact science, all clean and clinical, is out of touch. Awoniyi’s injury is a reminder of the sport’s ability to ruin even the best-laid plans.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestLeicester CityRefereesVideo assistant referees (VARs)Laws of footballcommentShareReuse this content"

The day before, Carlo Ancelotti had talked about the many wonderful comebacks over his years atReal Madrid, moments he said would never be forgotten, and now here in his penultimate game in this stadium was another, 20-year-old centre-back Jacobo Ramón scoring with the last touch of the game to defeat Real Mallorca and keep the league title alive for another day at least.It came late, very late on a grey, wet Wednesday night in front of perhaps 30,000 empty seats, with a manager whose departure was announced two days earlier and a dozen players missing. Ultimately it may not matter and it arrived at the end of an evening that had often felt empty. Yet now it was full of noise, it meant the world to Ramón and for a moment everyone could just go wild, the defender’s strike in the 95th minute and Kylian Mbappé’s goal a quarter of an hour earlier overturning Martin Valjent’s 11th-minute opener.Ten transfer targets for Premier League clubs from across EuropeRead moreThat leaves Madrid four points behind Barcelona, with two games to play and Barça with three. While Ancelotti insisted “anything can happen in football” the reality is that it also leaves them more or less where they were, waiting for the end after the league was effectively concluded whenBarcelona won Sunday’sclásico. If Barcelona win against Espanyol on Thursday night the end will come within 24 little hours; if not, Hansi Flick’s side would still have two more chances to get three more points.The statements will follow immediately. Madrid will at last officially announce what the Brazilian Football Confederation already has: thatAncelotti is the leaving for theSeleção. Then they will confirm another open secret: that Xabi Alonso is his replacement. And then attention will turn elsewhere, or it would do if it hadn’t already. All of which made this a strange occasion that at times felt like what it was: a game too far, hearts no longer in it. One where there were still tickets on sale at kick-off for the first time this season, hope abandoned.Those that came were rewarded eventually; there had been grumbles, some timid whistles, frustration, but there ended up being a rebellion, pride, Madrid racking up 39 shots, and a final explosion. An unexpected hero, too. A pair of them in fact.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé (left) celebrates his equaliser for Real Madrid by high-fiving Jacobo Ramón, who would go on to score the winner.Photograph: Susana Vera/ReutersOther, more familiar names missed out. Dani Carvajal, Éder Militão and David Alaba have missed much of the season. Antonio Rüdiger, suspended after throwing ice at the referee in theCopa del Rey final defeatby Barcelona, had surgery. Eduardo Camavinga had torn a muscle. And then came what you could be forgiven for thinking was an outbreak ofseason’s-over-itis. Lucas Vázquez and Vinícius Júnior were injured in theclásico. Rodrygo walked out for training on Tuesday morning and then walked back in again. On the morning of this game, Andriy Lunin pulled out. In the afternoon, so too did Brahim Díaz. Aurélien Tchouaméni was suspended.Madrid were left with 10 first-team players and one of those is the strange case of Jesús Vallejo, the footballer who had been on the bench for 43 games and on the pitch for one, disastrous, 10-minute cameo. Here, he got on again and provided the assist at death – the first of his entire career.Quick GuideBologna win first major trophy for 51 yearsShowDan Ndoye's second-half strike earned Bologna a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Milan in the Coppa Italia final on Wednesday to secure their first major trophy in 51 years.Bologna got the breakthrough eight minutes after the restart when Milan defender Théo Hernandez's well-timed tackle on Riccardo Orsolini sent the ball rolling to an unmarked Ndoye, who calmly slotted it home from close range.The victory earned Bologna their first piece of major silverware since they won the same competition in 1974 and secured qualification for next season's Europa League.The match was a thrilling replay of Friday's Serie A encounter, where Milan triumphed with a dominant 3-1 victory on home turf.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.No one could ever have imagined that, although the night could have started well when Arda Guler sent Endrick running right through the middle after just two minutes, only to be denied by Leo Román, making the first of a dozen stops.

Dani Ceballos was unable to cut out a pass from Mateu Morey on the right and Valjent swung his left foot to send the ball past Thibaut Courtois.Madrid’s reaction was timid at first but gathered pace, the shot count rising and Román providing to be a formidable barrier. He made saves from Jude Bellingham, Luka Modric, Mbappé and Fede Valverde in the first half and carried on the same way in the second, resisting until the 68th minute, when Mbappé escaped Morey and Valjent with a combination of elegance and strength and hit a superb near-post finish to put Madrid level with his 28th league goal, his 40th in all competitions.The hosts kept coming, an occasion made of this.

I dreamed as a child of becoming the best player in the world and winning all the majors. I’ve done that. Everything beyond this, for however long I decide to play the game competitively, is a bonus.”Every McIlroy interview now reflects upon Masters Sunday, when he fell to the ground amid moving scenes after securing a playoff success over Justin Rose. McIlroy’s triumph has reverberated way beyond sport.“I’ve tried not to watch it a lot because I want to remember the feelings,” said McIlroy of his immediate celebration. “I’ve talked about this before, but I think when I rewatch a lot of things back, I then just remember the visuals of the TV rather than what I was feeling and what I was seeing through my own eyes. So I haven’t tried to watch it back too much. But anytime I have, I well up. I still feel like I want to cry.“It was an involuntary. I’ve never felt a release like that before and I might never feel a release like that again. That could be a once-in-a-lifetime thing and it was a very cool moment.”Bryson DeChambeau, who played in McIlroy’s company during the final round at Augusta, rather pointedly stated that the champion did not speak with him on the course. The American, who may well also be in theUS PGAmix, had slumped to a closing 75 for a share of fifth.“I don’t know what he was expecting,” McIlroy said. “We’re trying to win the Masters. I’m not going to try to be his best mate out there.“Look, everyone approaches the game in different ways. I was focused on myself and what I needed to do. That’s really all that it was. It wasn’t anything against him. It was just I felt that’s what I needed to do to try to get the best out of myself that day.”View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy watches his tee shot on the 2nd hole during a practice round for the US PGA at the Quail Hollow.Photograph: George Walker IV/APIt is telling – and deliberate – that McIlroy will not publicly set more professional targets. He is now within one, say, of Nick Faldo’s major haul of six. Faldo’s tally is the highest by a European.“I think everyone saw how hard having a north star is and being able to get over the line,” he said. “If I can just try to get the best out of myself each and every week, I know what my abilities are. I know the golf that I can play. If I keep turning up and just trying to do that each and every week, especially in these four big ones a year, I know that I’ll have my chances.If I keep turning up and just trying to do that each and every week, especially in these four big ones a year, I know that I’ll have my chances.“I’ve always said I’m never going to put a number on it. I’ve talked about trying to become the best European ever or the best international player ever or whatever that is. The numbers tell one story, but it mightn’t be the full story.“I feel like I sort of burdened myself with the career grand slam stuff and I want to enjoy this. I want to enjoy what I’ve achieved and I want to enjoy the last decade or whatever of my career. I don’t want to burden myself by numbers or statistics. I just want to go and try to play the best golf I can.”McIlroy’s chances in Charlotte appear to increase with every falling raindrop. Quail Hollow has been battered by precipitation since Friday, meaning McIlroy’s distance and accuracy with driver in hand should be extra valuable. In 13 Quail Hollow starts, McIlroy has posted nine top 10s. His score to par over that period is 102 under.“I think early in my career that these conditions favoured me more,” McIlroy explained. “But I believe that Pinehurst [at the US Open] last year favoured me. I believe that firm conditions favour me. I believe that any conditions that we play in, I have the abilities and I have the skill set to excel.”McIlroy was stern-faced when asked if there was any element of his game he would swap with another player in this sport. “I wouldn’t trade,” said the 36-year-old. He has no apparent need to either.Explore more on these topicsUS PGARory McIlroyPGA TourEuropean TourGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Alcaraz did not merely intend to win, as he does in every match, he desperately wanted to exact his revenge on an opponent who has positioned himself as one of his biggest challengers.Alcaraz achieved those aims with ruthless efficiency, piecing together some of his best tennis of the season at the end of two tough sets to stop the fifth seed Draper’s excellent run and reach the semi-finals of the Italian Open with a 6-4, 6-4 win.The first four months of this season have presented numerous difficulties for Alcaraz, the third seed in Rome, particularly as the sport has looked towards him in the absence of Jannik Sinner. This excellent performance was further evidence that the 22‑year‑old,a champion in Monte Carloat the beginning of the clay season, is finding his best level again. “It probably was one of the most complete matches that I played this year,” Alcaraz said.From early positivity to cursing on court: how the Djokovic-Murray partnership ended | Tumaini CarayolRead moreFor Draper, who fought hard until the end but struggled with his composure in crucial moments, the defeat closes out another great tournament that will be invaluable in the 23‑year‑old Briton’s development as a top player and a clay-court contender. Still, he was bitterly frustrated with his level and mental composure in the match.“I’m very disappointed with the way I performed,” he said. “I think from a mental and emotional point of view, obviously you could say: ‘That’s normal, you had a tough four weeks now.’ But I don’t want to be normal. I want to be right up there. It hurts a lot, this kind of loss.”Two months ago Alcaraz and Draper faced each other in the Indian Wells semi‑finals;a tense, turbulent matchthat Draper won en route to his first career ATP Masters 1000 title. Alcaraz’s state of mind going into the match was in some ways even more surprising than the actual result. He later admitted that he had been enduring suffocating nerves because of the challenge Draper presented.“I remember Indian Wells was really difficult for me, the whole day before the match dealing with the nerves,” Alcaraz said. “It was really stressful. Today I approached the match in a different way, which I’m really proud about. I just tried to show my best tennis from the first point until the last point.”Up against by far the toughest clay-court opponent of his career in the reigning French Open and Monte Carlo champion, Draper started well and took a 4-2 lead after a loose service game from Alcaraz. But Alcaraz responded immediately with a fine return game, which freed him up. He ended the set in supreme form, opening up his vast toolbox of shots as he dominated the baseline with his spectacular forehand, peppered the Briton with well-measured drop shots and closed down the net confidently.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz celebrates after winning his quarter-final match against Britain’s Jack Draper.Photograph: Yves Herman/ReutersAlthough Alcaraz was brilliant – his forehand was sublime in the decisive moments – Draper’s disappointment was understandable. At the end of two competitive sets, after particularly generating numerous opportunities in set two, he lost his composure and focus when he most needed it, allowing Alcaraz to bulldoze him at the end of both sets. As he reflected on his performance, Draper said that he feels the pain of defeats even more now that he understands his capabilities.“As I’ve got better, it hurts more because I know I can do so well. For instance today, I feel like I’m much better than that from a lot of standards, just from a mental and emotional side of the match. At the same time that’s what the best players in the world do, they make you feel like that.”The high standards Draper demands from himself are precisely what will drive him to even greater heights, but with time and distance from this result he should also be able to reflect on the significance of this breakthrough. He arrived in the clay-court season simply trying to find his feet on the surface and he has played top‑level tennis, following up his Madrid final with a Rome quarter-final.As a result, Draper will head to Paris next week for the French Open as a top-five player at a grand slam tournament for the first time in his career and he has shown to himself and the entire tour that he is capable of deep runs on all surfaces. There will also be plenty more opportunities in the future for him to execute the revenge he now seeks.“Carlos was the better player,” he said. “I have to accept that, go back to the drawing board, really prepare well for the French Open and know that I’m hopefully going to have many more chances against these great players.”Explore more on these topicsTennisCarlos AlcarazJack DrapernewsShareReuse this content"

I have a clear idea what to do. I understand the problems of the team. I am far from quitting.“What I am saying is we need to perform and this season and in the future we need to perform or else they [the executive] will change us. That is a normal thing. That was my feeling [after West Ham] and is still my feeling today.”United face Tottenhamin next Wednesday’s final and Amorim has paid for 30 of his backroom staff to take their families to the showpiece at Athletic Bilbao’s San Mamés Stadium after learning that the club will not pay for them. He explained this was related to Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting. This has included the club’s largest minority shareholder making up to 450 redundancies when the last round is executed.“The situation is simple,” Amorim said. “People are leaving, a lot of change in the staff. It is complicated for the club to start giving to other members of staff so it is a really hard position. That situation was explained and in that moment my reaction was to help. It is not going to change my life.”If Spurs are beaten, United will qualify for next season’s Champions League. But Amorim admits this has him torn as the team will have less time to train, yet if they lose and do not have Champions League football and the results remain bad this will increase the pressure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Spurs have confirmed the setback, which came after Ange Postecoglou raised fears on Monday about the attacking midfielder’s involvement in the final.Kulusevski was forced off in the 19th minute of the Premier League homedefeat by Crystal Palaceon Sunday, and Postecoglou said the player was still sore 24 hours later and everybody had their fingers crossed for him.The 25-year-old’s absence against United is a significant blow given his fine form for much of the season and how Postecoglou is without his other main option for the No 10 role, James Maddison, who also has a knee injury. The manager has said previously that another midfielder, Lucas Bergvall, is likely to be out for the rest of the season with an ankle issue.Postecoglou’s remaining options in midfield are Rodrigo Bentancur, Yves Bissouma, Pape Sarr and Archie Gray.Kulusevski, Spurs’ standout player over the first half of the season, missed a little more than six weeks after hurting an ankle at the end of February. But Postecoglou felt the Swede had shown signs of a return to form last Thursday in the Europa League semi‑final second-leg winat Bodø/Glimtand in the early running against Palace.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

This is St Martin’s AC, a quintessential community club hidden down the narrowest of side roads on the island of Guernsey. Hanging proudly in a frame above the club’s bar is a No 4 shirt bearing the name: “Le Tiss”.Asthe Manchester United captainenters her old clubhouse to greet former teammates, they immediately exchange banter. Maya Le Tissier is back home among those who saw her grow up from a toddler kicking a ball around to a 23-year-old who will, on Sunday, lead her team out at Wembley.WSL 2024-25 season review: our writers’ best and worstRead more“I owe everything to the island and my support network,” Le Tissier says, looking out across the St Martin’s pitch where she used to play in a hugely talented midfield alongside the Bournemouth men’s player Alex Scott. “It’s not quite Old Trafford, but coming here is just as special.”The match that changed her life was not actually played on the island; it came at Southampton’s training centre in Marchwood. It was a game she was not originally meant to play. A 10-year-old Le Tissier had accompanied her dad to watch his boys’ academy side face Southampton.“She came on the trip with her boots in her bag, carrying the drinks for the lads. We had about four injuries so we were down a player and Maya said: ‘Can I go on and play?’ and we said: ‘Yes, of course,’” recalls Rob Jones, a family friend and former coach of Le Tissier. “At the end of the game, the Southampton coaches said: ‘Who is that girl? She’s amazing.’ From that moment she sort of had an epiphany, realising how good she was.”Jones is speaking in the cafe at Guernsey’s immaculate, newly built stadium, Victoria Park, where he is the stadium director, and where Le Tissier is helping out with a youth session before making the youngsters’ days with signed balls and selfies. She is greeted like a big celebrity. Some of the youngsters had been on the same flight as her the night before, having gone to watch her play at Old Trafford in the Manchester derby. When she was their age, though, she was in a boys’ team.View image in fullscreenLe Tissier has a close connection with St Martins AC, where she cut her teeth as a player.Photograph: Ben Fiore/The Guardian“In Guernsey football, there was no pathway for girls at the time, 12, 13 years ago,” Jones says. “There was girls’ kickaround stuff on Sunday mornings but she was far too good for that. Playing with the boys is where she got her steel, determination and willpower. She read the game really well and, physically, she was stronger than the lads at 11, 12. She was not afraid to get stuck in.”With a population of around 64,000, in Guernsey, footballers who “make it” are rare. Tell a taxi driver you are here to interview a footballer and they ask: “Maya or Matt?” The Lionesses defender is not a direct relation to the former Southampton forward. The surname Le Tissier, deriving from the old French word for weaver, is common here.To call the island peaceful would be an understatement. Cars are often left unlocked. On the day of our visit, the worst offence reported in the local newspaper was a man urinating in public. With its charming coves, it is easy to see why Le Tissier loves to return, training at St Martins AC to keep fit when she is home for Christmas.She was coached by her dad, Darren, from the age of four, enjoying huge success alongside Scott – who was a year younger but so skilful he was playing up an age group – but she would eventually leave the island to pursue her career, a decision she says was “easy”.“That’s all I wanted to do. I think my family found it hard, with me leaving at quite a young age, but hopefully they can see that it all played out well. I wanted to create a pathway, because no one had ever done it before me in the women’s game from Guernsey, to show people they can break through.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Later the same year, still aged 16, she made her senior debut. Her proud dad, who can still recall the Rudimental and Jess Glynne songs that were playing in the car as he and Maya drove to Brighton to look around the facilities, recalls: “Hope [Powell] and Amy [Merricks] were just so good for Maya. Maya would swallow every bit of information she was given. Hope used to say: ‘You’ve got to push yourself, there’s no point swimming in a comfy lane.’ We were so grateful for Brighton.”Remarkably, since cementing her place in Brighton’s team in the 2020-21 campaign, she has started every WSL match for five consecutive seasons, the first two of those at Brighton and the past three at Manchester United. Further still, she has played every minute of the past two league campaigns. The secret is her dedication to keeping fit and Darren says: “Maya’s different. She sacrifices absolutely everything to ensure she’s 100%. She realises that your career is short. She’s very happy-go-lucky off the pitch but, when it comes to football on the pitch, she’s just steely and determined to win and nothing gets in the way of that.”View image in fullscreenLe Tissier takes a quiet moment to herself ahead of the Women’s FA Cup final on Sunday.Photograph: Ben Fiore/The GuardianThis season, having turned 23 in April, she has worn the captain’s armband. Gabby George, her fellow United defender, says Le Tissier is “everything we would want from a captain”. Accepting the captaincy is something Le Tissier admits took careful thought, given her age. “I was honoured. It’s not something that I thought would ever come, with Zel [Katie Zelem] leaving. I had a real, big think about whether I wanted to do it. It’s not something I would ever take lightly. It’s a big thing. I had a coffee with Marc [Skinner, the United manager] to speak about it and I spoke to my family and thought: ‘Yes’. I’ve definitely had to develop my leadership qualities, mostly off the pitch, as a leader, [but] I’ve really enjoyed it.”We move to Icart Point, a clifftop with beautiful sea views and one of her favourite dog-walking spots, 24 hours after she and George had helped United clinch Women’s Champions League qualification bycoming from 2-0 down to draw with Manchester City. A beaming Le Tissier says: “To come back from two down at Old Trafford, with so much on the line, it just shows how strong we are now – we might not have the most experienced team but our mentality is so strong.”Next, attention turns to Wembley, where they will contest the Cup final for a third consecutive year, this time as holders, afterlast year’s 4-0 win over Tottenham. “That was honestly like the best day of my life,” Le Tissier says. “We knew there were probably quite a few players who were going to leave so to be able to do it with that team … [she pauses to smile] and also the year before we’d lost to Chelsea, so we knew how badly that hurt. [Winning] 4-0, it was sunny, all my family were there, it was just a sick day.”For Sunday’s showdown with Chelsea, about 30 of her family and friends will be there and – by the sounds of it – the flights from Guernsey will be jam-packed with people heading to watch the island’s favourite daughter. Whether she lifts the Cup or not, she has already won this island’s heart.Explore more on these topicsManchester United WomenWomen's footballWomen's Super LeagueinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Couhig, the 76-year-old former Wycombe owner, has acquired theLeague Oneclub, their stadium and training ground.The English Football League said it wishedReadingand their supporters “a successful future following a difficult period for all associated with the club”. A deal had been agreed for several weeks and has now been ratified by the EFL.The US-based Couhig has been named chair and his business partner Todd Trosclair has also joined the board. Couhig tried to buy Reading last year but the deal collapsed in September 2024.Reading have been bought by Redwood Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of Dogwood Football LLC, which is owned by Couhig and Trosclair. “Redwood is ambitious and dedicated towards the club returning to its rightful place within the English football pyramid, while adhering to clear principles of honesty, transparency and financial sustainability,” a club statement said.Reading have been docked 18 points across the past three seasons, a period in which the club have also been under a series of embargoes for defaulted payments. Dai cut funding for Reading Women, resulting in themwithdrawing from the second tierlast summer, and in March he was disqualified as an owner by the EFL and given a deadline to sell the club, owing to business activity in China.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The White House claims the aviation agreement alone will support 154,000 American jobs annually, though it was unclear how those figures were calculated.Trump also secured a statement of intent for more than $38bn in future defense investments fromQatar, further intertwining America’s economic and security relationships with the Gulf state now offering him a luxury aircraft.Ahead of the deal, Trump dismissed mounting ethical concerns about accepting Qatar’s separate offer of a “palace in the sky” Boeing 747-8 jetliner – complaining that the current presidential aircraft simply doesn’t match up to those of Gulf monarchies.“The plane that you’re on is almost 40 years old,” Trump told the Fox News host Sean Hannity during an Air Force One interview on the Middle East trip, where he is also visitingSaudi Arabiaand theUnited Arab Emirates.“When you land and you see Saudi Arabia, you see UAE and you see Qatar, and they have these brand-new Boeing 747s, mostly. You see ours next to it – this is like a totally different plane.”Trump 2.0 takes quid pro quo fears to new heights with $400m flying griftRead moreClearly irritated by questions about the ethical criticism of accepting such a lavish gift as president, Trump insisted American prestige was at stake. “We’re the United States of America. I believe we should have the most impressive plane.”The timing of Trump’s visit has raised eyebrows, coming just weeks after the Trump Organization secured a deal with Qatar for a luxury resort and golf course development outside the capital, Doha, called Trump International Golf Club & Villas.“My attitude is why wouldn’t I accept a gift?” Trump continued. “We’re giving to everybody else, why wouldn’t I accept a gift? Because it’s going to be a couple years until the Boeings are finished.”Trump was referring to the incoming Air Force One fleet, a$3.9bn contractgiven to Boeing in 2018 with an original timetable of 2024 that has since been delayed by a number of years.The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, who worked as a lobbyist for Qatar while at her previous employer Ballard Partners, has declared accepting the aircraft “legally permissible”.Trump’s much-touted trade deals, coming as Qatar dangles what Democratic representative Ritchie Torres described as a “flying grift”, has triggered alarm across the political spectrum. Torres has argued that the winged present violates the constitution’s emoluments clause, which explicitly prohibits federal officials from accepting valuable gifts from foreign powers without congressional approval.Even staunch Trump allies have broken ranks, including the Texas senator Ted Cruz, who warned that the aircraft deal “poses significant espionage and surveillance problems”, while the West Virginia senator Shelley Moore Capito said bluntly she would “be checking for bugs”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The process would require dismantling the aircraft to search for surveillance devices before installing sophisticated security and communications systems.The actual Air Force One, while older, acts as a mobile version of the White House, and has anti-missile defense systems, hardened and encrypted communications, secure compartments for senior leadership, and the ability to refuel midair.Trump’s Gulf tour began with a speech at the Saudi US Investment Forum 2025, where he praised the region’s leaders. He said the region was “transcending the ancient conflicts and tired divisions of the past” and that “this great transformation has not come from western interventionists or flying people in beautiful planes giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs”Qatar has long been on its way to being accepted into the American list of preferred partners. In February 2022, the Biden administration designated Qatar the latest “major non-Nato ally”, a coveted relationship with military, intelligence and financial advantages.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpQatarTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Ventura was seeing Alex Fine, her now husband, at the time.After lunch, Combs and Ventura returned to her home where Ventura said he raped her.“And then he raped me in my living room,” she said, adding: “I just remember crying and saying ‘no,’ but it was very fast.”Ventura, who said she was not sure whether Combs noticed her crying, also said that Combs ejaculated inside her before getting up and leaving.After the alleged rape, Ventura said she had consensual sex with Combs one other time.“We’d been together 10 years, you just don’t turn feelings off that way,” she said, adding that they had “a few check-ins” since their 2018 breakup.2.Ventura said Combs told her “he was going to hurt” her and Kid Cudi when he heard they were datingVentura also testified about her brief relationship with Scott Mescudi, also known as rapper Kid Cudi. She told the court that she dated Mescudi in 2011 during a period when she and Combs were “not in a good place”.When Combs learned she was dating Kid Cudi during a “freak-off”, she said Combs told her that “he was going to hurt” both of them and that he was going to have Kid Cudi’s car blown up.She later saw Mescudi during a meeting with her and Combs.“What about my vehicle?” Mescudi asked at the time, per Ventura.“What vehicle?” Combs said.“And that was the end of the meeting,” Ventura said.InJanuary 2012, a Porsche owned by Mescudi was set on fire by an “incendiary device”.3.Ventura recalls more details from the viral 2016 surveillance assault footageThe trial’s third day opened with Ventura being shown the hotel surveillance footage of her 2016 assault by Combs, who was seen throwing a vase at her at the InterContinental hotel in Los Angeles. The video showed Combs running down a hallway after Ventura before grabbing her neck and shoving her on to the floor near some elevators.“I didn’t get hit. I remember it hitting the wall. He was yelling at me and threw it at me,” she said of the vase. She added that Combs told her “that I wasn’t going to leave him there. That I couldn’t.”Following the assault, Ventura texted Combs in messages that were displayed to jurors, telling the music mogul that he was “sick for thinking it’s OK to do what you did to me”.4.Combs was also violent towards his own employees and Cassie’s friendsVentura testified that Combs was also violent towards those who worked for him.He would assault some of his employees and attack her friends. In addition to punching people and slamming them into furniture, Ventura said that Combs once dangled one of her friends over a balcony.“There was an incident where I was asleep in my room and when I came out Sean was holding her and threw her on to the patio furniture,” she said.“I saw him bring her back over the railing of the balcony and then throw her on to the patio furniture.”She also recalled an incident during a trip abroad where she saw Combs drag his assistant “Mia” out of her bed and on to the deck outside her room after she refused to hand her phone over to Combs.5.Combs and Ventura settled for $20mIn her bombshell2023lawsuit against Combs, Ventura accused him of physical and sexual abuse. That suit, which wassettled for a previously undisclosed sum, prompted a federal investigation that led to Combs’sarrest in September 2024.On Wednesday, Ventura revealed that the sum for the settlement was $20m.6.Ventura says Combs would blackmail her with ‘freak-off’ videosVentura also said that Combs would regularly threaten to publicize videos of her participating in his “freak-offs”.She testified that once on her birthday, Combs reminded her of the videos after she refused to leave her friends and join him in a freak-off.“I feared for my career, my family … It is horrible and disgusting, no one should do that to anyone,” she said, adding: “It could ruin everything I worked for, make me look like a slut … I wasn’t supposed to be on those videos. I didn’t want to be in them.“I felt trapped,” Ventura continued, saying:  “Whatever was going to not make him angry or threaten me I was going to do.”Read key takeaways fromCassie Ventura’s first day of testimony hereExplore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsUS crimeNew YorkHip-hopexplainersShareReuse this content"

The Israeli military has issuedfresh evacuation ordersfor the Rimal neighbourhood in Gaza City, alleging that Hamas has been using schools and health facilities there.The new attacks comes as the US president, Donald Trump, continues his Middle East visit and follows a brief pause in Israel’s continuing offensive toallow the releaseby Hamas of the 21-year-old Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, which briefly raised hopes for a new ceasefire.Israel has threatened to launch a massive new offensiveto “conquer” Gazaif Hamas does not release the 58 hostages it is still holding and make other concessions.1:12Israel hits Gaza hospitals in deadly new wave of strikes – videoThe stop-start negotiations to end the war are continuing in the Qatari capital, Doha, which Trump was visiting on Wednesday.Officials said Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minster, had held talks with the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who has been tasked by Trump with ending the war in Gaza, on “the issue of the hostages and the missing”.Witkoff later said Trump had “a really productive conversation” with Qatar’s emir about a ceasefire deal in Gaza, adding that “we are moving along and we have a good plan together”.Israel is under increasing pressure to end its total blockade of Gaza, which was imposed in early March. Earlier this week, UN-backed food security experts said the territory’s 2.3 million population was at critical risk of famine.On Wednesday, António Guterres, the UN secretary general, called for “unimpeded humanitarian access” to the Palestinian territory, while Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was “ever more dramatic and unjustifiable”. Anita Anand, the new Canadian foreign minister, accused Israel of using food as a political tool.Israeli officials have rejected the criticism, saying that Hamas routinely steals and sells aid to finance military and other operations, and arguing that the blockade was necessary to force Hamas to release the hostages it is still holding. They say Israel is working with the US on a new plan for distributing aid to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, involving a series of hubs in the south of Gaza that would be run by private contractors and protected by Israeli troops.Humanitarian officials have rejected the plan as unworkable, inadequate, dangerous and potentially unlawful.0:29Israeli strike hits Nasser hospital in southern Gaza – videoSpeaking in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday, Trump said more hostages would follow Alexander, who had been in Hamas captivity since the group launched its surprise attack in October 2023, and added that the people of Gaza deserved a better future.1:48Hamas releases Israeli American hostage Edan Alexander from Gaza – video reportNetanyahu credited Alexander’s release on Monday to a combination of “our military pressure and the political pressure exerted by President Trump”. This has been rejected by Hamas, which has said it engaged in direct talks with Washington on a ceasefire in Gaza.Trump’s tour beganin Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. His next stop will be the United Arab Emirates.Israel’s offensive has obliterated vast swathes of Gaza, destroying health, sanitation and other infrastructure and displacing 90% of the population, often multiple times.Israeli media reported that one target in a strike on a hospital in Khan Younis on Tuesday was Mohammed Sinwar, younger brother of the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israeli forces last October. The military would not comment beyond saying it had targeted a Hamas “command and control centre” which it said was located beneath the European hospital.Mohammed Sinwar is believed to be Hamas’s top military leader in Gaza. Israel has tried to assassinate him multiple times over the past decades.Dr Marwan al-Hams, the director general of field hospitals at Gaza’s health ministry, said the strike had severely damaged the hospital’s water and sewage systems, as well as its courtyard. He added that the Israeli military hit a bulldozer brought in by hospital authorities to repair the area to allow ambulances reach the building.Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, and the abduction of 251. The ensuing Israeli offensive has killed at least 52,908 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the territory that is considered reliable by the UN.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesHamasMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It was at a time when we were being quite clear about the issues around sovereignty,” he said.Carney, who won a party race to become prime minister in March before he secured victory in Canada’s election last month by vowing to stand up Trump, said Charles’s presence in Canada later this month was by design.“All issues around Canada’s sovereignty have been accentuated by the president. So no, it’s not coincidental, but it is also a reaffirming moment for Canadians,” he said.Starmer, who is trying to improve trading ties with the US after Britain left the European Union, has sought to play to its strengths when dealing with Trump, talking up its security expertise, pledging higher defence spending, and offering the pomp and pageantry that comes with a state visit.Trump, whose mother was born in Scotland and who has repeatedly praised the British royal family, agreed a limited bilateral trade agreement with London this month.Asked about Carney’s criticism, the senior British minister Pat McFadden told Sky News that every country had to decide how to conduct its relations with other countries.Explore more on these topicsCanadaDonald TrumpKeir StarmerAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It is shameful that for so long, the last Conservative government failed to reckon with the reality of a rising prison population,” Mahmood said.She said the new recall measures were expected to free up about 1,400 places. They will apply to offenders who were sentenced to between one and four years and were let out on licence but committed another offence.Asked how many people would be released as a result of the fixed-term measures, Mahmood said: “We believe that that number will allow us to get from November into spring of next year … we are on track to hit zero capacity within our prison estate by November, and this measure will tide us over until any changes from the sentencing review start to hit the system.”The proposals have been condemned by two government-appointed tsars who represent victims, who claim that sexual and domestic abusers will be freed to terrorise victims again.Dame Nicole Jacobs, the domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales, said: “I cannot stress enough the lack of consideration for victims’ safety and how many lives are being put in danger because of this proposed change.“You are not sent to prison for four years if you do not pose significant risk to your victim or the wider public. Perpetrators of domestic abuse know everything about their victim … Re-releasing them back into the community after 28 days is simply unacceptable.“What makes this worse is that ministers cannot safely exempt all perpetrators of domestic abuse from this proposal, because they do not know how many domestic abusers are serving time in prison or currently being monitored by probation.”The victims’ commissioner for England and Wales, Baroness Newlove, said she would be writing to Mahmood to express her concern that the “short-term, stopgap” measures are corroding confidence in justice.“I find it difficult to understand why this specific group of offenders has been targeted for early release and I am concerned about the implications for victim safety,” she said.“I will be seeking urgent clarity from the lord chancellor on how this policy will operate in practice – and what safeguards will be put in place.”A standard recall currently results in offenders being taken back to prison for the remainder of their sentence, but it can be for shorter fixed terms in some circumstances.The latest measures are aimed at dealing with the scale of the continuing crisis in jails, with the latest weekly prison population in England and Wales standing at 88,087. This is 434 below the last peak in the prison population of 88,521 inmates on 6 September, recorded just before the government began freeing thousands of prisoners early as part of efforts to curb overcrowding.The three prisons will be built near existing prisons, Mahmood said, with construction workers breaking ground on a site near HMP Gartree in Leicestershire later this year.Officials said the others would be near HMP Garth near Leyland, Lancashire, and HMP Grendon in the village of Grendon Underwood, Buckinghamshire.Mahmood said that despite “record prison expansion”, England and Wales would still be more than 9,000 prison places short by 2028. The recall population in prisons had more than doubled in seven years, she said.Some offenders will be excluded from the scheme, “including any offender who has been recalled for committing a serious further offence”, Mahmood said.Amy Rees, the Ministry of Justice interim permanent secretary, said the government would run out of prison places in five months’ time if further measures were not taken.“On our current trajectory, the prison population rises by 3,000, and now we expect to hit zero capacity – to entirely run out of prison places for adult men – in November of this year,” she said.11:57Can the UK fix its broken prison system? – videoNext week an independent sentencing review will recommend a package of measures on prison overcrowding. Led by the former Tory justice secretary David Gauke, it will say prisoners will be able to earn their freedom after serving a third of their sentences under new minimum and maximum sentence plans.Offenders in England and Wales will be able to earn early release if they complete work, training or education assignments and demonstrate good behaviour.Gauke is expected to support the further deployment of specialist courts to break addictions of prolific offenders. Intensive supervision courts have been set up for female offenders in three pilots across England and Wales.Mahmood said changes from a sentencing bill would be expected to start having an effect in April next year. “We will legislate at pace. And as I described earlier, currently we’re on track to come down to zero capacity in November of this year,” she said.“That’s why I’ve announced the measures on fixed-term recall today. We would anticipate that any changes from a sentencing bill could start having an impact on April of next year, so that’s the timeline that we are working to. We’re moving very, very quickly, but it’s because we want to make sure we never have to do emergency releases again.”Posting on X, the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, said: “Labour are so obsessed with working from home, they want to roll it out to prisoners too. Criminals will be quaking in their boots.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justiceShabana MahmoodLabournewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday the ThamesWaterchief executive, Chris Weston, said he was not ruling out restrictions.James Wallace, the chief executive of River Action, said: “This crisis was avoidable. But thanks to corporate greed and regulatory complacency, our reservoirs are running dry and our rivers are polluted with sewage. Rather than punish the culprits, customers have been told by government they will be fined £1,000 if they break a hosepipe ban. Yet again, the public will bear the costs of a failing water industry.”Drought conditions already hitting UK crop production, farmers sayRead moreThe UKCEH hydrological outlook reads: “Over the period May-July, river flows in most areas are likely to continue to be below normal, with the potential for current low to exceptionally low flows to persist in some catchments.”Dwindling reservoir levels put waterways at risk as farmers and water companies abstract from rivers when other water sources run low.This can lead to exceptionally low river flows, which may result in large-scale fish deaths and increase the pressure on rivers, particularly if water companies continue tospill sewage into them. River flows are already far below average for the time of year, with almost every catchment in the UK below normal. UKCEH records show that some areas have had the lowest October to March flows since records for those places began in 1958.No reservoirs have been built inEnglandfor more than 30 years, which leaves the country particularly vulnerable to drought. Reservoir levels are lower than they should be after parts of the country had their driest spring on record, and if the dry weather continues as predicted there may be water shortages, leading to hosepipe bans and potentially other forms of rationing.The Guardianreported recentlythat to avert a drought there would need to be rainfall at levels last seen in 2012, when record-breaking deluges caused floods across the country. This does not look likely with hot, dry weather ahead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Farmers rely on this for irrigation, and low groundwater can lead to crop failures.Wallace said: “Britain may be heading for drought but for decades since privatisation water companies have siphoned off billions in dividends while wasting 3bn litres of drinking water per day, rather than invest in the infrastructure needed to cope with a changing climate. We’ve had ample warning about the risks, yet instead of building resilience, the industry banked on business as usual, putting our economy, food production, even healthcare at risk.”Explore more on these topicsDroughtWaterRiversEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Wildfire pollution has been linked to early deaths, worsened heart and breathing diseases and premature births.Previous studies have analysed outdoor exposure to wildfire smoke, but people spend most of their time indoors, particularly when seeking refuge from wildfires. The new analysis is the first global, high-resolution study of indoor spikes in wildfire pollution.The greatest exposure was in South America and central Africa, followed by the west coast of North America, north-west Australia, and north and south-east Asia.Indoor pollution can be reduced using air purifiers at significantly lower cost than the health damage the pollution causes. However, the scientists noted that some of the people most affected live in poorer nations and would need help to afford the equipment.“Even when doors and windows were closed, individuals remaining indoors were still greatly affected by [wildfire pollution],” said Dongjia Han, of Tsinghua University in Beijing, and her colleagues. “Consequently, there is a pressing need for more effective measures to reduce exposure to indoor wildfire particles.”A recent study found that even with closed doors and windows, indoor pollution concentrations on wildfire days can be nearly three times higher than on normal days.The new study,published in the journal Science Advances, used an established dataset of wildfire pollution, based on satellite observations of blazes, to model indoor exposure around the world from 2003 to 2022. They found that more than 1 billion people a year had at least one day when indoor particle levels were above World Health Organization (WHO) limits, with wildfires responsible for at least half of the pollution.The work builds on previous analyses of indoor wildfire pollution in North America, Australia, and south-east Asia which found sharp increases in particle levels. Studies in California, Australia and Brazil have shown that the cost of the damage to health resulting from wildfire smoke runs into many billions of dollars and is much higher than the costs of running air purifiers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It found the cost of buying, maintaining and running the purifiers would be hundreds of dollars a year per household. “These results suggest that a modest investment in air purifiers can yield substantial economic and health benefits during wildfire episodes,” the scientists said.However, in low-income countries such as Niger and Chad, the annual costs of air purifiers were greater than the average yearly income. “[This] provides compelling evidence of climate injustice, by exposing those who cannot afford the cost of air purifiers to higher health risks,” the researchers said. “Therefore, government support is necessary to narrow the inequality.”There are other measures that can reduce exposure, the scientists said, such as wearing face masks, relocating vulnerable people away from the fires, and making buildings more airtight.Jing Li and Yifang Zhu, both of the University of California, Los Angeles, and not part of the study team, said: “As wildfires continue to intensify due to climate change, reducing indoor exposure to wildfire smoke has become a pressing global issue that goes beyond individual action and requires comprehensive, policy-driven solutions.”They said more research was needed to validate the modelling study with on-the-ground measurements and exploration of factors such as the age of buildings, as older buildings have been shown to let more smoke in, and whether an increase in cooking indoors during wildfires adds to the pollution levels.Explore more on these topicsAir pollutionPollutionWildfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

More than 80% of its electricity is generated from renewables, including wind, biofuels and solar, according to the International Energy Agency.But Denmark may begin investing in modular nuclear reactors too, Lars Aagaard, the energy and climate minister, suggested.Aagaard told the Danish newspaper Politiken: “We can see that there is a development under way with new nuclear power technologies – small, modular reactors. But it’s not enough that they have potential. We also need to know what it means for Danish society if we are to enable these technologies.”The country’s decision to reconsider nuclear power has emerged as interest in new nuclear reactor designs has picked up across Europe, alongside plans to extend the lifespan of the continent’s existing reactors.Denmark’s former prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen told the Financial Times on Wednesday he supported lifting the “ridiculous” ban on nuclear power.“Wind and solar are good as long as you have wind and sunshine. But you have to have a non-fossil base-load and it’s ridiculous to exclude nuclear power in advance. My guess is that this is a process [from the government] towards lifting the ban,” he said.Renewed European interest in nuclear power is in part because of an expected increase in demand for low-carbon electricity to decarbonise transport, industry and home heating in the decades ahead.The developers of small modular reactor designs, which can be built in factories and assembled on site, have promised lower costs and shorter construction times than traditional large-scale reactors.Nuclear power has also won the backing of tech companies, including Google, which are interested in usingsmall modular nuclear reactorsto supply their energy-hungry datacentres with consistent 24-hour electricity.Spain, widely considered anti-nuclear, is understood to be reconsidering plans to shut down its seven nuclear reactors in the next decade after amassive power outage across the Iberian peninsula last month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week, itcancelled one of the UK’s largest offshore windfarms, Hornsea 4, off the Yorkshire coast, saying soaring costs meant it no longer made economic sense.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkNuclear powerEnergy industryRenewable energyEnergyEuropeGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

Many are already in an extremely poor condition, suffering from pollution and over-abstraction – the removal of water – to serve developments. Only 37% of the streams meet ecological standards of “good”.Ellie Chowns, a Green MP and member of the committee, said: “These are globally significant ecosystems and they are largely restricted to our shores. So we have a huge responsibility to protect them.”Chowns said there were no national protections for chalk streams and put forward the amendment to the planning and infrastructure bill, which was supported by a group of cross-party MPs.The amendment would create protections for the habitats as the government attempts to rip up what it sees asenvironmental red tape to push for housing and infrastructure growth.The planning bill has been labelleda licence to kill natureby economists and ecologists because it allows developers to pay into anature restoration fundrather than follow current environmental obligations to protect rare habitats and species.Under the bill, the payment into the fund would allow developers to begin work immediately while the money is used to improve nature, potentially in another region of the country.Critics point out that this strategic mitigation does not work for such a rare habitat as a chalk stream, which is impossible to recreate elsewhere.The amendment sought to impose protections for all chalk streams – most of which stretch across planning authority boundaries – and to require officials to identify the measures to be taken to protect any identified chalk streams from pollution, abstraction, encroachment and other forms of environmental damage.It would also have imposed responsibilities on strategic planning authorities in relation to the protection and enhancement of chalk stream habitats.Labour MPs also rejected another amendment which sought to ensure that irreplaceable habitats – which are considered the jewels in the crown of England’s wildlife and nature – could not be developed on and the harm offset by using the nature restoration fund. These habitats include ancient woodlands, blanket bogs and lowland fens.Luke Murphy, the Labour MP for Basingstoke, said the bill was not the right place to create such protections.Matthew Pennycook, the housing minister, said the government was committed to restoring and improving chalk streams.“These are unique water bodies, not just vital ecosystems but symbols of our national heritage,” he said, adding that the government had undertaken a comprehensive set of actions outside the bill to protect chalk streams.“We don’t believe it is necessary to include the provision in this legislation,” he said.Becky Pullinger, the head of land use and planning at The Wildlife Trusts, said: “As we face the driest spring since 1956, with chalk stream flows at historic lows, it’s vital that the planning and infrastructure bill ensures irreplaceable habitats like these are safeguarded from harm.“England has 85% of the world’s chalk streams and so today’s decision from the government is deeply disappointing.”Explore more on these topicsRiversPlanning policyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

One neighbour had been told someone had been stabbed.”Tumbare said she saw an air ambulance and police helicopter land close to the incident and added that a police officer told residents in Derna Road to remain indoors.Det Supt Paul Speight said: “I know that people who live in this area of Huyton and the wider communities of Merseyside will be shocked by this incident.“We are still in the very early stages of investigating and part of our initial inquiries will be to establish the full circumstances of what happened.“In the meantime, I want to reassure the public that Merseyside police is committed to keeping our communities safe and we take all reports of incidents involving weapons extremely seriously.“This was an isolated incident and we are not looking for anyone else. All three people have been taken to hospital to be assessed for their various injuries.“The IOPC will now conduct an independent investigation and we will be co-operating fully with their investigation in the coming days and weeks.”An IOPC spokesperson said: “We have begun an investigation into an incident where a person has been shot by Merseyside police in Huyton.”Explore more on these topicsMerseysideLiverpoolCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

We have so much to be proud of in the UK: our tolerance, our innovative spirit, our creativity, our humour, our sense of fairness. But I think that unless we act, we will drift, becoming weaker, less trusting, less competitive.”Ministers demand BBC World Service plan for cuts as aid budget slashedRead moreIn a rapidly changing media world in whichless than half of young people watch live TV each week, Davie said the days of the “old priesthood” of broadcasters deciding and controlling what information people consumed were over. However, he said that it had meant “disinformation is thriving”.“There is no doubt that this new age is fostering polarisation and threatening communal trust and putting more power in the hands of global social media platforms,” he said. “We see profound changes in people’s trust in the information that they receive … Many feel there is no agreed backbone of facts upon which to base constructive deliberation.“Those we disagree with become enemies, not friends who think differently. Empathy withers without understanding.”Davie’s address in effect served as the first major salvo in lengthy talks over how the BBC will be changed as its charter is up for renewal. With the future of the licence fee continuing to be in question, Davie pitched the BBC as a rare unifying force.He revealed plans to “dramatically increase” the amount of BBC News content on YouTube and TikTok, both of which were platforms where disinformation could flourish, he said. He said the BBC was “not being dragged there”, but wanted to reach the audiences using the platforms.He said: “In the election, we found enormous numbers of young people coming to [BBC Verify] factcheckers because they were just confused. We think [putting] things like that into YouTube will be very powerful.”However, after the Guardian revealed that the BBC had been asked byministers to draw up cuts to the World Service, Davie issued a direct challenge to the government – instead demanding “hundreds of millions” more to boost the World Service at a time when Russia and China alone are spending billions on their state-run media channels, designed to influence world opinion.“When it comes to funding the World Service, we do need help,” he said. “There’s never been a more important time to invest in this priceless national asset. We believe the UK should be ambitious about its future, and the government should invest for significant growth, not survival … We’ve got to make a decision as a country, are we in this game or not?”While he maintained that turning the BBC into a subscription service or one supported by advertising revenue were his red lines in talks with ministers, he suggested that a universal licence fee could be renamed, modernised or adapted.It suggests the BBC may be looking at whether wealthier households could pay more. “We keep an open mind and we continue to actively explore all options that can make our funding model fairer, more modern and more sustainable,” he said.After theGuardian highlighted the crisis inside the TV industry, Davie also backed greater tax breaks for vulnerable areas of television.He expressed his disapproval about a social media post briefly shared by Gary Lineker on Instagram that was labelled “Zionism explained in two minutes” and featured an illustration of a rat – historically used as an antisemitic insult and used in Nazi Germany to characterise Jews.“The BBC’s reputation is held by everyone and when someone makes a mistake, it costs us,” he said. “I think we absolutely need people to be exemplars of the BBC’s values and follow our social media policy.

An application for parental rights over a second girl from the north-east, who was born in March 2023, was also turned down.In both cases, he had sex with the women. It was a “free” service, which Albon on his Facebook page said meant recipients did not have to “have a weirdo in a lab coat look at your hoohaw”.In the case of the three-year-old, the mother contacted him over Facebook in 2021, and he asked her to send a picture before travelling 250 miles the same day for sex. The woman already had seven children, five of whom were not in her care.Afterwards, Albon exchanged messages with the woman, who later wrote: “Have done an awful lot of thinking about how you have treated me.

You have truly broken me.”In messages, she accused him of using the unborn child to try to get benefits and a house.In the case of the two-year-old girl, Albon did not appear on the child’s birth certificate, though he initially had some contact with her.Albon applied for declaration of parentage, parental responsibility and contact with the girl, which the mother opposed, giving evidence in court from behind a screen.The woman, who was described as “suggestible” by the judge, learned his name was Robert, and not Joe, only after the child was born. She was described by social services as being vulnerable, having a very unstable family background and was assessed to have an IQ of 75.Albon, who has families with a Japanese woman and a Chinese woman he is estranged from, has also fathered dozens of children across South America, Australia and the UK.In the US, where he was offering sperm donor services until 2017, there is a warrant for his arrest over unpaid child maintenance amounting to thousands of dollars.In an interview with the Sun last August, he said: “I’ve had about 180 live births and I’ve met about 60 of them.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsSperm donationEnglandChildrenCardiffMiddlesbroughSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

The fare was paid in full.“The foreign secretary and his wife are named as victims in this matter and the driver has been charged with theft.“As there is an ongoing legal process, it would be inappropriate to comment further.”Explore more on these topicsDavid LammyFranceEuropeCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

And what our studies found was that they show that the Bayesian may have been vulnerable to high winds and that these winds were likely to have been evident at the time of the accident.”Investigators said “there was no indication of flooding inside Bayesian until water came in over the starboard rails and, within seconds, entered the internal spaces down the stairwells”.MAIB said its report was based on “a limited amount of verified evidence” as a criminal investigation by Italian authorities has restricted its access to the wreck and other pieces of evidence.Further details such as “escape routes” will be included in the final report, once MAIB get access to the vessel.The full investigation report will not be published within 12 months.The wreck currently sits at a depth of 50 metres in the bay of Porticello.Recovery operations toraisethe Bayesian, which began early in May, have been suspended after a diver died during underwater work.Preparatory work onsite to resume the recovery is due to begin on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

For example, it counts ectopic pregnancies – when an embryo implants somewhere other than the uterine lining – as a serious complication.Mifepristonedoes not causean ectopic pregnancy and taking it will not harm someone with an ectopic. It also claims that needing an in-clinic procedure to complete the abortion is a complication, when patients arecounseledin advance about the pills’ failure rate of about 3 to 4%.The data, the authors say, means the FDA should reinstate earlier restrictions on mifepristone, including a ban on telemedicine and limiting use to the first seven weeks of pregnancy – but they do not intend to stop there.The authors note that restoring the limits could lead to better monitoring that could help “determine whether this drug should remain on the market”, statements that echo proposals found in Project 2025, the 900-page playbook published by the Heritage Foundation and for which the EPPC was an advisory board member.Project 2025 calls to end telemedicine prescriptions of abortion pills as an “interim step” to revoking mifepristone’s approval altogether.More than 100 scientific studieshave found the medications cited in the paper are safe and effective for ending a pregnancy.Telehealth, plus blue-state “shield laws”, have enabled thousands of people living in states where abortion is banned to continue to access mifepristone and misoprostol, which frustrates abortion opponents. One in five abortions nationwide are done via telemedicine, and in spring 2024, mail providers facilitated more than7,700 abortions per monthin states with total or six-week abortion bans.Anti-abortion leaders said during a private Zoom call that they intend to use the EPPC paper to pressure the FDA and lawmakers to dramatically roll back access to the drug, “if not suspend” their approval entirely, Politicoreported. It is part of a plan they are privately calling “Rolling Thunder”.Activists on that call – which included representatives from Americans United for Life, Live Action, Students for Life, and Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America – stressed that they viewed ending telemedicine prescriptions only as a “first step”.According to the Politico report, the EPPC president, Ryan Anderson, argued on the call that this plan aligns with Donald Trump’s stated desire to leave abortion policy to the states because, he said, “you’re not leaving it to states if California can mail pills to Texas”.Activists tried to push back on criticism that the paper was not peer-reviewed by arguing that academia is “broken” and they could not trust journals or reviewers not to “sabotage” their effort or leak it to the press. Politico reported that one medical professional on the call, Christina Francis, the CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life OBGYNs, warned her colleagues not to misrepresent the paper, acknowledging that the report was “not a study in the traditional sense” and “not conclusive proof of anything”. Still, Francis argued that it warranted government action and more research.During his January confirmation hearing, Kennedy said that Trumpasked himto review mifepristone’s safety data. The FDA commissioner, Marty Makary,saidin March that he, too, would “do a review of the data”, and would act if necessary. Hawley, the Missouri senator, laterwrotea letter to Makary asking him to review the paper the day it was published; Hawley alsointroduced a billto end telemedicine of mifepristone. It is not expected to pass Congress, but the FDA could take action on its own, especially under pressure from groups on the call.While abortion opponents have promoted researchlinkedto anti-abortion thinktanks claiming that mifepristone is dangerous, some studies havebeen retracted, including one cited heavily by a federal judge in a case seeking to roll back the pill’s availability that went to the supreme court last term. The court ruled unanimously that the plaintiffs, anti-abortion doctors, did not have legal standing to sue the FDA.That case is still ongoing, with three Republican attorneys general suing the FDA on behalf of the states of Missouri, Idaho and Kansas.The Trump administration made news last week whenit arguedin a filing that the judge should dismiss the case, the same position taken by the Biden administration earlier this year. But the Trump administration did not defend the FDA’s actions on mifepristone, instead saying only that the plaintiffs were not the right people to sue.As a health law expertrecently toldthe Guardian, the administration could use that argument in the future if it chooses to restrict the drug and Democratic-led states sue over the changes.Kirsten Moore, director of the Expanding MedicationAbortionAccess Project, told the Guardian she was not surprised by either the existence of a plan to restrict the drugs or that the push is based on what she called “manufactured misinformation”.Moore said that reproductive rights supporters had long known that anti-abortion advocates “will stop at nothing to put mifepristone – a safe, effective FDA-approved medication that has been used for 25 years in this country to end a pregnancy at 10 weeks or less – back under lock and key”.Carter Sherman contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUS newsReproductive rightsRoe v WadeRobert F Kennedy JrAbortionnewsShareReuse this content"

But being a Eurovision entry now looks like being part of an exhausting social media content factory, which may be driving some of the wackiness out of it. No one isgiving a wolf a bananathis year.In 2025, a Eurovision artist needs to tread on eggshells to avoid putting a foot wrong during months-long internet exposure, but must also stay interesting enough to attract likes and follows. It has also become the norm for contestants to provide alternative versions of their own or other Eurovision songs for the viral content mills. And it is difficult to do that if you are, like Ireland in 2008,sending a puppet.So if you were thinking of sending, say, novelty buxom butter churners, as Poland did in 2014 to accompanyDonatan & Cleo singing We Are Slavic, you must bear in mind that they have to commit to the bit and be prepared to churn butter all over TikTok for months, plus provide additional YouTube video for the official channel.This year’s standouts on that alternate content score include Lithuania’s Katarsis supplyinga more intense choir-laden versionof their alt-rock entry Tavo Akys, andGeorgia’s entry doing a cover of the Netherlands entry. We have also been treated toan acoustic Greek entrywith an additional lovely dog in the video, anda darker versionof Laura Thorn’s entry for Luxembourg,La Poupée Monte le Son, that arguably puts the original in the shade.The alternate version of the Luxembourg entryStill, this trend for extra content did at least give us theincredible deadpan Go_A coverof fellow Ukrainian Eurovision legendary entryVerka Serduchka’s Dancing Lasha Tumbai, so perhaps it isn’t all bad.Go_A perform Dancing Lasha TumbaiVoting atEurovisionisn’t as secret as a papal conclave, and social media success is clearly going to make a difference. The lengthy pre-contest campaign may influence people, and juries, to converge on popular acts, making the result a self-fulfilling prophecy.The number of YouTube views a song racks up also affects its betting odds. At the moment, Sweden’s KAJ lead both withBara Badu Basta. The producers who shape the running order of the final are hardly going to relegate a favourite of fans and bookies alike to an unfavourable slot on the night.KAJ with Bara Badu BastaYet the modern environment seems to have driven a lot of countries to send something safe in terms of song and artist profile. Slovenia, France, Switzerland, Israel and the Netherlands have all gone for basic Eurovision ballads. And there is a proliferation of electronic europop seeking to become club anthems. Perhaps taking a cue from 2023’s winner,Tattoo by Loreen, this year Germany, Spain, Ireland, Denmark, Cyprus and Belgium have all turned in entries that are so similar the world’s worst DJ could seamlessly mix them.Even Austria’s entry (currently second favourite), JJ’s emotional and operaticWasted Love, makes a point of finishing in a way that could be timed to work perfectly for a rave crowd watching the sunrise in Ibiza.JJ and Wasted Love, Austria’s entry for 2025Will it still be an absolute riot of fun in Basel on Saturday? Of course. With the advent of streaming there are fewer and fewer genuine live event television moments, and apart from sport they are scarce, especially one that the whole of Europe watches at the same time. Last year the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) claimed that 163 million people watched the three live shows across its 37 broadcasters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In one way this doesn’t seem particularly remarkable: Wilson is an esteemed food writer who presumably has a surplus of kitchen utensils crammed into her bulging cupboards. This tin, though, was different. For one thing it was heart-shaped. For another, Wilson had used it to bake her wedding cake 23 years earlier, taking care to leave out the cherries because her husband-to-be loathed them. (This now strikes her as ominous: “Maybe a man who was so fussy about cherries was not the man for me.”) Lurking at the back of Wilson’s mind had been the thought that she would soon be using the heart-shaped tin to bake a cake for their silver wedding anniversary. But now here it was, lying dejectedly at her feet and, she couldn’t help noticing, spotted with rust.In this delightful book, part memoir, part anthropological investigation, food writer Wilson explores the way that kitchen objects have the power to move, soothe and even reproach us. There’s the plate you feel compelled to eat off because it makes everything taste nicer, or that bowl you keep but can’t bear to use because it reminds you too much of the person who gave it to you. In the maelstrom of her new living conditions, Wilson worries that she is overdoing the anthropomorphism: there is a big cast-iron knife that she can’t bear to pick up because it is the one her ex-husband always used and “to touch its smooth handle would have felt like holding his hand”.It turns out that Wilson need not have worried that she was, in her words, going “mad” by ascribing personalities and human meaning to bits of wood and stainless steel. Magical thinking, the textbooks reassure her, is a universal aspect of human cultures. It also provides the propulsion for this engaging collection of 30-odd short essays organised around ordinary people’s complicated feelings for egg whisks and apple corers. Among the kitchenalia that Wilson sets before us is a much-loved pressure cooker belonging to a Tuscan diplomat’s wife which saw service after the second world war in Senegal and Mumbai (pressure cookers, incidentally, turn out to be ancient bits of kit, going all the way back to 1679). There’s also a silver toast rack that Wilson’s mother, slipping into Alzheimer’s, is convinced has been stolen by a burglar who wants it for a particularly fancy picnic.Closer to home is a humble red, plastic washing-up bowl. It was a gift from a thoughtful neighbour who spotted that the newly single Wilson was now in charge not only of the cooking for her three hungry children but all the washing up too. The bowl had a cheerful, purposeful look to it, as if urging Wilson to look on the bright side. And it worked: “Every time I looked at it filled with hot sudsy water, I felt that washing up might actually be cool and Danish rather than tedious and mildly oppressive.”A book concerned with rummaging in other people’s kitchen drawers might start to feel claustrophobic, but Wilson is careful to let the light in. She interviews Sasha Correa, a Venezuelan who recalls how for 60 evenings in a row in 2002, her family – five sisters plus their mother and father – went out on to their balcony in Caracas and banged pots for an hour to protest against the authoritarian policies of the country’s president, Hugo Chávez. These “casserole protests” have become a feature throughout Latin America, though recently they have been seen in Europe, too. During the “Kitchenware Revolution” of 2009-2011, Icelandic citizens clashed and clattered in protest at their government’s dire handling of the country’s financial crisis.It is no surprise to learn that Wilson’s obsession with kitchen vernacular has a genetic element. Her grandfather, Norman Wilson, was the production director of Wedgwood during the middle decades of the 20th century. Under his auspices, thousands of dinner plates and gravy boats sailed out into the world in a variety of patterns from the classic Willow to Summer Sky, a beautiful pale pearlescent blue with a white trim. By far and away Mr Wilson’s personal favourite, though, was Kutani Crane, featuring a turquoise crane set against a multicoloured floral arrangement. Although extremely popular with customers, Norman Wilson’s descendants found Kutani Crane fussy and clotted, and competed to offload unwanted heirlooms on each other.Consequently, Wilson admits that she has developed ambivalent feelings about the family china. Recently, she opened another little-used cupboard only to find two Kutani Crane vegetable tureens squatting, dusty, unloved and vaguely malevolent. Despite feeling “strangled” by them, filial obligation had so far stopped her from sending them to the charity shop. Looking at them now, Wilson has a revelation: “What if I had become the Kutani Crane in the marriage?” – in other words, something that her ex-husband felt a grudging duty towards, but not quite enough to keep. In the end, the tureens, unlike the marriage, get a last-minute reprieve. Bundled up into the attic, they are biding their sulky time until Wilson’s children are old enough to decide whether a clean break is in order.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

There is something of Dostoevsky’s The House of the Dead and also – with the appearance of two strangely grinning, singing men in a railway carriage – Kafka’s The Castle.‘Putin is just the frontman’: Sergei Loznitsa, the Ukrainian film-maker who refuses to be cancelledRead moreLoznitsa moreover allows us also to register that the wretched political prisoner of his tale is a veteran of Stalin’s brutal battle to suppress the Ukrainian nationalist Symon Petliura. And given the nightmarish claustrophobia and disorientation in the scenes in cells, official corridors, staircases and government antechambers, there is maybe a filmic footnote in the fact that Demidov worked for the scientist Lev Landau, the subject of Ilya Khrzhanovsky’s huge and deeply pessimisticmulti-movie installation project Dauin 2020.The first prosecutor of the title is Kornyev, played by Aleksandr Kuznetsov, an idealistic young lawyer, given a startlingly early promotion to a state prosecutor role – his beardless youth fascinates and irritates the grizzled old time-servers with whom he comes into contact.He has received a bizarre “letter” from Stepniak (Aleksandr Fillipenko) an ageing and desperately ill high security prisoner in Bryansk – written in blood on a piece of torn cardboard (which has escaped the bonfire that prison authorities make of protest letters like these). The letter alleges that the security services, the NKVD, are without reference to the rule of law, using the prisons and judicial system to torture and murder an entire older generation of party veterans like him, to bring in a fanatically loyal but callow and incompetent cohort of Stalin loyalists.The prison authorities make the politely persistent Kornyev wait hours before being allowed to visit Stepniak in his cell, transparently hoping he will just give up and go away – Loznitsa shows this weaponised inertia is the traditional official approach to petitioners everywhere in the Soviet Union.View image in fullscreenInfectious … Two Prosecutors, directed by Sergei Loznitsa.Photograph: Cannes film fesitvalThey also claim that the prisoner’s ill health and possible infection mean Kornyev really should “postpone” his visit. It is an obvious obfuscation and yet the idea of getting infected by Stepniak has a weird and queasy relevance.Horrified by Stepniak’s appalling condition and the evidence of torture, and aware of Stepniak’s own respected legal scholarship and expertise (he is perhaps the second prosecutor of the title), Kornyev gets on a train to Moscow to raise his concerns with the highest possible authority – convinced that the locals will do nothing – and this is the deadpan chief prosecutor Vyshinsky (Anatoliy Beliy) who makes Kornyev wait hours just like the prison governor and listens to his explosive allegations with unsettlingly attentive calm.From here, there are more bizarre hints of an occult conspiracy to frighten and deter and contain Kornyev – meetings with people who appear to have nothing to do with each other but who, like the various neighbours in Rosemary’s Baby, are in fact connected. On the train to Moscow, Kornyev encounters a garrulous old soldier with a wooden leg who is an eerie doppelganger of the prisoner Stepniak (and played by the same actor) and who makes wisecracks about young Kornyev being a virgin which are to be uncannily echoed later.In the government building, Kornyev meets a young man who claims to be his law-school contemporary, pointedly asking about this case he is pursuing – but Kornyev can’t remember ever having met him before. And most disturbingly of all, Kornyev runs into a strange man, perhaps a petitioner, who stands up against the wall motionless, evidently paralysed with fear, hoping that no official person will talk to him and who asks Kornyev in a low whisper which is the way out of there. Perhaps Kornyev himself should himself become very inconspicuous and motionless before making his own exit.It is a very disturbing parable of the insidious micro-processes of tyranny.Two Prosecutors screened at the Cannes film festivalExplore more on these topicsFilmCannes film festivalUkraineRussiaFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

And it gestures at the terrible pathos of the old GDR, which laboured and sacrificed for 40 years after the war in Soviet vassalage finally to discover it was for nothing. The film’s original German title is In Die Sonne Schauen, or Staring at the Sun.The action takes place in the same location in four different timeframes: a farm in Saxony-Anhalt in northeastern Germany, four buildings enclosing a courtyard. In the years during and just after the first world war, a young man called Fritz (Filip Schnack) has a leg amputated due to what the family agrees was a “work accident”; he must be bathed and intimately attended to by maid Trudi (Luzia Oppermann) who is herself bearing the burden of unnameable cruelty. The centre of this chapter is Alma (Hanna Heckt) a little girl who regards with bland, uncomprehending acceptance the family’s strange traditions, its macabre “death photographs” of deceased family members, and is puzzled by a photograph like this of someone who looks like her.Some years later, in the same household, Erika (Lea Drinda) conceives a morbid, quasi-erotic fascination with older “Uncle Fritz” (Martin Rother) and with her own fantasy self-image as an amputee. Later again, in the old East Germany, Angelika (Lena Urzendowsky) is a teen working on the farm, abused by her odious Uncle Uwe (Konstantin Lindhorst) and dreamily aware that Uwe’s son – that is, her cousin Rainer (Florian Geisselmann) – is resentfully in love with her. When Angelika joins the family group for a Polaroid group photo, she experiences an uncanny fate like Alma. And still later, in modern unified Germany, Lenka (Laeni Geiseler) befriends a strange, intense girl called Kaya (Ninel Geiger) whose mother has died.Gradually and incrementally the connections between the characters reveal themselves, and the film also hints at more characters and more uncanny and foretold events yet to come. What unites them is not just the farm but the river in which they swim, which forms part of the border with the west, and which contains slitheringly repulsive eels, like the English fenland.Perhaps like Haneke’s The White Ribbon, Mascha Schilinski’s film is something like a ghost story or even a folk-horror and there is a clammy unease in every shot as the camera drifts up and away from scenes like a ghost; the soundtrack throbs and groans with ambient disquiet. It is dense with fear and sadness.Sound of Falling screened at the Cannes film festivalExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsGermanyEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

But is there really any point in making them recall these hideous crimes? And why have crucial details been omitted?Lucy ManganWed 14 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 04.26 EDTShareAnother day, another addition to the “point and gasp” school of true crime documentaries; one which adds nothing to our understanding of a terrible crime or of those who committed it, nothing to our safety as individuals or as a society, nothing except our appetite for voyeurism and the normalisation of it. Most true crime documentaries are in this school. Fred & Rose West: A British Horror Story is no exception. Perhaps the sordid, exploitative aspects of the genre are felt more strongly here precisely because it is one of our own stories, and one many of us remember reading about in the papers and seeing on the news as the awful discoveries were made at the time. Usually we watch these films at one remove. We can at least feel we are learning about how terrible America can be, or that a victim who would otherwise be forgotten amid the great mass of victims evil people create has been memorialised. Here, we are more fiercely confronted with our complicity and the weakness of the arguments for watching.The best that can be said about the latest three-part testimony to human depravity is that it is superficial. It does not delve into the one aspect of the 1994 case that has the potential to edify – the backgrounds of the killers, the psychology of their relationship, and whether the world would have been different if they had not met; it also glosses quickly over the system’s failure to prosecute Fred West for rape early on in his murderous career – but neither does it dwell on the baser details of the case, the ones I suspect the officers and relatives interviewed here have in mind when they say how much this experience still haunts them.‘These murders still live with me’: the show that goes inside Fred and Rose West’s ‘house of horrors’Read moreThe first episode – titled simply “Fred” – covers the discovery of the bodies of, eventually, nine young women buried under the patio and in the basement of 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, home to Fred, Rose and the remainder of their 10 children who had not yet been taken into care. The programme gives the impression that the children’s references to their missing sister Heather being buried under the patio had simply become too frequent for the authorities to ignore. In fact, suspicion was primed by the claim of rape of one of the children that led to most going into care, where they were found to have many signs of physical and sexual abuse.View image in fullscreenFred and Rose West.Photograph: NetflixWe hear Fred’s voice on the police interview tapes as he is questioned about why he and Rose never filed a missing person’s report for Heather, who has not been seen since June 1987, and see him in the footage taken by police during his several visits to Cromwell Street to guide them round. He can’t remember the names of all the girls and women he (not Rose, he vehemently and repeatedly attests) bound, tortured, raped, killed and dismembered, but he marks the locations of their bodies as best he can with spray paint. At least one, Shirley Robinson, was heavily pregnant with his baby.The second episode, “Rose”, focuses on the police efforts to find the evidence that would tie her to the killings. There was no way, they felt, that she could not have known about the murders Fred had admitted to committing. The question was how much she was involved and how much they could prove. The safe house they had put her and the older children in was bugged, but she was only ever heard loudly proclaiming her innocence.The final episode outlines the trial. Fred killed himself before his could take place, but Rose stood accused of 10 counts of murder. The Wests’ former nanny Caroline Roberts testified at trial to Rose’s involvement with Caroline’s own kidnapping and subsequent ordeal. It was also proved that Fred was in prison when Charmaine West, his stepdaughter with his first wife (Rena, whom he killed), was murdered. Eventually Rose was unanimously found guilty of all 10 murders and given a life sentence, with the judge emphasising that she should never be considered for parole.And what are we to do with this information? What is the point of a programme that is little more than a bald summarisation of a bleak and terrible tale? This happened, then that happened, then this, then that. So what? What is the point? If you are not even calling proper attention to the many, many times authorities had concerns and could have intervened before nine people (at least – Fred suggested there were many more) died in horrific ways, what are you doing? Reminding us that evil can exist? Also pointless. If it brought a measure of peace to the victims’ relatives interviewed to remember them in public, I’m glad. But beyond that, it’s just a ratings hunt and it stinks.Fred and Rose West: A British Horror Story is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

It is, effectively, the final movie of the lateLaurent Cantet, who died last year.High-minded, progressive and literate, Laurent Cantet made a trio of brilliant films | Peter BradshawRead moreCantet was working on the screenplay with his longtime collaborator and contemporary, Robin Campillo and it is Campillo who now directs – and brings to the movie his usual intelligence and clarity.It is a story of growing pains and not fitting in and the painful mystery of being young. Enzo is a 16-year-old kid from a privileged background, living in a gorgeous villa with a swimming pool; to the intense chagrin of his maths teacher dad and engineer mum he has decided he wants to quit school and work with his hands on a building site as an apprentice. Meanwhile Enzo’s elder brother is poised for a prestigious university career.Enzo is embarrassingly mediocre at the job and clearly it is only his family’s standing which prevents him from being fired. His father thinks this is a self-harming affectation which might seriously damage his future; he believes Enzo’s talent at drawing means he should apply to art school – a far more acceptable middle-class career path.But of course this only makes stubborn Enzo more determined to tough it out at the building site where his incompetence baffles and annoys everyone. And Enzo is drawn to Vlad, a friendly young Ukrainian guy who is conflicted about not going back home to join the struggle against Russia.Enzo is fascinated by the sheer grownup importance of everything Vlad represents: Vlad has a sense of identity and a dramatic dilemma which is gratifyingly real in both its options: stay in France and do manual labour like a real man – or go home and fight? How much more heroic and magnificent is Vlad’s existence, how much more real than silly, muddled, spoiled Enzo’s dreary life choices? And Enzo’s interest in Vlad is romantic in every other sense.Of course, there’s something tragicomic and absurd about poor Enzo, absurd and humiliating in the way teenage yearning often is – and Enzo’s dad’s suspicion of self-harm turns out to be shrewder than he thought. Campillo and Cantet show us that the agonies of being young and existentially rebellious are not simply shallow and callow: they represent a state of idealism which is poignantly brief, like everything else about youth. It is another powerful, absorbing picture from Campillo and a fitting swan song for Laurent Cantet.Enzo screened at the Cannes film festivalExplore more on these topicsCannes film festivalLaurent CantetFestivalsDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The 20th-century modernist author and pioneer of stream-of-consciousness narration is one of the most celebrated British novelists of all time. For those looking to become more familiar with her work, author and critic Francesca Wade has put together a guide to her greatest hits.View image in fullscreenEmma D’Arcy as Rezia in a stage adaptation of Mrs Dalloway at the Arcola theatre in 2018.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianThe entry pointWoolf’s fiction often explores the relationship between self and society, turning on the disjunct between her characters’ private desires and other people’s expectations of them, and one of the best examples of this is Mrs Dalloway. From its opening line – “Mrs Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself” – Woolf plunges readers into the inner thoughts of her heroine, Clarissa, a society hostess running errands around London in preparation for a party she’s holding that June night. Among the people whose paths intersect with hers that June day is a shellshocked war veteran, Septimus Smith. Woolf wrote in her diary that she wanted, in Mrs Dalloway, to “dig out beautiful caves” behind her characters. The invisible depths and connections she creates between them give the novel a sense of holding all life within it.Her breakthroughWoolf’s first two novels, The Voyage Out and Night and Day, are bold in their subject matter but relatively conventional in form. In December 1910, she saw Roger Fry’s post-impressionist exhibition at London’s Grafton Galleries, which introduced works by artists including Matisse and Cézanne to British audiences, and was filled with ideas of how to represent the essence of a character without aiming for a straightforward, descriptive likeness. The result was Jacob’s Room, the novel in which Woolf claimed she found her own voice. It’s a scathing response to the destruction of war – a subject which haunts much of Woolf’s writing – and a deeply moving meditation on the impossibility of truly knowing others.Mrs Dalloway by Virginia Woolf review: ‘one brief day in a woman’s mind’ – archive, 1925Read moreThe most quotableWoolf was a brilliant polemicist. Her two book-length feminist essays – A Room of One’s Own and Three Guineas – are fascinating counterparts to her fiction. They probe the injustices that preoccupied her throughout her life, displaying how “the public and the private worlds are inseparably connected … the tyrannies and servilities of the one are the tyrannies and servilities of the other”. Each examines the way people are shaped by external forces – class, gender, access to education – and makes a powerful case for the importance of intellectual freedom. A Room of One’s Own focuses on literature, and conjures some of Woolf’s most inspired apparitions: the “Angel in the House”, the spectre of Victorian feminine propriety Woolf had to assassinate before she “plucked the heart out of my writing”, and Shakespeare’s eager sister, whose talents were never given a chance to flourish. Three Guineas, written amid the rise of fascism in Europe, examines the links between patriarchy and militarism: “As a woman,” Woolf writes, “I have no country. As a woman I want no country. As a woman my country is the whole world.”It’s worth persevering withWoolf’s seventh novel The Waves has a reputation of being difficult: it unfolds, in a rhythmic chorus of five voices, without any of the conventional crutches of narrative or character development. She told a friend she had composed the novel “in a kind of trance”. But it’s one of Woolf’s boldest experiments, the culmination of her explorations of the nature of perception and the realities of inner lives, and contains some of her most beautiful, lyrical language. “I am not concerned with the single life, but with lives together,” wrote Woolf in an early draft. In her essay Modern Fiction, Woolf argued that the task of the novelist is to evoke the same chaos that governs life: to “record the atoms as they fall upon the mind”. With The Waves, Woolf created a form which would convey her characters’ experience, thoughts and impressions as if in real time, tracing “the infinite loneliness of human beings” while also gesturing at the possibility of community.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

I love The London Scene, full of sparkling observations about the city which always energised her – its docks, its shops, its statues, its street life. Of her many essays on writing, Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown is a wonderful work of literary criticism and imagination, sweeping away the cobwebs from 19th-century realism and making the case for a new, and modern, approach to character. My favourite of all is Street Haunting, in which an excursion to buy a new pencil becomes an excuse to wander the city, gazing up into windows and imagining all the lives going on behind them. It’s the perfect analogy for Woolf’s own fictional method – the people-watching impulse she acquired when she first moved to Bloomsbury in 1904, and which never left her.The long-term project“Observe perpetually,” reads one of Woolf’s last diary entries, quoting Henry James. Woolf was always fascinated by people, and her diaries are full of piercing insights into herself and others. Woolf loved reading diaries, and her own lurk somewhere between private and public writing. Woolf’s diary was where she recorded Bloomsbury’s debates, parties and conversations, unleashed critiques of her friends, charted memories, practised description, analysed her own flaws, and battled with the struggle of writing. She wrote in her diary to “soothe the whirlpools” in her mind: entries are by turns introspective and expansive, personal and political. There are six volumes, covering (with some gaps and elisions) the years 1897 to 1941: they are worth reading slowly in full, and savouring.The masterpieceTo the Lighthouse is perhaps Woolf’s most personal novel – written in memory of her mother, who died when Woolf was 13, and childhood summers spent in St Ives, Cornwall. Through the eyes of the Ramsay family and others in their orbit – including the artist Lily Briscoe, one of Woolf’s most memorable characters – Woolf explores the passage of time, the nature of creation and the pain of loss.Explore more on these topicsBooksWhere to start withVirginia WoolffeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a departure from the deeper and more complex style of writing expressed in Greene’s better-known psychological and political thrillers including The Third Man, Our Man in Havana, The Power and the Glory, and Brighton Rock.Duel Duet, a collection of Graham Greene’s short stories to be released by Penguin in July.Photograph: Penguin“Greene wasn’t just a masterful novelist, he also excelled at the short story form, producing numerous classics,” said Andrew F Gulli, managing editor of Strand Magazine.“As a huge admirer of Graham Greene, whom I’ve often considered one of the 10 greatest writers of the 20th century, this piece was a personal highlight. It’s especially meaningful given that he published a chilling ghost story,A Little Place Off the Edgware Road, in the original Strand Magazine back in 1939.“While the story featured here may carry less overt menace, it still demonstrates Greene’s remarkable ability to hold a reader’s attention and subtly blur the line between entertainment and drama. Greene is a very serious author, and here there’s humor. It’s a playful yet chilling nod to the great supernatural stylists.”In the story, the protagonist recalls how reading Dracula and horror stories by MR James traumatized him as a child, and from then “he had never enjoyed reading alone in bed anything which might prove ghostly or violent”.So when he finds himself alone in the bedroom of a “strange” rented house on the Côte d’Azur, in the middle of a raging storm, and with only a paperback anthology of stories for company, his old fears come rushing back. In both the creepy story he reads, and the bedroom he is reading it in, there are mysterious scratching noises on the glass of the windows.Gulli said the manuscript was found in archives at the Harry Ransom Center library at the University of Texas at Austin, and was subsequently evaluated and transcribed by Camilla Greene, steward of the Greene literary estate and granddaughter of the writer, who died in 1991.“This eerie gem remained tucked away until now,” Gulli said.“It’s a story you can identify with. Weird things can happen to you when you’re traveling alone, not weird like this story, but I’ve had odd knocks on the door in the middle of the night, or some unusual creaking, or you have a nightmare or something.“It’s kind of like an everyday event andGraham Greene, with his great turn of phrase, his great style, turns it into something where it’s a what-if that can go a little too far, but just far enough to have a lot of interest to it.”The story by Fleming, meanwhile, called The Shameful Dream, is also a separation from the author’s traditional fare. It builds suspense through a series of recollections of previous firings as a London periodical’s literary editor prepares for a potentially fateful meeting with the publication’s overbearing proprietor.“While forever associated with the tuxedoed glamor of 007, Fleming was a talent who could transcend genre,” Gulli said.“This piece has no martinis, no Aston Martins and no villains bent on world domination. It’s a quietly unsettling story about a washed-up journalist wrestling with the dread of an invitation to a sadistic media mogul’s mansion, a tale more literary than spy thriller, revealing Fleming’s lesser-known capacity for irony and sharp social observation.”The story will also feature inTalk of the Devil, a collection of Fleming’s writings incorporating short-form fiction, travel essays, lectures, and correspondence with his friend and crime novelist Raymond Chandler, set to be published later this month.In July, 22 of Greene’s short stories will feature in another new collection, calledDuel Duet, published by Penguin.Duel Duet by Graham Greene (Vintage Publishing, £18.99).

The narrator, a young woman who considers herself unexceptional, recalls a break in a water main at the big roundabout, a rupture that revealed “white quartz pebbles being washed clean, rattling as they went like in any stream bed”. The surfaces we have built on the face of the Earth to sustain us are just that, only surfaces, easily cracked open to show what’s roiling beneath.And this is how it is at the end of the world in Water in the Desert Fire in the Night. The setup for this slender, evocative debut will be eerily familiar to all its readers, albeit with the disaster quotient kicked up a notch. A pandemic arises and begins its cull, only this one is unstoppable: it results in whole streets full of the dead. Those who survive – and we don’t know why they do – must stick together, and so this is a tale of unlikely alliances between a group of travellers determined to reach a refuge in the south of France, a place called Digne-les-Bains.One of this scrappy band, an older woman called Sarah, had spent time there in the 1970s – according to her it is an “epicentre of practical possibilities for the new world of disorder”, with hot springs, rich forests, wild mushrooms, plentiful deer. Like Cormac McCarthy’s The Road or Octavia E Butler’s Parable of the Sower, this is the novel of a journey both away from and toward. Its originality lies in the appeal of the narrative voice, one of millennial diffidence that is still somehow salted with optimism. “So, to be straight: I didn’t see it coming, I don’t know why it happened, and I don’t know what’s going to happen.”Dick creates a world where everything has not quite fallen apart, though we know that real collapse can’t be far awayDick creates a world where everything has not quite fallen apart, not yet, though we know that real collapse can’t be far away. One might argue that there are three vantage points from which to consider societal destruction, whatever its source. There’s the moment of violent change – HG Wells’s The War of the Worlds fits this pattern. There is radical alteration long established, as in Margaret Atwood’sThe Handmaid’s Tale. And there is the space just past seismic change, when a novel’s characters acknowledge what is gone, still recall how things used to be, must find their feet in a new and frightening reality – Ben Smith’sDoggerlandcomes to mind. Water in the Desert falls into this category, prompting the reader to wonder: how will I fare when things go belly-up?So it’s easy to identify with the narrator as she goes along for the ride of survival. Along with Sarah – a retired midwife, which comes in handy – and the narrator are the charismatic Pressure Drop, a Dubliner who has turned to Rastafarianism, and the young and idealistic Adi. They leave London for the Sussex coast and prepare to cross the Channel; there they encounter Martin, whose practicality will aid the expedition and who will capture the narrator’s heart. “I don’t believe in love at first sight, but actually whether you believe in something or not has nothing to do with whether or not it exists.” Yet these characters never feel fully rounded; there is something thin about them as they make their way towards imagined safety. The narrative can stray towards the obvious, as when one suffers a minor injury – something that would once have been easily treatable but now proves fatal. It’s hard to be moved by this death, which feels instrumental; designed to prove a point, rather than emotionally true.One of the most compelling characters in the book sits firmly in flashback: the narrator’s late mother Heike, born in East Germany, married to an Englishman, who made a life for the family in Cuba before settling in London. She is just the kind of person you’d want around at the end of the world, but a memory must suffice. “Even as a mortified teenager I knew that it wasn’t just right the way we lived, it was cool. And it made an amazing backdrop, because it was beautiful through and through: her rows of jars of many-coloured pickles and preserves; her allotment overflowing with everything worth growing; the cover of a thousand mends that she crocheted for the sofa that was in the house when we arrived, and was still in it twenty-odd years later when I left.”The destination isn’t the point of this novel; it is the journey. Somehow, hope endures. “There’s only forward, and you can only go forward from where you are, however wrecked that place is.” Words to live by, these days.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

You can play a whole international tournament in the Fifa titles, but what they never show is the way the competition seeps into the everyday lives of supporters, how whole towns are overtaken, how aWorld Cupcan become a national obsession. The way most of us experience the really big matches is through stolen moments of vicarious glory on televisions and giant pub screens, surrounded by friends and family and the sounds and images of real life.This is the territory of Despelote, a beautiful, utterly transportive game about childhood and memory, set during Ecuador’s historic 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign. Football-mad eight-year-old Julián – a semi-autobiographical version of the game’s co-designer Julián Cordero – has just watched the team beat Peru, but now four more matches stand betweenEcuadorand the World Cup finals in Japan and Korea. Structured as a series of short, immersive tableaux, Despelote gives us control of Julián as he goes about his life, buffeted by his parents and teachers between shopping trips, car journeys and school lessons.View image in fullscreenSomething of what it was like to be a kid … Despelote.Photograph: Panic GamesThe key scenes are where you are left alone, perhaps in a town square, or at a family get-together – and you experience something of what it was like to be a kid given crucial moments of freedom and agency. You listen in on adult conversations, watch an old man feeding pigeons, say hi to a shopkeeper, have a kickabout with friends – the world is depicted as a series of grainy photos, washed with single colours – a beautiful visual device replicating the haziness of our oldest memories, the background details indistinct behind the personal, emotional events.As the game goes on, depictions of Julián’s childhood merge and interchange with recollections of later teenage parties and responsibilities. We also learn about the sociopolitical background to the World Cup campaign: Ecuador is in the midst of a financial crisis, hyperinflation has bankrupted companies and gobbled up savings – in this context, the potential glory of footballing success becomes vital and talismanic. The tournament is discussed in the streets and at weddings, it permeates everything.But other aspects of Ecuadorian life and culture are drawn in too. You learn about the music, the food and the rebirth of the domestic film industry, via the 1999 crime film Ratas, ratones, rateros directed by Julián Cordero’s father, Sebastián Cordero. In this way, real life impinges on the game world, like a poetic and self-referential Agnès Varda film, and in one lovely sequence, while Julián is engrossed in a footie sim on the family’s console, his onscreen player leaves the pitch and wanders home – to Julián’s own house: a beautiful, subtle comment on embodiment, fantasy and the act of playing.Despelote recalls some of the great works of independent narrative game design – The Unfinished Swan, Gravity Bone, Virginia – yet it is also something thrillingly of itself. Even though it’s a game about one small boy in a specific rendering of Ecuador, it communicates the near-universal power of football as a cohesive social narrative: the way the Dutch team of 74, Maradona’s genius in 1986, and Gascoigne’s goal against Scotland at Euro 96 came to say something about the nations that produced them. At the same time, as we draw closer to the final matches of the qualifying round and the excitement and tension becomes palpable, the camera and narration pull back, beyond the structured world of the game and into a meditation on the creative process itself. This is fascinating, formally daring stuff that, in its two-hour playtime, asks more questions about the nature of memory, simulation and identity than a dozen 100-hour epics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Much has been made of the fact that the year’s most recent breakout hit, an idiosyncratic role-playing game called Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, was made by a small team. (It has just sold its two-millionth copy). It’s a tempting narrative in this age ofblockbuster mega-flops,live-service gamesandeye-watering budgets: scrappy team makes a lengthy, unusual and beautiful thing, sells it for £40, and everybody wins. But it’s notquiteaccurate.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Sandfall Interactive, the game’s French developer, comprises around 30 people, butas Rock Paper Shotgun points out, there are many more listed in the game’s credits – from a Korean animation team to the outsourced quality assurance testers, and the localisation and performance staff who give the game and its story heft and emotional believability.Compared to the enormous teams who make the Final Fantasy games – a clear inspiration for Sandfall – Clair Obscur’s team is minuscule. The more interesting achievement isn’t that a small team has made a successful game – it’s that a small team has made the most extravagantly French thing any of us will ever play. Much to my partner’s annoyance, I’ve set the voice language to French with English subtitles, just to enhance the immersion.In Clair Obscur’s belle époque-inspired world, a sinister entity called the Paintress daubs a number on a distant totem every year, descending from 100 – and every person of that age dissolves heartbreakingly into petals and dust, leaving behind devastated partners and orphaned children. (This andNevaare the only games in recent memory to make me shed a tear at theirbeginning.) The game starts as the Paintress counts down from 34 to 33, and an expedition of brave and slightly magic thirtysomethings from the dwindling population sets out, as they do every year, to sail across to the Paintress’s continent and try to kill her and stop the cycle. I was sad to leave this opening area, because the city was so beautiful, and everyone wasimpeccablydressed. Also, nothing was trying to kill me every few minutes.View image in fullscreenThe most French thing you’ll ever play … Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.Photograph: Sandfall InteractiveMany expeditions have gone before. You find their grisly remnants all over the place as you explore, their recorded diaries left to help whoever comes next. You start off in a kind of ravaged Paris, the Eiffel Tower distorting towards a distant horizon like a Dalí painting. The game looks like a waltz through a distinguished art museum that’s about to get sucked into a black hole. One early area of the continent is a waterless ocean, the wrecked vessel of one expedition wrapped around a dead leviathan of a sea creature, fronts of seaweed waving in the nonexistent currents. It’s beautiful but extremely dangerous: you quickly have to get the hang of a pretty complicated combat system to survive even the first few boss fights.Clair Obscur’s fighting is inspired by classic and modern Japanese RPGs: rhythmic and flashy, it lets you supercharge a fireball or dodge the fist of a stone automaton with a well-timed button press. Combining your unusually distinctive characters’ abilities is the key. One of them wields a rapier and changes stance every attack, another attacks with an impenetrable system of sun and moon tarot cards, a third mostly with a gun and a sword. If this all sounds needlessly extravagant, it is – and I love it. The combat menus are a tinkerer’s dream, letting you pore over and combine characters’ esoteric powers and skills to create interesting combo attacks.What I enjoy most about this game is that it doesn’t look like everything else or, indeed, anything else. The majority of games riff on the same few predictable references: Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Marvel. Instead it draws from completely different aesthetic and thematic sources; this is a baroque fantasy that tells a story about fatalism and love and death and legacy, a European-style tale with Japanese-style action and flair. It plays very differently, but its distinctiveness and determination to actuallysaysomething with its story reminds me of last year’s excellentMetaphor: ReFantazio. (There is a strong correlation between intellectually ambitious RPGs and baffling titles, it seems.)Clair Obscur also illustrates just how good game development tools are now: if you’re wondering how a smallish team could create something that looks this high-end, that’s a large part of the answer. This makes me feel pretty optimistic about the future of this middle sector of game development, in between blockbuster and indie. In the 00s and 2010s, that was where many of the most interesting games could be found. I can imagine several large publishers deeming this game simply too French to be marketable, but Sandfall was able to make it anyway. Expedition 33 is an encouraging commercial success that will be cited all year as a counternarrative to the games industry’s prevailing doomsaying, but it’s a creative success, too.What to playView image in fullscreenA thrill a minute … Doom: The Dark Ages.Photograph: BethesdaA new Doom game is out very shortly and reviews suggest that it is a glorious heavy-metal orgy of violence. It has you massacring hordes of gross demons at once, impaling them with spikes, shredding them with a chainsaw-shield, even punching gigantic hellspawn from within a giant robot or shooting at them from the back of a mecha-dragon.Doom:The Dark Agesis slower than the other modern games in the series, with more up-close combat and (as the title suggests) a vaguely medieval flavour to its aesthetic, but it’s still thrill-a-minute.Available on:Xbox, PS5, PCEstimated playtime:20-plus hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenChaos machine … Grand Theft Auto VI.Photograph: Rockstar GamesGrand Theft Auto VI, which is delayed until next May, left a crater in the 2025 release schedule that other game companies are scrambling to fill, reports Bloomberg (viaKotaku).

Press Pause? Save Point? LFG? I would pick shorter games for a book club-style group (so that everyone could actually play them through), and I’d want ones that leave room for people’s personal histories to inform how they respond to it. I’d love to hear other people talk aboutNeva’s environmentalist and parental themes, or anyLifeIs Strangegame’s mix of emerging-adulthood drama and quasi-successful supernatural storytelling, or even a game likeWhile Waiting, what it made them think about. That would surely be more interesting than simply arguing about whether the latestAssassin’s Creedis any good.I asked my partner what he’d call a video game book club, and he suggested Text Adventure, which is annoyingly better than anything I can think of.

I wasn’t aware of the impact an Olivier win could have. We were already in conversations with different organisations around the world about getting the show out internationally – those have stepped up quite dramatically.Philippa Hogg (actor, musician and creative associate):The ceremony was so much fun. We came on at the Royal Albert Hall to this roar from thousands of people.Clare Foster (plays Elowen Keene):Our fans are incredible. One gave me this beautiful letter with a wooden box, which had a pickled crab design. It could belong on our set. I opened it and it was the Diary of Elowen.Darren Clark (music and lyrics, co-music supervisor, orchestrator and arranger):There are generous souls working on this show – we talk about people who are “Button”. One of those qualities is an open heart; another is a curiosity about life.John Dagleish (plays Benjamin Button):Any story that is very human works well through the lens of an absurd conceit, like a man ageing backwards. The message about making the most of the time you have is much more poignant with a life led the opposite way around because there is a finite number of years and a specific end date.View image in fullscreenDarren Clark, John Dagleish and Jethro Compton at the Olivier awards, where The Curious Case of Benjamin Button won three prizes.Photograph: Joanne DavidsonPhilippa Hogg:Everyone on that stage feels connected to the themes, particularly being an outsider. It feels like a band of misfits telling the story of a misfit. Playing instruments and singing together is an ancient art form. You have to listen so hard when you play music and sing together and that ultimately connects people on a deeper level than just playing a scene. And this is very much a non-hierarchical piece – that’s quite rare.Jethro Compton:There’s nothing like it in the West End. An actor-musician storytelling show is very different to what people are used to experiencing here. It would not have been developed this way if it had originated in the commercial sector instead of the fringe.Musicalsare so expensive to develop that producers aren’t taking risks. This show has a title that people may have heard of from the film and short story but it’s created by a group of unknown people, pretty much. That’s part of its charm.Clare Foster:Telling an entire lifespan on stage makes people reflect on their own lives. They leave wanting to call their mum or to hold their partner’s hand a bit tighter because it deals with the big stuff. When my friends come and watch, they don’t – spoiler alert! – cope with me dying very well.John Dagleish:But Jethro has this phrase that he uses: “shitting on the romance”. Whenever anything becomes melodramatic or a bit too sepia, he pumps the brakes and throws in a little gag. It allows the audience a bit of respite from the heaviness.View image in fullscreenPhilippa Hogg, leaping, in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianClare Foster:When I joined the company, Jethro talked so much about it as an ensemble show. That word can get thrown around a lot. But it really is an ensemble in its core. A cast of actor-musicians changes the dynamic of a company because there’s an inherent reliance on each other. It never feels like a particular person is singing a song with a band; it feels like a group of storytellers collaborating.Darren Clark:There’s something in the show for everyone to reflect on. I wanted the music to feel like it was sort of rushing over you like a wave. There would be moments where you felt like you were inside a storm and others when the water was lapping at your toes.Anna Kelsey (costume designer and associate stage designer):We wanted the set to feel like it was all falling into the ocean. The stage at the Ambassadors theatre is already raked. We added more of a rake, which does look great, but there was a lot of adjusting to it.Philippa Hogg:We dropped a tankard and it rolled into someone’s lap in the front row! It takes some getting used to for the body, especially when you’re dancing, as your centre of gravity is a bit wonky. But it kind of gives that rickety pier feel.Anna Kelsey:On some shows the pieces don’t all seem to come together. But with this one, they really did. We knew we wanted Benjamin to wear a suit and for it to feel like he was filling it out as as he gets younger. So at the beginning of the show, John is very hunched over and his jacket has been cut to be oversized. At one point, he changes it for one made of the same fabric but with a cut that fits him better. Then he changes his hair in the interval, too. It all helps the process without that transformation becoming the focus of the show.John Dagleish:With Benjamin, we didn’t want to do a send-up caricature of an old man, a Julie Walters “two soups” kind of thing! We wanted to find something real that wasn’t based on makeup or prosthetics – something that would be believable without being too showy. So we discussed this idea of weight in his movement and a voice like I’ve been shouting all night, a shallowness of breath.Anna Kelsey:We did talk about him having a moustache at the top of the show. We cut it because no character ageing normally through the show is aided by anything like that. Also finding a place where John could actually take it off was challenging!View image in fullscreen‘His jacket has been cut to be oversized’ … John Dagleish as Benjamin Button.Photograph: Marc BrennerJohn Dagleish:I’d forgotten about the moustache! It would have felt more like you’re doing a “bit”, rather than selling this as authentically as we could sell it.Anna Kelsey:There was this idea that the swirling ensemble are called strangers. We talked about them being sort of washed up out of the ocean. The ensemble colours were timeless tones of the earth, sea and coast. But for the main characters I referenced items like life buoys, fishing floats, manmade colours of the coastline – so Benjamin’s got a bit of yellow, Elowen has orange.Philippa Hogg:The mystical nature of Benjamin Button, and the folkloric way that we tell the story, has so much truth in it. Elowen sings the line “for a person can be old and yet be young”. We all have that childlike nature in us but then young children can have these moments of profound wisdom. You think: where the hell did that come from? If anything, the show has made me think the traditional concept of ageing is a load of rubbish.John Dagleish:Benjamin is a very wise but naive character when he’s born. Jethro described it like, he’s already had all of the experiences but he just doesn’t remember them yet. So you’re playing this kind of childish naivety but with some sense of maturity and wisdom behind it as well. And then, as the younger man, I get to play it with a wealth of experience as well as an impetuous midlife crisis kind of vibe.Jethro Compton:If you try to make the fact that he is born old in any way believable or realistic, it doesn’t work. I think the 2008 film version went wrong in that they made him baby-sized, so the whole thing is a bit weird. The more absurd we made it, the more we leaned into making it a fairytale, the quicker the audience could accept it and move on. Benjamin is born old and falls in love with a younger woman. But I was very conscious of not wanting it to be creepy or sinister.Clare Foster:There’s something that’s a little bit ick about the concept but Jethro and Darren have done such a great job. I don’t think you ever really feel the ick!View image in fullscreenThe company at the Ambassadors theatre.Photograph: Marc BrennerJethro Compton:Largely that comes down to the ages of the actors that we cast but also that Elowen is the driving force of the relationship. Benjamin is not pursuing her – she very much pursues him. She doesn’t care what age he may or may not be, she’s only interested in who he is as a person.Clare Foster:The producer Richard Darbourne, who I did Guys and Dolls with 10 years ago, messaged me and said: you should come in for this. His text said: “High stakes, big heart, you eat that shit for breakfast!” It was one of those lovely rare auditions where, in the room, it just felt like the right fit.Philippa Hogg:Before we go on stage we do a physical and vocal warmup then come together in a big circle, arms around each other. Anyone from the cast or crew then has the opportunity to dedicate that performance to someone or something they have experienced that makes them think of the show. So we have a focus for the next couple of hours.John Dagleish:Jethro sent me some recordings of the earlier production and I fell in love with the music immediately. I remember the first day of rehearsal when I joined the company. What you would normally do is sit around a table and have a read-through. But we basically had a play-through with all of these amazing actor-musicians. Within the first two songs, everyone was in tears.View image in fullscreenAnn Marcuson, Clare Foster and Philippa Hogg in rehearsals.Photograph: Marc BrennerDarren Clark:I would say there’s probably between 10 and 15 songs that were cut over the years. We’d write a version of something, then take a little bit of that and write another one and so on. It’s like making whisky, it’s about distilling the idea. My life changed so much during the period of writing it. I became a father, I got married. A lot of the life that I have now is encapsulated within those years of making the show. I put the essence of my experience as a father into some of the lyrics.Jethro Compton:We partnered with new producers for theWest End. There were definite challenges in scaling up the show. We redeveloped it, with a new cast except for two of the company from when we did it at Southwark Playhouse.Anna Kelsey:One of the challenges we had back then was how hot the actors got. We had a lot more layers of costume. Our coastal reference images included thick fishing jumpers which I love the look of but it’s so impractical as the actors were just on the move all the time.Philippa Hogg:Before moving to Southwark Playhouse Elephant, we put it on at Southwark’s Little stage with a cast of five in 2019. I remember thinking: how the hell are we going to do this tastefully? For Benjamin’s entrance, there was a big creaky puppet made of driftwood that kind of flew apart into different pieces and then James Marlowe played Benjamin until the end when we had a child puppet made of buckets and bits of beach plastic. Benjamin and Little Jack didn’t go to sea in the earlier version; they went to the mines.Anna Kelsey:We got loads of costumes from car boot fairs and charity shops. There was no time for anyone to leave the stage for a costume change, with all of the music to consider.View image in fullscreenJames Marlowe, centre, as Benjamin Button at Southwark Playhouse, London, in 2019.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDarren Clark:Guitar is my home instrument. I knew that there would be lots of guitars with Celtic folk tunings. And fiddles, mandolin and the cello which feels like a human voice. There’s nothing quite like a solo cello playing something beautiful and mournful. And then I’d always had this vision of two sets of drums. I wanted to be able to capture vast and epic, as well as intimate and beautiful. That’s the way life operates: we have big moments and tiny moments.Jethro Compton:We did a week of previews in Salisbury before we went to London. That original production was self-financed and self-produced – I built the set, drove the van, did too many jobs myself.Philippa Hogg:For the first performances, we rehearsed in Cornwall. We had a couple of cottages in Bude. It really informed the feel of the show because every night we were on the beach. We had two actors playing Elowen. So I played her in part one, which takes you to the age of about 35, and then Rosalind Ford played her in part two.Jethro Compton:We rented out a space above a bowling alley in Bude for a week. We put the whole set together, rehearsed it for a week, then did a first sharing. An invited dress rehearsal basically. A number of local people were there, including my father who played with a ukulele group beforehand then stayed to watch. The cast size was hugely different, but its heart was the same.Darren Clark:It’s a deeply flawed short story but I saw the potential in it. Jethro added the tension of Benjamin trying to hide a secret.Jethro Compton:Fitzgerald’s story is ultimately a fairytale. That folklorish quality fit really well with the world of a Cornish folk musical. I didn’t particularly enjoy reading the story – it’s very dated, cold. But I liked the fact that I didn’t like the story. In my experience, adapting something that you think is a bit flawed allows you more freedom because you’re not too respectful to the material. Sometimes you need to be unafraid to break it and make something new.View image in fullscreen‘I liked the fact that I didn’t like the original story’ … Jethro Compton.Photograph: Marc BrennerDarren Clark:When it was a show for five performers, often only two of those people were playing instruments in any number. That first version had spirit and soul, but it didn’t have the depth of the story we wanted to tell.Philippa Hogg:I’d just worked with Darren on another show and in 2018 he asked me to record a demo for Benjamin Button. It was The Moon and the Sea. I was like, wow, something special is going on here.Darren Clark:I had been rather badly burned by a previous project that made me want to test my collaborators before getting involved. So when Jethro sent me a lyric I restructured it entirely, set it to music and sent it back. I thought, if this guy can take this, then he’s the kind of guy I want to work with, because it’ll be all about the story. He came back almost immediately, added his own suggestions and the song grew even before we had officially signed a contract.Jethro Compton:After making a lot of work set in America, I wanted to do something closer to home. I thought Cornwall would be a good setting but had never made a musical before … I was terrified about how to even begin!The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttonis at the Ambassadors theatre, London, and the cast recording is available to stream from 16 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndMusicalsF Scott FitzgeraldShareReuse this content"

All the fuss is justified. Set against the impending execution of Anne Boleyn, 1536 is an effortlessly funny, bold and ballsy play, which asks the question: just how much have things really changed for women today?View image in fullscreenCaptive for too long … Liv Hill in 1536.Photograph: Helen MurrayWhile the historical backdrop is dramatic, this is largely a play of small and arresting moments. Max Jones’s stark set – full of long lush grass and empty horizons – never changes. We’re in a forgotten field in Essex, where three female friends meet, talk, prod and tease each other. The long grass blows and the sky, thanks to Jack Knowles’ emotive lighting, seems to throb with the promise of other, grander lives playing out somewhere far away.It might have felt a bit static were it not for Pickett’s brilliant eye for detail and three captivating central performances. There’s midwife Mariella who – rather refreshingly – hates her job and whom Tanya Reynolds imbues with a bristling, fragile competence. Liv Hill is lovable and loathable as “good girl” Jane, who longs for marriage and brims with anxiety, vulnerability and – as the plot darkens – something steely and ugly too.At the heart of things is Siena Kelly’s thunderbolt of a character, Anna. Practically half the scenes begin with her thrust up against a tree, as she dangles her sexuality in front of men like a horribly dangerous toy. She’s selfish. Brave. Naive. Knowing. As news of Boleyn’s awful fate reaches these three women, Kelly’s Anna seems to physically bolt and buck against the world – a wild horse frantic at being kept in captivity for far too long.‘I don’t buy it’ … Ava Pickett on her play about Anne Boleyn’s treason and incestRead moreDirected with wit and vigour byLyndsey Turner, 1536 is both an easy and a deeply unsettling watch. The contemporary parallels sometimes feel slightly overplayed and, dare I say it, I could have seen more of the men. When they do appear, the scenes glimmer with menace and we are plunged into a world where even the slightest gesture – the refusal to eat a sweet, say – feels fraught with an all-too recognisable danger.At theAlmeida, London, until 7 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreAlmeida theatreLyndsey TurnerMonarchyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Laith Elzubaidi’s autobiographical play is not about immigrants, refugees or asylum seekers inflicting a sense of alienation on British society. It describes what they contend with psychologically, often in silence, and how it ripples down to the next generation.Tommy Sim’aan, playing the part of Laith, recounts early memories of his Shia Muslim parents who fled Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship and who bury their unspoken PTSD and fear in a semblance of hard-working normality in Wembley, north-west London.Politically, the play illustrates the notion that “we are here because you were there”, joining up the apparent immigrant invasion with Britain’s colonial invasions abroad. Laith’s parents are here because Britain was there. The 2003 Iraq war plays out on televisions strewn around Liam Bunster’s set; this was not the first time Britain occupied Iraq – that was in 1914, Laith tells us.The dominating note is not anger but humour. The production, directed by Emily Ling Williams, is set up as a lively monologue, with the bearing of a standup comedy act. Sim’aan is the joker-narrator, raising his eyebrow at the foibles of his Arab parents – a dad who, in the midst of a heart attack, put on his best suit and offered the paramedics tea, and a mother who sends him to a therapist trained by the CIA for his OCD.Beneath the bonhomie and heartiness, this is a play about trauma. Its politics are secondary to the focus on psychological damage and, by the end, healing. There is silliness, some screwed-on political messages, and the story of Laith’s first romance that seems to veer into a coming-of-age story but slowly gains in relevance. It comes together in a tearjerker of a final scene. A warm show with an irrepressibly big heart, albeit one that never quite stops feeling like standup.Perhaps Starmer should watch it. Maybe it will remind him that immigrants on our shores are not an overwhelmingly dangerous scourge but often vulnerable and broken human beings, trying hard to put themselves back together again in their newfound homes.At theBush theatre, London, until 7 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreImmigration and asylumBush theatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

How did the camera play a role in us becoming the country that we hoped we would become?”‘Not a single person shied away’: how a year chronicling end-of-life stories changed one photographerRead moreRosenheim sees cameras as furthering the anti-aristocratic principles that America was founded on, in the process helping individuals own their identities and document their world. His new exhibition at The Met, The New Art: American Photography, 1839–1910, aspires to give us new ways of seeing precisely how that occurred. Dozens of portraits of everyday Americans showcase a fascinating people’s history of the United States, while also revealing a middle class deeply engaged in the process of discovering its identity, both as consumers and as participants in this young, quickly developing democracy. “Photographic portraits play a role in people feeling like they could be a citizen,” Rosenheim said. “It’s a psychological, empowering thing to own your own likeness.”View image in fullscreenUnknown Maker – Studio Photographer at Work ca 1855.Photograph: The Metropolitan Museum of ArtCovering a period when the US was figuring out exactly what photography was for, The New Art offers roughly 250 photographs that capture the day-to-day of the American experiment in action. In their immediacy and their frankness, these photos offer new possibilities for recording history that simply were not available before the invention of the camera. “The collection is just filled with the everyday stories of people,” Rosenheim said, “and I don’t think painting can touch that.”Although The New Art does include pieces by some recognized giants of the genre, it is largely composed of the handiwork of unremembered and anonymous creators. The works are dominated by studio portraits – probably the only likeness of themselves a person of the era would have owned for their entire lifetime. Viewers will also be surprised to see the kinds of playful images that smack of people excited by the possibilities of a new creative toy.The latter category would include a memorable, if somewhat random, shot of a cow in a field, a dog standing on a chair and a sort of still life of a boot carefully placed into a roller skate. Rosenheim was particularly enamored of the boot still life for the sheer strangeness of it all. “It’s like, what is this picture, the mystery of this?” he told me. “The photographer had to solve a problem to make a still-life composition, so I love this. It’s like this fantastic object, and it asks more questions than it answers. In that, it’s very emblematic of the whole of 19th-century American photography.”View image in fullscreenUnknown Maker – Roller Skate and Boot, 1860s.Photograph: The Metropolitan Museum of ArtIndeed, one of the delights of The New Art is seeing so much individuality and personality brought to an era that is largely flattened into stereotypes of straitlaced veils and grim-faced visages. Although there are plenty of portraits redolent of the gravity of a once-in-a-lifetime event, there are also images that capture the true idiosyncrasy of the era: a shot of a man with his pet squirrel, the word “welcome” spelled out in what appears to be fern leaves, a man in a strange outfit simply labeled “Batman” and a portrait of a cat snuggling a rabbit. They hint at hidden sides of US humanity that might well have been preserved in the historical record if people of the time had been able to make permanent images as simply and thoughtlessly as we can today.“The social media aspect of our photography begins at its birth,” Rosenheim said. “Certainly in the United States, it was the people’s art.”View image in fullscreenUnknown Maker – Young Man with Rooster, 1850s.Photograph: The Metropolitan Museum of ArtThe New Art also shows the turmoil of a still young nation amid the pains and throes of a difficult coming of age. There are portraits of formerly enslaved individuals, including ones that show scars from the period before freedom. There is the curiously modern portrait of Lewis Payne, hands manacled as he awaits justice for conspiring to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. There is a street scene from the frontier town of Brownsville, Texas, and numerous shots of Native Americans. “This is a medium that came of age before the civil war,” Rosenheim said, “then goes to that war, and is a part of Reconstruction and thereafter.”The photographs that Rosenheim is exhibiting are drawn from the William L Schaeffer collection, named for a largely unknown collector in rural Connecticut who amassed them over the course of 50 years. Rosenheim has known Schaeffer for decades and has long wanted to show his collection at the museum. “He just kept on putting away these photos like a squirrel,” Rosenheim said. “Things that he didn’t know whether they were common or uncommon because that history wasn’t told. He wasn’t buying most things at auction, he was finding them through flea markets.”View image in fullscreenJosiah Johnson Hawes – Winter on the Common, Boston, early 1850s.Photograph: The Metropolitan Museum of ArtThe exciting thing for Rosenheim is that the Schaeffer collection doesn’t just add to the collections of photographs that are already known – it opens up new frontiers in our understanding of what photography can be. “It’s a very idiosyncratic collection,” he said, “and it’s a canon-expanding production. What’s great about American photography is it’s an ever-expanding canon.”The New Art is a delightfully varied and continually surprising exhibition that hints at just how much photographs may one day be able to show us, if collectors like Schaeffer and curators like Rosenheim continue to find and bring them to the public.“I hear Walt Whitman when I look at these pictures,” said Rosenheim. “singing the songs of the people everywhere, whether it’s the butcher, the baker or the candlestick maker. That’s the poignancy, that’s where the pathos of this exhibition really hits me.”The New Art: American Photography, 1839–1910 is on show at the Metropolitan Museum inNew Yorkuntil 20 JulyExplore more on these topicsPhotographyExhibitionsMuseumsArtNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Daré said that she did not start the book intending to write about the climate crisis. “I wanted to explore the lives of rural women and girls navigating inequality, silence and survival. But the deeper I went, the more I saw how environmental collapse bleeds into everything, how in many parts of rural Africa, climate injustice is more felt than understood,” she said.Author and judging chair Madeleine Bunting described And So I Roar as “a book of real energy and passion which both horrifies and entertains”, and a “story of how the climate crisis can provoke social crisis, where often women and children are the victims.“Despite the tragedy, Daré holds faith in the strength of individuals and relationships and her hopefulness leaves us inspired,” she added.Climate fiction “is often rooted in the global north, so having a story set in Africa acknowledged like this means a great deal,” Daré said when she was shortlisted. “Africa accounts for just 4% of global carbon emissions, yet faces some of the harshest effects of the climate crisis. A prize like this matters because it creates space for stories that show how deeply connected we all are and how fiction can open hearts where data alone might struggle.”Essex-based Daré was born in Lagos and studied law at the University of Wolverhampton, followed by a master’s in international project management at Glasgow Caledonian University and a creative writing course at Birkbeck, University of London. In 2023, she set up The Louding Voice Foundation to provide educational scholarships to women and girls in Nigeria.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

We could not tell if he was conscious or not.”In McQuarrie’s telling, the pilot communicated at this point that the plane had only three minutes’ worth of fuel remaining, but that the plane couldn’t have landed with the actor lying prone on the wing.“We watched Tom as he pulled himself up and stuck his head in the cockpit, so that he could replenish the oxygen in his body and then climb up into the cockpit”, McQuarrie said. “No one on earth can do that but Tom.”Cruise, who swooped into the Palais deFestivalsas part of a multi-stop promotional tour also including stops in Japan, Korea and London, talked up his prowess as he joined the director on stage. “I don’t mind encountering the unknown,” he said. “It’s just an emotion for me and it’s something that is not paralysing.”.McQuarrie, who first made a mark in Hollywood as the scriptwriter behind 1995 cult thriller The Usual Suspects, bemoaned that the US film industry in its current state was “driving a wedge through cinema” by increasingly forcing film-makers to choose between seeing themselves as artists or as entertainers.He questioned the claims of streaming giants to be “saving Hollywood”, saying that Netflix and co were “cutting the audience off from the history of cinema” by prioritising their own productions over classic films on their home pages.“The number of people I meet who have never heard of The Best Years of Our Lives, who have never heard of William Wyler’s The Big Country, who have never seen Cool Hand Luke, and whose history of cinema begins at Star Wars or Pirates of the Caribbean.”Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalMission: ImpossibleTom CruiseFranceAction and adventure filmsFestivalsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I didn’t ask about the hats. That wasn’t the kind of questioning I engaged in’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 14 May 2025 10.56 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 13.07 EDTShareWhen I began my project photographing in the southern states of the US, I’d only recently developed the confidence needed to take effective portraits. Speaking publicly or talking with people used to make me very nervous. But I was mainly photographing architecture – I knew I wanted to change and make people my subject. So I simply forced myself to endure the anxiety. I picked locations where people gathered in public, such as beaches or parks, and would make myself walk up to them and ask for permission to photograph them.If you do anything long enough, you start to get good at it, and eventually I turned myself into a very assertive photographer. I’m not an intimidating person – I’m small in stature – and generally speaking people like me. On any given day, if I were to ask 20 people to pose for me, 19 would say yes.I would ask the police what areas of town to avoid – then go thereI’d moved to Knoxville in 1982 to teach photography at the University of Tennessee, and during the first exploratory trip from my new home I really did not have a specific objective. But when I got back and processed the film, the results confirmed what I’d started to realise as the trip had gone on – that my pictures of Black Americans were the most interesting. Over the course of a number of summer road trips throughout the decade, I continued to visit Black communities across the American south.During each trip, my first stop after checking into a motel would be the local police station. I would pull out a map of the town, explain that I had some very expensive photographic equipment and ask an officer if he would circle the places I should avoid. I knew those were the places I needed to be.I would walk around with my heavy, large format 4:5 camera already mounted on its tripod, in search of opportunities. When I sensed the possibility of a photograph, I’d approach the subject and explain that I thought he or she was somehow special, that this person was, as in the theatre, clearly the star, and that what I wanted to photograph was their star quality.As an Asian man showing up in predominantly Black areas, I was clearly an anomaly, and often people were surprised I didn’t speak Chinese or broken English. Having the camera on a tripod allowed me to avoid a certain predicament that would occur with a handheld camera that you would hold in front of your face. In that instance, the subject feels as if they are undergoing a medical exam. They’re being looked at, objectified, and the photographer has all the control, whereas the ability to stand beside the camera levels the playing field. It allowed me to have a direct conversation, and invite the subject to be a participant.‘It stunned me that people had to live like this’: ​​Baldwin Lee​ on his rediscovered images of the deep south​Read morePosing the subject was when the process became very interesting. The person I was asking to photograph was not a professional actor, nor was I a director. Whatever I asked them to do, they would interpret individually and do something different, often displaying themselves in a surprising and revealing way. That’s what I wanted – to make a photograph of something that was a mutual discovery.This particular picture was taken either in Augusta or Valdosta, Georgia. I saw the woman in her yard, began a conversation and took several pictures of her outside, then asked if she would mind if I also photographed her inside. She invited me into her house and her husband was there. I asked them to stand next to each other in that doorway, then I asked them to kiss.I made a series of them together and this one turned out to be, I think, the best. I wanted a dialogue between the couple and the plaque you can see on the wall beside them, which is a relief carving of a man and a woman in a similar pose. I didn’t ask about the hats – that wasn’t the kind of questioning I engaged in. I just included objects that might allow the viewer to imagine possible scenarios.At the end of the process I would write down my subjects’ addresses and send them a print. Sometimes I saw participants again on later trips, and they would show me where they’d put my picture up in their homes. On one occasion a woman tore the photograph to pieces in front of me. The majority of times, though, they were very pleased with the results.Baldwin Lee.Photograph: Courtesy Baldwin LeeBaldwin Lee’s CVBorn:Brooklyn, New York, 1951.Trained:“With Minor White at MIT and Walker Evans at Yale.”Influences: “Minor WhiteandWalker Evans”.High point: “Having been plucked from obscurity.”Low point:“I thought I was retired but instead have been busier than ever!”Top tip: “Teach yourself to have courage.”Baldwin Lee’s photographs are on display at theDavid Hill Gallery stand, Photo London,15-18 May.Explore more on these topicsArt and designMy best shotPhotographyArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Kouoh, who has died aged 57 after being diagnosed with cancer, was impossibly ubiquitous. In 2015, she was living and working in Dakar, Senegal, where in 2008 she had set up an artists’ residency called Raw Material. Seven years later,Raw Materialhad come to include a gallery, exhibition space and a mentoring programme for young Senegalese artists.Four years after that, in 2019, Kouoh was made director of theZeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art (MOCAA)in Cape Town, South Africa – the largest institution of its kind in the world, but at the time on the point of closing down. “I was convinced that the failure of Zeitz would have been the failure of all of us African art professionals,” Kouoh recalled in a podcast in 2024. “For me, it became a duty to save it.”Among other groundbreaking exhibitions curated by Kouoh during her tenure at Zeitz MOCAA was When We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration in Painting, in 2022. This was still running at the time of her death, having moved to Brussels’ Bozar centre earlier this year. (It closes on 10 August.)The New York Times praised the “sophisticated breadth … aesthetic and art historical, painterly and political” of the show, and the curatorial thinking behind it – in particular, its exploration of what Kouoh called Black self-representation from acrossAfricaand the Afro-diaspora.View image in fullscreenWhen We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration in Painting, edited by Koyo KouohKouoh described herself as a pan-Africanist, embracing the term “Black geographies” to include all those parts of the world in which Africans had, for the most part involuntarily, found themselves. “Their cultures have evolved, transformed and taken root,” she said. “Their territories become extensions of the continent. So, from my point of view, Brazil is an African country, Cuba is an African country, even the United States.”As well as her formal posts, Zeitz’s director had twice been on the curating board of Documenta in Kassel, Germany, organisedIreland’s EVA International biennial in 2016and a keynote exhibition at the Carnegie International in Philadelphia in 2018.At the end of 2024, Kouoh was named as commissioner for the 61st Venice Biennale, only thesecond Africanto be chosen for the job,and the first African woman. She died the week before she was due to announce the biennale’s programme and theme.There was little in her past to suggest a stellar career in the international arts. Born in Douala, the economic capital of Cameroon, Kouoh described her background as “very modest”. Her great-grandmother had been forced into a polygamous marriage as a teenager; her grandmother was a seamstress; her mother, Agnes, left Cameroon in the 1970s to look for work inSwitzerland. “This is the family I come from,” Kouoh told ARTnews. “That is the essence of my feminism.”At 13, Kouoh joined her mother in Zurich. Like many children of aspirational immigrant parents, she was nudged towards a career in finance, studying economics and becoming an investment banker at Credit Suisse. Her heart was not in it.As she told theNew York Times in 2023, she was “fundamentally uninterested in profit”. It was while working in Zurich that she met a pair of Swiss-German artists, Dominique Rust and Clarissa Herbst. The world they introduced her to was captivating. In October 1995, Kouoh left for Senegal as cultural correspondent for a Swiss magazine.There were other reasons for her departure. Shortly before, she had given birth to a son, Djibril. True to her matriarchal roots, she would bring him up by herself: “I couldn’t imagine raising a Black boy in Europe,” she said.The discovery, in Senegal, of her own, non-European identity had come as a surprise to the young, Swiss-educated banker.“I realised I was African and Black,” she told Le Monde in 2015.“It was then that I first felt a hunger for Africa.”Her early studies in economics helped clarify her later thinking. “Money is a fundamental component of our existence,” she said. “Every sphere has its own economy, and art is no exception.” In this, too, she saw an African exceptionalism. The western model has been to measure artistic success by success in the saleroom.“In Africa, it’s a completely different story,” Kouoh said. “I’m happy for artists who are successful in the market, but that is not synonymous with worth.” Her own philosophy, central to her curating and directing, was collaborative rather than competitive.One of the more surprising things about her appointment as commissioner for the Venice Biennale was that it was made byPietrangelo Buttafuoco, the one-time leader of the youth wing of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement party and an ally of Italy’s far-right prime minister,Giorgia Meloni.What form Kouoh’s biennale might have taken – indeed, whether the biennale will now take place – remains for the moment unknown. “I will, of course, be bringing my intellectual and aesthetic baggage to Venice,” she said recently, in an interview on thewebsite Next Is Africa. “It will be true to my obsessions and my values.” Punning in French – one of a number of languages she spoke fluently – she laughingly said: “Venice has given me carte blanche, and I am going to play my carte noire (black card).”Educated by Jesuits as a child in Douala, she came to embrace broader beliefs. After a merry interview in the Financial Times earlier this month, in which the brightly dressed curator confessed to a shoe obsession and shared the view that “champagne is the only thing you can drink at any time of the day,” Kouoh grew more thoughtful. “I do believe in life after death, because I come from an ancestral Black education where we believe in parallel lives and realities,” she said.“There is no ‘after death’, ‘before death’ or ‘during life’. It doesn’t matter that much.”She is survived by her husband, Philippe Mall, by Djibril, and by her mother, Agnes, and stepfather, Anton.Marie-Noëlle Koyo Kouoh, art curator and director, born 24 December 1967; died 10 May 2025Explore more on these topicsArtAfricaSouth AfricaCameroonSwitzerlandSenegalVenice BiennaleobituariesShareReuse this content"

All its 46 islands (including the main Lastovo island), islets and reefs weredeclared a nature park in 2006. By luck, I’m with the ornithologist whose discovery of the nesting sites of some of the Mediterranean’s most endangered birds – yelkouan and Scopoli’s shearwaters – was instrumental in Lastovo getting the official protection it deserves.Croatia map updatedBetween Robert Crnković, a retired army officer turned full-time ornithologist who surveys the birds here several times a year, and Alexandra Horvat, Lastovo nature park’s head ranger, I’m getting a crash course in the region’s birdlife and biodiversity. Robert points to our right. “Oh look – shearwaters! You can see them sniffing the water. They’re searching for food.” He mentions that yelkouan and Scopoli’s shearwaters are breeding on the islet within sight of my holiday apartment. “Maybe at night you can hear them calling like a baby crying … ”View image in fullscreenMary Novakovich spotting shearwaters with Robert Crnković.Photograph: Adam BatterbeeThat’s one mystery solved. Here on one of Croatia’s most remote inhabited islands – next stop, Italy – I am uncovering Lastovo’s secrets. Time slows down on that terrace as I watch life go by in Zaklopatica Bay – fishers cleaning their catches, older ladies chortling after a boozy lunch, young boys driving and mooring their boats. Ladders and steps along the quayside turn the bay into one giant swimming pool, where I jump into impossibly clear waters. On the horizon is bigger, busier Korčula.On the northern coast, wooded cliffs and the shearwater-inhabited islet give Zaklopatica bay plenty of natural shelter. Three waterside restaurants do a roaring trade feeding the yachting crowd.I’m getting a sense of Lastovo’s fragility, and the battle to keep it from going the way of other parts of Croatia’s overdeveloped coast and islandsAmong measures introduced to protect the marine ecosystem, particularly the posidonia seagrass, is a system of “ecological mooring”, using buoys instead of anchors. Boats need an entrance ticket to enter the archipelago too, while rangers look out for illegal fishing and diving, and maintain 125 miles (200km) of footpaths and hiking trails on a hilly island that’s 70% covered in forests.I’m quickly getting a sense of Lastovo’s fragility, and the battle to keep it from going the way of other parts of Croatia’s overdeveloped coast and islands. Despite its natural park status, there are fears things could change. Diana Magdić in the tourist office worries the protection may not be enough, and estimates that Lastovo has about 10 years before unscrupulous developers exhaust other areas and try to do the same here.View image in fullscreenThe town of Lastovo.Photograph: Adam BatterbeeFor now, the island remains gloriously unspoilt. Lastovo town lies a few hundred metres inland from the coast – this distance was useful centuries ago, when marauding pirates brought violence and fear to locals’ lives. The village’s 15th- and 16th-century stone houses with colourful shutters sit alongside vineyards, olive groves, orchards and market gardens whose produce ends up on local restaurant plates when it’s not being bartered among neighbours.A squiggling road leads us downhill from the village to pretty Lučica Bay, where fishers’ cottages squeeze around a bay too narrow for anything bigger than a dinghy. At compact Konoba Lučica, we sit at one of the restaurant’s two outside tables with a romantic sea view. We dine on grilled squid served by owner-chef Ante Kovačev, who fell in love with this spot after being stranded here on a sailing trip and left his home in Šibenik to set up this enchanting pint-sized place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here we findPorto Rosso, a restaurant and nautical centre whose numerous terraces hover over a pine-shaded beach. Although it’s mid-June, the summer season hasn’t kicked off yet, so we have an absurd amount of empty space in which to lounge after a satisfying lunch of seafood risotto. Gazing at the sea and swimming in transparent waters, we allow the afternoon to slip by in total relaxation.Lastovo does this to people. When we decamp from Zaklopatica and cross the little bridge to Prežba, the archipelago’s only other inhabited island, I immediately fall in love with the huge flower-filled terrace in our roomy apartment overlooking Malo Lago Bay in tiny Pasadur village. The atmosphere is less yachtie than Zaklopatica, and the peaceful bay looks more like a channel, flanked by wooded hills. “You’ll have to drag me from here,” I warn my husband.View image in fullscreenThe peaceful bay at Pasadur on the island of Prežba.Photograph: Adam BatterbeePine-shaded coves are tucked into Prežba’s indented coast, also pockmarked by old naval tunnels and bunkers from the days before 1988, when Lastovo was a military base and closed to tourists. Although the beaches beckon, we are again seduced by the ease of jumping into the clean waters from the sunny quayside.It takes five hours to get to Lastovo from Split via two ferries, and three hours on a catamaran from Dubrovnik (leaving you reliant on the island’s sole bus that is actually a minivan). It won’t suit everybody (thank goodness), especially drunk partygoers from Hvar who get on the wrong boat and wonder where all the cocktail bars and nightclubs are (answer: there aren’t any, and yes, this does happen).For Diana in the tourist office, who, like Alexandra Horvat, originally came from Zagreb, Lastovo harks back to 1980s Yugoslavia, “when every tourist was a guest, a friend”.

I approached with trepidation, but stayed for the bitter espresso notes and the sexy whiff of plump, boozy cocktail cherries steeping in the bottom of a glass, swollen from hard liquor. Elegant and complex, this smells very expensive (and at £164, albeit for a large 75ml bottle, it is), gender neutral and distinctly “black tie” in dress code. I doubt I’ll be wearing it myself (I’ve never had a sweet tooth), but if it wafted past me at a party, I’d follow its heady trail. Just beautiful.Elegant and complex, this smells very expensive, gender neutral and distinctly ‘black tie’Zara’sCherry Smoothieis different in every way. At just £12.99 for 30ml, it’s been designed for a younger, less bold consumer, and though sweet, it has avoided the cloying melted Haribo route taken by others in the market. This is a dry powder-puff fragrance that I find surprisingly charming. Think airborne cherry sherbet, washing powder, a hint of ripe plums for body and a subtle whiff of vintage makeup. It is unsophisticated, but has a gentle, innocent quality that makes it a very easy wear for casual, low-key days (sadly not by me though, since my husband loathed it).Similarly uncomplicated, but way more raucous and fun, isSweet Tooth Cherry Baby(£24.99) by Sabrina Carpenter, a singer that I know practically nothing about except that she was loved for her matching hip flask and gown ensemble at the Grammys. This is an unabashed cherry bomb – or rather an undiluted Rowntree’s jelly of a fragrance. Sugary, concentrated, stickily fruity, it gets yet more sweetness from vanilla that cannot be grounded by the musky, woody base. Bold, juicy, maybe a little bit screechy – it’s a riot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The recipe is adapted from the traditionalaçordaof Alentejo, where it’s thought of as the region’s signature dish. Açorda is said to have been born from necessity, a waste-saving and resourceful soup that’s transformed by olive oil, plentiful herbs and rich egg. I find this take on it particularly interesting because, instead of simmering the coriander, garlic and egg in hot broth, they are instead put in a bowl and the broth is poured over them. This enhances the powerful flavours of the garlic and coriander, and the whole lot is then ladled over stale bread. For a vegetarian version, just omit the fish.Açorda – Portuguese garlic and coriander bread soup with optional codThis is a chunky, fragrant and very flavourful soup. A fresh egg is gently cooked by the residual heat of the broth, and thickens the soup along with the bread, giving it a wonderful viscosity.Although a traditional Portuguese stock for açorda might be made with vegetables or bacalau (salt cod), in the spirit of this column, and because they are delicious and often free (or at least very cheap) from most fishmongers, I’ve chosen to make my version with cod’s head. It’s a humble cut, but deeply flavoured and ideal for stocks. Don’t get me wrong, this is a delicious soup when it’s vegetarian, but any omnivores who do add a cod’s head will be rewarded by an extra-savoury, umami-rich and gelatinous fish broth.Serves4–61kg cod’s head, rinsed and gills removed1 bay leafVegetable scraps5 eggsSalt and black pepper100g bunch coriander4 garlic cloves, peeled100ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve200g stale bread(for example, ciabatta, sourdough orpão alentejano), torn into pieces4 pieces of toast, to serve (optional)For a vegetarian take on this soup, simply omit the fish. Put the cleaned cod’s head in a large saucepan with one and a half litres of water, the bay leaf and any vegetable scraps you have to hand. Bring to a boil, turn down the heat and simmer gently for 30 minutes, skimming off any foam that rises on the surface. After 25 minutes, drop in four unshelled eggs, cook for five minutes, then lift out the boiled eggs and the cod’s head and put to one side. Strain the broth, then return it to the pan. Once the cod is cool enough to handle, pick off any good flakes of meat, add to the strained broth, season to taste and keep warm.Meanwhile, tear the stale bread into four bowls. Finely chop the coriander from stem to leaf, then put it in a large bowl. Finely chop the four garlic cloves, add to the coriander and pour in the extra-virgin olive oil. Crack in the remaining egg and beat until well combined.Pour the hot broth into the coriander bowl, stir, then ladle the soup over the torn bread and serve with the boiled eggs and optional toast on the side.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteSoupBreadVegetablesPortuguese food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These recipes for one are also speedy, low-fuss and involve minimal cooking – perfect for maximising your time outdoors.Chilli oil udon (pictured top)These are inspired by my travels across China and its love for all things spicy noodles. A perfectly balanced sauce made with soy, vinegar and herbs means these salty, sweet, sour and spicy noodles are incredibly addictive.Prep10 minCook15 minServes1200g fresh udon, or 100g dried udon30g fresh coriander, roughly chopped¼cucumber, julienned1 fried egg, to serve (optional)For the chilli oil1 garlic clove, peeled and minced½ spring onion, white part minced½ tsp cayenne powder½tsp sweetpaprika1 tsp roasted sesame seeds¼tsp Sichuan peppercorns, crushed1 tbsp vegetable oilFor the sauce1 tbsp light soy sauce1 tsp dark soy sauce1 tsp oyster sauce1 tspblack Chinese vinegar1 tsp white sugar½ tsp MSG½ tsp sesame oilPut all the ingredients for the chilli oil, bar the oil, in a serving bowl (the one you plan to eat from) and stir to combine. Put the vegetable oil in a small frying pan on a high heat for a minute, until just shy of smoking, then pour this over the contents of the bowl and stir to coat. Add all the ingredients for the sauce, then stir until the sugar dissolves and everything is well combined.Cook the noodles in a pan of boiling water for a minute shy of the packet instructions (to ensure they’re al dente). Drain and transfer to the bowl with the sauce. Top with the coriander and cucumber, then toss very well, to make sure all the sauce at the bottom of the bowl is incorporated and coating the noodles. Serve topped with a fried egg, if you like, for some protein.Salmon noodle saladView image in fullscreenJustin Tsang’s salmon noodle salad.This packs a serious punch and barely requires any cooking.

We asked the experts for their top tipsOlivia PetterWed 14 May 2025 10.04 EDTShareMost dating apps have been forced to bolster their safety measures in recent years due to a litany of complaints of online abuse as well as negligence when handling reports of sexual violence. Several of them are now taking steps to combat this and encourage users to verify their identities to ensure everyone is who they say they are. Typically, this is done with facial recognition technology by asking users to take a video selfie or provide a photo ID that the app uses to compare with the photos used in their profile. Many have also introduced features to help users stay safe, including block and report systems alongside bans on sexual harassment, fetishisation and hate speech.Still, there are precautions to be taken whenever you agree to meet someone you’ve spoken to online, like meeting in public places and withholding any private information. Here are more top tips for staying safe.Read our guide tothe best dating apps, testedHow to date safely onlineAsk the right questionsYou want to strike the right balance between flirting and getting to know someone to build trust. “Try asking how they like to communicate or what they’re passionate about to see if it’s going to be a fun adventure or if you could end up hurt,” advises Alice Hoddinott, education and wellbeing specialist at Brook, the sexual health and wellbeing charity. “Don’t ignore red flags and trust your instincts.”Those red flags could be anything from scant profile details to highly edited photos. “This indicates a possible scammer,” says Dr Emma Turley, senior lecturer in criminology at Central Queensland University and a chartered psychologist with the British Psychological Society. “Other red flags could be fast-tracked intimacy accompanied by pressure to move conversations off the dating app and on to other platforms [see below]. The other major red flag is around requests for money and/or personal information. This often comes in the form of stories of personal hardship. Scammers will take time to build trust before asking for money or personal information, and it can be very subtle.”“As soon as a conversation mentions money in any form, stop the conversation immediately and report to the dating app,” says Ann Austin at the OnlineDatingand Discovery Association.Take breaksView image in fullscreenPrevent dating app burnout with regular breaks.Photograph: recep-bg/Getty Images“It’s easy to get swept up in swiping, chatting and constantly checking your phone – but remember, dating apps are just one part of your life,” says Brook’s Hoddinott. “If things start feeling overwhelming or you’re noticing it’s affecting your self-esteem, it’s OK to log off. Taking a break doesn’t mean giving up – it’s a way of looking after your mental health and keeping all parts of your life safe.”This is important as a way of preventing dating app burnout, which can hinder your judgment.“When someone is drained, they are more likely to overlook red flags or settle for unsafe or unpleasant behaviour,” says Turley. “Breaks allow you to reset your boundaries and return to the apps with clearer judgment.”Keepconversations on the apps until you feel comfortable“It is common for scammers to try to move conversations off the dating app as soon as possible to avoid detection,” says Austin. “It makes sense to move off the dating app eventually, but don’t feel rushed to take the conversation away too soon and make the most of the added security the dating services offer within their messaging services.”Turley also advises making sure not to share your location (including your home and workplace) on other messaging platforms when you first start chatting to someone. “Be cautious with photos, too, as some can be reverse-searched to find out more information about you,” she adds. “Trust your instincts.

AI images are becoming more sophisticated, so also be wary if there’s no online presence at all.”Of course, reverse image searches can also be weaponised and used by people you’ve spoken to on apps to track you down on social media without your consent, which could lead to online stalking. To prevent this from happening, it might be worth using photos for your dating app profile that aren’t featured on your social media pages, as advised by theRape, Abuse & Incest National Networkin the US.Enlist the help of family and friendsEven if you have been chatting to someone for a week or two, it’s a good idea to talk to someone you’re close to about them before agreeing to meet, just to ensure you haven’t missed any glaring red flags. “Sometimes it’s someone not closely involved who can see things that you are unable to, and they can offer some useful advice,” says Austin.As for the date itself, be sure to meet in a public place with good lighting and people nearby. “Tell a friend or family member where you’re going and who you’re meeting, and what time you expect to be back,” says Turley, who also suggests sharing your live location with a friend or family member using your phone for the duration of the date. “Have a plan to get home independently, and if someone makes you feel unsafe, it’s OK to leave the date.”Other sources of dating app safety advice:BrookCrimestoppersSolace Women’s AidRainn(American but worth a look wherever you are)eSafety(Australian but worth a look wherever you are)Olivia Petter is ajournalist, broadcaster and author with more than a decade of experience in lifestyle, pop culture and cosplaying as Carrie Bradshaw.

The friendship was an insight into the underground that existed when homosexuality was still a crimeChristopher StephensWed 14 May 2025 01.55 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 09.37 EDTShareIn 2003, I was at a dinner of “the like-minded” (Oxford University code for gay) when an academic leaving for a sabbatical in New York asked a favour: would I take over his slot as a volunteer reader for a gay blind man living alone in east Oxford?I agreed, and so one evening in October I found myself cycling out of Christ Church to my first appointment. I rounded the turning to Roger Butler’s home and rang the doorbell twice, as instructed, to indicate that I was his expected visitor.The red-brick Victorian house suddenly illuminated, the door was unchained, and I was standing in front of a slim, dark-haired man, aged somewhere north of 60. His clouded, still eyes were framed by an inexpressive but gentle face.I was invited into the drawing room, which Roger had styled with the help of an aristocratic friend. It was filled with antiques, ornately framed pictures and chinoiserie lamps and had heavy curtains – a world apart from the rather run-down street outside.View image in fullscreenChristopher at Oxford University in 2003 – the year he met Roger.Photograph: Courtesy of Christopher StephensWe started that evening – as we did for several more Tuesdays – looking through a recent issue of the London Review of Books, so Roger could consider items he would like to read another time. The material was intentionally unremarkable: Roger was treading water until he could work out what was of mutual interest. We were both shy, avoiding topics of conversation that might seem too personal – including anything touching on sexuality. Roger, I later learned, called to ask the academic who had introduced us whether I was absolutely, definitely “one of us”. With that established, we slowly began to work our way through a few Alan Hollinghurst novels, an enormous biography of Christopher Isherwood, and Edmund White’s memoirs.This was an education for me in learning to read collaboratively: progress is slow when you say the words aloud, skimming isn’t an option, skipping ahead takes negotiation and, if the reader doesn’t pronounce a word correctly, or sounds uncertain about its meaning, it usually prompts a conversation.As months turned into years, we started reading Roger’s own, painstakingly created writing: memoirs and essays that he had sketched out in braille, then typed for a trusted reader to record on to cassette tapes so he could play them back and make edits. We read his postal correspondences – some, decades old. It was one of the most intimate experiences I have shared with another person.During this process, I learned about the London gay underground Roger had inhabited in his 20s, while homosexuality was still a crime, and how he had become blind in his mid-30s after a succession of failed surgeries to manage his glaucoma. I learned how he had rebuilt his life and discovered “not only that a great many more things were still possible than I might have supposed, but also that they still mattered”.It became far more than Tuesday evenings. I would come over to do odd jobs around the house, which turned into picnics in his garden, then trips into town and to local villages for country walks and leisurely pub lunches. My education continued, not just because Roger encouraged me to think about politics and history, but because he also taught me how he, as a blind person, negotiated the minefields of cobbled streets, ancient, uneven steps, low doorframes and fast-moving pedestrians.My glimpses into the world Roger inhabited showed me the bravery it took to live well in it. He scoffed at the idea that blindness had sharpened his other senses, but it was evident that he had been forced to find mental tools to better remember things, people and facts, and innovative ways to run his household. I listened, and I learned his habits of keeping an orderly home, never letting anything be out of place, so he could move freely there and find what he needed.View image in fullscreenRoger and guide dog, Gay, at Blenheim.Photograph: Courtesy of Christopher StephensMy perception of what mattered also began to shift. I came to judge restaurants on their noise levels and the quality of their menu over trendy decor and the arrangement of food on a plate. When we started taking trips to country houses, Roger showed me all the ways he perceived beauty in a place: the creaking of medieval floorboards or the softness of thick carpets underfoot; the smell of fireplaces used for centuries; the sound of voices hushed by low ceilings, or swelled in high-vaulted stone hallways.At a hastily arranged lunch in 2007, Roger told me he was dying. “Stick with me, love,” he asked. For the next three years, I did my best. I was at his bedside in the hospice when he drew his last breath.Roger’s death was an ending and a beginning. I inherited a lifetime of his writings – essays, letters, diaries – and learned from them that, in 1960, seven years before the law in England and Wales changed to permit sex between men, he had written to the national press declaring himself to be gay. Roger believed that the only way to change public opinion about homosexuals was for them to take control of the gay rights movement – and this required them to unashamedly identify themselves on the national stage. But nobody else had been willing to do it.I had always been led to believe that the pre-legalisation years were dominated by secrecy and shame, that gay men hid in the shadows, and that this concept of coming out – and gay pride – was an invention of the 70s. Roger’s papers upended all that.I wish I had known this while Roger was alive, and better understood his role in making it possible for me, decades later, to live openly. But I am grateful that I know now and, in the years since, it has often led me to wonder how many other quiet revolutionaries live among us, ready to share their stories, if only we knock on their doors.The Light of Day: the first man to come out at the dawn of gay liberationbyChristopher Stephens and Louise Radnofskyis published on 22 May (Headline Press; £20)This article was amended on 14 May 2025.

With portable versions, sophisticated technology and built-in shops, these entertainment centres are valuable items, costing hundreds. If the worst happens and your Xbox, PlayStation or Nintendo gets stolen, here’s what to do.What to do if your console is stolenChange your Microsoft, Sony or Nintendo account password, which will help keep the thieves out of your entertainment library.Remove your payment information from the digital store built into your console to help prevent anyone running up large bills.Report your console as stolen to the police via 101 in the UK. Give them the make, model and serial number of the console, which you’ll find on the box or in your online Microsoft, Sony or Nintendo account. Don’t forget to include details of any games, joypads or accessories that were taken with the console.Report the theft to the manufacturer through its website or customer service.Contact your insurance company should the console be covered under your household policy. This is usually under “high risk” items but portable consoles may need to be included in specified items for coverage outside of the home.What to do as soon as you get a new oneWhen you get a new or replacement console, there are a few things you can do to help in the event it goes missing again:Unlike phones, tablets and other devices there is no built-in way of tracking most consoles, so consider attaching a Bluetooth tracker such as an Apple AirTag, Tile or Samsung SmartTag so you can locate them with phone or browser.Make sure you use a strong password and two-step authentication for your console’s account to help prevent your details being stolen and items from being bought from any associated stores.Set a pin code on your console’s account or turn on an option to require your password to confirm purchases on the digital store to prevent thieves running up a bill. This setting is either on your profile or part of the parental controls.Backup your game data and settings in the cloud, which should happen automatically if your console is connected to the internet and logged into your online account. Game save syncing is free on Xbox but requires a subscription for Playstation or Nintendo. Some consoles also allow game save backups to external storage.Make note of the serial numbers for your console, controllers and accessories. Take and store photos of each item along with purchase receipts so you can show them to the police or insurance.Explore more on these topicsGames consolesLost or stolenGamesConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fruit blossom has dropped with some apples already set; and the 50-year-oldJudas treeis covered with purple flowers, vivid against diaphanous beech and swags of native May tree.Before going upcountry, I walked on mymended hipin James Evans and Mary Martin’s documented and tendedorchard of historic fruit trees(200 apples, 30 cherries and 10 pears). This year’s succession of prolific blossom is particularly beautiful, helped by a sunny March, and in such contrast to last year’s wet and unproductive spring.View image in fullscreenMorwellham pear among cherry trees.Photograph: James EvansApple is the latest to open, heralded by the large pink and white blooms of the pear apple (Snub Nose). But it is the creamy coloured blossom of pears that came first, includingBelle de Bruxelles, now more than 40ft high and laden with blossom to the topmost tips. It was grafted from a twig, cut from an overgrown specimen surviving in the old garden of a pub in nearby Launceston. The spreading Morwellham pear was grafted at the same time from a chance seedling, found growing in the wall of a derelict lime kiln on the Devon bank of the Tamar. Hoverflies dart about its blossom and shiny pale leaves, and there should be a good crop of medium-sized golden-red fruit.The delicate fluffiness of white cherry blossom diminishes among the opening orange-tinged foliage, while avenues of Burcombe, Birchenhayes, Fice, Rumbullion and Smutts form flowering canopies, spread above sturdy trunks. Years of pruning in the winter months has shaped the branches in this maturing orchard to allow occasional mechanical trimming of the flowery sward (sheep were tried at first but they preferred to graze the immature trees).After a three-year dearth of cherries, there is hope for a bumper harvest; perhaps the triple-legged ladders will be erected and another deep freeze needed to store surplus fruit.Further down the valley, in a steep tributary of the Cotehele millstream, the council’sForest for Cornwallare planting a random mix of young trees. Included are old sorts of apples and cherries that will add diversity and mystery to this expanse of future woodland.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsTrees and forestsCountry diaryFruitSpringRural affairsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is never enough you can do to prepare for every possible emergency. Electricity out is not a big deal really, depending on how long it lasts. Twenty four hours or less, you need some sort of lighting and batteries, something to eat that doesn’t need to be cooked or a small camp stove for heating things up.

They’re often dismissed as one-song wonders, or as proponents of brutally simplistic music – but as much as the Stones or the Who,Status Quoare carved into British rock.Francis Rossi and Alan Lancaster formed the Spectres in 1962, when the guitarist and bassist were still at school. Drummer John Coghlan signed up a year later and Rick Parfitt completed the “Frantic Four” when he joined after sharing a bill with the Spectres at Minehead Butlin’s in 1966. The Beatles showed Rossi not just what he could do with his life, but touched something very primal in him.“Everybody liked them,” he says, “and I must have been a wimpy kid, and I terribly wanted to be liked. Still do in some ways. That’s quite sad. But we tried to emulate them – that’s where we wanted to go.” Over 60 years on, he’s not there yet, despite the end of his iconic partnership with Parfitt, who died aged 68, in 2016. “I don’t know what else to do. I’m obsessed by it all, and I just keep going.”Rossi, everyone says, doesn’t like talking about the past. He doesn’t have much choice today, because we’re talking as Quo prepare to reissue the 1977 album Live!, recorded in Glasgow when the band were at their peak as a rock band: when their force and power was as blunt and brutal as the Stooges, but without the nihilism, and with added massive hit albums and singles.View image in fullscreenAlan Lancaster, Rick Parfitt and Francis Rossi of Status Quo performing in Rotterdam in 1981.Photograph: Rob Verhorst/RedfernsThe first was in 1968, with the ersatz psychedelia ofPictures of Matchstick Men. “We weren’t very happy being dressed-up pop stars. And our tour manager, Bob Young, said, ‘Well, why don’t you change?’ So we grew our hair long, got rid of the clothes and put on jeans and T-shirts. And boogie was the right music to play.”For Rossi, the boogie style – the tough, hard rock version of the 12-bar blues, exemplified by songs such asWhatever You WantorRoll Over Lay Down– also tied in with the shuffling Italian music he grew up with in south London. “There are so many things in our lives that are shuffles, even nursery rhymes – Nellie the Elephant. Our marches do that. It appealed to me and it still does.” That was crossed with what he was hearing on the university circuit Quo were playing. “We used to work with Fleetwood Mac a lot on the uni circuit,” Rossi says. “You could sit down beside the stage and they’d start playing – der-der, der-der – for an hour and a half. We wanted to do that, to be that.”Quo were constantly written off as “heads down, no-nonsense, mindless boogie”, Rossi says, and were parodied as such by Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias on a 1978 single. But there’s more to them than that. Their 1975 No 1Down Down, with its multiple sections, is like the Paranoid Android of 12-bar boogie, or consider that What You’re Proposing was one of two consecutive Top 20 hits – along with Living on an Island – about cocaine-addicted alienation. The latter, written by Parfitt, was speaking plainly about waiting for people to come to Jersey with drugs for him. The former, by Rossi, was more allusive but its theme was evident. “I used to believe what I read in the press, that there was nothing to the lyrics,” Rossi says. “But then I’d read them and think, ‘That was about my first wife, that was about such and such.’ In doing it, I think it’s far too” – he pulls a face to suggest a highfalutin intellectual – “to say, ‘I’m going to write about this now.”But the truth will out, nonetheless. “That’s what I think, yes.”The new reissue of the live album – the full sets from all three nights at the Glasgow Apollo in October 1976 – could really have been recorded anywhere and at any point during the mid-70s. For a start, their set didn’t change a whole lot through those years: “We had a good set and we stuck to it,” drummer Coghlan says. “And it meant I didn’t have to look at a set list.” And, second, Quo worked so hard through those years that they were like a juggernaut, night after night. “They weren’t afraid of hard work, and they got their heads down,” says Bob Young, their tour manager. “We were just one of those bands that liked playing,” Coghlan says, plainly.One of the curiosities of Quo is that its members almost always co-wrote, and they didn’t look far for co-writers. Young has his name on a bunch of Quo’s biggest hits, which must have made him the highest-earning tour manager in rock history. Young laughs at the thought, though accepts it was probably true: “I ended up in the unique position of being tour manager, songwriter and harmonica player.”View image in fullscreenRick Parfitt in 1979.Photograph: Fin Costello/Getty ImagesBut, as time went on, the writing with others reflected the fact they weren’t getting along with each other. “It got to a point where we should have taken some time off, maybe three or four months,” Coghlan says. But they didn’t. Coghlan left in 1982, kicking over his drum kit during a recording session and walking out without a word, sick of his bandmates. Lancaster, who had formed the band with Rossi, departed after the End of the Road tour in 1984. And Parfitt was haunted by insecurities about his status within the band – specifically about having always been viewed as No 2 in the group to Rossi, who stood centre stage and took most of the vocals.“He was my greatest friend, but someone” – Rossi can’t say who – “got to him. Somebody knew it was a weakness with him. And as we got older it got worse and worse. I always saw it as the two of us, because we made a great pair – and I think we were a bit unfair on the rest of them. We would sit in the car and hold hands and dress the same just to wind people up, and I think certain people decided to get between the two of us.”Rossi, plainly, is an unusual person. “Francis has always been his own man,” Young says. “He’ll say what he wants; he hasn’t got a lot of filter, like it or not.” In his autobiography, Rossi mentions his tendency to say inappropriate things and cause offence, and says he doesn’t visibly grieve the deaths of those he has loved, including Parfitt. I mention to him that those were both traits of mine, that I obsessed over until being diagnosed as neurodivergent and learning they were common behaviours: a lack of grief is related to object impermanence about people. Has he, I ask as delicately as I can, ever been tested?He looks not horrified but fascinated. “You’re the first person that’s ever broached that at all. And now there are loads of things going on in my mind, because that would explain …” He starts to talk about the deaths of his mother and father, how he poked at his mother’s body to be sure she was gone, how when he was told his father had died he just wanted to check on the arrangements for his own perfectly normal working day: “I said, ‘Is the car coming to pick me up?’ And it makes me feel like I’m cold. But if I’m in a situation and I’m told what I’m supposed to do, I can’t do it. I’m supposed to grieve, I’m supposed to say certain things. And I will be thinking, ‘I shouldn’t say that, that’s not appropriate.’ It’s interesting, what you said. I never thought about that before.”View image in fullscreenRossi playing with Status Quo in 2016.Photograph: Christie GoodwinRossi, 76 in May, isn’t going to give up anytime soon. He outlines his plans for the next couple of years, talking about how he still loves playing to an audience. And he says something else, something familiar from my parents’ generation of working-class people who grew up to be comfortable, but aware of their past. “The thing that worries me constantly is: will I have enough money if I stop now and there’s no more income? I’m scared shitless of that.”Of course Francis Rossi is not going to die in penury, but it’s a comment that shows he’s a more complex man than the jeans and waistcoats and winks to camera ever hinted at. Just as Status Quo were a more complex group than anyone who claimed they only had one song could ever understand.The 8-CD expanded reissue of Status Quo / Live! is out on 16 May on Edsel Records.Francis Rossi is currently touring the UKExplore more on these topicsStatus QuoPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The scheme promises to create an estimated 6,500 new jobs, including 1,500 during construction.It also includes a major new building for a government ministry. The tenant has yet to be confirmed, but the Guardian understands it will be the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), and an official announcement is expected in summer.York is one of Defra’s four main hubs, alongside Bristol, London and Newcastle, and 854 civil servants will move from the current office on the other side of town into the newsix-storey, 195,000 sq ft government building, which can house up to 2,600.The state-of-the-art structure, which will have solar panels, air source heat pumps and a green roof, is due to be completed by 2028.View image in fullscreenWork under way on a new access road in the York Central redevelopment.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianYork Central forms part of the government’s plan for change that promises growth for every region, and itsindustrial strategy that names digital and technologies, and life sciencesas two key sectors.It “will see a ripple effect for the local economy”,Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary, said when she visited in February, adding: “What we’re really clear on as government, growth has to be across the whole of the UK.”Stephen Hind, Network Rail’s head of business development for the eastern UK, says one of York’s biggest problems is an outflow of expertise from the city. “There’s not necessarily the space for those companies to grow.”After previous failed attempts to remodel the site several decades ago, the landowners Network Rail and Homes England have teamed up with UK developers McLaren Property and Arlington Real Estate to get the new master plan off the ground. They are backed by £150m of public money, most of it from the government agency Homes England, with £30m from City of York council.The project, bigger than similar regeneration schemes in the capital at King’s Cross, Battersea power station andBritish Land’s £5.6bn Canada Waterin east London, is part of York’s 10-year growth plan, and should be completed about 2038.View image in fullscreenParking will be relocated as part of the York Central redevelopment.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianHowever, local campaigners worry that the opportunity to do something different and build a “utopia” with walkable neighbourhoods in the spirit of England’s garden cities could be squandered.“The opportunity this presents to York is huge. It’s very rare to be able to do things more or less from scratch,” says Jane Hustwit from York Central Co-Owned, which campaigns for a community-led mixed-use neighbourhood. “So if we repeat in York an off-the-shelf city development, making all the same mistakes again, it would just be heartbreaking.”At the heart of York Central is the expanded railway museum with a big new square in front as the “cultural gateway” to the area. Rayner has confirmed a £15m injection into the institution from the Ministry of Housing,Communitiesand Local Government – without which the near-£100m museum revamp would have been in danger.The rest will come from corporate partners, trusts and individual donors, with funding going towards a new circular central hall with a cafe connecting the museum’s two existing buildings – the North Eastern Railway’s 1873 goods office, which was used as a freight depot until the early 1970s and now exhibits royal carriages but is closed for refurbishment, and the Victorian engine shed.The latter houses the museum’s collection of locomotives such the 737 featured in the movie Chariots of Fire, the Flying Scotsman, and the only Japanese bullet train found outside Japan.The York Central scheme includes a new western entrance to the railway station and two new bridges over the East Coast line, while car parking will move to a multistorey car park on the other side of the station closer to the historical centre.Tom Gilman, head of regeneration at McLaren, wants to avoid creating an “oasis of privilege” and insists the new neighbourhood will be “car light”.View image in fullscreenTom Gilman and Karen Stafeckis from McLaren Property, which won the bid to redevelop the area west of York railway station.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianHowever, campaigners have voiced concerns over the decision to close a section of Leeman Road to allow for the construction of Museum Square and the museum’s central hall, arguing this will cut a traditional working-class area off from the city centre. Residents will be forced to take a long route round when foot access through this space is limited during museum closing hours.“Symbolically, it cuts that community off,” says Phil Bixby, a local architect and treasurer of York Environment Forum. “There’s a lot of feeling of ownership of the history, heritage of this place there, there are people whose families worked in the railways for generations.”The museum insists that the local community will not be cut off, pointing to new alternative routes under construction.The campaigners hope that the developers will listen to them. “The pandemic taught us a lot about what good neighbourhoods look like,” says Bixby.View image in fullscreenLocal people challenging the York Central plans. Right to left: Phil Bixby, Michael Driscoll, Andy Shrimpton, Penny Bainbridge and Jane Hustwit.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianConstruction on the first lot of 1,000 homes is expected to start next year and people are due to move in from 2028. All homes are to be built toPassivhaus principles for energy and comfort, with heat pumps planned and potentially a deep geothermal system to provide heating and hot water.There will be a mix of one and two-bedroom flats, about 60% of the total, as well as three- and four-bedroom houses. At least a fifth of the homes will be affordable but the developers say they are aiming for 40%. Of the affordable homes, the majority (80%) are slated to be social rent, with the remainder made up of discounted market rent and shared ownership, Gilman says.David Skaith, the mayor of York and North Yorkshire, hopes the new homes could stem the tide of university graduates and other young people leaving the city because of high rents and house prices.Tenants who rent privately in the city pay an average of £1,117 a month, up by 2.6% in March from a year earlier,according to the Office for National Statistics. In January, rents were still 5.9% higher year on year. The average house price in York dipped by 1.6% to £299,000 in February, while across Yorkshire and The Humber, values were up by 7.5%.“To have such a large-scale site in a small historical city like York is quite unusual and much needed in terms of investment and housing,” Skaith says, adding that it would be transformative for the wider region, which needs better transport links from east to west, such as more frequent train services between York and Scarborough.James Farrar, chief executive of York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority, agrees, saying “the worst deprivation is on the coast”. He says homes being rented out on Airbnb or other holiday home sites has worsened the problem: “Housing affordability is an enormous challenge across York and North Yorkshire,.”Andy Shrimpton, founder of the Cycle Heaven bike shop in York, wants the developers to think big with their plans for the site, arguing that a failure to aim high could lead to a generic “estate devoid of any interest, amenity, community or joy”.He adds: “We’ve done this long enough to know what works best in cities – dense neighbourhoods where we allow for, and mix up, all of life’s activities – work, rest and play.”Explore more on these topicsRegenerationYorkConstruction industryCommunitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A quiet room reminds her too much of the police cell she was locked into just hours after undergoing a traumatic stillbirth.Arrested in hospital by uniformed officers while still recovering from surgery, she was accused of carrying out an illegal abortion. It took four-and-a-half years for her case to come to court, where last week she wasunanimously cleared by a jury.Packer, 45, was charged with “unlawfully administering to herself a poison or other noxious thing” with the “intent to procure a miscarriage”, after taking abortion pills prescribed to her by a registered provider during the November 2020 Covid lockdown.Under emergency legislation introduced during the pandemic – and later made permanent – medication could be dispatched by post for pregnancies up to 10 weeks’ gestation.Packer went on to deliver a foetus estimated to be about 26 weeks’ gestation. The prosecution had claimed she had known she was more than 10 weeks pregnant when she took the pills; an allegation Packer has always denied.The case of Nicola Packer tells us this: Britain is shamed by its abortion laws – and must change them | Jonathan LordRead moreShe may have been found not guilty, but Packer knows she will never be the same; she is nervous of seeking medical help now.At her trial, the prosecution tried to claim she was lying when she said she did not initially tell medical staff (who went on to call in police) that she had taken abortion pills because she was afraid it would affect the quality of care she received.“But they didn’t really help me, did they?” she says. “So I think I was right to be frightened.”And she no longer trusts the police – when her phone died, and she needed help, she asked the drunk man outside a London station for directions, rather than a police officer.She also knows she has not yet fully processed the enormity of what happened to her. Just days after the verdict “I’m still running on adrenaline”, she says. But she is seeking answers from the Crown Prosecution Service and the Met police as to how she got here.“There are other ways that it could have been handled after I’d been in hospital,” she says. “I could have been sent home to recuperate. There was no legal need for me to be taken straight to a police station.“It was absolutely horrific to get to from the hospital to Charing Cross police station,” she added. With no cars available, she was put in the back of the police van, and “I had to sit basically on a plank of wood, with no seatbelts on it, driving around London like that.” In custody, she was not given her anti-clotting medication on time, told it was “not a priority”.“I was still in pain, I was extremely tired, I felt very weak and mentally, just did not really understand what was going on,” she said.The prosecution clouded her life for almost half a decade. “I kept doing things, but you’re not fully present in the moment,” she says.She spent tens of thousands of pounds on her defence. A crowdfunder helped to meet at least some of her costs. “I read all [the comments] several times,” she says. “I was reading them in the run-up and during the trial as well. There are so many people out there that don’t believe this should be happening, there’s so much support.”Years before her case ever reached Isleworth crown court, Packer’s barrister, Fiona Horlick KC, asked her what she was most of afraid of.“I’m most scared going to prison,” she says. The next worst thing, was “the trial, just giving evidence and having to be speaking in front of all these people”.View image in fullscreenThe jury unanimously found Packer not guilty after six hours of deliberations: ‘It was just wonderful to get that verdict.’Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianShe knew she had the option to plead guilty, but she did not consider it for more than a “split second”, she says. “I couldn’t have looked at myself doing that, because it wasn’t true.”While she waited for her case to come to court, she saw another woman, Carla Foster, convicted of, and jailed for, an illegal abortion before her sentence was suspended by the appeal court.“I was really angry, angry that she had to go through this,” Packer says. “She spent 35 days in prison. Why? Who did that help? What was the point? There was no point in sending her to prison, and then you have to think about the impact on the rest of her life.”But the case also brought home the reality of what she was herself facing, and she began asking questions she had never imagined having to contemplate. “How do I prepare for the worst outcome?” she says. “Do I rent my flat out and cancel Netflix? What do I do? I don’t know. I’ve never been in this situation before.”“The rational part of your brain can tell you it’s unlikely to happen, but then the other part … it still could happen,” she adds. “So it’s a horrible thing to live under, and the fact that it comes with a potential life [sentence] in prison.”When Packer’s trial finally came around at the end of April, the prosecution opening including details of her sex life, which included her alternative relationships.“It was completely unnecessary, and it was just done to make me look bad,” she says. “And potentially you’re dealing with something that people may never have heard of, wouldn’t understand, may have a bad opinion of. It was completely not needed.”At one point, Packer was forced to sit in court while lawyers discussed the size of her nipples with the judge. Intimate photographs of her were shown to the jury; evidence of her flat stomach.“It was quite humiliating,” she says. “I didn’t want anybody to see those photos, but I knew that it was for my own good.“We hid what we could, but because my nipples were such a hot topic, we couldn’t blank them out in pictures,” she says. “It’s not nice knowing that people have seen such intimate pictures of you.”“It was horrendous giving evidence, absolutely awful,” she says. “It was very upsetting, I spent most of the time crying while I was doing it, but I got through it because I knew that I was right.”And the jury agreed, finding her not guilty after about six hours of deliberations.“It was just wonderful to get that verdict,” she said. “I just feel that although the last four and a half years been absolutely horrific, I don’t know if I could say at the moment it was worth it, but to have that validation of being found unanimously not guilty by a jury of my peers, it’s an amazing thing.”Having cleared her name, Packer is now throwing her weight behind the voices calling for a change in the law that would decriminalise abortion. A parliamentary vote is expected on the issue as early as this summer.“I do hope that the law does get changed – it should do,” she said. “Abortion is healthcare. It should not be treated as anything other than that.”A CPS spokesperson said: “We recognise the profound strength of feeling these cases evoke, but have a duty to apply laws passed by parliament fairly and impartially.”They said the CPS’s role had not been to decide whether Packer’s actions were right or wrong, “but to make a factual judgment about whether she knew she was beyond the legal limit when she procured an abortion”, and it had considered there was enough evidence to take the case to court.Regarding the sharing of sensitive details and intimate images in court, the CPS spokesperson said this was often part of the justice process. In Packer’s case it was done, “by both the prosecution and defence, to establish the timing of her pregnancy and her understanding of the gestation period when she accessed abortion medication”.“It is never our intention to publicly embarrass or humiliate anyone with the evidence we put forward,” they said.Packer says such prosecutions “could happen to anybody, I think that’s what’s really scary about it. With the law being as it is, a tragic accident and you’re up on trial, and it’s why the law needs to change.”Packer wants to make history as the last woman in England to be prosecuted for an abortion. She has heard of other women whose cases are in the early stages of the criminal justice system, and she wants to use her voice to ensure they never see the inside of a courtroom.“I can’t really say it was worth it,” she says, “but at least it would have meant something.”Aside from campaigning for legislative change, how does Packer plan to move on from this? “That is a very good question,” she says. “I do feel a bit like I need to find myself again.”While awaiting trial, she sought comfort in familiar music and television; she listened to the same albums from her favourite rock artists on repeat, rewatched her favourite series’ back-to-back. But she found she could no longer watch Orange Is The New Black.“I had to turn it off,” she says. “I couldn’t watch it any more because I started to get a really eerie feeling; this is set in a prison, I might go to a prison.”But, she adds: “I started re-watching it last night.”Explore more on these topicsAbortionWomenReproductive rightsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Plus letters fromMatt Powell, Shayne Mary MitchellandMichael FortWed 14 May 2025 12.56 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 13.19 EDTShareAs a social worker who wrote hundreds of pre-sentence reports before becoming a criminologist, and someone who has been to prison before all of that, I would urge the judge in the case of the two men convicted of felling the Sycamore Gap tree to act creatively and constructively (Two men found guilty of ‘mindless, moronic’ felling of Sycamore Gap tree, 9 May).The UK sendsmore people to prison, andfor longer, than all other European countries. People seem to think that anything other than a prison sentence is tantamount to absolving the convicted of guilt and letting them escape punishment. Community penalties restrict liberty, and compel individuals to put something back and learn from their mistakes. Sending the two men to prison will damage their respective futures and achieve little else.Conventional mitigations that the men have shown remorse or insight into their actions both seem absent at this stage, but although locking them up might be popular, it would do little more than give legal form to the destructive vengeful sentiments of an understandably outraged public.A creative sentence would challenge the men to face up to what they have done, while a custodial sentence will merely get rid of them for a while. There are alternatives, and this is a great opportunity for the judge to use them. Doing so would show that the men’s actions can be condemned without adding needlessly to the sum of misery and destruction in the world.Dr Rod EarleSenior lecturer in youth justice,The Open UniversityNo doubt this was an idiotic act of wanton vandalism, but let’s get a bit of proportion here. Sycamore trees arenot native to Britain, but probably brought here in the 1500s. This sycamore was not particularly old. If the tree was so “iconic”, why had the local council failed to place a tree preservation order on it? Themonetary value placed on the tree in the trial – £622,191– was ridiculous. How on earth was that calculated? Based on outrage?How will society benefit from a custodial sentence for these two fools? Would it not be more fitting for a court to decide that they should plant 2,000 trees each? Planting trees is loathsome, back-breaking work. Justice served and hopefully a lesson learned.Matt PowellHolne, DevonThe two men found guilty of what is described as the “mindless” and “moronic” felling of the Sycamore Gap tree have been told by the judge that they could face “a lengthy period” in jail.It was indeed a tragedy. Yet no developer or landowner has ever gone to prison for cutting down beloved and listed trees. At best, they get a slap on the wrist or a paltry fine far less than the profit made. If you want to chop down a wonderful tree and get away with it, be moneyed and middle class. This seems to be the law at its most classist.Shayne Mary MitchellCambridgeIf Adam Carruthers and Daniel Graham can be given a custodial sentence for cutting down a 150-year-old sycamore, I think that the managers of the Toby Carvery who commissioned the cutting down of a 500-year-old oak should face a commensurate sentence, so it’s a shame that the police decided that it was civil matter and closed their investigation (Felling of ancient London oak tree by Toby Carvery owner reported to police, 15 April).Michael FortHuddersfield, West YorkshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It was during a standoff between Israeli settlers, the Israeli army and the Palestinian farmers who owned the land we were helping to harvest.She said the land was “empty” when Kedumim was established in 1975, and that the well-established old olive trees were wild. I pointed out that they were growing in well-spaced rows. “They’re wild,” she replied. I noted that the hillside was terraced with stones. “They’re wild,” she repeated. I gave up discussing further.Louis Theroux, in his excellent film, summed her up well with a single word: “sociopathic”.We no longer go to help harvest those lands as they have been stolen by settlers. Weiss has the full support of the Israeli government. She and the settlers have access to automatic weapons and the protection of the Israeli army. The Palestinians have no protection whatsoever. Anyone with an ounce of humanity can see which side we should be supporting.Maggie FoyerFounder, The Olive Harvest TrustLouis Theroux’s documentary will have been achingly familiar to us Northern Irish. It is no surprise that our divided communities identify with one side or the other, and both Palestinian and Israeli flags are widely flown here, each calling out that we know your pain and we’re on your side. One can’t make like-for-like comparisons, but the story of a settler community that pushes the other aside but doesn’t completely succeed in that, and an incumbent community that is resentful and oppressed, is understood here.Also understood is that it plays out over centuries, not years. Maybe there are lessons too, as we work through our peace and reconciliation process. We’re a more hopeful place now, even if there is still a few hundred years to go.Paul HealyDerryHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Indeed, some poorly classified areas of the green belt help nobody, featuring disused car parks or industrial land.Therefore, if we are going to build, we should do so in harmony with nature. And this is where ministers must step in. Without strong, consistent laws balancing competing demands over our land and environment, with appropriate independent checks and oversight, we risk accelerating the decline of nature in pursuit of growth, while hurting the very people and sectors we are looking to help.The planning and infrastructure bill is a prime example of where the government must think again about how it ends the injustice of sky-high rents, alongside restoring nature-depleted urban areas. As it stands, part 3 of the bill slows down developers, making their work more costly and complex. It is a “lose-lose” for builders, the economy and nature, and must be put on hold for proper consultation.Alexa CulverGeneral counsel, RSK WildingHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It was at a time when we were being quite clear about the issues around sovereignty,” he said.Carney, who won a party race to become prime minister in March before he secured victory in Canada’s election last month by vowing to stand up Trump, said Charles’s presence in Canada later this month was by design.“All issues around Canada’s sovereignty have been accentuated by the president. So no, it’s not coincidental, but it is also a reaffirming moment for Canadians,” he said.Starmer, who is trying to improve trading ties with the US after Britain left the European Union, has sought to play to its strengths when dealing with Trump, talking up its security expertise, pledging higher defence spending, and offering the pomp and pageantry that comes with a state visit.Trump, whose mother was born in Scotland and who has repeatedly praised the British royal family, agreed a limited bilateral trade agreement with London this month.Asked about Carney’s criticism, the senior British minister Pat McFadden told Sky News that every country had to decide how to conduct its relations with other countries.Explore more on these topicsCanadaDonald TrumpKeir StarmerAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The prosecutor’s office did not name a suspect.Seconds before the incident, Márquez was seen on her TikTok live stream seated at a table clutching a stuffed toy. She was heard saying, “They’re coming,” before a voice in the background asked: “Hey, Vale?”“Yes,” Márquez replied, just before muting the sound on the live stream.‘Femicide nation’: murder of young woman casts spotlight on Mexico’s gender violence crisisRead moreMoments later, she was shot to death. A person appeared to pick up her phone, with their face briefly showing on the live stream before the video ended.Márquez, who had nearly 200,000 followers across Instagram and TikTok, had said earlier on the live stream that someone came to the salon when she was not there with an “expensive gift” to deliver to her. Márquez, who appeared concerned, said she was not planning to wait for the person to come back.Mexico is tied with Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia as the countries with the fourth-highest rates of femicide in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the latest data from the United Nations economic commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, at 1.3 such deaths for every 100,000 women in 2023.Jalisco is ranked sixth out of Mexico’s 32 states, including Mexico City, for homicides, with 906 recorded there since the beginning of President Claudia Sheinbaum’s term in October 2024, according to the data consultancy TResearch.Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Just ahead of that deal closing, Rumble inked another deal to provide cloud services to El Salvador’s government, with Bukele’s regime saying the arrangement rested on shared values of “freedom, innovation and prosperity”.Does Nayib Bukele’s campaign against democracy give a blueprint for Trump?Read moreAs well as facilitating the buy – which allowed Rumble insiders to cash out with nine- and 10-figure windfalls – Cantor has been a longterm investor in Rumble since it sponsored the special purpose acquisition company (Spac) that took the platform public.Tether relocated to El Salvadorin January, where the regime allows crypto firms to operate tax- and regulation-free – and has taken advantage of further tax breaks to accumulate real estate in downtown San Salvador alongside transplanted US crypto influencers and members of Bukele’s family.New York Timesreportingthis week revealed some of the relationships previously scandal-plagued for Tether have become more palatable in Washington during the Trump administration, but not the extent of the company’s ties to El Salvador.Cantor and Lutnick’s El Salvador deals raise further questions about the Trump administration’s deepening involvement with Bukele’s authoritarian regime, which has imprisoned 2% of its population during a two-year “state of exception”, which has consolidated Bukele’s power during a harsh crackdown on criminal gangs.They also raise questions about the direction of cryptocurrency regulations after Tether’s founder, Giancarlo Devasini, reportedly told associates in November that Lutnick would “use his political clout” to lift the regulatory scrutiny that has plagued the troubled firm for almost a decade.TetherTether – whichreportedlymints the world’s most traded cryptocurrency – has attracted controversy since it was founded in 2014 alongside sister company Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange by Devasini, an Italian former cosmetic surgeon who has relocated to El Salvador.Increasingly, it also attracted hostile attention from US regulators. As recently as October, the Wall Street Journalreportedthat the Manhattan US attorney’s office was investigating Tether for its use in sanctions busting, money laundering, and “to fund illegal activities such as the drug trade, terrorism and hacking”.That was the19th timethat Tether had attracted US government action, according to reporting at Protos, a cryptocurrency watchdog outlet. Many previous investigations and prosecutions alleged a fundamental fraud at the heart of Tether’s business.The main product, USDT, is a stablecoin, a cryptocurrency whose value is exactly equivalent to that of the US dollar.As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to offer a stable reservoir of value amid the volatility of crypto markets, allowing investors to trade, invest and transfer funds in dollar-equivalent values.Its dollar equivalence is purportedly secured by an amount of US dollars, or easily converted equivalent assets, so that any holder can convert their USDT into dollars at any time. In theory, the company derives its profits from interest on the holdings that back its cryptocurrency.But cryptocurrency traders, critics, government agencies and law enforcement have persistently questioned whether Tether holds reserves equivalent to the USDTs it has issued.In 2021, Tether and Bitfinexagreedto jointly settle a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) suit with a payment of $42.5m, with $41m of that coming from Tether.In their statement on the fines, CFTC said: “From at least June 1, 2016 to February 25, 2019, Tether misrepresented to customers and the market that Tether maintained sufficient U.S. dollar reserves to back every USDT in circulation.”Instead, the statement said: Tether had “relied upon unregulated entities and certain third-parties to hold funds comprising the reserves; co-mingled reserve funds with Bitfinex’s operational and customer funds; and held reserves in non-fiat financial products”.The same year, theyhad paid $18.5mto the New York attorney general’s office to settle a suit that foreshadowed the circumstances surrounding the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The attorney general’s office alleged that Tether had commingled client and corporate funds to cover up an $850m shortfall in their reserves.As part of the settlement, Tether and Bitfinex were not required to admit wrongdoing.In January, Protosreportedin summary that the company had “lied repeatedly about the quality and quantity of its backing”.The company has also resisted compliance with regulations designed to ensure that stablecoins including USDT have sufficient backing.Critics slam deregulation of crypto as Trump family expands its footprint in industryRead moreTether is not currently listed on European exchanges because of the company’s refusal to comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (Mica) framework, effective from 1 January. It requires stable issuers operating in Europe to obtain authorization as an electronic money institution, and to hold at least 60% of their reserve assets in European banks.Other allegations have probed Tether’s knowledge and involvement in the use of the token in illicit activities like sanctions busting and trafficking.Ricardo Valencia, an assistant professor at California State University, Fullerton, and a former staffer at the Salvadorian US embassy under a previous administration, said that the growing relationship between Tether and the Bukele regime was unsurprising.While the Trump regime was exploiting the “crypto gulag horror movie” ofCecot, a destination of summarily deported immigrants under Trump, both the US administration and Tether were exploiting the fact that “you can pay the Salvadoran government to do shady deals for a fee,” Valencia said.Lutnick and TetherThe extent of Lutnick’s relationship with Tether only fully came to lightduring his confirmation hearings in January, when US senators including Democrat Elizabeth Warren sought to shed light on how entwined Lutnick’s business affairs were with the cryptocurrency firm.On 27 January, just ahead of those hearings, Warren sent aletterto Lutnick that in part said: “Your deep involvement with and support for Tether, a known facilitator of criminal activity that has been described as ‘outlaws’ favorite cryptocurrency,’ raises concerns about your judgment and ability to put the interests of the American people ahead of your own financial interests.”In the hearings, Lutnick disclosed that a 2024 deal gave Cantor a convertible bond equivalent to a 5% stake in Tether, whose value he put at $600m. Meanwhile, according to the Wall Street Journal, Cantor “holds most of Tether’s $134 billion in assets, largely US Treasury bills, in exchange for tens of millions of dollars in fees each year”.The relationship began at a time when Tether was in perhaps its deepest crisis. After they had paid the combined $61m in settlement funds to the New York attorney general and CFTC, Tether’s Bahamian bankers lost their ability to process international payments, cutting them off from customers.Reportedly, an investment adviser from their original bank connected them to Lutnick.According to the Wall Street Journal, Lutnick personally traveled to meet Devasini, the Tether founder, in the Bahamas in late 2021 to determine whether the company had the assets it claimed to have.Last July, he told a crypto conference that at that time, “I said: ‘Show me the money’”, and that “we found every penny, and they had every penny, but they had it in what I would call some pretty godforsaken places.”Previous reports have suggested that at times, Tether’s backing has carried significant proportions of so-called “commercial paper”: undertakings from other companies to repay loans at a future date.Cantor later became Tether’s asset manager, and its position as a so-called primary dealer in the treasury market meant that it could liquidate assets with relative ease. The firm alsoreportedlywon the business of some crypto-trading firms who are Tether customers.El SalvadorEven before relocating and re-incorporating in El Salvador, Tether’s managers apparently exercised significant influence in Bukele’s crypto-happy regime.Salvadoran media reports show that Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, US crypto advocates who head El Salvador’s national bitcoin office, are also investors in Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency exchange that was founded by Tether’s Devasini and whose management overlaps with the stablecoin firm.In 2023, Salvadoran newspaper El Farocalledthe office they run “Bitfinex’s puppet embedded in the Salvadoran state”.That year, Tetherannounceda $250m investment in Bukele’s project that sought to harness geothermal energy to fuel bitcoin mining at a so-called “Volcano Energy” park.The company alsoplannedto collaborate in the issuance of bonds to finance the construction of a planned bitcoin city in the country, though that project never came to fruition.More recently, Tether identities have been on a real estate spending spree in the country.According toreports, Devasini bought a house in San Salvador for $2m.He alsoreportedlybought a historic hotel building in downtown San Salvador in a joint venture with Keiser. This purchase of “a prime location in the historic center”, according to El Faro, came into force after the regime exempted investors in that part of town from income tax.Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, bought two plots of land in the port city of La Libertad, in a deal that revealed he had been naturalized as a Salvadorian citizen.Tether is also set toreceive tax concessionsfor a planned 70-storey headquarters tower in San Salvador.The Rumble dealIn the Rumble deal, concluded on 7 February, Tether Holdings handed $775m to Rumble, with $525m earmarked for a “self-tender offer” for a share buyback, and another $250m hitting Rumble’s balance sheet for “growth initiatives”, according to the announcement.Weeks after the announcement, Rumble and El Salvador announced their partnership on cloud services infrastructure, despite the country announcing a separate deal with cloud titansGoogle in 2023.Market analysts say this makes Tether the single largest shareholder in the company, with just more than 20% of all outstanding shares.But the deal also put constraints on Tether’s influence over Rumble. According to Rumble’s 20 December press release and the SEC filing announcing the deal, “Rumble’s existing Board and governance structure, including Chris Pavlovski’s super-majority voting control, will remain unchanged”, and “Tether will own a minority position in our outstanding common stock but will not have the right to designate any members of the Board”.This lack of say in Rumble’s operations is not offset by the likelihood of near-term profits.From crypto bro to commerce secretary pick: Howard Lutnick’s glaring conflict of interestRead moreWriting on the Tether-Rumble deal when it was announced in December, financial news site Sherwood reported that “by any conventional metric, Rumble is just a really, really bad business”, noting that “inQ3 2023, it lost $29m on $18m in revenue, and inQ3 2024it lost $32m on $25m in revenue”.Sherwood also noted that “the company’s cash and cash equivalents shrank from $218m at the beginning of the year to $131m at the end of September” and that “at its current pace the company would be running low on cash within the next 12 months”, since “despite its revenue growth, Rumble’s losses have grown even faster”.Rumble’s Trump connectionTether’s interest in buying into Rumble – even without any significant say over its operations – may be explained by its alignment with the Trump administration.The company’s central offering is an “anti-woke” video platform that won favor among Maga influencers beginning in 2020, amid crackdowns on pandemic and election disinformation on leading platforms such as YouTube.At that time, Rumble leaned into an anti-“cancel culture” pitch, offered signing deals to rightwing, conspiracy-minded and contrarian creators such asAndrew Tate,Tulsi Gabbard and Glenn Greenwald, and positioned itself as a pillar of a rightwing “parallel economy” of explicitly ideological, Maga-forward companies advocating for an ideologically inflected vision of “free speech”.In its first round of venture capital funding in 2021, lead investors were rightwing billionaire Peter Thiel andJD Vance’s venture fund,Narya Capital. Vance and Thiel reportedly exited their investments after Rumble went public in September 2022.In 2022, Trump’s Truth Social platform, operated by Trump Media and Technology Group, became the first outside publisher toadoptRumble’s ad network, an alternative to dominant players such as Google’s AdSense. At that time, Rumble’s CEO said the ad network’s mission was to “fight back against cancel culture”.At the beginning of 2023, the companyinkeda “seven-figure” deal with Donald Trump Jr to exclusively carry his biweekly livestream show, Triggered.Rumblesuedthe government of Brazil, alongside Trump Media, over a Brazilian judge’s order that the platforms remove accounts of a supporter of Brazil’s former president, Jair Bolsonaro.On 12 February, Pavlovski was given a “new media” seat at the White House’s daily press conference, where he told spokesperson Karoline Leavitt “Rumble was a victim of censorship at the hands of multiple foreign governments” and asked: “Can you describe what the administration will do to protect US interests and values worldwide?”Lutnick’s endVia Cantor, Lutnick was also deeply involved with Rumble.Under Lutnick, Cantor “made a fortune, thanks to a favorable deal structure”,according to Forbeswhen it sponsored the special purpose acquisition company that took Rumble public in 2022.Spacs allow private companies to go public by merging with a shell company set up to explore such merger opportunities. They have been popular in the last half-decade because they enable companies to avoid the investor and regulatory scrutiny that comes ahead of a more conventional initial public offering.Spac sponsors, such as Cantor, are generally issued with stocks and warrants in the eventual public company with little downside risk. In the Rumble Spac, 12m shares, or 4.6% of the total, were issued to “Sponsor Related Parties” according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.Prospectuses filed by Rumble show that at the time the company went public, several people and entities related to Lutnick and his family had also been dealt in. Lutnick 2020 Descendants Trust UA had 375,000 shares; his wife, Allison Lutnick, had 50,000 shares; and his sister, Edith Lutnick, had 35,000 shares.This may be the source of the holdings disclosed in Cantor’s most recent holdings report, filed on 14 February, which indicates that the company he led holds 9.3m Rumble shares, which at that time they valued at over $120m.Lutnick personally owned between $1m and $5m worth of Rumble stock according to his Office of Government Ethics filings.Finally, Cantor was the placement agent for Tether’s buy-in to Rumble. Normally such a role attracts fees, but Lutnick said at his confirmation hearing that on this occasion Cantor waived them.RumbleRumble had several officers and shareholders besides Lutnick who have since gone on to serve in the Trump administration.Tech-right ideologue and venture capitalist David Sacks resigned from Rumble’s board in December “to pursue a position in government”, according to a 13 December SEC filing. He now serves as the Trump administration’s “crypto czar”.Sacks joined the board in 2023 after Rumble acquired Callin, the podcasting and livestreaming platform he founded, and Locals, a crowdfunding platform fronted by rightwing comedian Dave Rubin that Sacks had backed.Any share sales he made in the February deal were not subject to insider trading disclosures. However, the most recent filing detailing Sacks interest in the company from last July shows him increasing his shareholding to just over 571,000 shares, a position being worth over $4.2m in the Tether deal.Crypto giant Tether CEO on cooperating with Trump administration: ‘We’ve never been shady’Read moreEthan Fallang, formerly a board member of Rumble and Narya Capital – the Vance-founded venture firm – resigned in January to work in government, according to SEC filings. The most recent documentation of his holdings while he was still on the board show him owning some 27,000 shares.Although he is not subject to insider trading disclosures, filings show that Trump’s deputy FBI director, Dan Bongino, has maintained his 5.72% share in Rumble since it went public. No OGE agreements or disclosures for Bongino have been made public to date.OGE disclosures do indicate that on the way into their jobs, Bongino’s new boss, Kash Patel, held between $1,001 and $15,000 worth of stock; transportation secretary Sean Duffy held between $1,000 and $15,000; and the director of national intelligence, Gabbard, held between $100,001 and $250,000 of the stock.Patel, Gabbard and Lutnick all undertook to divest themselves of holdings including their interest in Rumble within 90 days of taking office, according to their OGE agreements.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationCryptocurrenciesEl SalvadorUS immigrationAmericasUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

These conditions include scrutinising supply chains and ownership structures – a move widely interpreted as targeting Chinese involvement.Beijing argues the agreement violates the principle that international agreements should not target third countries, noting this is a “basic principle”.China’s foreign ministry criticised the agreement in a statement to theFinancial Times. It said: “Cooperation between states should not be conducted against or to the detriment of the interests of third parties.”Beijing fears these clauses are designed to pressure allies into excluding Chinese products, in effect isolating China economically.China is doubling down on what it calls “dual circulation” – boosting domestic production and resilience so its economy can thrive. State-backed companies are being pushed to source components locally, and ministries are funnelling support into advanced manufacturing and green technology.Under the UK-US deal signed last week the US agreed to reduce tariffs on British car exports from 27.5% to 10%, applicable to a quota of 100,000 vehicles annually. Tariffs on UK steel and aluminium have also been lifted, provided British companies meet strict US security conditions, particularly around supply chain transparency and foreign ownership – measures that implicitly limit Chinese involvement.The deal also includes liberalised quotas for US beef and ethanol exports to the UK, alongside a commitment to explore deeper cooperation in pharmaceuticals and advanced manufacturing, contingent again on UK compliance with US security provisions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zhang Yansheng, a senior researcher at the China Academy of Macroeconomic Research, said the UK’s actions were “not fair to China”. He described the deal’s clauses as “poison pills” that were worse than tariffs.A government spokesperson said: “This government signed a deal with the US in the national interest to secure thousands of jobs across key sectors, protect British businesses and lay the groundwork for greater trade in the future.“In line with our long-term, consistent approach, trade and investment with China remain important to the UK.

The former president, who was ousted after the constitutional courtupheld his impeachmentlast month, made his third appearance in court in a separate criminal trial while senior figures in his conservative People Power party (PPP) clashed over who should run in the election to succeed him.South Koreans are celebrating Yoon’s impeachment, but the saga is far from overRead moreAfter days of public infighting, the party announced that the former labour minister and hardline conservativeKim Moon-soo, would run. He will be up against Lee Jae-myung, the liberal Democratic party candidate, who leads comfortably in the polls.Lee, whonarrowly lostto Yoon in 2022 after a divisive campaign, thanked his supporters for helping him rebuild after the “painful defeat” three years ago. “I promise to repay their support with victory,” he told a crowd in Seoul.Kim will be hoping to banish memories of Yoon’s botched suspension of civilian rule and prioritise his plans for the economy amid record-high youth unemployment, and a housing and cost-of-living crisis.“I genuinely believe I must become a president for the people, a president for livelihoods, a president for the economy,” Kim told reporters after launching his campaign at a market in the capital. “I must be a president who ensures the people ofSouth Korealive well.”Lee, meanwhile, is contesting criminal charges that have threatened to disqualify him from the race. His ongoing trials range from alleged bribery to charges mostly linked to a $1bn property development scandal. He has, though, been given breathing room after courts agreed to push back further hearings until after the election. He denies all charges.Kim’s chaotic selection underlined the size of the challenge facing the PPP since Yoon, a conservative populist, attempted to impose martial law to confront what he described as “pro-North Korean” elements in the Democrat-controlled national assembly.Yoon, who was impeached by the assembly two weeks later, was succeeded by two acting presidents while the constitutional court considered his fate. He is on trial on charges ofinsurrection– a crime that carries life in prison or the death penalty, although South Korea has not carried out an execution since 1997. Yoon has denied the charges.Kim was initially selected to run for president in early May, only for his candidacy to be cancelled as senior party figures attempted to replace him with the former prime minister, Han Duck-soo, whom they said had a better chance of defeating the resurgent Lee.Party members voted down the attempted coup and Kim was reinstated, amid warnings that infighting would hand Lee an easy victory.Even PPP supporters said they were dismayed by the party’s preparations for the election. “The PPP is just a mess. They are self-destructing,” said Lee Jung-ja, a 52-year-old voter. “Even if they unite, it still won’t be enough. All they’re doing is fighting with each other. I bet Lee Jae-myung is gloating.”If elected, Kim said he would demand an immediate summit with Donald Trump to negotiate tariffs and take a hard line against nuclear-armedNorth Korea. He has promised to create a more business-friendly environment to encourage private investment and to increase housing support for young people and newly married couples.Lee has campaigned in a bulletproof vest following claims by Democratic party lawmakers that they had received text messages warning of an assassinate plot. They claimed he was being targeted by former operatives from a covert South Korean military unit that operated when the country was ruled by authoritarian regimes from the 1960s to the 1980s.Lee, who wasstabbed in the neckduring a press conference in January 2024, referred to the unusual precaution, telling supporters that South Korean society was “now so fractured that a presidential candidate must campaign in a bulletproof vest”.Lee has said he will boost economic growth through AI and theKorean culture wave– a major driver of exports and inbound tourism – and offer tax incentives to encourage couples tohave more children.Like previous liberal candidates, he has vowed to restart a dialogue with North Korea, despite the regime’s development of nuclear weapons andmilitary alliance with Russia.In an editorial, the Korea Herald noted that Yoon’s impeachment had left little time for debate and urged South Koreans to “resist partisan reflexes”.The newspaper said: “The next president will inherit more than a fractured government. They will inherit the responsibility to restore institutional trust, re-anchor the economy and navigate an increasingly volatile global order. The task ahead is formidable.”With less than three weeks until the election, one poll gave Lee a lead over Kim of 43% to 29%, while another put Lee on 49.5% and Kim on 38.2%Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaYoon Suk YeolAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

An application for parental rights over a second girl from the north-east, who was born in March 2023, was also turned down.In both cases, he had sex with the women. It was a “free” service, which Albon on his Facebook page said meant recipients did not have to “have a weirdo in a lab coat look at your hoohaw”.In the case of the three-year-old, the mother contacted him over Facebook in 2021, and he asked her to send a picture before travelling 250 miles the same day for sex. The woman already had seven children, five of whom were not in her care.Afterwards, Albon exchanged messages with the woman, who later wrote: “Have done an awful lot of thinking about how you have treated me. I can’t eat. I actually came within minutes of ending my life this morning. It was my 17-year-old that stopped me. I cannot carry on any longer. You have truly broken me.”In messages, she accused him of using the unborn child to try to get benefits and a house.In the case of the two-year-old girl, Albon did not appear on the child’s birth certificate, though he initially had some contact with her.Albon applied for declaration of parentage, parental responsibility and contact with the girl, which the mother opposed, giving evidence in court from behind a screen.The woman, who was described as “suggestible” by the judge, learned his name was Robert, and not Joe, only after the child was born. She was described by social services as being vulnerable, having a very unstable family background and was assessed to have an IQ of 75.Albon, who has families with a Japanese woman and a Chinese woman he is estranged from, has also fathered dozens of children across South America, Australia and the UK.In the US, where he was offering sperm donor services until 2017, there is a warrant for his arrest over unpaid child maintenance amounting to thousands of dollars.In an interview with the Sun last August, he said: “I’ve had about 180 live births and I’ve met about 60 of them.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsSperm donationEnglandChildrenCardiffMiddlesbroughSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

Researchers said the trackways represent the oldest evidence of amniotes on the planet.“The implications are profound,” said Flinders University palaeontologist Prof John Long, lead author of the paper,published in Nature. “It’s rewriting the story of the amniotes – evolving much earlier than people had thought.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe discovery also hinted at their emergence in the ancient southern continent of Gondwana, rather than in the northern hemisphere, he said. The trackways were much older than previous amniote fossils and tracks – from Europe and North America – dated to about 318 million years ago, as well as an earlier example identified by the authors in the course of their research.Fossil hunters Craig Eury and John Eason found the footprints on the banks of the Broken River near the town of Mansfield, on Taungurung country, 200km north-east of Melbourne.Long, whose connection to fossils of the area stretches back 45 years, has kept in contact with a “local band of dedicated Mansfield locals”.View image in fullscreenFlinders University palaeontologist Prof John Long.Photograph: Traci KlarenbeekHe said he was “gobsmacked” when Eason sent him an email with a photograph of the find, asking: “Is this anything?”When the photo opened on his screen, he said: “It was a beautiful set of not one but a couple of different sets of trackways criss-crossing the slab.”An ancient rain shower had pockmarked the slab’s surface, indicating exposed ground. Later, reptilian track makers came through, leaving five-toed prints, some with imprints of claws, and scratch marks from digging.Detailed investigations by Flinders University specialists in CT scanning and trackways, and world experts in early tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) tracks at Uppsala University in Sweden, confirmed the significance of the find.The discovery pushed back the arrival of amniotes to the early carboniferous, a period named for the rich coal beds that formed in the northern hemisphere at the time, Long said.The period was a “turning point” in the Earth’s history, he said. Oxygen levels were high and huge forests dominated the land. Swamps were full of amphibians, some up to five metres in length, and huge sharks invaded the rivers. A great diversity of animals and plants started appearing – bony fishes and seed-bearing trees.“It was really a changing of the guard from the archaic fishes and plants that characterised the first half of the palaeozoic era, to the kind of assemblages that would dominate right through to today.”That included the amniotes – defined by the amniotic membrane that allowed them to lay eggs or reproduce outside of water – adapted for life on the land.Giant prehistoric kangaroos preferred to ‘chill at home’ and didn’t like to go out much, scientists sayRead more“It’s a very exciting story for Australian science,” Long said. “It hints there’s a lot more work to do [and] a lot more field work. Now we’ve got the footprints we need to find the bones of these things.”Dr Erich Fitzgerald, a senior curator of vertebrate palaeontology at Museums Victoria Research Institute, who was not involved in the study, said it was a “provocative discovery with potentially far-reaching implications”.“What we need next is to find body fossils – bones from these rocks – that can confirm the presence of amniotes so long ago.”Fitzgerald said the discovery of the trackway highlighted the importance of “Australia’s spectacular fossil record”, much of which was relatively understudied, and revealed the importance of collaboration between professional scientists and keen members of the public.“This is a jaw-droppingly beautiful example of the importance of continuing to search for and collect new fossils,” he said. “Palaeontology is still in the process of unravelling the mysteries of the evolution of life … and the evolution of us.”Explore more on these topicsFossilsAustralian climate and environment in focusnewsShareReuse this content"

And what our studies found was that they show that the Bayesian may have been vulnerable to high winds and that these winds were likely to have been evident at the time of the accident.”Investigators said “there was no indication of flooding inside Bayesian until water came in over the starboard rails and, within seconds, entered the internal spaces down the stairwells”.MAIB said its report was based on “a limited amount of verified evidence” as a criminal investigation by Italian authorities has restricted its access to the wreck and other pieces of evidence.Further details such as “escape routes” will be included in the final report, once MAIB get access to the vessel.The full investigation report will not be published within 12 months.The wreck currently sits at a depth of 50 metres in the bay of Porticello.Recovery operations toraisethe Bayesian, which began early in May, have been suspended after a diver died during underwater work.Preparatory work onsite to resume the recovery is due to begin on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The fare was paid in full.“The foreign secretary and his wife are named as victims in this matter and the driver has been charged with theft.“As there is an ongoing legal process, it would be inappropriate to comment further.”Explore more on these topicsDavid LammyFranceEuropeCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

More than 80% of its electricity is generated from renewables, including wind, biofuels and solar, according to the International Energy Agency.But Denmark may begin investing in modular nuclear reactors too, Lars Aagaard, the energy and climate minister, suggested.Aagaard told the Danish newspaper Politiken: “We can see that there is a development under way with new nuclear power technologies – small, modular reactors. But it’s not enough that they have potential. We also need to know what it means for Danish society if we are to enable these technologies.”The country’s decision to reconsider nuclear power has emerged as interest in new nuclear reactor designs has picked up across Europe, alongside plans to extend the lifespan of the continent’s existing reactors.Denmark’s former prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen told the Financial Times on Wednesday he supported lifting the “ridiculous” ban on nuclear power.“Wind and solar are good as long as you have wind and sunshine. But you have to have a non-fossil base-load and it’s ridiculous to exclude nuclear power in advance. My guess is that this is a process [from the government] towards lifting the ban,” he said.Renewed European interest in nuclear power is in part because of an expected increase in demand for low-carbon electricity to decarbonise transport, industry and home heating in the decades ahead.The developers of small modular reactor designs, which can be built in factories and assembled on site, have promised lower costs and shorter construction times than traditional large-scale reactors.Nuclear power has also won the backing of tech companies, including Google, which are interested in usingsmall modular nuclear reactorsto supply their energy-hungry datacentres with consistent 24-hour electricity.Spain, widely considered anti-nuclear, is understood to be reconsidering plans to shut down its seven nuclear reactors in the next decade after amassive power outage across the Iberian peninsula last month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week, itcancelled one of the UK’s largest offshore windfarms, Hornsea 4, off the Yorkshire coast, saying soaring costs meant it no longer made economic sense.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkNuclear powerEnergy industryRenewable energyEnergyEuropeGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

She added that Khan Suri’s release was “in the public interest to disrupt the chilling effect on protected speech” during the hearing. The judge explained in her ruling how the government did not submit sufficient evidence on several of its claims.Denied, detained, deported: the faces of Trump’s immigration crackdownRead moreA large crowd of demonstrators outside the courthouse reportedly cheered upon hearing the news of the ruling.Badar Khan Suri will go home to his family in Virginia while he awaits the outcome of his petition against theTrump administrationfor wrongful arrest and detention in violation of the first amendment and other constitutional rights.He is also facing deportation proceedings in an immigration court in Texas.“Justice delayed is justice denied,” Khan Suri told reporters after his release from a detention facility in Alvarado, near Dallas. “It took two months, but I’m extremely thankful that finally I’m free.”The Trump administration had ordered the detention of Khan Suri, a citizen of India, on 17 March. He was previously being held at animmigrationprison in Alvarado, Texas.Immigration officials revoked his J-1 student visa, alleging his father-in-law, Ahmed Yousef, was an adviser to Hamas officials more than a decade ago in addition to claims that he was “deportable” because of his posts on social media in support of Palestine. Yousef, who has not been an adviser to Hamas in over a decade, has said Khan Suri was not involved in “political activism” on behalf of Hamas.On March 15, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, issued a determination that Khan Suri’s presence in the US “would have potentially serious foreign policy consequences”, according to a statement filed in the case by a Virginia immigration office.Khan Suri, who is married to a Palestinian American US citizen, Mapheze Saleh, is a senior postdoctoral fellow at the institution’s Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU). Many students and alumni of the institutionsigned a letteropposing his detention by Ice.Giles prohibited federal officials in March from deporting the postdoctoral fellow after his wife filed an emergency court request to prevent deportation.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationVirginiaTrump administrationWashington DCIndiaPalestinian territoriesUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The White House and Saudi governmentannounced an arms dealworth $142bn following the event.Musk was one of a long list of Silicon Valley moguls and top executives of major US companies to attend the summit. The CEO of Palantir and Musk ally, Alex Karp, took part, as did the OpenAI CEO and Musk rival, Sam Altman. Amazon’s chief executive, Andy Jassy, and Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, were some of the other tech leaders present. The list also included CEOs from a range of boldface names such as Boeing, Coca-Cola and Halliburton.Earlier on Tuesday, Musk talked with Trump and Prince Mohammed inside the Saudi Royal Court and warmly greeted both leaders. Weeks before Musk’s arrival in Riyadh, his Twitter/X social media platform had managed to refinance some of its billions in debt withhelp from a Saudi fund.

Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter.”Sharaa, 42, later hailed Trump’s decision to lift sanctions as “a historic and courageous decision, which alleviates the suffering of the people, contributes to their rebirth and lays the foundations for stability in the region”.In a late-night television address, he said: “Syrians, the road before us is still long. Today we begin the real work, with which modern Syria will be reborn.”Ordinary Syrians watched the images of their president standing beside the leaders of the US and Saudi Arabia on their TV screens in amazement. For many it was a sign that 15 years of international isolation could finally be coming to an end.Stalls that had popped up by Damascus’s Ummayad mosque after the fall of Assad in December now sold the Saudi flag alongside the Syrian – thanks for Saudi’s role in helping arrange the Trump-Sharaa meeting.“For 15 years the world had this picture of us Syrians as refugees. Now they see us as we are. You can finally see light and you can see hope,” said Hossam al-Khouli, 50, the owner of a handicraft shop in Damascus’s old city.Behind Khouli was a wall filled with handmade mirrors and boxes inlaid with Damascus’s famed mother-of-pearl. It was rare that he sold pieces these days, he said, as Syria had had few tourists over the last 15 years. Trump and Sharaa’s meeting seemed to him a sign that soon he might have plenty of visitors to sell to.“When Trump spoke last night, it was the first time in my life that I listened to any president in the world and began to clap. He’s a great man, really, he is a great man,” Khouli said, smiling.Trump also seemed pleased with the meeting. He said he thought Sharaa had a “real shot at holding it [Syria] together” and that the Syrian president had agreed to eventually join the Abraham accords, which would normalise Syrian ties with Israel. The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco signed the US-brokered accords in 2020.“[I am] ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria to give them a fresh start,” Trump told the GCC. “It gives them a chance for greatness. The sanctions were really crippling, very powerful.”According to a White House spokesperson, Trump urged Sharaa to “deport Palestinian terrorists”, help the US against Islamic State, and to deal with the country’s remaining chemical weapons stock.From doctor to brutal dictator: the rise and fall of Syria’s Bashar al-AssadRead moreThe meeting, which Trump said had come at the urging of Prince Mohammed and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was remarkable as theTrump administrationhad previously been wary of engaging with Sharaa, a former leader of the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham who has sought to moderate his image in recent years. Sharaa previously led the Syrian wing of al-Qaida before cutting ties with the group in 2016.It was the culmination of months of diplomacy by the new Syrian government, which overthrew Assad’s regime at the end of the last year, as well as their Turkish and Saudi allies, who believed face time with Trump would help end Syria’s international isolation.Damascus had prepared a pitch to Trump that included access to Syrian oil, reassurances of Israel’s security and a proposal to build a Trump tower in Damascus.Trump later arrived in Qatar for the second leg of his Middle East trip, where he oversaw the signing of a $96bn order from Qatar Airways for up to 160 Boeing aircraft and a statement of intent for more than $38bn in future defence investments.Sanctions were originally imposed on Assad after his bloody crackdown on peaceful protesters in 2011, and the US and other countries retained their economic embargo on Syria as they evaluated the new Islamist-led government in Damascus.A key concern for the US in Syria is the protection of religious minorities. The Trump administration released a sharply worded statement urging Damascus to protect minorities after attacks by pro-Assad forces sparked revenge killings of nearly 900 mostly Alawite civilians in north-west Syria in March.The US state department had handed the Syrians a 12-point list of conditions to end sanctions, which included protection of minorities and the US maintaining the right to conduct strikes against what it considered “terrorists” on Syrian soil.They were in the process of negotiating when Trump suddenly announced the lifting of US sanctions on Tuesday night at an investment conference in Saudi Arabia.1:11Syrians welcome Trump's decision to lift sanctions – videoIt came despite Israeli suspicions of the Islamist government in Damascus. Israel has said it will not allow government forces to deploy in southern Syria, and it has carried out dozens of airstrikes across the country in recent months.The end of US sanctions will be a step towards reintegrating Syria into the international economic system and a boost to the battered economy trying to rebuild after 14 years of civil war.The announcement of the end of sanctions was met with jubilation in Damascus. Beeping cars waving Syrian flags filled the country’s capital.A traditional Syrian band played in the city’s old quarter, the beats of the drums accompanied by whooping cheers. Social media in Syria was meanwhile filled with videos of Trump dancing, his signature double-fist pump set to Syrian anthems.“Everyone is happy and in the streets. Thank God, a thousand times thank God,” said Omar al-Nafa, who works in education.Syria’s economy is battered from 14 years of war, with the UN estimating more than 90% of the population lives in poverty. Much of the country’s housing stock is destroyed and basic services such as electricity and internet remain dysfunctional.Syria’s new government set ambitious goals to rebuild the country but was hampered by severe economic sanctions. Under US sanctions, Syria had no access to the international Swift banking system, and international businesses were reluctant to trade with the country for fear of falling foul of the US treasury.Nafa said: “It will take some time for it to be actually implemented, but hopefully it will help the economy.”Explore more on these topicsSyriaUS foreign policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Thewar in Gazahas seen the country’s public diplomacy face its greatest test – as was made clear on Wednesday morning with arobust exchangebetween David Mencer, a spokesperson for the Israeli government, and Nick Robinson, a presenter of the BBC’s flagship Today programme.Mencer stressed that he was speaking on behalf of the prime minister and made an uncompromising statement of Israel’s arguments, including the accusation that Hamas – described as a “genocidal death cult” – uses civilians as human shields.“Israel faces a moral paradox right now. It’s been created by Hamas. We have an opportunity to strike every military target, but when we do, we get condemned, you know, or we don’t strike them, and we reward the use of human shields,” he told Robinson.But the core of the confrontation was Israel’s blockade ofGaza. Here some listeners may have decided Mencer was involved in a deliberate attempt to obscure the reliably reported reality on the ground for political, ideological and strategic ends.Certainly, the key Israeli argument that there is “no hunger in Gaza” is hard to sustain. The same goes for Mencer’s accompanying claim that there is food in Gaza, and that markets are open.It is true that there are some basics still available in the territory, even after 11 weeks of a total blockade by Israel, and that a few stalls and shops still offer some basics. But the vast majority of the 2.3 million Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip cannot afford to buywhat they need to survive, and, if they could, stocks would suffice only for a tiny number.There is a limited amount of often spoiled flour, of which a standard 25kg sack costs hundreds of dollars, and of fresh food such as potatoes and tomatoes, a kilo of which costs between $10 and $15. There is no dairy and almost no meat. Free bakeries shut weeks ago for lack of fuel and flour, while community kitchens which once served 1m meals a day are closing fast. Almost all the main warehouses run by big international NGOs, such as the World Food Programme or Unrwa, are now empty.Many people are living on canned peas or dried beans, of which there is a finite supply.There are, however, thousands of tonnes of food, medicine, shelter, fuel and everything else necessary for survival ready to be sent into Gaza, but that can happen only when Israel opens the checkpoints it controls along its perimeter.It is true, as Mencer said, that a substantial amount of aid was brought in and stockpiled during the 10-week ceasefire that came into effect in mid-January, but this has all gone – and this influx did not offset the consequences of a war that has devastated agriculture, water supplies, sanitation systems and health services, leaving the population gravely weakened and vulnerable to disease.Essential medicines used to treat malnutrition are now being rationed, aid workers say, and medical supplies are running low.Then there is the obvious evidence of images of clearly malnourished people – often children. Mencer suggested that such cases may not be proof that thousands or tens of thousands of others are in the same dire condition, but a report on Monday fromthe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a consortium of experts that has for decades advised the UN and governments, said that Palestinians living there faced “a critical risk of famine”.The IPC, which has developed a five-level famine warning system, found that between 1 April and 10 May this year, 244,000 people in Gaza were in the most critical food security situation: level five, “catastrophe/famine”. The IPC noted that there had been a “major deterioration” in the food security situation inGazasince its last assessment in October 2024.Mencer denied that Israel was using starvation as a deliberate strategy, asking why, if that was the case, would Israel have sent “enough food aid to fill Wembley Stadium in London to the brim 80 times over” into Gaza during the conflict.But the aid allowed into Gaza through much of the 19-month conflict has been inadequate, unpredictable and subject to much-criticised bureaucratic procedures that blocked many shipments and slowed more. It was also hard to distribute given the widespread destruction and continuing violence.Almost 53,000 people have been killed since the Israeli offensive began. Sanitation systems, water supplies and health services are in ruins. Roads are choked with rubble, and bulldozers are systematically targeted by Israel.Israeli officials argue thatHamas steals and sells aidto fund its military and other operations. Therefore, they say, the restriction of aid is necessary to defeat the militant Islamist organisation, which killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in its raid on Israel on 7 October 2023, and to secure the return of the 57 of the 251 hostages taken that day who are still held in Gaza.Instead, Israel has made its own plan to distribute aid from six major hubs in southern Gaza, which would be run by private contractors and defended by Israeli troops.Aid agencies say they have robust mechanisms to prevent leakage of aid, and that Hamas steals little, if any. They also say they believe the new Israeli scheme is impractical, inadequate, likely to be dangerous and is potentially unlawful as it would displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, forcing them into ever smaller parts of the territory. Given this, they said they cannot agree to cooperate with it.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesanalysisShareReuse this content"

But the paper did not specify whether this would apply to recent arrivals already in the UK and in the process of their application.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, will consult stakeholders on whether the changes will apply to all migrants who have arrived in the UK in the past five years, according to government sources.No 10 defends Starmer’s language on immigration likened to Enoch Powell speechRead moreIf the change goes through, it would mean that 1.5 million foreign workers who would have qualified for permanent settlement as soon as this year face having to wait until they have lived in Britain for 10 years.TheLabourMP Florence Eshalomi told the House of Commons on Tuesday that she had been contacted by several of her constituents in Vauxhall and Camberwell Green, in south London, who were “worried about where this uncertainty leaves them”.She said: One even told me that they were so worried that they were considering leaving the UK, because their settled status here is in jeopardy.”If ministers do decide to apply the changes to arrivals from 2020, this would make government policy in the area more robust even than that sought by the Conservatives, who have suggested dating it to 2021.A number of Labour MPs and others haveexpressed concernat some of the measures in the white paper and the language used by Keir Starmer to introduce it, including that recent levels of migration have caused “incalculable” damage to the country and that the UK risks becoming“an island of strangers”.At prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Starmer won unwelcome praise from Nigel Farage for his rhetoric on the subject. The Reform UK leader said he had “very much enjoyed” Starmer’s speech on Monday, adding: “You seem to be learning a very great deal from us.”Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru’s Westminster group leader, accused Starmer of demonising migrants with his language. Starmer said that was “rubbish” and said: “I want to lead a country where we pull together and walk into the future as neighbours and as communities, not as strangers, and the loss of control of migration by the last government put all of that at risk, and that’s why we’re fixing the system based on principles of control, selection and fairness.”Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, defended the prime minister while resisting an invitation to repeat his exact words, and called for the UK to become “a nation of neighbours”.She said: “I agree with the prime minister that without curbs on migration, without making sure that we have strong rules that everyone follows, and that we have a pace of immigration that allows for integration into our country, we do risk becoming a nation of people estranged from one another.“What he has described is something that I absolutely believe in, which are the values of the Labour party, which is a desire to see this country as a nation of neighbours.”Separately, vice-chancellors and other higher education sector leaders have warned that proposals in the white paper on international students will worsen the financial crisis already affecting universities.Skilled visa rules, deportations and higher fees: what’s in the immigration white paperRead moreWith four in 10 universities in England likely to be in deficit this summer, Jo Johnson, the former Conservative universities minister, said few were in a position to absorb the government’s proposed 6% levy on income from overseas students or pass it on in higher fees. “This risks both weakening the financial position of the sector and making it harder to compete in a global market for talent,” he said.Shitij Kapur, the vice-chancellor and president of King’s College London, where 54% of students are from overseas, said: “The precise details of the wording and policy change matters less than how it is perceived in the 150 countries we recruit our students from. Are we still seen as a welcoming jurisdiction?”Steve West, the vice-chancellor of UWE Bristol, speaking on behalf of University Alliance, said the international student levy was an additional tax on universities. “Taken alongside eye-watering pension costs and the national insurance hikes, [it] would add to a mounting proportion of university resources being diverted to the Treasury,” he said.Combined with a proposed cut to the graduate post-study work visa from two years to 18 months, also outlined in the white paper, West warned of a further drop in international students. Numbers are already in decline after a clampdown by the previous government, a factor that is exacerbating the financial crisis in the sector.In a shift in focus to unofficial migration, Starmer is to visit Albania from Thursday to discuss more ways to tackle people smugglers and the broader issue of asylum seekers arriving in the UK on small boats from France.Albania is one of the few recent success stories in reducing numbers, with a programme to speed up the return of Albanian nationals leading a 95% fall in small boat arrivals in the UK from the country over three years.In the first ever official visit to the country by a UK prime minister, Starmer is to hold talks in Tirana and visit the port of Durres, across the Adriatic from Italy.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumLabournewsShareReuse this content"

That starts with delineating which minerals are really critical for what end, and prioritising those needed for public goods of a green future – not the likes of arms companies’ profits.”By 2040, the world is expected to need four times as many critical minerals as it does today, and while theUS deal with Ukraine for access to its mineral wealthhas hit the headlines, deals have also been struck more quietly around the world, away from public attention.The UK government has already signed non-binding agreements with Saudi Arabia, Australia, Kazakhstan and Zambia in an effort to corner their mineral resources, and is this year poised to publish a 10-year critical minerals strategy to support the “industries of tomorrow”.But in a joint briefing released on Thursday, 17 organisations, including the Trade Justice Movement, Global Justice Now, Corporate Justice Coalition and Friends of the Earth say that without safeguards, the UK and other powerful nations risk perpetuating a system of neocolonial exploitation that “sacrifices justice for the sake of convenience”.The increased levels of mining needed to extract minerals risks disrupting ecosystems and creating water scarcity, as well as workers’ rights abuses, violation of Indigenous rights and occupational safety and health issues.The new strategy, they say, must clearly differentiate between minerals needed for the energy transition, and commit to limiting extraction and the principles of the circular economy. It must also ensure that bilateral agreements with producer countries respect core UN and International Labour Organization human rights and labour rights conventions, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the Paris agreement on climate change.Tom Wills, the director of the Trade Justice Movement, said: “The UK’s approach to securing critical minerals must not repeat the mistakes of the past, where the drive for resource extraction left behind a trail of environmental degradation and human suffering.“The UK has a responsibility to lead a sustainable and fair global transition to clean energy which prioritises both environmental protection and human rights. We cannot afford to perpetuate a system that sacrifices justice for the sake of convenience.”The Department for Business and Trade, which is responsible for the UK’s critical minerals strategy, has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsCommoditiesGreen politicsMining (Environment)Mining (Business)newsShareReuse this content"

These include the share of children on free school meals who achieve passes in GCSE maths and English; who complete a degree by age 22; and who make it into the top 20% of earners by age 28.The trust finds that all of the top-scoring 20 constituencies on this index, and 42 of the top 50, are inLondon. The highest-ranked constituency outside the capital is Birmingham Perry Bar, in the West Midlands, in 23rd..The research shows the dramatic differences in children’s prospects, depending on where in England they happen to be born.Children receiving free school meals in the best-performing constituency, the social security minister Stephen Timms’s seat of East Ham, are a startling 30 percentage points more likely to achieve grade 5 in English and maths than their counterparts in the area at the bottom of the list, Newcastle upon Tyne Central and West, represented by Labour’s Chi Onwura.As they go on through life, these same children are three times as likely to complete a degree if they came from Timms’s east London seat than they are if they were born in Onwura’s Newcastle seat. The latter is one of three of the 10 lowest-scoring constituencies in north-east England.Nick Harrison, the Sutton Trust’s chief executive, said: “This research paints a startling picture of inequality of opportunity across England. The life chances of disadvantaged young people remain strongly tied to where they grow up.”As a child I needed free school meals, as mayor, I provide them. And this policy works – here’s the proof | Sadiq KhanRead moreThe report, which is based on data covering 10 million people over 25 years, also reveals big differences in the likelihood that children from low-income families leave the area they grew up in when they become adults.Despite the familiar narrative of young people moving to London to seek their fortune, the Sutton Trust finds that the capital is one of two regions, with the east of England, where the highest proportion of children on free school meals go on to move elsewhere, at 13%. That is more than twice the 6% in north-east England who do so.Anthony Breach, a research director at the Centre for Cities thinktank, said the Sutton Trust’s research suggested that aside from London, many English cities are not offering the economic opportunities they could.“It’s striking that only London among our major cities consistently performs the role we’d expect of a big city – driving progression, opportunity and advancement for its residents. This aligns with the evidence that Britain’s other big cities are underperforming,” he said.The Sutton Trust makes a series of policy recommendations for narrowing these regional gaps in social mobility, including incentivising the best teachers to work in disadvantaged schools, and improving financial help for children from low-income families who attend university.As negotiations between the Treasury and Whitehall departments intensify, the trust also calls on the government to make improving social mobility a guiding principle in the forthcoming spending review.“Opportunities for social mobility will only be available nationwide if there is a more even spread of economic opportunities across the country,” the report says.“This should be a sustained effort across government, potentially including greater devolution of powers and reforms to funding for local government, as well as greater investment in infrastructure regionally – including transport, and opportunities for education and training.”.Priya Edwards, a senior policy and advocacy adviser at Save the Children UK, agreed that ministers should be prepared to commit significant resources to improving children’s prospects.“This report shows how children’s life chances are sadly limited by both poverty and geography and it should serve as a wake-up call to the UK government,” she said.“Ministers must act to level the playing field for all children, regardless of where they live. They should start by scrapping the two-child limit and benefit cap at the comprehensive spending review on 11 June, or in the forthcoming child poverty strategy.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “High and rising standards are at the heart of the government’s mission to break down barriers to opportunity and ensure where you come from does not determine your future success.“This government has inherited a system with baked-in inequalities, which we’re tackling head-on through our plan for change by rolling out free breakfast clubs, improving mental health support, investing over £3bn to support those children who need it most and delivering a rich and broad curriculum so pupils are set up for life, work and the future.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mobilityChildrenPovertySchoolsInequalityEconomic policyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Our people can be assured that should they raise any allegation, they will be fully supported, and the matter investigated, with appropriate action taken as required.”Last weekthe head of the Royal Navy was suspendedpending an investigation.The MoD said last week that an investigation into the first sea lord, Adm Sir Benjamin Key, 59, was “ongoing”.He had reportedly been expected to retire this summer but it is understood he has been told to step back from his role while the investigation takes place.Key was absent from the lineup of senior military personnel on the Mall for celebrations to mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day, and it is understood that the second sea lord, V Adm Martin Connell, has taken full charge until a permanent replacement is announced.The first sea lord, who has served more than four decades in the navy, is understood to be the first head of the navy to face a misconduct investigation in its 500-year history.Explore more on these topicsRoyal NavyMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

For example, it counts ectopic pregnancies – when an embryo implants somewhere other than the uterine lining – as a serious complication.Mifepristonedoes not causean ectopic pregnancy and taking it will not harm someone with an ectopic. It also claims that needing an in-clinic procedure to complete the abortion is a complication, when patients arecounseledin advance about the pills’ failure rate of about 3 to 4%.The data, the authors say, means the FDA should reinstate earlier restrictions on mifepristone, including a ban on telemedicine and limiting use to the first seven weeks of pregnancy – but they do not intend to stop there.The authors note that restoring the limits could lead to better monitoring that could help “determine whether this drug should remain on the market”, statements that echo proposals found in Project 2025, the 900-page playbook published by the Heritage Foundation and for which the EPPC was an advisory board member.Project 2025 calls to end telemedicine prescriptions of abortion pills as an “interim step” to revoking mifepristone’s approval altogether.More than 100 scientific studieshave found the medications cited in the paper are safe and effective for ending a pregnancy.Telehealth, plus blue-state “shield laws”, have enabled thousands of people living in states where abortion is banned to continue to access mifepristone and misoprostol, which frustrates abortion opponents. One in five abortions nationwide are done via telemedicine, and in spring 2024, mail providers facilitated more than7,700 abortions per monthin states with total or six-week abortion bans.Anti-abortion leaders said during a private Zoom call that they intend to use the EPPC paper to pressure the FDA and lawmakers to dramatically roll back access to the drug, “if not suspend” their approval entirely, Politicoreported. It is part of a plan they are privately calling “Rolling Thunder”.Activists on that call – which included representatives from Americans United for Life, Live Action, Students for Life, and Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America – stressed that they viewed ending telemedicine prescriptions only as a “first step”.According to the Politico report, the EPPC president, Ryan Anderson, argued on the call that this plan aligns with Donald Trump’s stated desire to leave abortion policy to the states because, he said, “you’re not leaving it to states if California can mail pills to Texas”.Activists tried to push back on criticism that the paper was not peer-reviewed by arguing that academia is “broken” and they could not trust journals or reviewers not to “sabotage” their effort or leak it to the press. Politico reported that one medical professional on the call, Christina Francis, the CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life OBGYNs, warned her colleagues not to misrepresent the paper, acknowledging that the report was “not a study in the traditional sense” and “not conclusive proof of anything”. Still, Francis argued that it warranted government action and more research.During his January confirmation hearing, Kennedy said that Trumpasked himto review mifepristone’s safety data. The FDA commissioner, Marty Makary,saidin March that he, too, would “do a review of the data”, and would act if necessary. Hawley, the Missouri senator, laterwrotea letter to Makary asking him to review the paper the day it was published; Hawley alsointroduced a billto end telemedicine of mifepristone. It is not expected to pass Congress, but the FDA could take action on its own, especially under pressure from groups on the call.While abortion opponents have promoted researchlinkedto anti-abortion thinktanks claiming that mifepristone is dangerous, some studies havebeen retracted, including one cited heavily by a federal judge in a case seeking to roll back the pill’s availability that went to the supreme court last term. The court ruled unanimously that the plaintiffs, anti-abortion doctors, did not have legal standing to sue the FDA.That case is still ongoing, with three Republican attorneys general suing the FDA on behalf of the states of Missouri, Idaho and Kansas.The Trump administration made news last week whenit arguedin a filing that the judge should dismiss the case, the same position taken by the Biden administration earlier this year. But the Trump administration did not defend the FDA’s actions on mifepristone, instead saying only that the plaintiffs were not the right people to sue.As a health law expertrecently toldthe Guardian, the administration could use that argument in the future if it chooses to restrict the drug and Democratic-led states sue over the changes.Kirsten Moore, director of the Expanding MedicationAbortionAccess Project, told the Guardian she was not surprised by either the existence of a plan to restrict the drugs or that the push is based on what she called “manufactured misinformation”.Moore said that reproductive rights supporters had long known that anti-abortion advocates “will stop at nothing to put mifepristone – a safe, effective FDA-approved medication that has been used for 25 years in this country to end a pregnancy at 10 weeks or less – back under lock and key”.Carter Sherman contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUS newsReproductive rightsRoe v WadeRobert F Kennedy JrAbortionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Democratic governor’s move highlights his struggle to protect his liberal policy priorities amid budget challenges in his final years on the job.California was among one of the first states to extend free healthcare benefits to all poor adults regardless of their immigration status last year, an ambitious plan touted by Newsom to help the nation’s most populous state inch closer to a goal of universal healthcare. But the cost for such expansion ran $2.7bn more than the administration had anticipated.Newsom in March suggested to reporters he was not considering rolling back health benefits for low-income people living in the country illegally as the state was grappling with a $6.2bn Medicaid shortfall. He also repeatedly defended the expansion, saying it saves the state money in the long run. The program is state-funded and does not use federal dollars.Under Newsom’s plan, low-income adults without legal status will no longer be eligible to apply for Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program, starting in 2026. Those who are already enrolled will not be kicked off their plans because of the enrollment freeze, and the changes will not affect children. Newsom’s office did not say how long the freeze would last.Starting in 2027, adults with “unsatisfactory immigration status” on Medi-Cal, including those without legal status and those who have legal status but are not eligible for federally funded Medicaid, will also have to pay a $100 monthly premium. The governor’s office said that was in line with the average cost paid by those who are on subsidized heath plans through California’s own marketplace. There is no premium for most people currently on Medi-Cal.In total, Newsom’s office estimated the changes will save the state $5.4bn by 2028-2029.In the presentation of his $321.9bn budget, Newsom on Wednesday pointed at the policies of the Trump administration, heavily emphasizing Trump’s tariffs.Newsom stated that California was “under assault”, and estimated that Trump’s policies would cut revenue to the state by $16bn in the coming year. The governor notably suedthe presidential administration over tariffsin April. The Golden state exported $67bn worth of goods to China, Mexico and Canada in 2024, with China as its largest trading partner.The new deficit comes in addition to more than $23bn in remedies previously agreed to,the Los Angeles Times reports.California’s public universities, the University of California and California State systems, will receive a 3% budget cut, far short of the originally anticipated 8% cut. Newsom’s proposal to increase the state’sfilm and television subsidy by $420min the aftermath of the Los Angeles wildfires survived the cuts as well.The governor also proposed thefast-trackingof the $20bn, 45-mile long Delta Conveyance project. Newsom’s proposal would shorten the allowable window for bringing legal challenges against the project.Other cuts to the budget included long-term care, environmental protections, K-12 education and overtime for in-home care workers.Newsom now opens budget negotiations with lawmakers and it is unclear how Democrats who control the legislature will react to his plan to freeze new Medi-Cal enrollment for some immigrants. A final budget proposal must be signed by June. California’s budget is by far the largest among states.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaGavin NewsomUS immigrationWest CoastUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The secretary was called to discuss Donald Trump’s proposed budget, which would impose disproportionatelylarge cutsto scientific enterprises at the health department.However, the most memorable exchange went to a deeper tension between Kennedy and his own department – his contradictory and at timesinflammatory statementson vaccines.Elon Musk shows he still has the White House’s ear on Trump’s Middle East tripRead more“If you had a child today, would you vaccinate that child for measles?”beganthe Democratic congressman Mark Pocan of Wisconsin at the House appropriations committee hearing.“For measles? Um, probably for measles,” said Kennedy, in one of the few hesitations of the hearing. “What I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant … I don’t want to seem like I’m being evasive, but I don’t think people should be taking advice, medical advice, from me.”Vaccines are considered one of public health’sgreatest victories, and the measles vaccine alone is estimated to have saved90 million livesin five decades. The US is in the midst of the single worst measles outbreaksince 2000. Three people, includingtwo unvaccinated children, have died in Texas. Before heading the health department, Kennedy led arguably the mostinfluential anti-vaccine campaigngroup in the nation.Pocan went on to ask about chickenpox.“Um, again, I don’t want to give advice,” Kennedy said, before commenting on shingles.Pocan continued: “Polio?”“Polio?” Kennedy said. “Again, I don’t want to be giving advice.”The issued re-emerged in his afternoon testimony before the Senate committee on health, education, labor and pensions, where the Democrat Chris Murphy asked Kennedy if he would recommend the measles vaccine. The secretary demurred, prompting Murphy to say: “I think that’s really dangerous for the American public and for families.“The secretary of health and human services is no longer recommending the measles vaccines,” Murphy said.Kennedy’s hearing came at an exceptionally tumultuous period in America’s public health history. With help from the billionaire Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency”, Kennedy has eliminatedroughly 20,000 jobs, whole departments andexpert public health labs. He has also in effect cut the federal biomedical and behavioral research budgetby $2.7bn– including cancer research alone by 31% year-over-year – byfailing to distributeor “impounding” funds.Officially, the hearing was intended to investigate a White House budget proposal to cut tens of billions from the health department – slashing the federal government’s biomedical research arms in particular, theNational Institutes of Health (NIH), by 40%.However, it also took bizarre turns – as when Kennedy asserted that agencies would soon be “phasing out most animal studies” in favor of using artificial intelligence. The organic chemist and drug discovery researcher Derek Lowe described Kennedy’s claim as “bullshit”. He said such advances, while promising, were “years” away.The White House budget has come alongside Republicans formally unveiling a “big, beautiful bill” toextend tax cutsfrom President Trump’s first term by in effect cutting federal healthcare subsidies. The Congressional Budget Officeestimatesthat an additional 13.7 million Americans could become uninsured if the proposal moves forward.The bill proposes adding work requirements to Medicaid and ending a federal subsidy for individual insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as “Obamacare”. Medicaid covers about 71 million low-income, disabled and elderly Americans – making it the largest health insurance program in the nation. This is Trump’s first attempt to restrict healthcaresince 2017, when an attempt to repeal the ACA was dramatically tanked from within his own party.Some Republicans are already wary of the bill, warning that taking away healthcare was, in the Missouri Republican senator Josh Hawley’s words, “morally wrong and politically suicidal”. Advocacy groups have also rallied to oppose the cuts.“These work requirements and reporting requirements are designed to kick people off Medicaid,” said Julie Nickson, director of federal relations at the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. “And that’s what they’ll do.”Even as Kennedy has eviscerated departments and fired workers, the health department has released few official details of the “reorganization” other than to claim that it would eliminate “fraud, waste and abuse”. Kennedy continued that pattern on Wednesday, as he told lawmakers he could not answer detailed questions about changes he has imposed.“I’m going to talk very, very broadly … We are under a court order yesterday afternoon not to do any more planning under the reorganization, and I have been advised by my attorneys not to talk about it,” Kennedy said.Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown Law School called Kennedy’s assertions that the court order barred him from answering questions “pure nonsense”.“The Department of Justice may be advising the secretary not to discuss the litigation,” said Gostin. “But the secretary has a public duty to explain the reasoning behind the reorganization of his department and to show why it is in the public interest.”In addition to enormous and often untold cuts, Kennedy has also reinstated programs – Democrats argued based on political favor. For the first time, Kennedy commented on reinstatement of two branches of the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (Niosh) and the World Trade Center Health Program.The programs researched and monitored miners for pneumoconiosis, better known as black lung, ran the firefighters’ national cancer registry and, paid for the healthcare of victims of the September 11 attacks.“I reinstated 328 employees at Niosh – about a little over a third of them were in Morgantown and a third in Cincinnati and the WTC group,” Kennedy told Republican Riley Moore about programs in West Virginia and Ohio respectively.The Connecticut Democrat Rosa DeLauro said: “I don’t understand why Republicans get to call you to spare offices like Niosh … Is there a special phone number if I want to save tobacco prevention, lead poisoning?”Chris Stein contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrUS healthcareTrump administrationUS politicsHouse of RepresentativesUS SenateUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

Personal pizzas posted as on sale for $1 a piece rang up for $1.25 each. An 8oz jar of minced garlic listed at the low price of $2.49 cost $3.99 at checkout – a 60% jump.“Almost every single time I go in the store, the listed price of an item is NOT what rings up at the register,” Allison Hadfield, who home-schools the couple’s two children, wrote in December in a complaint to Ohio’s attorney general. “I want Kroger to stop screwing over people especially when they are the only store in town!”The family’s experiences are not an isolated problem involving a single store, an investigation of the supermarket giant’s pricing practices by the Guardian US, Consumer Reports and theFood& Environment Reporting Network has found.Kroger stores in multiple states, the investigation has revealed, show a pattern of overcharging customers by frequently listing expired sale prices on the shelves and then ringing up the regular prices at checkout – a practice that adds additional burdens on to American families already struggling under the weight of the soaring costs for eggs, meat and other groceries.View image in fullscreenThe advertised shelf price of $11.99 for pistachios jumps to $14.99 at checkout.Composite: Guardian DesignThe investigation drew on “secret shopper” tests in more than a dozen states by the Guardian and its partners as well as a separate series of tests by union grocery workers in Colorado. The investigation also drew on internal corporate documents, court records, complaints to government authorities and interviews with customers, workers and union officials.The shopping tests by the media partners found expired tags that resulted in overcharges in 14 of the 26 stores reviewed in Washington DC and 14 states, including Arizona, Michigan, Oregon, Virginia and Ohio. The tests in March, April and May identified more than 150 items with expired sale tags for which Kroger was charging more than the sale price – producing average overcharges of about $1.70 per item, an 18% markup over the discount price.On average, the expired discount tags the tests analyzed were about two weeks out of date, suggesting that thousands of customers ended up paying more for what they likely thought were discounted items.At times, Kroger’s sale tags don’t clearly disclose that a discount offer has ended. In some instances expiration dates are listed in small print and in others they are noted in a corporate code that is not clear to people who are not Kroger employees. Some customers catch the problem at checkout or when they go over their receipts, but workers and union officials said many busy shoppers don’t notice the overcharges.“It really makes me feel bad because some of them are on fixed incomes and they’re older. They’re not going to pay attention,” said Joy Alexander, who works as a scan coordinator at a Kroger-owned King Soopers store in suburban Denver. “They think that when they took it off the shelf, it was $2.50. They don’t know that they’re paying $3.75 for that one item.”Kroger, the nation’ssecond largestgrocery retailer behind Walmart, is headquartered in Cincinnati and operates more than 2,700 stores in 35 states under a variety of names, including King Soopers, Harris Teeter, Ralphs, Fry’s Food and Drug, and others.In a statement, Kroger said the price tag errors identified by the news organizations represented “a few dozen examples across several years out of billions of customer transactions annually”.“While any error is unacceptable, the characterization of widespread pricing concerns is patently false,” the statement said.Kroger did not provide detailed answers to most of the media partners’ questions about its pricing practices. The statement said the company is “committed to affordable and accurate pricing” and that it regularly conducts price checks that review “millions of items weekly to ensure our shelf prices are accurate”.With food costs soaring from the grocery aisle to the drive-through window, Americans are spending a greater portion of their income to eat than they have in decades. US food pricesclimbed nearly 24%from 2020 to 2024, leaving many Americansfeeling angry, anxious or dejectedabout their trips to the supermarket.basketAndrew Knall, a high school math teacher in suburban Dayton, Ohio, said he feels like he is “going into battle” whenever he shops at his local Kroger, because he regularly gets hit with overcharges. “Like I’m on 24-hour missile watch here and I’m going to get ripped off at any moment.”The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has responsibility for overseeing the grocery industry, with the authority to take action to stop unfair sales and advertising practices and block industry mergers likely to increase food prices. An FTClegal challengelast year helped stop Kroger’s push to absorb a supermarket rival, Albertsons, in a deal the FTC said would have led to higher prices and fewer choices for consumers.In August, vice-president and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harrispromisedto give the FTC thepowerto impose the first-ever federal ban on price-gouging on food and groceries. Her campaign rival, Donald Trump, also promised to force food prices down. But in December, as president-elect, Trump said it would be “very hard” to bring down grocery prices, and in March, as president, hefiredtwo Democratic FTC commissioners known as aggressive advocates for consumer protection.During the Kroger-Albertsons merger battle, legal filings revealed that a top Kroger pricing guru wrote fellow executives in early 2024 that the chain had raised its prices for milk and eggs at a level that was “significantly higher” than the rise in costs charged by its suppliers. Krogersaidthe email did not reflect the company’s “decades-long business model to lower prices for customers by reducing its margins”.A complaint in October to Ohio’s attorney general from a Kroger customer from suburban Cincinnati described how overcharges on specific items at the cash register have piled on costs on top of the “outrageous prices” produced by the general inflation in food costs.“We just spent $121 for two seniors for a week’s groceries,” the customer wrote, noting that the bill included an $8.07 overcharge on a frozen turkey. “We shop there regularly and 3 out of five times we have to correct them on prices.”Kroger said its business model is “rooted in bringing down prices to attract more customers to our stores”.‘Nothing changes’In Colorado, leaders of the United Food & Commercial Workers Union (UFCW) Local 7 say that Kroger is fully aware that inaccurate pricing is common at its King Soopers stores in the state. Workers and union officials say the company’s chronic understaffing is driving the problem.Union officials say that some Kroger stores have tens of thousands of sale tags hanging at any one time and – without enough workers to remove expired tags – inaccurate tags stay on the shelves for days and weeks.When the job of updating sale tags doesn’t get done, consumers are “kinda left in the dark”, said Alexander, the Kroger employee in Colorado. “You don’t know what you’re paying for.”In its statement, Kroger said it is “inaccurate to say the company reduced standards or labor hours”.“We intentionally staff our stores to keep them running smoothly while creating an enjoyable place to shop,” the statement said. “Our staffing decisions are data-driven to balance workload and schedules.”Kroger’s workforce fell from roughly 465,000 full- and part-time employees in January 2021 to just over 409,000 in February 2025, according to company filings with US securities regulators.Workers and union leaders in Colorado say the overcharges have sparked growing anger among customers, with some taking their frustrations out on cashiers and other front-of-the-store workers.“I’ve witnessed verbal altercations almost turn into fistfights,” said Chris Lacey, a King Soopers service manager in Colorado. “Customers are so frustrated and so at their wits’ end with the pricing that they’re just willing to take it out on anybody with a King Soopers name badge on.”In contract talks with Kroger, UFCW Local 7 has made the overcharging issue a key negotiating point, urging the company to create a “tag integrity department” within each store and schedule more hours for employees to pull down out-of-date price labels.Local 7 leaders outlined their concerns about overcharges in a meeting with company officials in January. A transcript shows that an executive with the Kroger’s Colorado division questioned the efficiency of store employees, but acknowledged pricing errors and the impact on customers. “If we are not getting the job done, that is a different problem for us,” she said.Union leaders in Colorado said Kroger had done little to address the problem since that meeting.“With these price tags, we’ve told them and they haven’t even flinched,” said Kim Cordova, Local 7’s president and international vice-president for the UFCW.In March, Local 7 members conducted secret shopping tests at more than 30 King Soopers stores around Colorado. The results, which the union shared with the media partners, showed more than 300 expired discount tags led to an average overcharge of almost $1, or nearly 15%.View image in fullscreenA Kroger grocery store in Houston, Texas.Photograph: Mark Felix/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesKroger’s national“Make It Right” policyallows employees to fix price discrepancies on the spot, on a case-by-case basis, which the company says allows workers to address “any situation when we unintentionally fall short of a customer’s expectations”. Colorado employees and union officials say store-level management tells front-end workers to fix price errors for individual shoppers who complain, but does not do what needs to be done to correct the expired discount tags that are driving the problem.“They go: ‘Just take care of the customer, deal with it, and we’ll fix it later on.’ And that never happens,” Lacey, the King Soopers service manager, said.In complaints to Ohio’s attorney general, some shoppers described getting a runaround from the company when they raised concerns with Kroger representatives at the local stores and beyond.“I have complained to the corporate office many times but nothing changes,” a customer from Columbus said in December. A customer from Dayton said in October that he had spotted overcharges three weeks in a row but a complaint to Kroger’s corporate office “resulted in a canned response that offered no solution”.In Belpre, Ohio, the Hadfields told the Guardian that Kroger employees confirmed to them that the store was too poorly staffed to make sure that sale tags were up to date. Kroger reduced staff at the Belpre store by 16% between 2019 and 2024, and reduced the average hours of those who remained, federal labor data shows. Derek, an army veteran who served as an armored crew member in Iraq, said one worker told him: “They have one person responsible for changing all the prices in the store and that’s why the prices constantly ring up different.”The Hadfields were so frustrated they filed three complaints with Ohio’s attorney general – one by Derek in November and two by Allison in late December and early January. Allison said in her first complaint that “we can’t even get anything resolved at the store because they are so understaffed it should be considered abuse towards their current employees”.Two other shoppers filed similar complaints in 2024 with the attorney general’s office about the Belpre store. “Literally every person I know that shops at Belpre OH Kroger has this issue,” one of them wrote.The attorney general’s office forwarded Allison Hadfield’s complaints to Kroger. In response, a Kroger executive promised that company officials would share her complaints with its local store director to “ensure our employees are following proper procedure when removing and updating sale tags”.On 1 May, the Guardian sent a reporter to the Belpre Kroger to see whether things had changed at the store. The shopping test done by the reporter found that – more than three months after Kroger promised state officials it would make sure proper procedures were being followed at the store – expired sale tags and overcharges were still a problem.Six of the 11 expired on-sale items the reporter purchased resulted in an overcharge at checkout. The average overcharge on those six items was more than 12.5%.Across OhioOn the banks of Lake Erie more than 200 miles north of Belpre, Ohio, another Kroger customer was wrestling with the same problems around the same time as the Hadfields.Jim Howell was overcharged on four straight visits, he said, to his local Kroger in Sandusky, Ohio, including on the purchase of six containers of vegan cream cheese.Howell trained as a chef and pays close attention to food prices. He said he got into the habit of doing what he called a “forensic accounting” when he got home after each trip to the store, checking what he had paid against Kroger’s listed prices on the chain’s online app, which reflects what customers will be charged at checkout. He would tally up the errors, go back to the store with his receipts and get his money back.“These days, when I shop,” he said, “I just walk to the customer desk and they ask for my receipts. They know.”But he thought that simply getting refunds was not enough. In November he went on a Facebook group, “What’s going on in Sandusky,” to complain about Kroger’s pricing practices.“Kroger is a behemoth, one of America’s largest grocery retailers,” he wrote. “You should be able to trust them on their pricing, not have to waste time auditing and getting issues corrected.”The post got dozens of likes and replies, with many posters saying they had had similar problems at the Sandusky Kroger or other Kroger locations in the region. “There are *always* outdated coupons and sale prices on the shelf,” one poster said. “Has happened to me dozens of times,” another said.basketShoppers from many other towns and cities across Ohio – where industry analysts say Kroger holds a dominant position in the grocery market – are also complaining. The media partners’ review of records from the state attorney general’s office identified more than 55 complaints since 2021 from Ohioans accusing Kroger of promising one price and then charging a higher price at checkout.More than half of these complaints – 30 – were filed in 2024 and the first three months of 2025.Some of the complaints cited problems with a single item. But others described repeated pricing issues playing out over many visits that continued, in some instances, for a year or more.“Every week customers are being duped into thinking some grocery items are on sale,” a shopper from Cincinnati told state officials in February. “The store is full of expired shelf tags showing one price and upon checkout [customers] are being charged a higher price.”Andrew Knall, the Ohio schoolteacher, and his spouse, Michelle Tomashot, said they have been grappling with overcharges at Kroger for years.In 2022, Knall wrote the state attorney general’s office to report that their family of three had been seeing overcharges “for well over a year now. My wife and I constantly complain to the clerks and the managers there but it keeps happening … This happens with canned items, frozen food, produce, dog food, and many other items.”About a year later, the couple decided to do an experiment after Michelle did a morning shop that, they said, yielded five overcharges out of 10 items purchased. After she showed pictures of the sale tags, she said, a Kroger staffer fixed the overcharges on her bill.The couple returned later that afternoon and selected the same items. The same five overcharges, they said, rang up again – Kroger had corrected the problem on Michelle’s bill that morning but, hours later, still had not fixed it within its pricing systems or on its shelf tags.She said she told Kroger staff that continuing to overcharge customers after being put on notice is “called stealing”.The couple said the problem has not slowed down since then – and that Kroger needs to take responsibility for making sure the prices on its shelf tags are accurate.“If that sticker is hanging below that item, that’s what the price is,” Michelle said. “It’s their fault for not taking that sticker off.”Across the nationKroger is not the only supermarket mega-chain to face allegations of unfair pricing practices. In 2024, Walmart agreed to pay $45m to settle a class action lawsuit in Florida that accused the company of overcharging American customers for meat, poultry, pork, seafood and bagged citrus fruit. In October, Albertsons, which also owns Safeway and Vons,agreed to pay a nearly $4m civil penaltyto settle allegations in California that the chain charged customers prices higher than their lowest advertised or posted price.Walmart and Albertsons denied wrongdoing.Kroger’s own pricing practices have been flagged in lawsuits in multiple states. In Utah, Kroger paid a $2,500 settlement in 2019 to a shopper who accused the company of “falsely and deceptively charging full prices instead of the advertised promotional pricing” covered by a Fresh Values rewards program.Lawsuits currently being fought in California, Ohio and Illinois claim Kroger stores soaked large numbers of consumers at checkout. The California case alleges the company raised prices of products when shoppers used grocery coupons and the Ohio case claims it gouged pharmacy customers who had health insurance by inflating the price of generic drugs.The Illinois suit alleges that the lead plaintiff, Lisabeth Gainsberg, repeatedly encountered overcharges when she purchased on-sale items at a Kroger-owned Mariano’s store in suburban Chicago – including Slim Jim Sticks on sale for 92¢ each that were rung up at $1.79 per stick. When she pointed out these overcharges, the suit claims, store employees strung her along for half an hour or more before correcting the overcharges.The suit says she spent months urging the store manager and corporate higher-ups to fix the issue, but Kroger continued to charge more for many items than its posted sale prices.Kroger has denied wrongdoing in the case that was settled in Utah and in the current cases in Illinois, Ohio and California. In the Illinois case, Kroger said it “has not engaged in any deceptive act”. It contends that Gainsberg has not produced any evidence that “the price discrepancies at issue were anything other than random mistakes” in a situation “where perfection cannot possibly be achieved”.Beyond the courts, government regulatory agencies are also hearing complaints about Kroger’s price tag issues. In March, a shopper in Arlington, Texas, contacted the FTC to report that their local Kroger had been leaving out-of-date discount tags up throughout the store, resulting in overcharges, for about five years.The shopper said they had tried almost everything to stop the practice: they talked to store employees, Kroger’s corporate office and the Better Business Bureau. But the customer has “not received a satisfactory response”, the FTC said.basketIn Michigan, where Kroger is dominant in metro Detroit, the attorney general’s office has received 229 consumer complaints about Kroger since 2020. In 25 of those cases, the attorney general’s office has found violations of Michigan state law concerning price errors, overcharging, and bait and switch tactics, and returned nearly $1,600 to Kroger customers.Kroger policy allows for no more than 1% of price tags to be incorrect, according to an internal company document obtained by the news organizations. At one Kroger-owned store in the western US, the document shows, an in-house audit of hundreds of products found that roughly 6% had incorrect price tags directly leading to overcharges.In many cases, Kroger’s overcharges may seem small – a few cents more on one mislabeled item, a dollar on another. But those inflated prices add up in an era of big worries about food prices. In a MarketWatch survey in April, 63% of Americans agreed with the statement: “It is difficult for me to afford groceries.”The squeeze is especially tight for lower-income families, which spend about 30% of their incomes on food.“If you don’t care about money, carry on,” Jim Howell in Sandusky wrote in his Facebook blast about Kroger’s pricing practices. “If you do care about money, you may want to jot your pricing down and do an audit. It adds up quick!”This article was produced in collaboration withConsumer Reportsand theFood & Environment Reporting Network, an independent, non-profit news organization.Research contributors to this story include: Haley Parsley, Cait Kelley, Callie Lyons, Jules Feeney, Betti Johnson, Blandon Ray, Quincy Kelly, Katherine Smithyman, Hope Covey, Courtney Comfort, Harry Chandler, Nan Rothwell, Carter Smith, Madeline Nguyen, Brent Cunningham, Steph Quinn, Julian Mendoza, Ethan Bakuli, Sandy West, Juwan Holmes and Lee Roop."

Fast forward two years, and on Wednesday, executives at the same company unveiled a new bright idea: re-rebrand the service from Max to HBO Max.The move will “further accelerate” the platform’s growth, according to David Zaslav, president and CEO ofWarner BrosDiscovery, or WBD.“Returning the HBO brand into HBO Max will further drive the service forward and amplify the uniqueness that subscribers can expect from the offering,” a press release claimed, adding the reversal was “also a testament to WBD’s willingness to keep boldly iterating its strategy and approach”.It is the latest big branding decision by a top media firm this month to raise eyebrows.As Comcast moves to spin off cable networks including CNBC, MSNBC and E!, it was announced last week they would be owned a firm called Versant. The name is designed toemphasize the firm’s versatility, executives explained, andselected“after months of presentations and conversations”.WBD owns an array of media businesses, including the Warner Bros movie studios; the DC Comics franchise; and a string of cable networks including the CNN news network and, yes, HBO, home to hit premium shows such asThe White LotusandGame of Thrones.Its streaming platform Max, formerly and soon to be known again as HBO Max, launched in 2020 and includes popular archive series includingFriends; movie franchises includingHarry Potter; as well as HBO shows.WBD had 122.3 million subscribers at the end of March, and is pushing for more than 150 million by the end of next year. Shares in the conglomerate have struggled in recent years, however, and are down 15% since the start of 2025.Explore more on these topicsHBOWarner BrosTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

They gave more weight to statements from managers and formal consultations on specific policies, and placed more importance on recent pieces of evidence.They found “an increasingly substantial portion of the corporate sector” was engaging in positive climate advocacy.In 2019, when theEuropean Commission announced its Green Deal, only one in four companies were lobbying partly in line with Paris Agreement goals of keeping the planet from heating 1.5C (2.7F), the report found. By 2025, that share had doubled.The researchers found industry associations were lagging behind individual companies. The share of aligned or partly aligned associations rose from 2% in 2019 to 12% in 2025, far below the share of similarly supportive companies.The disparity could arise from industry associations prioritising the views of the loudest opponents of climate policy, though it could also be the result of companies channelling unsavoury lobbying requests through trade groups.“Industry associations in the EU appear to be fighting a losing battle against the tide of positive corporate action on climate policies,” said Roxburgh. “[They] need to urgently reassess their priorities if they are to continue to act as true representatives of the majority of their membership.”The worst-scoring companies in the ranking, weighted by their level of engagement on policy, were the Polish utility PGE; the Austrian oil and gas producer OMV; the Spanish oil and gas producer Repsol; the Spanish transmission system operator Enagás; and the German airline Lufthansa.Enagás, which InfluenceMap cited as supporting the long-term role of fossil gas in energy and transport and advocating to weaken measures for methane emission leak detection and repair, said its climate policy is committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2040 – not including the emissions from customers using its products – and by 2050 overall. It added that it had embraced the EU’s methane regulation, for which it had received the highest rating from the International Methane Emissions Observatory.Lufthansa, which InfluenceMap cited as lobbying against the EU mandate for sustainable aviation fuels and the full inclusion of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading System, said it did not oppose either policy but was calling for “competition-neutral implementation”.PGE, OMV and Repsol did not respond to a request for comment.The European Commission has put “competitiveness” at the heart of its agenda since its new mandate began in December, in a partial reversal of its Green Deal after elections in 2024 that saw sizeable gains for the far right and losses for the greens.Environmental groups have criticised the new focus on simplification as a cover for deregulation that will allow companies to pollute more.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentClimate crisisClimate scienceFossil fuelsEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

It recorded a £66m loss, down from a profit of £383m, as the company has struggled against a broader malaise in the global luxury goods industry.The company said a new plan to find £60m in cost savings could affect 1,700 jobs.Burberryemployed about 9,300 people around the world last year, so the cuts could affect almost a fifth of its staff.Joshua Schulman, the chief executive of Burberry, said most of the cuts would be at the group’s head offices around the world, led by London, but jobs would also go by reorganising staff rotas in stores and dropping one shift at its trench-coatfactory in Castleford. He said no significant store closures were planned.The change in Castleford, which is expected to affect about 170 highly skilled jobs, will happen before a “significant investment” in the second half of this year in the factory, Schulman said.“For a long time we have had overcapacity at that facility and that’s simply not sustainable at this point,” he said. “We are making this change to safeguard our UK manufacturing and will be making a significant investment in renovating the Victorian factory [later this financial year].”View image in fullscreenBurberry’s Castleford factory in West Yorkshire makes trench coats.Photograph: Kai Pfaffenbach/ReutersHe said Burberry had “an ambition” to increase the scale of UK production “over time” and saw value in the “tradition of making trench coats right here in the UK”.However, Darren Travis, an organiser for GMB union which represents workers at the factory, said: “This is a sad, sad blow for these workers and Castleford itself. Burberry is the town’s biggest employer and more than a quarter of the workforce are going.” ”The fashion house, which is best known for its signature trench coats, hasstruggled in recent yearsbecause of a weak luxury market and a series of short-lived attempts to revive the brand with different designers. The company hired Schulman, the former boss of the US fashion brand Coach, as chief executive last year in an attempt to turn around its fortunes.One job that appears to be safe as part of Schulman’s revamp is that of the chief creative officer, Daniel Lee, whose role had been seen to be a risk under the new regime.Schulman said he “couldn’t be happier with the progress our team is making” on moving Burberry from “modern British luxury to timeless British luxury” and that Lee’s latest collection was “an extraordinary expression of timeless British luxury and all of us are very excited about what is to come”.The plan to cut costs is on top of a£40m savings programmethat Schulman announced in November. Burberry shares jumped by 17% on Wednesday, as the City welcomed the cost-cutting plan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company partly blamed the drop on lower sales to Chinese tourists and the post-Brexit removal of VAT tax break for tourists shopping in the UK.Schulman said sales in the US had been “choppy” in recent months, with a number of ups and downs since the Trump administration took office.Charlie Huggins, of the investment broker Wealth Club, said the 2025 period had been an “annus horribilis” for Burberry. “Luxury consumers across the globe significantly tightened their belts hitting the whole luxury sector. But Burberry has seen more impact than most,” he said. “Its operational execution has left a lot to be desired in recent years and the brand has lost its lustre, compounding the wider sector’s issues.”A wider downturn in the luxury goods sector has also hit the sales of bigger rivals such as Kering, which owns brands such as Gucci and Balenciaga, and LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior.Burberry has lost roughly a quarter of its market value over the past year, while LVMH has lost about a third and Kering is down by more than two-fifths.Explore more on these topicsBurberry groupLuxury goods sectorRetail industryBurberryYorkshireJob lossesWest YorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

A former volunteer with the Peace Corps, which sends young Americans overseas to projects in emerging economies, Anderson had expected to spend her whole career in international development.“I had taken this job two years ago expecting to stay here for at least 10 years, and you know, we had started to make a community and build up our life here. In January, we had started looking at buying a home,” she says.Now Anderson is having to consider giving up the apartment in the Washington DC commuter town of Reston, Virginia, that she shares with her husband and their four-month-old baby and almost two-year-old toddler.“Financially, it’s a little bit precarious, and honestly we’re not sure what we’re going to do,” says Anderson, who is also an activist with the local branch of the AFSCME union and dabbles in selling political merchandise. “We’re thinking about moving back to Ohio, where I’m from, where my family is. You know, it’s a lot cheaper there.”Anderson is far from alone. “In our apartment complex, there’s been lots of yard sales, people selling things and moving away. It really does seem like people are just picking up and leaving, because it’s too expensive to live here without a job,” she says.Tough life-decisions like these have been forced on hundreds of thousands of former federal employees in the past couple of months, as the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge), which is headed up by Donald Trump’s favourite tech billionaire, Elon Musk, hasslashed jobs in a cost-cutting spree.Data from the latest monthlyChallenger jobs reportsuggests Doge has been responsible for 281,452 job cuts so far – almost eight times the number of workers the government let go in the entire year to April 2024.Brendan Demich is among those to be dismissed, losing his job as an engineer at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. All his colleagues working on mine safety, as well as those in their sister laboratory testing equipment such as respirators, are also leaving – more than 200 in total – as part of a wave of cuts initiated by Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr.“So many people are devastated,” says Demich, chief steward of the local AFGE union branch. He says so many workers have been removed at once that their colleagues have barely been able to give them any kind of send-off. “It’s just unceremoniously leaving, because they had their package processed and they had to walk out the door.”Each of these cuts has its own human impact, but experts are warning of a growing risk that they combine to trigger an economic retrenchment – particularly in areas with a heavy concentration of government jobs.View image in fullscreenLiz Shuler: ‘The economy is being impacted in such a stark way, that ripples out across all of the industries that we represent.’Photograph: Bonnie Cash/UPI/Rex/ShutterstockLiz Shuler, the president of the AFL-CIO federation of 63 trade unions, which together represent more than 15 million US workers, is trying to build a nationwide campaign to highlight the devastating impact.“The trick is connecting the dots because there’s already a national narrative around what’s happening but it’s not quite being felt yet,” Shuler says. “Elon [Musk] has his ‘department of government efficiency’. We established the ‘department of people who work for a living’. That’s kind of cheeky, but it’s kind of serious, because we’re saying we’re the ones working on the frontlines. We know what’s efficient and what’s not.“Obviously as the labour federation we’re worried about jobs and people’s livelihoods, but it’s also connected to community, and the fact the economy is being impacted in such a stark way, that ripples out across all of the industries that we represent,” she adds.These ripples are being felt especially strongly in the towns and counties around Washington DC, where job losses and government cuts crop up constantly in conversation.Kate Bates is the president of the chamber of commerce in affluent Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River from the US capital. She compares the current uncertainty to the pandemic, “but during Covid, the federal government was the backstop, whereas right now it’s the federal government that’s causing a lot of this,” she says.Bates reports that her members are warning of a slowdown across real estate and hospitality, as well as among government contractors, with several reporting they have already had to make job cuts.“What we hear from a lot of people is that if they could plan for the cuts, they would be in an OK position, right? But because things are changing, going back and forth, that’s causing a lot of stress,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘If the whole year is on the margin then restaurants like ours will go under,’ says the general manager of Arlington’s Barley Mac.Photograph: Greg Kahn/The GuardianBusinesses that rely on government workers for custom are also feeling the chill. Saamir Nizam, the general manager of Arlington’s Barley Mac restaurant, which is part of a small family-owned chain, has noticed trade declining in just about every one of their usual customer groups.The nearby hotels are less occupied; bookings for “happy hour parties” by the accountants and consultants who serve the federal government are down by two-thirds; and many older local residents have been spooked by market volatility.“We can only do so much to turn things around: we can’t pull people to Washington, or convince companies to go out and do things,” Nizam says. “Barley Mac serves great food, it gives great service, but it exists, like many restaurants, on the financial margin. And if the whole year is on the margin then restaurants like ours will go under, because we’re not part of a huge national chain which has deep pockets.”View image in fullscreenReal estate agent Jessica Miller says clients are responding by pulling out of deals and trying to negotiate unusually short leases.Photograph: Greg Kahn/The GuardianJess Miller, who set up Rock Spring Real Estate Solutions a couple of years ago, has been hosting a breakfast roundtable for clients, on the top floor of an as yet unoccupied new office block in Arlington.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The owners of this building are splitting the floors instead of looking for one anchor tenant.“Just how they’re making decisions is different – the cutbacks we’re seeing,” Miller says. “It hit the NGOs first and then it hit, you know, the corporations and the contractors, and it’s a lot of the senior management.”Katherine D’Zmura Friedman is a co-founder and the chief executive of Thumbprint, an Arlington-based startup offering an artificial intelligence platform for designing office layouts.View image in fullscreenKatherine D’Zmura Friedman says she seen family friends and neighbours losing their jobs, people who would not ‘normally be subject to layoffs’.Photograph: Greg Kahn/The Guardian“There’s no universe in which something like the last few months happens and there’s not serious consequences,” she says. “We’ve had family friends, we’ve had neighbours lose their jobs, and these are not people who would normally be subject to layoffs. These are people who are at the peak of their career, and hyper-specialised.”As far as the business effects are concerned, D’Zmura Friedman says: “Certainly on the commercial side, there’s been hesitancy about launching into things.”At her office nearby, Renata Briggman, a residential estate agent, plays down the idea that the housing market in Arlington could be hit, pointing to the many local employers broadly unaffected by federal spending – such as Amazon, which is headquartered here.However, she does acknowledge signs of change. “It’s definitely shifting. We’re not seeing any fire sales, it’s too soon for that. It’s very, very slow, and we’re just going to start seeing it, it’s just on the cusp … end of June, we’ll have a better idea.”View image in fullscreenRenata Briggman: ‘It’s definitely shifting. We’re not seeing any fire sales, it’s too soon for that.’Photograph: Greg Kahn/The GuardianSuch challenges are being replicated across the region. Jimmy Olevson, the president and chief executive of National Capital Bank, which serves Washington DC and the surrounding areas, says the bank is not yet seeing signs of financial distress, such as rising arrears, but the mood is “uneasy”. Many customers who have had a recent mortgage application approved seem to have put house-hunting on hold.Some experts fear this widespread mood of unease bodes badly for the coming months. Analysis by Dr João Ferreira, an expert in regional economics at the University of Virginia, suggests more than 320,000 people in the state are employed directly by the federal government – and another 441,000 jobs depend on taxpayer-funded contracts, of the kind that are being cut.In some sectors – construction, for example – the same firms fretting about whether their contract will be cut are also contending with the rising price of materials, as a result of tariffs. Although some of the border taxes have beenpaused or reduced, those restrictions that remain mean costs are still far higher than at the start of the year.In theory, the Trump administration could lift the gloom by drawing a line under budget cuts as Musk headsback to his day jobrunning the electric carmaker Tesla. But key members of the cabinet, including Kennedy and the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, have boasted of how much they plan to slash from their budgets – and White House trade policy continues to see-saw.Ferreira says: “I think, as an economist, I’ve never seen so many things happening at the same time. But they all lead to the same direction, and that’s a recession.”He says Virginia has often been cushioned from economic downturns in the past by federal funding, but in this cycle he expects the state to lead the way. “We definitely might see that Virginia, and other regions like Maryland, will be the frontrunners in this recession period,” Ferreira says.Meanwhile, for many of the affected individuals, the future looks highly uncertain – despite the US treasury secretary Scott Bessent’s suggestion theyshould go work in manufacturing. “For us on our team, we work in international development,” says Anderson. “We have a background in humanitarian work, and the Trump administration is trying to cut international foreign aid.

Wrapped in an “ultra-hard, 30X, cold-rolled stainless steel exoskeleton”, the Cybertruck was touted as the ultimate doomsday chariot – avirtually indestructible, obtuse-angled, electrically powered behemoth that can repel handgun fire and outrun a Porsche whiletowinga Porsche, with enough juice leftover to power your house in the event of a blackout. At the launch,Tesla’s CEO,Elon Musk, said the truck could tackle any terrain on Earthand possibly also on Mars – and all for the low, low base price of $40,000. “Sometimes you get these late-civilization vibes [that the] apocalypse could come along at any moment,” Musk said. “Here at Tesla, we have the best in apocalypse technology.”Six years on, Covid and Musk’s political alignment withDonald Trumphave kicked upthe apocalypse vibes, and Tesla’s good sense has only become more questionable as the Cybertruck has been reduced to an object of universal scorn and derision further raising a host of questions: is the Cybertruck even a decent doomsday chariot? Could it reallysurvive end times? Will it survive Musk himself? “There’s no doubt it’s a heavy-duty vehicle that can take some punishment, even from small arms fire,” says Arthur Bradley, a prepping expert who oversees the building of satellite systems at Nasa’s Langley research center in Virginia. “But you can’t weigh the pros without also asking: ‘Are people shooting at me because they think I’m an idiot or a bad guy, or they don’t support my political views – or they don’t support me supporting this company?’”View image in fullscreenElon Musk introduces the Cybertruck at Tesla’s design studio in Hawthorne, California, on 21 November 2019. The windows were broken during a demonstration intended to show the strength of the glass.Photograph: Ringo HW Chiu/APPost-armageddon transport has a simple but specific brief: be tough, durable and drive through anything – and no vehicle ticks those boxes more reliably than trucks. Fictional concepts such as Mad Max’s tanker-based War Rig are often the inspiration for real-world creations like Ford’s custom-built F650 Supertruck, a tractor-trailer sized monstrosity that can carry 120 gallons of fuel, tow 30,000lb, and be reinforced with bulletproof armor. The truck is how insurgent fightersget around war zonesand what storm chasers use torun down tornadoes. “They’re certainly pretty good for prepping purposes,” says Sean Gold, a former air force emergency manager who has worked in the prepping industry for nearly a decade. “They’re large, off-road-capable, able to get off roads that might be congested – that sort of thing.”I have never physically felt the air leave a room in the way that it did when the Cybertruck rolled out on stageSimone Giertz, DIY robotics inventorThe Cybertruck, however, broke from a century’s worth of truck-building orthodoxy, eschewing the typical three-box layout for a wedge-shaped silhouette that took inspiration from the movie Blade Runner and cyberpunk motifs. It mocked the F-150, the US’s top-selling vehicle for the last 47 years, asprehistoric tech. On its website, Tesla featured imaginative images of the Cybertruck crawling around Mars. Few knew what to make of it. Simone Giertz, a DIY robotics inventor whobuilt a Tesla truckon her popular YouTube channel, was among a select group invited to Tesla’s Hawthorne, California, studio for the Cybertruck unveiling. “I have never physically felt the air leave a room in the way that it did when the Cybertruck rolled out on stage,” she recalls. “People were so confused.”Since Musk’s hard-right turn, however, the Cybertruck’s design has gone from aesthetically polarizing to politically so. A recentSlate articlenods at the truck’s uncanny resemblance to the Casspir, the apartheid-era military transport that patrolled South African townships inMusk’s boyhood. “As violence and flames engulfed the streets of the nation, Black South African children drew and wrote about the apartheid security forces and its tools – dogs and Casspirs – chasing and shooting at them in their schools, streets, and homes,” the article says. “By the 1990s, the Casspir had become an iconic global symbol of apartheid oppression.”View image in fullscreenCasspirs, armored personnel carriers used by South Africa’s army and police, patrol the streets of a township before the nation’s first democratic election in 1994.Photograph: Peter Turnley/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesIt’s no surprise then that the Cybertruck would become a status symbol for security forces. One California police department spent $153,000 on a Cybertruck for “community outreach efforts” (though it didn’t rule out using it to “respond to emergencies” as needed), and a Chechen warlord showed offa machine-gun mounted Cybertruckhe claimed was purpose-built to help his army fight alongside Russia in the Ukraine war. “I am sure that this ‘beast’ will bring a lot of benefit to our fighters,” Ramzan Kadyrov said while heaping praise on “the respected Elon Musk”, who has denied making the vehicle for Kadyrov. Ultimately, the Cybertruck had to be towed from the battlefield after randomly shutting down on Chechen forces, and Kadyrov accused Musk of switching it off remotely –a nagging concernamong Tesla owners.In Tesla’s early days, the catastrophe thinking was small – a “bioweapon defense mode” button on each vehicle’s climate control, something Musk reckoned might come in handy “if there’s ever an apocalyptic scenario of some kind”. But even as Musk’s winking references to the apocalypse manifested into a bulletproof rig made of stainless steel, there was no denying that he may have been right to think the Cybertruck could be a hit with consumers. After the 2019 unveiling,Teslareceived about 2m preorders from customers plonking down $100 each. But in the end the enthusiasm wouldn’t last because Musk couldn’t keep his promises.The Cybertruck came to market two years too late, which was time that allowed Tesla’s rivals to get in the game; more Cybertruck reservation holders might have hung in there if Musk hadn’t marked the truck’s base price up to $99,000. Perhaps most detrimental for Tesla: the Cybertruck’s purported utility appeared to beworsethan advertised. The average truck is undergirded with a steel frame to handle the rigors of hauling and towing – but the Cybertruck’s underbody is made of aluminum, much lighter metal that can bendand even breakunder heavy strain. Stainless steel is also susceptible torust– which is to say the Cybertruck is an iffy proposition to survive regular winter, let alone nuclear winter.The internet teems with video of the Cybertruck spinning its wheels ina snowy parking space,on the beachand farther off the beaten path; meanwhile the Rivian R1T, a legitimately capable electric vehicle rival to the Cybertruck, was apparently no worse for wear after beingtossed around during Hurricane Helene. (“What a dream marketing opportunity for Rivian,” Giertz says. “Your truckactuallysurvived a natural disaster.”)Dan Neil, the Wall Street Journal’s Pulitzer prize-winning car critic,slid off a hillwhile test-driving the Cybertruck with his teenage daughter. “We took it on class three and class four trails, which it is technically capable of,” he says. “But it’s also 2ft wider than any trail at any national park could generally accommodate. That’s the part I don’t get. It’s definitely anon-roadcar.”View image in fullscreenPolice officers stand near a Cybertruck as people protest against a rally by Elon Musk, who is supporting a conservative state supreme court candidate, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on 30 March 2025.Photograph: Vincent Alban/ReutersThat makes the Cybertruck an even tougher sell to doomsday preppers – many of whom already had their doubts about the viability of EV technology during and after a major disaster, says Gold, the former air force manager. The Cybertruck’s 300ish-mile range in particular becomes a much riskier proposition when plugs stop working. “The beauty of EVs is you don’t have to hunt for fuel,” says Bradley, the Virginia-based prepping expert. “But the drawback is most people don’t have a large solar power generation system. If you get a little too far out, or run into a situation that causes you to use up your energy, you might not get back home.”Daisy Luther, a former automotive service manager who went into the prepping business after the 2008 financial collapse, wonders how anyone in the post-apocalypse would go about fixing a Cybertruck (which has already been recalledeighttimes) – especially in the event of an electromagnetic pulse or similar event. “I generally recommend that if someone is getting a vehicle to last them through some kind of apocalyptic situation that it have as few computer chips and electronics as possible,” says Luther, who drives an old Jeep. “I can do small repairs on something mechanical, but I can’t do anything that requires a computer flash or a satellite upgrade because I don’t have the equipment.”Last month I rented a Tesla Cybertruck to get a feel for it as a family vehicle and found it to be ill-equipped forthesetimes, let alone the end times. (And I say that as the owner of a Model Y, an exceedingly versatile family hauler that’s also massively fun to drive.) At over 6ft wide, 18ft long and 3.5 tons, the Cybertruck was a bear to maneuver around Atlanta’s narrow streets; its obtuse-angled shape made identifying traffic hazards through the car’s windows and mirrors a virtual impossibility. Even when I find myself considering the Cybertruck just for its potential as a standby home generator, I was soon reminded that Hyundai and Kia EVs offer similar capability for a fraction of the cost.I don’t think that [Doge] is the issue. Actually, it’s that people despise Elon Musk even more than they hate TrumpRoss Gerber, Tesla investorFor my toddler boys the Cybertruck is what the Lamborghini Countach was to me in my youth,the apogee of poster cars– but the truck isn’t what I would call kid-friendly. Mostly, it kept me worried about them gouging out an eye, losing a finger or getting static shock from touching the steel doors as they explored.“You’re driving a meme car!” Ezra Dyer, the Car and Driver columnist, helpfully reminds me. “You have to buy into the idea that it’s kind of funny,wink-wink.” When my wife asked if the children would be safe inside, I hesitated to tell her that Alijah Arenas – the highly regarded USC basketball recruit and son of former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas – had to be put into a coma after losing control of his Cybertruck andcrashing into a fire hydrant in Los Angeles. Suffice to say, had Alijah Arenas been driving a Rivian (the safest pickup on the roadfull stop) orTiger Woods’s 2009 Escalade, he would have been able to walk away from the accident; but somehow, bystanders managed to pry open the Cybertruck’s doors, which don’t have exterior handles (!), and pull him away from a fiery scene made scarier by the truck’stough to extinguish high-voltage battery– the last thing you’d want to deal with when the world’s already burning.View image in fullscreenA Cybertruck is parked with other Tesla vehicles on the south lawn driveway in front of the White House in Washington DC on 11 March 2025. Trump has said he will buy a Tesla to support the company and Elon Musk after recent calls for boycotts of Tesla products.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockUnlike modern cars, the Cybertruck was expresslynot designed to deform on impact– further ratcheting up the safety risks during and after a cataclysmic disaster. (This is also why Cybertrucks are banned in the UK, EU and China, the world’s largest EV market.) Gold, who drives a Model 3, could envision a bad actor hacking into the truck remotely or even Musk himself shutting them down out of spite as may or may not have been the case with the Chechen warlord. “I know it doesn’t really make sense [for him to do that],” Gold says, “but thepossibilityis concerning”.Then there’s Gold’s point: the Cybertruck is such a ripe target, it sticks out so much. Early on the Ford CEO, Jim Farley, dismissed it as the kind of status mobile you might find “parked in front of a hotel”. In its relatively short life, the Cybertruck has gone from being a status mobile for Kim Kardashian, Pharrell Williams and other tastemakers to the ultimate meme-mobile – a Maga hat on wheels. (SNL’s Colin Jost called it the answer to the question: “What if Kanyewas a car?”) When the truck isn’t being flipped off in traffic (although that wasn’t my experience driving it in Atlanta, asaturated Tesla market), it’s being used as aslate canvasforpolitical protestsagainst Musk. “I mean, I wouldn’t want to drive one around towntoday,” Bradley says.Read more from The Armageddon complex seriesWhy apocalypse-minded shoppers go to CostcoLefty preppers are taking a different approach to doomsdayThe rise of end times fascismThe irony of Tesla’s apocalypse machine is it couldn’t even overcome Musk’s worst nature, or even live up to the Earth-saving principles that Tesla used to espouse. “Maybe this explains it: he’s working really hard on bringing down civil society; maybe that was just to increase the market?” Giertz jokes. “It’s interesting because when the environmentalists turned on Elon, he immediately pivoted to another target group: the preppers who want to be self-sufficient. But at this point when civility is out the window and we are even more pissed at the guy who brought the apocalypse in, I’d rather be in a Toyota Prius than a Cybertruck.”On the company’s earnings call last month Musk vowed to step back from running the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to devote more time to Tesla amid speculation that he could bereplaced as CEO– but the catastrophe may be unsalvageable. “I don’t think that [Doge] is the issue,” Ross Gerber, a major Tesla investor, toldCNN. “Actually, it’s that people despise Elon Musk even more than they hate Trump. And that’s not something that he can solve at this point.”Despite being the world’s top selling EV pickup, Cybertruck sales are still so poor that the company doesn’t even bother reporting them – butrecord high inventoryandsteep depreciation curvesgive the game away. Quietly, Tesla shifted marketing strategies for the Cybertruck, pivoting away from the Martian imagery to more classic pickup truck iconography – but it’s too little, too late, and now just gaslighting the public. In recent months Tesla’s board chair made $198m unloading the company’s stock amid falling profits.Ford, Rivian and other competitors are fast gaining ground in the market. “It’s really interesting to see how far Tesla has fallen,” says Benoit. “At this point it’s beyond political.”If anything, the Cybertruck becoming the Titanic of cars is the fate weactuallyshould’ve prepared for. History tells us anytime a vehicle is touted as future-proof, it’s all but doomed to become a monument to unchecked hubris. “My guess is this incarnation of the Cybertruck has a very limited life,” Bradley says. “I think there will be another Cybertruck, but it will probably be more modern-looking – like a regular pickup truck.”"

The nonfiction theatrical marketplace has never been breezy in the US, but this is a particularly difficult time for documentaries, let alone films about hot-button issues considered politically sensitive or, under the new administration, outright dangerous; one of the Encampments’ primary subjects, the Columbia University student-activistMahmoud Khalil, remainsin detentionby Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) without charge for any crime. Large-scale distributors, including all of the major streaming services, areincreasingly wary of anything deemed controversial, leaving such films asUnion, on the Amazon Labor Union, or theOscar-winningPalestinian-Israeli documentaryNo Other Landwithout distribution in the US.From campus to police state: a new documentary goes inside the Columbia university protestsRead moreNevertheless, over an exclusive first-weekend run, The Encampments made $80,000 at the Angelika – the highest per-screen average for a documentary since the Oscar-winning Free Solo in 2018. That number may sound like peanuts compared with, say, the multimillion theatrical haul of a Marvel movie, but it’s asignificant win for the specialty box office– and validation for a film whose mere existence, as a pro-Palestinian narrative, led tothreats of violence at the Angelika, an incident of vandalism in the theater’s lobby and social media censorship of its ads.That it reached a theater at all is the work ofWatermelon Pictures, an upstart film financing and distribution company aiming to bring Palestinian and other marginalized voices to new audiences. The Chicago-based label, founded by brothers Hamza and Badie Ali in April 2024, is single-handedly hustling to get Palestinian films on screens large and small, filling a crucial hole in the entertainment market and providing an outlet for a long-underserved community.“We see ourselves as a distributor that’s willing to take risks,” Hamza Ali told the Guardian from the label’s Chicago offices. For most of Watermelon’s slate – including The Encampments, the West Bank-set narrative drama The Teacher and the Palestinian anthology film From Ground Zero – “distributors aren’t wanting to take the risk because of backlash. We see ourselves as a home for them. And there is an audience.”View image in fullscreenHamza and Badie Ali.Composite: Watermelon PicturesThe Ali brothers first conceived of Watermelon Pictures – so named for the fruit that became a symbol of Palestinian resistance, sharing the colors of the national flag – in the wake of the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks that precipitated Israel’s ruthless war in Gaza, which haskilledmore than 62,000 Palestinians and destroyed nearly every home in the territory. The label honors their father Malik and uncle Waleed, Palestinian-Americans who, in 1976, founded MPI Media Group in Chicago as a small, bespoke distribution company; the entrepreneurs graduated from delivering film rolls at select screenings to TV rights, DVDs and foreign distribution deals.As, to their knowledge, the only Palestinian-led distribution company in North America, “we came to the realization that we need to do something” in the wake of the war in Gaza, said Badie. Watermelon Pictures, as a label specifically devoted to the perspective of Palestine and other resistance movements, was “an opportunity that we felt we had to do”.‘A chilling effect’: is Hollywood too scared to touch hot-button documentaries?Read moreThe brothers have focused, in part, on giving films that challenge the conventional US narrative on Palestine – one that invariably privileges the justifications of the Israeli state – a theatrical run. From Ground Zero, an anthology of shorts from 22 Palestinian directors on life and death in Gaza, played in select theaters and made the Oscar shortlist for best international film. In January, Watermelon acquired the US distribution rights forThe Teacher, a political thriller from the Palestinian-British director Farah Nabulsi starring Saleh Bakri and Imogen Poots, whose distribution prospects languished after premiering at the Toronto Film Festival in 2023. The film, based on a real 2011 prisoner swap, when Israel freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for one IDF soldier, hit US theaters in April.And this month, the company launchedWatermelon+, a new streaming service that will serve as a home for its upcoming releases as well as several decades’ worth of Palestinian cinema – films with limited reach or lapsed distribution rights, if they were even available in the west to begin with. “It guarantees that we don’t have to depend on anyone to make sure that these titles are seen,” said Badie. “We’ll always have our own platform, at least, as a backstop – if it’s being rejected by this or that, it will have a home no matter what.”The subscription service, which costs $7.99 a month or $79.99 annually, has obtained the rights for 70 films – including Oscar nominees Omar, Five Broken Cameras and Theeb – with plans to expand beyond the Palestinian perspective. “Palestine is not alone,” said Hamza. “The pro-Palestine movement is growing, but we want to be inclusive and expand beyond that,” such as Hind Meddeb’s documentary Sudan, Remember Us, a film on the 2019 Sudanese revolution that Watermelonacquiredthis month for a US release later this summer. “The rising global south community is where the future is,” said Badie. “And we just want to be ahead of it.”The Teacher review – a Palestinian educator is troubled by his radical pastRead moreView image in fullscreenA still from The Encampments.Photograph: Watermelon PicturesThe eventual goal, according to the Alis, is to host a wide variety of content – reality TV, cooking shows, standup comedy and short films, some original and some acquired – that offer a different perspective from the stillpredominant tropeof Arab and/or Muslim characters as perpetrators of violence. “Our job is to show that this isn’t who we are,” said Badie. Backlash to The Encampments, which mirrored efforts to keep theaters from playing the self-distributed No Other Land, only reinforced the company’s mission. “They’re nervous about what we’re doing,” said Badie. “But at the same time, if we’re not getting this heat, I feel like we’re not doing our job. We really want to challenge the portrayal of how we’re looked at.”The brothers are continually in search of new independent projects, nonfiction or fiction, but noted that, for the moment, Palestinian films are defaulting to Watermelon, as currently the only Palestinian-led business in town. “Hopefully we see a time where other distributors want these films too, so that there is competition,” said Hamza.In the meantime, Watermelon will continue to pursue its twofold mission: provide an outlet for Palestinian and other marginalized perspectives and, as Badie put it, “make far-reaching films that just humanize us and that appeal to a larger audience.”“We’re going to do our part,” added Hamza. “It’s representation and humanization.”The Encampments out in the UK and Ireland on 6 JuneExplore more on these topicsFilm industryPalestinian territoriesDocumentary filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s what our experts thinkAlexander Abnos,Megan Swanick,Jakub Frankowicz, and Adam SnavelyWed 14 May 2025 11.20 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 15.30 EDTShareThe primary kit, white with a star print, will be worn only by the US women to start. Dubbed the “Brilliant Kit,” the marketing pitch says it’s a “tribute to the trailblazers who have shaped soccer and inspired generations. Star details are drawn directly from iconic past WNT kits, fused with a modern silhouette to reflect the optimism, leadership, and evolution of the game.” Does the kit accomplish this, to you?I appreciate Nike saying the modern silhouette is reflecting all of those very nice-sounding buzzwords and not just “we put this design on one of our current kit models instead of reproducing shirt sizes from 1999 because no one wants to run around in baggy polyester any more.” Are the star details from past USWNT that are referenced supposed to be the stars they got from winning World Cups? If so, that’s a good flex. Unfortunately, the biggest visual reference this one conjures to me is the‘94 men’s denim kit(which the women did not wear – the USWNT and USMNT designs didn’t match up until a couple decades later). I like the retro feel of it all and so that look-back-at-the-past direction succeeds. I can do without the rest of the blurb.ASI think it does accomplish all that, though I imagine most, including myself, would say the most clear comparison is to the 1994 men’s World Cup kit. It’s got the same denim blue and a patchwork of stars. Though this time the stars look much less clip art-inspired.JFUS men to play South Korea, Japan in September friendlies with World Cup loomingRead moreThis kit absolutely feels like a tribute to past generations of American soccer. On that front, they knocked it out of the park. The stars definitely draw the mind more immediately to the men’s 1994 World Cup kits, though, as opposed to any star-laden WNT kits. That said, the women are the only ones with stars above their crest, so it makes sense for them to have a star-spangled jersey.MSI mean … it’s a white US home kit. I don’t know that they’re necessarily paying tribute to anything as much as they’re maintaining tradition. And that’s fine! Tradition is good. The kit is good. I appreciate that they’re trying something different within the relatively narrow bounds of “majority white.” I’m not sure who is going to be moved over the line from “don’t like it” to “want to buy it” once they hear that the stars reference past US kits (which, as the others point out, feels like much more of a nod to men’s kits of the past than anything).AAWould you wear it? Why or why not?I’m on the fence, if I’m being honest. It’s a good swing at taking the white home kits and trying something different with them, but the texture of the shirt and overlapping star pattern feels more like patriotic napkins my mom would buy for a Fourth of July picnic than a shirt I really want to wear. I feel as if they’re ultimately just fine, but not something I’d want to spend money on.ASYes, but I’d keep it reserved for match days.JFThis kit has July barbecue written all over it. Highly wearable, but definitely more of a statement piece compared to the away version.MSThis is the perfect example of a kit I would buy or wear depending on the memories that are made with it on the field. I think it’ll be easy to wear it proudly if the US does relatively well. If the Emma Hayes era takes a drastic and unforeseen turn for the worse … maybe not.AAThe “Heartbeat Kit” as modeled by US men’s player Yunus Musah.Photograph: Courtesy US SoccerThe away kit – the “Heartbeat Kit” – was created to honor the fans, “the ever-growing, passionate community behind US Soccer … Designed with a heritage-meets-streetstyle aesthetic, the Heartbeat Kit channels the pulse of the soccer nation.” Does any of that seem apparent to you in this kit?Heritage meets streetstyle. Farm-to-table fashion. I can practically taste the heirloom synthetic cotton used to spin these threads. And what is it that channels the pulse of the soccer nation? Pinstripes, baby! As a person that really loved theroyal blue with white pinstripesUSMNT kit from a long time ago, I’m down with rehashing that concept. But I’m going to need a map to figure out how we got from the kit design to this description of it. It’s another retro callback, so I guess that’s where the “heritage” parts comes in? But they’ve lost me with the rest of it. This is channeling the streetstyle soccer pulse of a nation only if said nation is located inside of an Old Navy.ASI don’t know how it “channels the pulse of soccer nation” but it is one of the most street-wearable kits US Soccer has released. Even the US Soccer crest and Nike logo feel unobtrusive and integrated into the design.JFI think the “heritage-meets-street style” approach comes through here. There’s America-themed stripes, a pleasing mix of red and blues shades, and a design that is sleek and fashionable.MSskip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t get any of that from this kit, which to my eyes is very refined and under control. If anything, the home kit says “passionate” to me far more than this one.AAWould you wear it? Why or why not?Nah. The alternating colors of the pinstripes aren’t doing it for me and I don’t really like navy as a base color for the secondaries as it stands. It feels simultaneously too drab and too busy. Generally, I want a kit to either commit to either being clean with some nice details (like thecentennial kits), or go fully brash and loud (the‘21 stadium kits). This kit feels like it tries to do both, and ends up hitting neither target.ASEvery so often a kit comes along that I buy without a player name and number so I can wear it out on any occasion, this is one of those.JFFor sure. This one’s both eye-catching but versatile. I think you’d get a lot of good wear out of it, in a variety of settings.MSDefinitely. As others point out, this one seems to be designed specifically to be worn in a non-game context, and it succeeds in that goal.AAView image in fullscreenThe US will begin wearing the new looks this summer.Photograph: Courtesy US SoccerOverall, where would you rank this collection in the pantheon of US kits?I don’t like the secondaries, but the primaries are fine and the US has taken much worse swings. If the design hotstreak for the men between 2006 and 2012 is near the top of my US collection rankings, and stuff like the2011 “medical scrubs” women’s kitsor those2015 secondariesthat looks like a bottle of antifreeze are on the bottom, then these are pretty middling, all things considered. Don’t love ‘em, don’t hate ‘em. I’ll feel fine watching them on TV and not needing to wear them myself.ASIt’s top notch. Perhaps due to nostalgia I’m partial to theUSMNT 2010 World Cupkits and the spiritual sequel of the2011 aways, which improved on color. Another favorite are the 2013 US Soccer centennial kits with their vintage crest. These new kits fall right behind those.JFThey’re both easy on the eye, but haven’t earned best-ever status just yet. I’d put them toward the top but short of my all-time favorites (I’m aWaldoloyalist with special places in my heart for the2019 women’s kitand those ‘94 World Cup denim things) for now.MSI think they’re certainly in the top half, maybe the top quarter. They thread the needle nicely by trying new things while maintaining tradition, and I feel like the designs will look decent in the stands and on the field. Whether they move up or down, again, will depend on the memories made in the next couple years.AAExplore more on these topicsUSAUSA women's football teamUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I dreamed as a child of becoming the best player in the world and winning all the majors. I’ve done that. Everything beyond this, for however long I decide to play the game competitively, is a bonus.”Every McIlroy interview now reflects upon Masters Sunday, when he fell to the ground amid moving scenes after securing a playoff success over Justin Rose. McIlroy’s triumph has reverberated way beyond sport.“I’ve tried not to watch it a lot because I want to remember the feelings,” said McIlroy of his immediate celebration. “I’ve talked about this before, but I think when I rewatch a lot of things back, I then just remember the visuals of the TV rather than what I was feeling and what I was seeing through my own eyes. So I haven’t tried to watch it back too much. But anytime I have, I well up. I still feel like I want to cry.“It was an involuntary. I’ve never felt a release like that before and I might never feel a release like that again. That could be a once-in-a-lifetime thing and it was a very cool moment.”Bryson DeChambeau, who played in McIlroy’s company during the final round at Augusta, rather pointedly stated that the champion did not speak with him on the course. The American, who may well also be in theUS PGAmix, had slumped to a closing 75 for a share of fifth.“I don’t know what he was expecting,” McIlroy said. “We’re trying to win the Masters. I’m not going to try to be his best mate out there.“Look, everyone approaches the game in different ways. I was focused on myself and what I needed to do. That’s really all that it was. It wasn’t anything against him. It was just I felt that’s what I needed to do to try to get the best out of myself that day.”View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy watches his tee shot on the 2nd hole during a practice round for the US PGA at the Quail Hollow.Photograph: George Walker IV/APIt is telling – and deliberate – that McIlroy will not publicly set more professional targets. He is now within one, say, of Nick Faldo’s major haul of six. Faldo’s tally is the highest by a European.“I think everyone saw how hard having a north star is and being able to get over the line,” he said. “If I can just try to get the best out of myself each and every week, I know what my abilities are. I know the golf that I can play. If I keep turning up and just trying to do that each and every week, especially in these four big ones a year, I know that I’ll have my chances.If I keep turning up and just trying to do that each and every week, especially in these four big ones a year, I know that I’ll have my chances.“I’ve always said I’m never going to put a number on it. I’ve talked about trying to become the best European ever or the best international player ever or whatever that is. The numbers tell one story, but it mightn’t be the full story.“I feel like I sort of burdened myself with the career grand slam stuff and I want to enjoy this. I want to enjoy what I’ve achieved and I want to enjoy the last decade or whatever of my career. I don’t want to burden myself by numbers or statistics. I just want to go and try to play the best golf I can.”McIlroy’s chances in Charlotte appear to increase with every falling raindrop. Quail Hollow has been battered by precipitation since Friday, meaning McIlroy’s distance and accuracy with driver in hand should be extra valuable. In 13 Quail Hollow starts, McIlroy has posted nine top 10s. His score to par over that period is 102 under.“I think early in my career that these conditions favoured me more,” McIlroy explained. “But I believe that Pinehurst [at the US Open] last year favoured me. I believe that firm conditions favour me. I believe that any conditions that we play in, I have the abilities and I have the skill set to excel.”McIlroy was stern-faced when asked if there was any element of his game he would swap with another player in this sport. “I wouldn’t trade,” said the 36-year-old. He has no apparent need to either.Explore more on these topicsUS PGARory McIlroyPGA TourEuropean TourGolfUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, this trip ended with the same heartbreak as his other three to this point in the playoffs.Mitchell started, played 38 minutes and scored 39 points despite a sprained ankle, but it wasn’t enough as the Indiana Pacers wore down the Cavaliers in the second half and eliminated the Eastern Conference’s top seed 114-105 on Tuesday night.Ten minutes after the game ended, Mitchell went back on the court at Rocket Arena and was still shocked over the sudden ending to the season.The Mavs’ Cooper Flagg lottery miracle fuels conspiracy theories – and hopeRead more“I just couldn’t believe it. I didn’t want to believe it. I still don’t want to believe it,” he said.The Pacers’ victory in Game 5 on Tuesday night was similar to the first two games of the series. Cleveland jumped out to a big first-half lead, but Indiana’s quick tempo eventually took a toll.“I have to give our guys credit, they earned this,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. “This was one of the best teams in the league. I’m sorry their season had to end like this. They had the perfect season, and we came along and were hot at the right time.”Tyrese Haliburton scored 31 points and Pascal Siakam added 21 as the Pacers reached the conference finals in consecutive years for the first time since 2013-14.For Donovan, there was just lingering regret. “We just didn’t get the job done. Nothing else needs to be said … We let the city down. We let each other down,” he said.The Cavaliers easily dispatched of Miami with a four-game sweep in the first round but could never find the answer against an Indiana squad that plays quick and wears teams down.After going 64-18 in the regular season – which included three winning streaks of 12 games or more – Mitchell and the Cavaliers will ponder what might have been in what is an open chase for theNBAtitle this year.“We have a window with this group. I believe in this team. That’s what just [hurts]. We’re a good team, but ultimately for three games, we didn’t seem it,” Mitchell said. “There is going to be a long of talk [from the media]. We didn’t capitalize, so everyone is going to write us off. It’s, ‘What are we going to do about it next year?’ Y’all are going to say a lot. And that’s what it takes. I’ve been here.”In Tuesday’s other game, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 31 points, and the Oklahoma City Thunder rallied from a double-digit deficit in the second half to beat the Denver Nuggets 112-105 and go up 3-2 in their Western Conference semi-final series. Oklahoma City overcame a 44-point, 15-rebound night from Denver’s Nikola Jokić. The Thunder can clinch the series on Thursday in Denver. Gilgeous-Alexander made 12 of 23 field goals and had seven assists. He led six Thunder players in double figures. Jokić made 17 of 25 field goals. Denver’s Jamal Murray scored 28 points, but he made just 10 of 27 shots.“We had no choice. The game obviously wasn’t going our way. But we always say the answer is never a hero play or anything out of the ordinary,” said Gilgeous-Alexander. “It’s being who we are. It’s trusting each other playing with all five on both ends. Whatever the problem is, we can fix it with the collective effort.”Explore more on these topicsNBAIndiana PacersCleveland CavaliersBasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

What is not acceptable is the safety of players being compromised as a result of technology warping the game and officials being instructed not to flag for offside if a goalscoring opportunity is on the cards. Thankfully, he was reported to have woken from his coma on Wednesday evening.Taiwo Awoniyi set to be brought out of induced coma after surgeryRead moreThe hope is that the sight of Awoniyi colliding with a post and suffering a serious abdominal injury during an attack that should never have been allowed to unfold duringForest’s 2-2 draw with Leicester last Sundaywill finally shake some sense into people.It is worth pointing out, of course, that Sian Massey-Ellis, who was running the line at the City Ground, was not at fault when she chose not to raise her flag when Anthony Elanga ran past the Leicester defence at the start of the move and crossed for Awoniyi. Elanga looked offside to the naked eye but these days officials are told to wait.The logic is that it is better to allow a move to play out and leave it to VAR to verify whether someone has strayed offside. The thinking is sound at a superficial level: in theory the law, brought in for the 2020-21 season, guards against goals being chalked off when someone was half a yard onside, rewarding attacking play, and means that nobody can complain about the unknown consequences of moves being brought to a premature halt by an incorrect offside flag.But the sweeping application of the law opens up officials to accusations that the fear of making a mistake has become too great. It seems that the smooth running of VAR, which looks increasingly impossible in a sport as dynamic as football, is a bigger priority than player safety and the quality of the spectacle.Few things about the modern game are more frustrating than watching play continue even when the offside is clear and obvious. The effect is artificial, a kind of non-football being allowed to unfold while an attack develops in hesitant fashion. I shared Pep Guardiola’s irritation when he erupted on the touchline after such an incident duringManchester City’s win against Chelsea last August.Everyone inside Stamford Bridge could see that Nicolas Jackson had mistimed his run. So much energy was wasted. The crowd’s excitement at Chelsea scoring wasn’t real. City’s defenders should not have been made to scramble back to keep the ball out of their net. Jackson’s teammates should not have been sprinting forward to support him.View image in fullscreenThe moment the ball is played, with Anthony Elanga (left) clearly offside.Photograph: BBC SportView image in fullscreenAn arm goes up for offside.Photograph: BBC SportView image in fullscreenElanga makes a run on to the ball.Photograph: BBC SportTaiwo Awoniyi clatters into the post after attempting to meet Elanga’s cross under pressure from Facundo Buonanotte.Photograph: BBC SportThere is a feeling within the game that this application of the offside law has contributed to the rise in hamstring injuries in the Premier League. It is not ideal that defenders playing in high lines are repeatedly having to turn and set off on a series of unnecessary explosive runs. Defenders, managers and fans have every reason to complain when the flag eventually goes up.Awoniyi is not the first to suffer. City’s Ederson and John Stones picked up injuries in similar circumstances last season. There should have been a reaction. Footballers are taught to play to the whistle. It does not matter if a defender knows that the attacker has been caught offside. There is no option but to play on if the flag stays down. There is always a chance of the offside trap malfunctioning and the goal being allowed to stand. But the uncertainty helps no one. Elanga was clearly offside. Play continued and Leicester’s Facundo Buonanotte had to track back to help out. Buonanotte was involved in the challenge that led to Awoniyi’s injury.It is the latest example of how the desire to use VAR to turn refereeing into a precise science is causing more problems than it solves. At the 2018 World Cup, when the technology was first used at a major tournament, the protocol was for assistant referees to keep the flag down for tight offsides. That makes sense. Some offsides are impossibly difficult to call. Leaving aside whether chalking off a goal for a toenail offside is in alignment with the original spirit of the law, as long as VAR exists there is a benefit to letting some moves play out before taking a closer look at a replay.Yet football is a game of collisions and fast movements. Its appeal lies in its imperfect lines, its shades of grey. We need to be mature enough to accept that human error is part of the game. It is time to be more flexible and allow assistant referees to raise the flag if they think they have seen a clear offside. And if that leads to teams missing out on goals that might have been? Better to have that than the constant stoppages and the increased risk of injury. Football is supposed to be fluid and chaotic. Attempting to turn it into an exact science, all clean and clinical, is out of touch. Awoniyi’s injury is a reminder of the sport’s ability to ruin even the best-laid plans.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestLeicester CityRefereesVideo assistant referees (VARs)Laws of footballcommentShareReuse this content"

The day before, Carlo Ancelotti had talked about the many wonderful comebacks over his years atReal Madrid, moments he said would never be forgotten, and now here in his penultimate game in this stadium was another, 20-year-old centre-back Jacobo Ramón scoring with the last touch of the game to defeat Real Mallorca and keep the league title alive for another day at least.It came late, very late on a grey, wet Wednesday night in front of perhaps 30,000 empty seats, with a manager whose departure was announced two days earlier and a dozen players missing. Ultimately it may not matter and it arrived at the end of an evening that had often felt empty. Yet now it was full of noise, it meant the world to Ramón and for a moment everyone could just go wild, the defender’s strike in the 95th minute and Kylian Mbappé’s goal a quarter of an hour earlier overturning Martin Valjent’s 11th-minute opener.Ten transfer targets for Premier League clubs from across EuropeRead moreThat leaves Madrid four points behind Barcelona, with two games to play and Barça with three. While Ancelotti insisted “anything can happen in football” the reality is that it also leaves them more or less where they were, waiting for the end after the league was effectively concluded whenBarcelona won Sunday’sclásico. If Barcelona win against Espanyol on Thursday night the end will come within 24 little hours; if not, Hansi Flick’s side would still have two more chances to get three more points.The statements will follow immediately. Madrid will at last officially announce what the Brazilian Football Confederation already has: thatAncelotti is the leaving for theSeleção. Then they will confirm another open secret: that Xabi Alonso is his replacement. And then attention will turn elsewhere, or it would do if it hadn’t already. All of which made this a strange occasion that at times felt like what it was: a game too far, hearts no longer in it. One where there were still tickets on sale at kick-off for the first time this season, hope abandoned.Those that came were rewarded eventually; there had been grumbles, some timid whistles, frustration, but there ended up being a rebellion, pride, Madrid racking up 39 shots, and a final explosion. An unexpected hero, too. A pair of them in fact.View image in fullscreenKylian Mbappé (left) celebrates his equaliser for Real Madrid by high-fiving Jacobo Ramón, who would go on to score the winner.Photograph: Susana Vera/ReutersOther, more familiar names missed out. Dani Carvajal, Éder Militão and David Alaba have missed much of the season. Antonio Rüdiger, suspended after throwing ice at the referee in theCopa del Rey final defeatby Barcelona, had surgery. Eduardo Camavinga had torn a muscle. And then came what you could be forgiven for thinking was an outbreak ofseason’s-over-itis. Lucas Vázquez and Vinícius Júnior were injured in theclásico. Rodrygo walked out for training on Tuesday morning and then walked back in again. On the morning of this game, Andriy Lunin pulled out. In the afternoon, so too did Brahim Díaz. Aurélien Tchouaméni was suspended.Madrid were left with 10 first-team players and one of those is the strange case of Jesús Vallejo, the footballer who had been on the bench for 43 games and on the pitch for one, disastrous, 10-minute cameo. Here, he got on again and provided the assist at death – the first of his entire career.Quick GuideBologna win first major trophy for 51 yearsShowDan Ndoye's second-half strike earned Bologna a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Milan in the Coppa Italia final on Wednesday to secure their first major trophy in 51 years.Bologna got the breakthrough eight minutes after the restart when Milan defender Théo Hernandez's well-timed tackle on Riccardo Orsolini sent the ball rolling to an unmarked Ndoye, who calmly slotted it home from close range.The victory earned Bologna their first piece of major silverware since they won the same competition in 1974 and secured qualification for next season's Europa League.The match was a thrilling replay of Friday's Serie A encounter, where Milan triumphed with a dominant 3-1 victory on home turf.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.No one could ever have imagined that, although the night could have started well when Arda Guler sent Endrick running right through the middle after just two minutes, only to be denied by Leo Román, making the first of a dozen stops. ButMallorcatook the lead on 11 minutes. Dani Ceballos was unable to cut out a pass from Mateu Morey on the right and Valjent swung his left foot to send the ball past Thibaut Courtois.Madrid’s reaction was timid at first but gathered pace, the shot count rising and Román providing to be a formidable barrier. He made saves from Jude Bellingham, Luka Modric, Mbappé and Fede Valverde in the first half and carried on the same way in the second, resisting until the 68th minute, when Mbappé escaped Morey and Valjent with a combination of elegance and strength and hit a superb near-post finish to put Madrid level with his 28th league goal, his 40th in all competitions.The hosts kept coming, an occasion made of this. Román kept saving, Valjent cleared one off the line, Gonzalo García missed a clear chance at the far post and then there was Ramón to complete one lastremontadafor old times’ sake.Explore more on these topicsLa LigaReal MadridMallorcaEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I have a clear idea what to do. I understand the problems of the team. I am far from quitting.“What I am saying is we need to perform and this season and in the future we need to perform or else they [the executive] will change us. That is a normal thing. That was my feeling [after West Ham] and is still my feeling today.”United face Tottenhamin next Wednesday’s final and Amorim has paid for 30 of his backroom staff to take their families to the showpiece at Athletic Bilbao’s San Mamés Stadium after learning that the club will not pay for them. He explained this was related to Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting. This has included the club’s largest minority shareholder making up to 450 redundancies when the last round is executed.“The situation is simple,” Amorim said. “People are leaving, a lot of change in the staff. It is complicated for the club to start giving to other members of staff so it is a really hard position. That situation was explained and in that moment my reaction was to help. It is not going to change my life.”If Spurs are beaten, United will qualify for next season’s Champions League. But Amorim admits this has him torn as the team will have less time to train, yet if they lose and do not have Champions League football and the results remain bad this will increase the pressure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Spurs have confirmed the setback, which came after Ange Postecoglou raised fears on Monday about the attacking midfielder’s involvement in the final.Kulusevski was forced off in the 19th minute of the Premier League homedefeat by Crystal Palaceon Sunday, and Postecoglou said the player was still sore 24 hours later and everybody had their fingers crossed for him.The 25-year-old’s absence against United is a significant blow given his fine form for much of the season and how Postecoglou is without his other main option for the No 10 role, James Maddison, who also has a knee injury. The manager has said previously that another midfielder, Lucas Bergvall, is likely to be out for the rest of the season with an ankle issue.Postecoglou’s remaining options in midfield are Rodrigo Bentancur, Yves Bissouma, Pape Sarr and Archie Gray.Kulusevski, Spurs’ standout player over the first half of the season, missed a little more than six weeks after hurting an ankle at the end of February.

This is St Martin’s AC, a quintessential community club hidden down the narrowest of side roads on the island of Guernsey. Hanging proudly in a frame above the club’s bar is a No 4 shirt bearing the name: “Le Tiss”.Asthe Manchester United captainenters her old clubhouse to greet former teammates, they immediately exchange banter. Maya Le Tissier is back home among those who saw her grow up from a toddler kicking a ball around to a 23-year-old who will, on Sunday, lead her team out at Wembley.WSL 2024-25 season review: our writers’ best and worstRead more“I owe everything to the island and my support network,” Le Tissier says, looking out across the St Martin’s pitch where she used to play in a hugely talented midfield alongside the Bournemouth men’s player Alex Scott. “It’s not quite Old Trafford, but coming here is just as special.”The match that changed her life was not actually played on the island; it came at Southampton’s training centre in Marchwood. It was a game she was not originally meant to play. A 10-year-old Le Tissier had accompanied her dad to watch his boys’ academy side face Southampton.“She came on the trip with her boots in her bag, carrying the drinks for the lads. We had about four injuries so we were down a player and Maya said: ‘Can I go on and play?’ and we said: ‘Yes, of course,’” recalls Rob Jones, a family friend and former coach of Le Tissier. “At the end of the game, the Southampton coaches said: ‘Who is that girl? She’s amazing.’ From that moment she sort of had an epiphany, realising how good she was.”Jones is speaking in the cafe at Guernsey’s immaculate, newly built stadium, Victoria Park, where he is the stadium director, and where Le Tissier is helping out with a youth session before making the youngsters’ days with signed balls and selfies. She is greeted like a big celebrity. Some of the youngsters had been on the same flight as her the night before, having gone to watch her play at Old Trafford in the Manchester derby. When she was their age, though, she was in a boys’ team.View image in fullscreenLe Tissier has a close connection with St Martins AC, where she cut her teeth as a player.Photograph: Ben Fiore/The Guardian“In Guernsey football, there was no pathway for girls at the time, 12, 13 years ago,” Jones says. “There was girls’ kickaround stuff on Sunday mornings but she was far too good for that. Playing with the boys is where she got her steel, determination and willpower. She read the game really well and, physically, she was stronger than the lads at 11, 12. She was not afraid to get stuck in.”With a population of around 64,000, in Guernsey, footballers who “make it” are rare. Tell a taxi driver you are here to interview a footballer and they ask: “Maya or Matt?” The Lionesses defender is not a direct relation to the former Southampton forward. The surname Le Tissier, deriving from the old French word for weaver, is common here.To call the island peaceful would be an understatement. Cars are often left unlocked. On the day of our visit, the worst offence reported in the local newspaper was a man urinating in public. With its charming coves, it is easy to see why Le Tissier loves to return, training at St Martins AC to keep fit when she is home for Christmas.She was coached by her dad, Darren, from the age of four, enjoying huge success alongside Scott – who was a year younger but so skilful he was playing up an age group – but she would eventually leave the island to pursue her career, a decision she says was “easy”.“That’s all I wanted to do. I think my family found it hard, with me leaving at quite a young age, but hopefully they can see that it all played out well. I wanted to create a pathway, because no one had ever done it before me in the women’s game from Guernsey, to show people they can break through.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Later the same year, still aged 16, she made her senior debut. Her proud dad, who can still recall the Rudimental and Jess Glynne songs that were playing in the car as he and Maya drove to Brighton to look around the facilities, recalls: “Hope [Powell] and Amy [Merricks] were just so good for Maya. Maya would swallow every bit of information she was given. Hope used to say: ‘You’ve got to push yourself, there’s no point swimming in a comfy lane.’ We were so grateful for Brighton.”Remarkably, since cementing her place in Brighton’s team in the 2020-21 campaign, she has started every WSL match for five consecutive seasons, the first two of those at Brighton and the past three at Manchester United. Further still, she has played every minute of the past two league campaigns. The secret is her dedication to keeping fit and Darren says: “Maya’s different. She sacrifices absolutely everything to ensure she’s 100%. She realises that your career is short. She’s very happy-go-lucky off the pitch but, when it comes to football on the pitch, she’s just steely and determined to win and nothing gets in the way of that.”View image in fullscreenLe Tissier takes a quiet moment to herself ahead of the Women’s FA Cup final on Sunday.Photograph: Ben Fiore/The GuardianThis season, having turned 23 in April, she has worn the captain’s armband. Gabby George, her fellow United defender, says Le Tissier is “everything we would want from a captain”. Accepting the captaincy is something Le Tissier admits took careful thought, given her age. “I was honoured. It’s not something that I thought would ever come, with Zel [Katie Zelem] leaving. I had a real, big think about whether I wanted to do it. It’s not something I would ever take lightly. It’s a big thing. I had a coffee with Marc [Skinner, the United manager] to speak about it and I spoke to my family and thought: ‘Yes’. I’ve definitely had to develop my leadership qualities, mostly off the pitch, as a leader, [but] I’ve really enjoyed it.”We move to Icart Point, a clifftop with beautiful sea views and one of her favourite dog-walking spots, 24 hours after she and George had helped United clinch Women’s Champions League qualification bycoming from 2-0 down to draw with Manchester City. A beaming Le Tissier says: “To come back from two down at Old Trafford, with so much on the line, it just shows how strong we are now – we might not have the most experienced team but our mentality is so strong.”Next, attention turns to Wembley, where they will contest the Cup final for a third consecutive year, this time as holders, afterlast year’s 4-0 win over Tottenham. “That was honestly like the best day of my life,” Le Tissier says. “We knew there were probably quite a few players who were going to leave so to be able to do it with that team … [she pauses to smile] and also the year before we’d lost to Chelsea, so we knew how badly that hurt. [Winning] 4-0, it was sunny, all my family were there, it was just a sick day.”For Sunday’s showdown with Chelsea, about 30 of her family and friends will be there and – by the sounds of it – the flights from Guernsey will be jam-packed with people heading to watch the island’s favourite daughter. Whether she lifts the Cup or not, she has already won this island’s heart.Explore more on these topicsManchester United WomenWomen's footballWomen's Super LeagueinterviewsShareReuse this content"

He also had the first opening of the second half as he raced on to a through-ball but saw his attempted lob palmed over by Addai.Driven forward by the energetic Ollie Norwood, Stockport battled on and were rewarded for their persistence when Olaofe flicked them level. Keeley looked to have Diamond’s initial strike covered but the keeper was wrong-footed by Olaofe’s clever backheel.Olaofe should have settled the contest in stoppage time but failed to hit the target after charging into the area.Stockport had the better of the chances in extra time but Horsfall’s glancing header was pushed away. Keeley then produced a stunning save to keep out a low shot from Horsfall and Bailey thought he had snatched victory in the dying moments only for his effort to strike the post.Orient punished the hosts with four perfect penalties and will face Charlton or Wycombe at Wembley.Explore more on these topicsLeague OneStockportLeyton Orientmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A deal had been agreed for several weeks and has now been ratified by the EFL.The US-based Couhig has been named chair and his business partner Todd Trosclair has also joined the board. Couhig tried to buy Reading last year but the deal collapsed in September 2024.Reading have been bought by Redwood Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of Dogwood Football LLC, which is owned by Couhig and Trosclair. “Redwood is ambitious and dedicated towards the club returning to its rightful place within the English football pyramid, while adhering to clear principles of honesty, transparency and financial sustainability,” a club statement said.Reading have been docked 18 points across the past three seasons, a period in which the club have also been under a series of embargoes for defaulted payments.

The decision comes after Ben Sulayem, who is set to stand for re-election in December, had intimated he was to do so last month and after the governing body and its president had been at odds with the drivers over the issue since the Singapore GP in 2024 when Verstappen waspunished for using bad languagein an FIA press conference.Before Singapore Ben Sulayem had made his position clear, stating he did not want drivers to swear, comparing it unfavourably to rap artists; a commentLewis Hamilton dismissedas being influenced by a racial bias and stereotyping. The Grand Prix Drivers’ Association reacted byissuing a public statementto the FIA demanding they stop treating drivers like children and to know where the money from the fines was being spent, to which the FIA did not respond.More recently George Russell, a director of the GPDA, stated they wanted actions not words from the FIA on the matter and reiterated that the GPDA had still had no contact on the subject from the governing body. The standoff appears to be finally nearing some form of rapprochement, although there has yet to be any comment from the drivers, who will likely address it this weekend at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix in Imola.View image in fullscreenGeorge Russell had demanded actions not words from the FIA.Photograph: Jakub Porzycki/ReutersThe FIA said on Wednesday that the base maximum penalty has been reduced from €10,000 (£8,423) to €5,000, while stewards will have the option to fully suspend a penalty if it is the first offence by a driver or a team. Previously F1 drivers, who were subject to multipliers from the base level, were in line for an escalating scale of fines opening at €40,000 (£33,700) and with the more consequential sporting threat of a ban, which has also been dropped, with the caveat of the potential for a “serious penalty” for “very serious offences”.Crucially, stewards will also be given more discretion on deciding penalties. They will be able to differentiate between “controlled” and “non-controlled environments”, with the latter being the competition on track or on a rally stage, where drivers have long been clear they express themselves in the heat of the moment and that the sport is unusual in having competitors’ comments broadcast live while they are in action.Garry Connelly, F1’s stewards chief, claimed the changes would give stewards guidance to “differentiate between on and off-track issues”. Ronan Morgan, president of the drivers’ committee, said: “Drivers are looked up to as role models by young fans and are rightly seen as ambassadors for the wider world of motor sport.“How they act really does matter but it is important to recognise that there is a difference between what is said during a race and in a press conference.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mitigating circumstances will also be considered while the abuse of officials, which is exceptionally rare in F1, will now result in sporting penalties instead of fines.“As a former rally driver, I know first-hand the range of emotions that are faced during competition,” said Ben Sulayem, “I have led an extensive and collaborative review with contributions from across the seven FIA world championships, FIA member clubs and other motor sports organisations.“The improvements the FIA has announced today to appendix B will ensure we continue to promote the best of sportsmanship in motor sport, while also giving stewards effective guidelines to act against individuals who may bring the sport into disrepute.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Simple as that.”Davie is facing calls to sack Lineker from his future BBC engagements for reposting the material, which was titled “Zionism explained in less than 2 mins” and originally sent from the Palestine Lobby account.“On Instagram I reposted material which I have since learned contained offensive references,” Lineker said in a statement. “I very much regret these references. I would never knowingly share anything antisemitic. It goes against everything I believe in.“Whilst I strongly believe in the importance of speaking out on humanitarian issues, including the tragedy unfolding in Gaza, I also know that how we do so matters. I take full responsibility for this mistake. That image does not reflect my views. It was an error on my part for which I apologise unreservedly.”Lineker’s use of social media has created controversy for the BBC for some time. When he was temporarily suspended in March 2023 after criticising the then government’s immigration policies, many of his BBC colleagues protested against the decision.It was announced last November that Lineker, who co-owns the successful Goalhanger Productions podcast company, would be stepping down from presenting Match of the Day but would continue to host World Cup and FA Cup coverage.The BBC’s former director of television, Danny Cohen, who had criticised Lineker’s post, questioned the delay to the pundit’s apology.“On a day on which director general Tim Davie has talked of a ‘trust crisis’, the time has come for the BBC to finally take decisive action to restore its trust with the Jewish community and consider whether Lineker should remain as a presenter on the BBC, including his role as the main host of its World Cup coverage next year,” he said.“If this had occurred in the context of any other minority community I feel certain that action would be taken by the BBC.”Explore more on these topicsGary LinekerBBCAntisemitismIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

I suffered a lot. This was a really tough one,” Pedersen said.The favourite Primoz Roglic (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) hit the front with just over 2km to the finish, but while Pedersen initially struggled, the Slovenian was unable to shake off the chasing pack.Casper van Uden claims Giro d’Italia stage four on all-Dutch podium in LecceRead moreOnce again, Pedersen’s teammate Mathias Vacek gave him the perfect lead out, and after his Czech colleague dropped off the front, Pedersen went early and his gamble paid off, despite Zambanini almost catching him on the line.“Over the top of the last climb I was a bit behind. I was still in the group fighting for the win but I had a very hard time there,” Pedersen said. “I used a lot of energy to move back on to Vacek’s wheel. Luckily I had enough for the last sprint.”Pedersen has committed his future to Lidl-Trek, with the 29-year-old announcing on Wednesday that he will remain with the team for the rest of his career. The 10-second bonus for the win stretched Pedersen’s lead to 17 seconds over Roglic, with Vacek a further seven seconds back in third before Thursday’s stage six, a 227km ride from Potenza to Naples.Explore more on these topicsGiro d'ItaliaCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

Alcaraz did not merely intend to win, as he does in every match, he desperately wanted to exact his revenge on an opponent who has positioned himself as one of his biggest challengers.Alcaraz achieved those aims with ruthless efficiency, piecing together some of his best tennis of the season at the end of two tough sets to stop the fifth seed Draper’s excellent run and reach the semi-finals of the Italian Open with a 6-4, 6-4 win.The first four months of this season have presented numerous difficulties for Alcaraz, the third seed in Rome, particularly as the sport has looked towards him in the absence of Jannik Sinner. This excellent performance was further evidence that the 22‑year‑old,a champion in Monte Carloat the beginning of the clay season, is finding his best level again. “It probably was one of the most complete matches that I played this year,” Alcaraz said.From early positivity to cursing on court: how the Djokovic-Murray partnership ended | Tumaini CarayolRead moreFor Draper, who fought hard until the end but struggled with his composure in crucial moments, the defeat closes out another great tournament that will be invaluable in the 23‑year‑old Briton’s development as a top player and a clay-court contender. Still, he was bitterly frustrated with his level and mental composure in the match.“I’m very disappointed with the way I performed,” he said. “I think from a mental and emotional point of view, obviously you could say: ‘That’s normal, you had a tough four weeks now.’ But I don’t want to be normal. I want to be right up there. It hurts a lot, this kind of loss.”Two months ago Alcaraz and Draper faced each other in the Indian Wells semi‑finals;a tense, turbulent matchthat Draper won en route to his first career ATP Masters 1000 title. Alcaraz’s state of mind going into the match was in some ways even more surprising than the actual result. He later admitted that he had been enduring suffocating nerves because of the challenge Draper presented.“I remember Indian Wells was really difficult for me, the whole day before the match dealing with the nerves,” Alcaraz said. “It was really stressful. Today I approached the match in a different way, which I’m really proud about. I just tried to show my best tennis from the first point until the last point.”Up against by far the toughest clay-court opponent of his career in the reigning French Open and Monte Carlo champion, Draper started well and took a 4-2 lead after a loose service game from Alcaraz. But Alcaraz responded immediately with a fine return game, which freed him up. He ended the set in supreme form, opening up his vast toolbox of shots as he dominated the baseline with his spectacular forehand, peppered the Briton with well-measured drop shots and closed down the net confidently.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz celebrates after winning his quarter-final match against Britain’s Jack Draper.Photograph: Yves Herman/ReutersAlthough Alcaraz was brilliant – his forehand was sublime in the decisive moments – Draper’s disappointment was understandable. At the end of two competitive sets, after particularly generating numerous opportunities in set two, he lost his composure and focus when he most needed it, allowing Alcaraz to bulldoze him at the end of both sets. As he reflected on his performance, Draper said that he feels the pain of defeats even more now that he understands his capabilities.“As I’ve got better, it hurts more because I know I can do so well. For instance today, I feel like I’m much better than that from a lot of standards, just from a mental and emotional side of the match. At the same time that’s what the best players in the world do, they make you feel like that.”The high standards Draper demands from himself are precisely what will drive him to even greater heights, but with time and distance from this result he should also be able to reflect on the significance of this breakthrough. He arrived in the clay-court season simply trying to find his feet on the surface and he has played top‑level tennis, following up his Madrid final with a Rome quarter-final.As a result, Draper will head to Paris next week for the French Open as a top-five player at a grand slam tournament for the first time in his career and he has shown to himself and the entire tour that he is capable of deep runs on all surfaces. There will also be plenty more opportunities in the future for him to execute the revenge he now seeks.“Carlos was the better player,” he said. “I have to accept that, go back to the drawing board, really prepare well for the French Open and know that I’m hopefully going to have many more chances against these great players.”Explore more on these topicsTennisCarlos AlcarazJack DrapernewsShareReuse this content"

Sound familiar?Graham RuthvenWed 14 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 07.58 EDTShareInter Miami are used to having a target on their back by now, but no opponent has hit them harder than Minnesota United did on Saturday in a 4-1 rout. As if inflicting Lionel Messi’s heaviest-ever defeat in Major League Soccer wasn’t enough, the Loons took the opportunity to rub it in on social media, labelling South Florida’s Galacticos a “Pink Phony Club” –a jibe that irked David Beckham.Beckham’s frustration, along with everyone else’s at Inter Miami, has built over a number of weeks. The Herons are experiencing an early-season reckoning. Their Concacaf Champions Cup challengewas ended by a rampant Vancouver Whitecapswho ran up a 5-1 aggregate scoreline to make the final despite Inter Miami making the competition a big priority.At least Vancouver are good – they currently lead the MLS standings. FC Dallas are a middling side in the Western Conference, yet they still put four pastInter Miamiat the end of April. Inter Miami have developed a bad habit for conceding goals. Lots of them.León out of Club World Cup after losing appeal; LAFC and América set for playoffRead moreMessi might be feeling a sense of deja vu. This isn’t the first top-heavy, structurally unsound team of superstars he has played for. Indeed, the more matches Inter Miami play this season, the more they look like the Paris Saint-Germain side that had Messi for two seasons. They had many of the same problems.Like Inter Miami, PSG struggled to balance their best-in-class forward line with the rest of the team. Messi, Kylian Mbappé and Neymar were capable of incredible moments, but PSG’s lack of structure through the midfield and into the defence cost them in the biggest matches. A similar pattern is emerging for Inter Miami who have struck out on everyMLSCup and CONCACAF Champions League they have gone for with Messi, Luis Suárez, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets in the team.Mascherano has attempted to balance his midfield by deploying Yannick Bright as a destroyer in the centre of the pitch. The Italian product of the college soccer system ranks highly for tackles, interceptions, blocks … all the dirty work Messi and Co aren’t willing or able to do. Too often, though, it’s Busquets tracking opposition runs in behind a defensive line that falls apart far too easily. At 36 years old, this isn’t the former Barcelona anchor’s game.Going into the off-season after the shocking playoff loss to Atlanta United, it was clear Inter Miami needed more recovery pace in defence. They also required more physicality at the back. Maxi Falcón and Gonzalo Luján arrived and have addressed those issues to a degree, but it has still proved too easy for opponents to find space in behind in quick transition. There is a disconnect between the midfield and defensive units.View image in fullscreenLionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappé couldn’t lead PSG to a coveted Champions League title.Photograph: Matthieu Mirville/DPPI/ShutterstockA lot of Inter Miami’s problems go beyond tactics, though. It wasn’t tactics that caused right back Marcelo Weigandt to bizarrely head a cross into his own net against Minnesota. Nor was it the reason Jordi Alba inexplicably vacated his position to chase a ball in the corner, leaving Bongokuhle Hlongwane free to open the scoring in the same game. Inter Miami just haven’t been tuned in for many of their recent matches, just like the back linefalling asleepdoomed them against Atlanta United in last year’s season-ender.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They went eight games without losing, a streak that peaked with an impressive away win over the Columbus Crew. At that point, Mascherano looked to have forged a team that could grind out results as well as blow away opponents.Since then, some fundamental flaws have been exposed. Vancouver overloaded Inter Miami in central areas to force them wide and starve their best players of possession. Without a natural winger, the Floridians were stunted in the final third. Minnesota moved the ball quickly and directly to put Inter Miami’s defenders under pressure as frequently as possible. They couldn’t cope.Most expect Inter Miami to make moves in the summer. Kevin De Bruynehas been linked. Ángel Di María’s name regularly surfaces in the gossip column. The transfer market could offer a solution or two to Inter Miami’s problems, but not before the Club World Cup when Messi and Co will be the tournament’s opening act. With the world watching, the pressure will be on to perform.Inter Miami might still have the star quality to be in Supporters’ Shield contention. They are only four points off the top of the Eastern Conference. It wasn’t until the summer that the Herons truly hit their stride last year. In fact, Inter Miami have won more games this season than they had at the same stage of last season when they would go on to set a regular season points record.However, 2025 for Inter Miami won’t be defined by what happens in the regular season. Instead it’ll be judged on the trophies they win, and another Leagues Cup won’t be enough. Messi never won the Champions League as a PSG player and he may never win MLS Cup or the Concacaf Champions Cup in pink either.

Wrapped in an “ultra-hard, 30X, cold-rolled stainless steel exoskeleton”, the Cybertruck was touted as the ultimate doomsday chariot – avirtually indestructible, obtuse-angled, electrically powered behemoth that can repel handgun fire and outrun a Porsche whiletowinga Porsche, with enough juice leftover to power your house in the event of a blackout. At the launch,Tesla’s CEO,Elon Musk, said the truck could tackle any terrain on Earthand possibly also on Mars – and all for the low, low base price of $40,000. “Sometimes you get these late-civilization vibes [that the] apocalypse could come along at any moment,” Musk said. “Here at Tesla, we have the best in apocalypse technology.”Six years on, Covid and Musk’s political alignment withDonald Trumphave kicked upthe apocalypse vibes, and Tesla’s good sense has only become more questionable as the Cybertruck has been reduced to an object of universal scorn and derision further raising a host of questions: is the Cybertruck even a decent doomsday chariot? Could it reallysurvive end times? Will it survive Musk himself? “There’s no doubt it’s a heavy-duty vehicle that can take some punishment, even from small arms fire,” says Arthur Bradley, a prepping expert who oversees the building of satellite systems at Nasa’s Langley research center in Virginia. “But you can’t weigh the pros without also asking: ‘Are people shooting at me because they think I’m an idiot or a bad guy, or they don’t support my political views – or they don’t support me supporting this company?’”View image in fullscreenElon Musk introduces the Cybertruck at Tesla’s design studio in Hawthorne, California, on 21 November 2019. The windows were broken during a demonstration intended to show the strength of the glass.Photograph: Ringo HW Chiu/APPost-armageddon transport has a simple but specific brief: be tough, durable and drive through anything – and no vehicle ticks those boxes more reliably than trucks. Fictional concepts such as Mad Max’s tanker-based War Rig are often the inspiration for real-world creations like Ford’s custom-built F650 Supertruck, a tractor-trailer sized monstrosity that can carry 120 gallons of fuel, tow 30,000lb, and be reinforced with bulletproof armor. The truck is how insurgent fightersget around war zonesand what storm chasers use torun down tornadoes. “They’re certainly pretty good for prepping purposes,” says Sean Gold, a former air force emergency manager who has worked in the prepping industry for nearly a decade. “They’re large, off-road-capable, able to get off roads that might be congested – that sort of thing.”I have never physically felt the air leave a room in the way that it did when the Cybertruck rolled out on stageSimone Giertz, DIY robotics inventorThe Cybertruck, however, broke from a century’s worth of truck-building orthodoxy, eschewing the typical three-box layout for a wedge-shaped silhouette that took inspiration from the movie Blade Runner and cyberpunk motifs. It mocked the F-150, the US’s top-selling vehicle for the last 47 years, asprehistoric tech. On its website, Tesla featured imaginative images of the Cybertruck crawling around Mars. Few knew what to make of it. Simone Giertz, a DIY robotics inventor whobuilt a Tesla truckon her popular YouTube channel, was among a select group invited to Tesla’s Hawthorne, California, studio for the Cybertruck unveiling. “I have never physically felt the air leave a room in the way that it did when the Cybertruck rolled out on stage,” she recalls. “People were so confused.”Since Musk’s hard-right turn, however, the Cybertruck’s design has gone from aesthetically polarizing to politically so. A recentSlate articlenods at the truck’s uncanny resemblance to the Casspir, the apartheid-era military transport that patrolled South African townships inMusk’s boyhood. “As violence and flames engulfed the streets of the nation, Black South African children drew and wrote about the apartheid security forces and its tools – dogs and Casspirs – chasing and shooting at them in their schools, streets, and homes,” the article says. “By the 1990s, the Casspir had become an iconic global symbol of apartheid oppression.”View image in fullscreenCasspirs, armored personnel carriers used by South Africa’s army and police, patrol the streets of a township before the nation’s first democratic election in 1994.Photograph: Peter Turnley/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesIt’s no surprise then that the Cybertruck would become a status symbol for security forces. One California police department spent $153,000 on a Cybertruck for “community outreach efforts” (though it didn’t rule out using it to “respond to emergencies” as needed), and a Chechen warlord showed offa machine-gun mounted Cybertruckhe claimed was purpose-built to help his army fight alongside Russia in the Ukraine war. “I am sure that this ‘beast’ will bring a lot of benefit to our fighters,” Ramzan Kadyrov said while heaping praise on “the respected Elon Musk”, who has denied making the vehicle for Kadyrov. Ultimately, the Cybertruck had to be towed from the battlefield after randomly shutting down on Chechen forces, and Kadyrov accused Musk of switching it off remotely –a nagging concernamong Tesla owners.In Tesla’s early days, the catastrophe thinking was small – a “bioweapon defense mode” button on each vehicle’s climate control, something Musk reckoned might come in handy “if there’s ever an apocalyptic scenario of some kind”. But even as Musk’s winking references to the apocalypse manifested into a bulletproof rig made of stainless steel, there was no denying that he may have been right to think the Cybertruck could be a hit with consumers. After the 2019 unveiling,Teslareceived about 2m preorders from customers plonking down $100 each. But in the end the enthusiasm wouldn’t last because Musk couldn’t keep his promises.The Cybertruck came to market two years too late, which was time that allowed Tesla’s rivals to get in the game; more Cybertruck reservation holders might have hung in there if Musk hadn’t marked the truck’s base price up to $99,000. Perhaps most detrimental for Tesla: the Cybertruck’s purported utility appeared to beworsethan advertised. The average truck is undergirded with a steel frame to handle the rigors of hauling and towing – but the Cybertruck’s underbody is made of aluminum, much lighter metal that can bendand even breakunder heavy strain. Stainless steel is also susceptible torust– which is to say the Cybertruck is an iffy proposition to survive regular winter, let alone nuclear winter.The internet teems with video of the Cybertruck spinning its wheels ina snowy parking space,on the beachand farther off the beaten path; meanwhile the Rivian R1T, a legitimately capable electric vehicle rival to the Cybertruck, was apparently no worse for wear after beingtossed around during Hurricane Helene. (“What a dream marketing opportunity for Rivian,” Giertz says. “Your truckactuallysurvived a natural disaster.”)Dan Neil, the Wall Street Journal’s Pulitzer prize-winning car critic,slid off a hillwhile test-driving the Cybertruck with his teenage daughter. “We took it on class three and class four trails, which it is technically capable of,” he says. “But it’s also 2ft wider than any trail at any national park could generally accommodate. That’s the part I don’t get. It’s definitely anon-roadcar.”View image in fullscreenPolice officers stand near a Cybertruck as people protest against a rally by Elon Musk, who is supporting a conservative state supreme court candidate, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on 30 March 2025.Photograph: Vincent Alban/ReutersThat makes the Cybertruck an even tougher sell to doomsday preppers – many of whom already had their doubts about the viability of EV technology during and after a major disaster, says Gold, the former air force manager. The Cybertruck’s 300ish-mile range in particular becomes a much riskier proposition when plugs stop working. “The beauty of EVs is you don’t have to hunt for fuel,” says Bradley, the Virginia-based prepping expert. “But the drawback is most people don’t have a large solar power generation system. If you get a little too far out, or run into a situation that causes you to use up your energy, you might not get back home.”Daisy Luther, a former automotive service manager who went into the prepping business after the 2008 financial collapse, wonders how anyone in the post-apocalypse would go about fixing a Cybertruck (which has already been recalledeighttimes) – especially in the event of an electromagnetic pulse or similar event. “I generally recommend that if someone is getting a vehicle to last them through some kind of apocalyptic situation that it have as few computer chips and electronics as possible,” says Luther, who drives an old Jeep. “I can do small repairs on something mechanical, but I can’t do anything that requires a computer flash or a satellite upgrade because I don’t have the equipment.”Last month I rented a Tesla Cybertruck to get a feel for it as a family vehicle and found it to be ill-equipped forthesetimes, let alone the end times. (And I say that as the owner of a Model Y, an exceedingly versatile family hauler that’s also massively fun to drive.) At over 6ft wide, 18ft long and 3.5 tons, the Cybertruck was a bear to maneuver around Atlanta’s narrow streets; its obtuse-angled shape made identifying traffic hazards through the car’s windows and mirrors a virtual impossibility. Even when I find myself considering the Cybertruck just for its potential as a standby home generator, I was soon reminded that Hyundai and Kia EVs offer similar capability for a fraction of the cost.I don’t think that [Doge] is the issue. Actually, it’s that people despise Elon Musk even more than they hate TrumpRoss Gerber, Tesla investorFor my toddler boys the Cybertruck is what the Lamborghini Countach was to me in my youth,the apogee of poster cars– but the truck isn’t what I would call kid-friendly. Mostly, it kept me worried about them gouging out an eye, losing a finger or getting static shock from touching the steel doors as they explored.“You’re driving a meme car!” Ezra Dyer, the Car and Driver columnist, helpfully reminds me. “You have to buy into the idea that it’s kind of funny,wink-wink.” When my wife asked if the children would be safe inside, I hesitated to tell her that Alijah Arenas – the highly regarded USC basketball recruit and son of former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas – had to be put into a coma after losing control of his Cybertruck andcrashing into a fire hydrant in Los Angeles. Suffice to say, had Alijah Arenas been driving a Rivian (the safest pickup on the roadfull stop) orTiger Woods’s 2009 Escalade, he would have been able to walk away from the accident; but somehow, bystanders managed to pry open the Cybertruck’s doors, which don’t have exterior handles (!), and pull him away from a fiery scene made scarier by the truck’stough to extinguish high-voltage battery– the last thing you’d want to deal with when the world’s already burning.View image in fullscreenA Cybertruck is parked with other Tesla vehicles on the south lawn driveway in front of the White House in Washington DC on 11 March 2025. Trump has said he will buy a Tesla to support the company and Elon Musk after recent calls for boycotts of Tesla products.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockUnlike modern cars, the Cybertruck was expresslynot designed to deform on impact– further ratcheting up the safety risks during and after a cataclysmic disaster. (This is also why Cybertrucks are banned in the UK, EU and China, the world’s largest EV market.) Gold, who drives a Model 3, could envision a bad actor hacking into the truck remotely or even Musk himself shutting them down out of spite as may or may not have been the case with the Chechen warlord. “I know it doesn’t really make sense [for him to do that],” Gold says, “but thepossibilityis concerning”.Then there’s Gold’s point: the Cybertruck is such a ripe target, it sticks out so much. Early on the Ford CEO, Jim Farley, dismissed it as the kind of status mobile you might find “parked in front of a hotel”. In its relatively short life, the Cybertruck has gone from being a status mobile for Kim Kardashian, Pharrell Williams and other tastemakers to the ultimate meme-mobile – a Maga hat on wheels. (SNL’s Colin Jost called it the answer to the question: “What if Kanyewas a car?”) When the truck isn’t being flipped off in traffic (although that wasn’t my experience driving it in Atlanta, asaturated Tesla market), it’s being used as aslate canvasforpolitical protestsagainst Musk. “I mean, I wouldn’t want to drive one around towntoday,” Bradley says.Read more from The Armageddon complex seriesWhy apocalypse-minded shoppers go to CostcoLefty preppers are taking a different approach to doomsdayThe rise of end times fascismThe irony of Tesla’s apocalypse machine is it couldn’t even overcome Musk’s worst nature, or even live up to the Earth-saving principles that Tesla used to espouse. “Maybe this explains it: he’s working really hard on bringing down civil society; maybe that was just to increase the market?” Giertz jokes. “It’s interesting because when the environmentalists turned on Elon, he immediately pivoted to another target group: the preppers who want to be self-sufficient. But at this point when civility is out the window and we are even more pissed at the guy who brought the apocalypse in, I’d rather be in a Toyota Prius than a Cybertruck.”On the company’s earnings call last month Musk vowed to step back from running the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to devote more time to Tesla amid speculation that he could bereplaced as CEO– but the catastrophe may be unsalvageable. “I don’t think that [Doge] is the issue,” Ross Gerber, a major Tesla investor, toldCNN. “Actually, it’s that people despise Elon Musk even more than they hate Trump. And that’s not something that he can solve at this point.”Despite being the world’s top selling EV pickup, Cybertruck sales are still so poor that the company doesn’t even bother reporting them – butrecord high inventoryandsteep depreciation curvesgive the game away. Quietly, Tesla shifted marketing strategies for the Cybertruck, pivoting away from the Martian imagery to more classic pickup truck iconography – but it’s too little, too late, and now just gaslighting the public. In recent months Tesla’s board chair made $198m unloading the company’s stock amid falling profits.Ford, Rivian and other competitors are fast gaining ground in the market. “It’s really interesting to see how far Tesla has fallen,” says Benoit. “At this point it’s beyond political.”If anything, the Cybertruck becoming the Titanic of cars is the fate weactuallyshould’ve prepared for. History tells us anytime a vehicle is touted as future-proof, it’s all but doomed to become a monument to unchecked hubris. “My guess is this incarnation of the Cybertruck has a very limited life,” Bradley says. “I think there will be another Cybertruck, but it will probably be more modern-looking – like a regular pickup truck.”"

The prominent position of a tech bigwig at the event underlined the importance of the sector to a government that has made growth a priority and believes the sector is crucial to achieving it.Top US tech firms have a big presence in the UK, including Google, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Palantir, the data intelligence firm co-founded by theMaga movement backer Peter Thiel.If a government wants growth, then it is hard to look beyond firms with a combined market value of many trillions of dollars.According to one former big-tech employee with knowledge of how the leading US companies further their interests in the UK, such heft brings immediate access.“We never had a problem walking the corridors of Whitehall because we could claim to create thousands of jobs and create millions for the economy. Governments love job announcements,” said the ex-employee.It is in this context thatPeter Kyle, the tech secretary, has met people from the tech sector nearly 70% more often than his predecessor, Michelle Donelan – at an average of more than one meeting every week. The list includes multiple meetings with Google, Amazon, Meta and Apple.UKAI, a trade body representing the UK’s artificial intelligence industry, says smaller players are being squeezed out as a consequence.“Our concerns is that there is a huge imbalance between a handful of global players who are able to influence directly what No 10 is thinking about on policy, and the thousands of other businesses that make up the AI industry across the UK,” says Tim Flagg, UKAI’s chief executive. “Our voice is not being heard, but the economic growth that the government seeks will come from these companies.”Echoing the former big-tech employee, Flagg adds that big tech firms have the resources allowing them to build and sustain political relationships, “getting them into the room and concentrating influence at a senior political level”.According to one source who has observed the industry’s interactions with the government, big tech companies also deployed those resources before the general election, allowing them to hit the ground running with established relationships after the Labour landslide.Another talks of the Tony Blair Institute’s “phenomenal” access to No 10. The thinktank is backed financially by the tech billionaire Larry Ellison and has been a prominent voice in thedebate over AI policyalthough it says it maintains “intellectual independence over our policy work”.For critics of the government’s interaction with big tech, itsattempts at reforming copyright laware an exemplar of an imbalanced relationship. Ministers have proposed letting AI companies use copyright-protected work without permission to build their products, unless those copyright holders “opt out” of the process in an as-yet undetermined manner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A campaign against the proposal has been backed by every leading light in the UK’s formidable creative industries, from Paul McCartney to Dua Lipa and Kazuo Ishiguro.If tech is the answer to the government’s economic growth problem, thenAI is a crucial element of that approachwith its promise of runaway improvements in productivity – a measure of economic efficiency. But the mooted copyright policy has been a PR disaster, if measured in celeb-powered headlines. The News Media Association, which represents news organisations including the Guardian, also opposes the proposal. Google and OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, have come out against the plans as well.A former government adviser who worked on tech policy says weakening copyright – which they describe as the “lowest hanging fruit” on a list of pro-tech policy options – isn’t the “magic answer” to winning the AI race anyway.“In taking this approach, government risks the worst of all worlds, which is devastating a sector where the UK is actually world-leading, while not actually taking the actions necessary to make the UK an AI superpower.”The department for science, innovation and technology makes “no apologies” for interacting with a sector that employs 2 million people in the UK, according to a spokesperson, adding that “regular engagement” with tech companies of all sizes is fundamental to delivering economic growth.In his conversation with Schmidt, Starmer said the key question around policies from now on would be “does this promote growth or does it not promote growth?”. The tech industry is at the core of this approach, but in terms of the copyright debate it has damaged important relationships elsewhere.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyLabourPeter KyleLobbyingTechnology sectoranalysisShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Much has been made of the fact that the year’s most recent breakout hit, an idiosyncratic role-playing game called Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, was made by a small team. (It has just sold its two-millionth copy). It’s a tempting narrative in this age ofblockbuster mega-flops,live-service gamesandeye-watering budgets: scrappy team makes a lengthy, unusual and beautiful thing, sells it for £40, and everybody wins. But it’s notquiteaccurate.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Sandfall Interactive, the game’s French developer, comprises around 30 people, butas Rock Paper Shotgun points out, there are many more listed in the game’s credits – from a Korean animation team to the outsourced quality assurance testers, and the localisation and performance staff who give the game and its story heft and emotional believability.Compared to the enormous teams who make the Final Fantasy games – a clear inspiration for Sandfall – Clair Obscur’s team is minuscule. The more interesting achievement isn’t that a small team has made a successful game – it’s that a small team has made the most extravagantly French thing any of us will ever play. Much to my partner’s annoyance, I’ve set the voice language to French with English subtitles, just to enhance the immersion.In Clair Obscur’s belle époque-inspired world, a sinister entity called the Paintress daubs a number on a distant totem every year, descending from 100 – and every person of that age dissolves heartbreakingly into petals and dust, leaving behind devastated partners and orphaned children. (This andNevaare the only games in recent memory to make me shed a tear at theirbeginning.) The game starts as the Paintress counts down from 34 to 33, and an expedition of brave and slightly magic thirtysomethings from the dwindling population sets out, as they do every year, to sail across to the Paintress’s continent and try to kill her and stop the cycle. I was sad to leave this opening area, because the city was so beautiful, and everyone wasimpeccablydressed. Also, nothing was trying to kill me every few minutes.View image in fullscreenThe most French thing you’ll ever play … Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.Photograph: Sandfall InteractiveMany expeditions have gone before. You find their grisly remnants all over the place as you explore, their recorded diaries left to help whoever comes next. You start off in a kind of ravaged Paris, the Eiffel Tower distorting towards a distant horizon like a Dalí painting. The game looks like a waltz through a distinguished art museum that’s about to get sucked into a black hole. One early area of the continent is a waterless ocean, the wrecked vessel of one expedition wrapped around a dead leviathan of a sea creature, fronts of seaweed waving in the nonexistent currents. It’s beautiful but extremely dangerous: you quickly have to get the hang of a pretty complicated combat system to survive even the first few boss fights.Clair Obscur’s fighting is inspired by classic and modern Japanese RPGs: rhythmic and flashy, it lets you supercharge a fireball or dodge the fist of a stone automaton with a well-timed button press. Combining your unusually distinctive characters’ abilities is the key. One of them wields a rapier and changes stance every attack, another attacks with an impenetrable system of sun and moon tarot cards, a third mostly with a gun and a sword. If this all sounds needlessly extravagant, it is – and I love it. The combat menus are a tinkerer’s dream, letting you pore over and combine characters’ esoteric powers and skills to create interesting combo attacks.What I enjoy most about this game is that it doesn’t look like everything else or, indeed, anything else. The majority of games riff on the same few predictable references: Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Marvel. Instead it draws from completely different aesthetic and thematic sources; this is a baroque fantasy that tells a story about fatalism and love and death and legacy, a European-style tale with Japanese-style action and flair. It plays very differently, but its distinctiveness and determination to actuallysaysomething with its story reminds me of last year’s excellentMetaphor: ReFantazio. (There is a strong correlation between intellectually ambitious RPGs and baffling titles, it seems.)Clair Obscur also illustrates just how good game development tools are now: if you’re wondering how a smallish team could create something that looks this high-end, that’s a large part of the answer. This makes me feel pretty optimistic about the future of this middle sector of game development, in between blockbuster and indie. In the 00s and 2010s, that was where many of the most interesting games could be found. I can imagine several large publishers deeming this game simply too French to be marketable, but Sandfall was able to make it anyway. Expedition 33 is an encouraging commercial success that will be cited all year as a counternarrative to the games industry’s prevailing doomsaying, but it’s a creative success, too.What to playView image in fullscreenA thrill a minute … Doom: The Dark Ages.Photograph: BethesdaA new Doom game is out very shortly and reviews suggest that it is a glorious heavy-metal orgy of violence. It has you massacring hordes of gross demons at once, impaling them with spikes, shredding them with a chainsaw-shield, even punching gigantic hellspawn from within a giant robot or shooting at them from the back of a mecha-dragon.Doom:The Dark Agesis slower than the other modern games in the series, with more up-close combat and (as the title suggests) a vaguely medieval flavour to its aesthetic, but it’s still thrill-a-minute.Available on:Xbox, PS5, PCEstimated playtime:20-plus hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenChaos machine … Grand Theft Auto VI.Photograph: Rockstar GamesGrand Theft Auto VI, which is delayed until next May, left a crater in the 2025 release schedule that other game companies are scrambling to fill, reports Bloomberg (viaKotaku).

That would surely be more interesting than simply arguing about whether the latestAssassin’s Creedis any good.I asked my partner what he’d call a video game book club, and he suggested Text Adventure, which is annoyingly better than anything I can think of. My pal Tom suggested Pile of Shame, One More Go and Shared Worlds.

You can play a whole international tournament in the Fifa titles, but what they never show is the way the competition seeps into the everyday lives of supporters, how whole towns are overtaken, how aWorld Cupcan become a national obsession. The way most of us experience the really big matches is through stolen moments of vicarious glory on televisions and giant pub screens, surrounded by friends and family and the sounds and images of real life.This is the territory of Despelote, a beautiful, utterly transportive game about childhood and memory, set during Ecuador’s historic 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign. Football-mad eight-year-old Julián – a semi-autobiographical version of the game’s co-designer Julián Cordero – has just watched the team beat Peru, but now four more matches stand betweenEcuadorand the World Cup finals in Japan and Korea. Structured as a series of short, immersive tableaux, Despelote gives us control of Julián as he goes about his life, buffeted by his parents and teachers between shopping trips, car journeys and school lessons.View image in fullscreenSomething of what it was like to be a kid … Despelote.Photograph: Panic GamesThe key scenes are where you are left alone, perhaps in a town square, or at a family get-together – and you experience something of what it was like to be a kid given crucial moments of freedom and agency. You listen in on adult conversations, watch an old man feeding pigeons, say hi to a shopkeeper, have a kickabout with friends – the world is depicted as a series of grainy photos, washed with single colours – a beautiful visual device replicating the haziness of our oldest memories, the background details indistinct behind the personal, emotional events.As the game goes on, depictions of Julián’s childhood merge and interchange with recollections of later teenage parties and responsibilities. We also learn about the sociopolitical background to the World Cup campaign: Ecuador is in the midst of a financial crisis, hyperinflation has bankrupted companies and gobbled up savings – in this context, the potential glory of footballing success becomes vital and talismanic. The tournament is discussed in the streets and at weddings, it permeates everything.But other aspects of Ecuadorian life and culture are drawn in too. You learn about the music, the food and the rebirth of the domestic film industry, via the 1999 crime film Ratas, ratones, rateros directed by Julián Cordero’s father, Sebastián Cordero. In this way, real life impinges on the game world, like a poetic and self-referential Agnès Varda film, and in one lovely sequence, while Julián is engrossed in a footie sim on the family’s console, his onscreen player leaves the pitch and wanders home – to Julián’s own house: a beautiful, subtle comment on embodiment, fantasy and the act of playing.Despelote recalls some of the great works of independent narrative game design – The Unfinished Swan, Gravity Bone, Virginia – yet it is also something thrillingly of itself. Even though it’s a game about one small boy in a specific rendering of Ecuador, it communicates the near-universal power of football as a cohesive social narrative: the way the Dutch team of 74, Maradona’s genius in 1986, and Gascoigne’s goal against Scotland at Euro 96 came to say something about the nations that produced them. At the same time, as we draw closer to the final matches of the qualifying round and the excitement and tension becomes palpable, the camera and narration pull back, beyond the structured world of the game and into a meditation on the creative process itself. This is fascinating, formally daring stuff that, in its two-hour playtime, asks more questions about the nature of memory, simulation and identity than a dozen 100-hour epics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The president has discussed trade, investment and defence. But the boundary between statecraft and self-aggrandisement is blurred. To honour the US president, the government of Qatar has  offered him a Boeing 747 aircraft. This “flying palace”, worth around $400m, would serve as a substitute for Air Force One as Mr Trump’s personal jumbo.The US constitutionexplicitly forbidsanyone holding a government office from accepting any “present, emolument, office or title” from foreign powers without congressional consent. White House lawyers, obedient to their master, say the Qatari jet doesn’t cross that line.Accepting gifts from foreign regimes is not the worst constitutional violation committed by theTrump administration. The contempt for due process and rule of law in cases where innocent Americans have been abducted and deported for unproven and spurious immigration offences is more alarming.But corrosion of civil rights and flouting rules of financial propriety are symptoms of the same condition. Mr Trump doesn’t believe in submission to rules of any kind. He recognises no distinction between business conducted in the White House and deals done at Mar-a-Lago. On the eve of his inauguration, Mr Trump launched a crypto asset, $TRUMP, literally monetising the presidency. Last month, it was announced that the top 220 holders of the coin would beinvited to dinnerwith the president.Previous occupants of the Oval Office sold investments or set them aside in blind trusts. Mr Trump’s business empire, managed by his sons, operates as before, except with the added commercial privileges that accrue to association with the most powerful man on Earth.Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, runs a private equity company that mostly deals with the state-backed investment funds of Gulf states that Mr Trump is visiting this week.Theconflicts of interestare so densely woven that it is difficult to separate the presidency from the commercial ambitions of the presidential entourage. That is a defining feature of state capture in regimes that lack democratic safeguards and where law enforcement is incapable of policing corruption. It is an affront to the principle that public office should be sought with a view to advancing public interest, not exploited for personal enrichment. It is the mark of a kleptocracy.That is not incompatible with the more ideological side of Mr Trump’s project – the promise to make America great again. The president sees himself as a champion of the American people – an incarnation of a national will – so his soaring wealth is synonymous with collective greatness. But if ordinary Americans do notfeel themselves enriched, they will turn resentful, perhaps wanting regime change, at which point the president may feel threatened by democracy and seek to disarm it.This is the cycle of authoritarianism permitting corruption, which in turn feeds more authoritarianism. Plenty of dysfunctional states have exhibited this pattern before, but rarely has it been displayed on a scale and a stage as vast as those available to a US president.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After all, the president’s primary domestic policy deputy, Elon Musk, gained his position in the administration more or less by purchasing it: he is the richest man in the world, and the primary funder of Trump’s last presidential campaign, and it is seemingly by this virtue – does he have any others? – that Musk has been granted the authority to dismantle large swaths of the federal bureaucracy.This is something of a pattern for Donald Trump. In his first term, it became de rigueur for foreign dignitaries tostay at Trump’s hotelon trips to Washington, a practice long perceived to be a way of currying favor with the president by spending money at his businesses. Trump funneled money to his hotel business from domestic sources, too: when Secret Service agents were required to stay at Trump’s hotels, they werecharged exorbitant rates– including after he left office. Before their recent worldwide jaunt making deals with foreign governments and businesses that willfinancially benefit their father– including plans for a major new golf course in Qatar, built in partnership with a company controlled by the royal family – Trump’s sons launched$Trump, a cryptocurrency coin – that ever-popular scheme of shameless millennial grifters.Foreign powers, major businesses and wealthy individuals whose interests might be affected by Trump administration policy have all rushed to invest, a not-so-subtle way of ingratiating themselves to the president with money. Last month, Trump announced that the biggest investors in the scheme could meet with him personally, either at one of his clubs or at the White House: a literal auction of access to the president. His ear is for sale to the highest bidder.This kind of behavior from the Trump administration has gone on for so long that it is hard to rouse the media to attention to cover it. Their standards for the ethical conduct of politicians – or, at least, of Republicans – have lowered so dramatically that it’s hard to tell if they have any. Personal enrichment by politicians is no longer treated as a scandal, a state of affairs that’s been helped along not only by how pervasive corruption has become, but by the US supreme court’s repeated and dramatic efforts to narrow federal anti-bribery statutes and the longstanding non-enforcement of the constitution’s emoluments clause.Amid this non-response to influence peddling and back-scratching more broadly, it is sometimes difficult to get Americans to notice just how flagrantly their president is on the take. If Trump has been selling access and influence for years – if he has not divested from his companies, which are now supposedly run by his sons, and continues to profit from the largesse of billionaires foreign and domestic, is it really a story that he still does so now?And so it is a testament to the brazenness and almost cartoonish excess, of Trump’s dealings that one of them has gained so much coverage: his willingness to accept a$400m luxury 747 plane, decked out so lavishly that it has been called a “palace in the sky”, from the royal family of Qatar.The plane, Trump says, is a gift. “It’s a great gesture from Qatar. I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer,” he told reporters. Trump has long bemoaned what he considers the inadequate state of the two aircraft that currently serve as Air Force One; he has been angling for a fancier plane since his first term. As that has been slow to materialize, the Qataris appear to have stepped in with an alternative: they will give Trump a “palace in the sky” to serve as Air Force One, and the plane would then be transferred, after he leaves office, to his presidential library.The mainstream media has been reluctant to name this exchange as a bribe. After all, Trump insists that the aircraft is being gifted to him, in exchange for nothing. “The Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE,” he wrote on social media. Responding to suggestions that he pay for the plane to avoid the appearance of impropriety, he countered, “Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!!”Later, in an interview with the New York Times’ Maggie Haberman, Trump elaborated further: “I mean, I could be a stupid person say, ‘No, we don’t want a free, very expensive airplane.’ But it was – I thought it was a great gesture.” He went on to explain that he does indeed believe that the “gift” of the airplane is a recognition of his own stance toward Qatar, which has changed dramatically since he called the nation a sponsor of terror and endorsed a regional blockade during his first term. “I think it was a gesture because of the fact that we help,” he said of Qatar. “If it wasn’t for us, they probably wouldn’t exist right now.”What is remarkable about the plane episode is not just Trump’s willingness to accept a lavish gift from another state, but the impotence and indifference of Congress and the judiciary to punish him for it.To accept a gift from a foreign government is a plain violation of the unambiguous text of the constitution. That the US supreme court has made federal anti-bribery laws nearly impossible to prosecute has made a legal response to this kind of behavior even harder. That Congress – controlled by a Republican majority more interested in benefiting from Trump’s largesse than in checking his excesses or asserting their own constitutional prerogatives – is both unable and unwilling to stop him does not change it either. Trump will get away with his plane stunt: we know he will, because the constitutional checks on his power have been made deliberately useless. But no one should be confused about what he is doing.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

There was no warning, no investigation but worst of all – no outcry from the westWed 14 May 2025 06.00 EDTShareAmer Mohammed Rabea was 14 years old. He was a US citizen. On 7 April 2025, he was shot andkilledby Israeli forces in theoccupiedWest Bank city ofTurmus Ayya. There was no warning. No investigation. Just a bullet, a body and a silence so deep it threatens to swallow justice whole.The killing of a child should rupture the world. Instead, Amer’s death joined a growing ledger of erasedPalestinianlives, tallied but never mourned by those in power. There was no state department briefing. No congressional statement. No public grieving for a child born under two flags, killed under a third. Even in death, Amer was made stateless.Since October 2023, at least 17,000 Palestinian children have beenkilledinGaza. The UN nowconfirmsthat at least 100 children have been killed or injuredevery single daysinceIsraelresumed its offensive in March 2025. In 36 verified airstrikes,onlywomen and children were found beneath the rubble. Not fighters. Not military targets. Just families.A picture that shocked the world: the story behind baby Siwar AshourRead moreBut this war is not just about death. It is about the systematic erasure of Palestinian life – its rhythms, its generations, its futures. It is, as one UN official warned, thecreationof conditions of life incompatible with the continued existence of Palestinians as a group.According to Unicef, eight infants died ofhypothermiain January. Medical personnel report a spike in miscarriages. Children are born premature, malnourished, and die in the first weeks of life. The UN warns that Gaza’s children are being subjected to conditions “incompatible with their continued existence”. According toDoctors Without Borders, children arrive at hospitals with rotting wounds, dehydrated, skeletal. Aid has beenblocked. Water tanks have been bombed. Birth, in Gaza, is a threat Israel answers with airstrikes.Israel has turned two-thirds of Gaza into ano-go zone, effectively stealing Palestinian land. There is no electricity. No medicine. No clean water. The siege does not just kill. It prevents life from beginning. And yet those who survive the bombs are hunted by other means.But Israel’s violence against children is not new. In theWest Bank, the violence is personal, intimate. Children are executed at checkpoints. Soldiers raid homes at night. Human Rights Watch has documented numerous killings of Palestinian children who posed no threat, shot in the back, in the chest, while running, while walking to school, in a 2023 report.Seventeen-year-old Mahmoud al-Sadi wasgunneddown on his way to class in Jenin. He was unarmed. A military vehicle 100 metres away fired a single shot. There were no clashes nearby. No justification. Just another morning turned into a funeral.Wadea Abu Ramuz, 17, wasshot in the backduring a protest in East Jerusalem. After being taken to a hospital in critical condition, he was shackled to the bed, denied family visits and later buried at night under police supervision, with mourners limited and phones confiscated.This is not about Hamas. This is not about security. This is about annihilationFifteen-year-old Adam Ayyad, from the Dheisheh refugee camp, was killed by asniperwhile throwing stones. No warning shots. No effort at de-escalation. Just live fire into a crowd of boys.And now, at 12 years old, Rahaf Ayyad feelspainin her bones every day; there is no treatment, no help, and Rahaf often cries comparing her current state with photos of herself looking healthy before the war. In Rahaf’s plight, it becomes clear – starvation is being used to kill Gaza’s children.Since March,Israelhas blockedallfood, fuel and medicine from reaching more than 2 million people. It has cut off not only supply lines, but the ability of Palestinians to produce or gather food themselves. Gaza’s farmland has been destroyed. Its fishing boats bombed. Its bakeries shuttered. Its water undrinkable. Families are boiling weeds and eating turtles, and they are forced to spend $300 on a bag of flour. Some burn garbage just to cook whatever they can find.According to Gaza’s ministry of health, 57 people, mostly children, have alreadystarved to deathunder the blockade. At least 10,000 cases of child malnutrition have been documented by the United Nations, with more than 1,400 of them classified as severe acute malnutrition, meaning their bodies are wasting away. These are the children who still made it to hospitals. Others die in their homes, in tents or while waiting in endless food lines that are often bombed.Starvationis slow violence, and collectively starving 2 million further proves Israel’s genocidalintentions. Starvation begins with fatigue and confusion and ends with organ failure and silence. It kills children first, because their bodies have less to lose. And in Gaza, that silence is growing.What unites Gaza and the West Bank is the intent: to punish Palestinians for existing. To eliminate not only those who resist but those whocouldone day resist. In this logic, every child is a potential threat. Even in death, Palestinian children are punished. Bodies are withheld. Burials restricted. Flags banned. Schools interrogated. Grief criminalized. And so, Israel’s campaign includes thedetentionof more than 1,200 Palestinian children since October 2023 – children who are tortured, starved and held without charges. One of them, 17-year-old Walid Ahmad,diedin Israeli custody this year. His crime? Being Palestinian in a land where that alone can warrant execution.International law is unambiguous: civilians must beprotected. Children, especially. The Geneva conventions prohibit attacks on schools and hospitals. The convention on the rights of the child guarantees life and dignity. But law means little when it is not enforced – when the violator is armed with impunity and backed by billions.The USfundsIsrael’s military to the tune of $3.8bn a year. The bombs that collapse Gaza’s homes are American. The bullets that pierced Amer Rabea’s chest are American. And still, there is no accountability. No consequence. Only more weapons, more blank checks, more diplomatic cover.To kill a child is to erase a future. When a child dies, a world ends. This is not just about bodies. It is about memory. About denying Palestinians the right to imagine tomorrow. What is left of a people who cannot bury their dead, teach their children or name their grief?Israel knows this. It bombs archives and universities. It targets schools and hospitals not just because they house people, but because they carry meaning. A population deprived of memory and future is easier to govern. Easier to erase.But Amer Rabea did not move on. He died in the place his parents had hoped he would come to know as home. He died a child of war and empire, killed for no reason other than being Palestinian. If even American citizenship cannot protect a 14-year-old boy, what protection exists for anyone?This is not about Hamas. This is not about security. This is about annihilation. A future where Palestinian children are denied the most basic right: to live. We must reject the narrative that flattens this genocide into “conflict”. We must say plainly that what is happening is the deliberate destruction of a people – and it begins with their children.Amer had a name. He had a smile. He was loved. He was real. And now, he is gone.We owe him more than silence. We owe Gaza’s starving children more than silence.Have you been silent?Ahmad Ibsais is a first-generation Palestinian American, law student and poet who writes the newsletter State of SiegeExplore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesOpinionChildrenGazaWest BankIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

I had last been in Ukrainejust over a year earlier. Back then, in April 2024, the mood was dark. Frustrated by delays in western military aid, people had a palpable fear of escalating Russian territorial gains, perhaps even a collapse of Ukraine’s frontline. Today, the international context is even more fraught. The Biden administration was frustratingly slow and scared, but few doubted that the US wanted to prevent Russia from prevailing. The same cannot be said of Donald Trump, whose ideological affinity with Vladimir Putin has thrown Europe, starting with Ukraine, off balance.But despite the Trump administration’s betrayals, I found the mood in Kyiv more confident than a year previously. After more than three years of war, Ukrainians are tired, but they are not exhausted. The soldiers, civil society representatives, parliamentarians and government officials I met seemed ever-more determined to stand tall and defend their country.This confidence stems from the country’s growing military self-sufficiency. Ukraine’s drone industry is impressive in terms of technological edge, adaptability, mass and speed. In production of drones and artillery,Ukraineis strengthening by the day. It has no reason to envy many of its European neighbours, and much to teach them.And while manpower is a problem, the Ukrainian army, especially its professional units, (tragically) understands war better than forces elsewhere inEurope. Of course, in Kyiv there is realism: nobody thinks that this understanding of war is sufficient to win back lost territory. But while it no longer expects peace through military victory over Russia, nor does it fear defeat as in the past. It is silently recalibrating, seeking a sustainable ceasefire through deterrence.This doesn’t mean that Ukrainians think they can, or less still want, to go it alone. The sense of having been let down by the US is acute. But in Kyiv there is a deep awareness that Ukraine still needs Washington, particularly in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance as well as air defence.True, the blatant show of warmth between the White House and the Kremlin is unsettling. But Ukrainians also think Putin will continue overshooting with his demands. This is why Volodymyr Zelenskyy called his bluff this week, proposing aface-to-face meetingin Istanbul.Putin, on the back foot, may pull another diplomatic rabbit out of the hat to gain time, postpone new sanctions and divide the west once again. But it’s becoming increasingly clear, even to the Putin-friendly White House, that Russia doesn’t want to end the war now. This, alongside theminerals deal Ukraine signedwith the Trump administration, may have contributed to a subtle repositioning in Washington.The war in Ukraine could never beended in 24 hours,as Trump boasted, because it was never a proxy war between the west and Russia, as Russian propaganda claimed and Trump seemed to believe. The war isn’t ending because the only man who can end it – Putin – continues to think he can win. This realisation may not prompt Trump into a U-turn in which he supports Ukraine full-on. But it could shift Washington from a position of active hostility towards Kyiv to one of benign indifference. In this scenario, the US would gradually disengage from the war while still providing or allowing Ukraine to buy in military capacity. And while it is not ideal, Kyiv can cope with a US that benignly steps aside in ways it could not if Washington were to obstruct it.The other side of the coin is that Ukraine is being progressively integrated into the new European security architecture in the making. On Europe Day, 9 May, the EU’s foreign ministers convened in Lviv. Hours later, theleaders of France, Germany, Poland and the UKarrived in Kyiv, their first joint visit. This was of more than symbolic importance: these states, with the Nordic and Baltic countries, form the kernel not just of the “coalition of the willing” supporting Ukraine, but also of the new European security architecture that is emerging from Russia’s threat and the US’s betrayal.Their support of Ukraine, diplomatic and military, is critical in exposing to the world, and especially to Washington, that it is Putin and Putin alone who wants the war to continue.Whatever materialises this week, it is essential that European leaders do not limit themselves to discussing a post-settlement “reassurance force” for a territorially divided Ukraine. This idea was important in sustaining Ukraine when it looked as if Trump had fallen squarely into Putin’s lap. And European governments will have to be ready to reinforce Ukraine’s deterrence in air, sea and land whenever the war winds down.But the immediate priority is different. A sustainable ceasefire does not look imminent, sadly. Russia might agree to a short-term truce but is unlikely to permanently stop fighting in the months ahead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The broader integration of Ukraine into Europe’s security and defence plans and action is just as important. Ukraine’s battleground experience, born from the tragedy of war, is precious as Europe beefs up its collective defences.European security passes through Kyiv. Understanding this means leaders of thecoalition of the willingwill continue to support Ukraine. They know that Russia represents the biggest threat to Europe.But it’s not a one-way street: as Europeans boost their own defences against Russia, they can only gain from including Ukraine in this effort. Ukraine’s mood is resilient because of growing self-confidence.

In the March quarter of this year, overall wages grew 0.9%, and for the past year wages were up 3.4%. That is a good result. We should celebrate wage growth and not submit to the spin of business groups who preach bankruptcy and recession whenever wages rise.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBut the figures also point to just how tough it is going to be to recover the value of our wages that has been lost in the past four years.In March, the 3.4% overall growth was driven by a pretty strong increase in public-sector wages of 1.0% in the quarter and 3.6% over the year:If the graph does not display, click hereThe increase largely came from new state-based enterprise agreements that saw public-sector wages in Tasmania rise by 1.8% in the quarter, 2.0% in New South Wales and 2.8% in Western Australia.It means across the nation, over the past year, public-sector workers on average have had bigger wage rises than those in the private sector:If the graph does not display, click hereThis does not mean that public-sector workers are living high on the hog. Over the past four years, private-sector workers in each state except Queensland have had better pay rises:If the graph does not display, click hereI choose March 2021 as a reference point because it is now four years since we embarked on the extraordinary run of eight consecutive quarters of private-sector wage rises slower than inflation. And if you think that is bad, for public-sector workers, the streak began in the middle of 2020 and went for 13 quarters.It’s why the government was correct to say they inherited a bad situation, not created it.Now, at least, wages are rising faster than inflation – albeit only just, and only if we measure price rises using the consumer price index. The CPI does not count mortgage repayments. If instead we use the employee cost-of-living index, which does include mortgage repayments, wages grew slower in the past year than most workers’ cost of living:If the graph does not display, click hereIf we measure real wages using CPI, it seems like they have been rising for some time, whereas using cost of living they haven’t increased for a long while:If the graph does not display, click hereThe picture since March 2021 is particularly bleak. Using the official CPI measure, real wages are still 4.4% below what they were four years ago. If we use the employee cost-of-living index the fall is 8.9%:If the graph does not display, click hereWhat does that mean in dollars? Even if we just use the official CPI as the measure of prices, someone who, in March 2021, was earning $90,000 would today be getting the equivalent of $86,055.

Nothing in these figures should greatly alter those odds.The likelihood of more than three rate cuts this year, however, has fallen as investors have become less concerned about a global recession due to Trump’s idiotic tariffs policy:If the graph does not display, click hereThe good news of real wage rises, however, is tempered by the latestlending figuresfor new mortgages that were also released on Wednesday. Across the nation, the average size of an owner-occupier mortgage rose 8.4% in the past year – more than double the 3.4% wage growth.It’s even worse when we again consider what has happened since March 2021.The average size of a mortgage across Australia has gone from $506,000 to $660,000 – a 30% increase – and the story is much worse if you live in South Australia, Western Australia or Queensland:If the graph does not display, click hereAnd a rate cut next week will probably create an uptick in house prices and, in turn, mortgages.So welcome to the next three years and beyond.During the first term, the Albanese government can claim that they stopped the freefall in real wages that they inherited.

We should ask ourselves why.News.com.au reportsthat recent “drops” of the toy in Australia have seen queues form for blocks around its distributor, Pop Mart, with 3am-risers racing to meet the arrival of restocked merchandise. A Pop Mart spokesperson insists such a mania in pursuit of the highly-collectible plushies and miniatures has gripped Australia “like never before”.Collectibles are taking over the toy box – but now the grown-ups are playing tooRead moreIf this isn’t aggressive sales hyperbole, it’s an admission of touching innocence from someone too young to know about theCabbage Patch Kid riotsof 1983, theTamagotchi State Repressionof 1996 or the brawl economics of theBeanie Baby bubblein the late 1990s. Child, sit by me and let me tell you the tale of when I, as a nine-year-old, somehow blackmailed my mother into chaperoning me to the Northgate shopping centre, Hornsby, before dawn, so we could be first in line to acquire a soft-bodied, vinyl-faced Cabbage Patch Kid with a unique birth certificate. “Fifty bucks for that thing,” my incredulous mother said, forever thereafter, whenever my prized adoptee entered her field of vision. “Fifty bucks!”Ah, but what price for childhood joy? Well, you can snaffle Labubu keychain figures for a lobster or two, but joy’s price tag comes in at A$300 for some popular models of Labubu on eBay, and goes up to a truly eye-popping $1,580 for some items on the Pop Mart website.The queues and the cost aren’t the only reason for media interest in the fad. The explosion of Labubu popularity can be traced to the appearance of the toy, not with aspirational child models in a heavily capitalised, after-school-television marketing campaign, but in the possession of adults. Lisa from K-pop band BlackPink wasphotographed with oneof the miniatures dripping from a luxury handbag last year. The Barbadian iconRihannafollowed suit. Then everyone was in on it.Maybe a fluff ball with a monster face is the comfort object that today’s bleakness recognisesWhat’s the aesthetic appeal? Uh, subjective! The dolls are the creation of Hong Kong-born, Netherlands-raised artist Kasing Lung, who was inspired by Nordic mythology when he created his “Monsters” characters for a series of picture books in 2015, of which Labubu is but one. The style that emerged (and has since been rendered by brand partnerships into fluffy polyester and vinyl) most resembles what would happen if a Cabbage Patch Kid had a love child with a Tim Burton Nightmare Before Christmas claymation and then grew up to be a bunny furry. Cute fluffy ears are quite the contrast with sharp-looking teeth; some wear farmers’ overalls, others what appear to be trans-pride helmets. You can dress them yourself – people do, look up the hashtag on Bluesky – or accessories are available for purchase. Pop Mart will generously sell you tiny plastic shoes for $22.The hybrid visual identity of the object provides a neat metaphor for the hybrid marketing assault that has stoked its popularity. It’s not just that the doll speaks to a contemporary K-pop/anime aesthetic that has achieved near-global familiarity. Pop Mart has also replicated the restricted-supply concept of distribution that drove the Beanie Babies craze, releasing waves of variations, some in very limited numbers, and then cutting them off – creating hype around new releases, as well as the use of collectibles markets like eBay as an ongoing, unpaid-for marketing front.Can a fluffy robot really replace a cat or dog? My weird, emotional week with an AI petRead moreAdd to this, Labubu are predominantly sold in “blind boxes”, like theLOL Surprise Dolls of 2017; at purchase, you don’t know which precise model of Labubu you’ll acquire. There’s a lottery element of possibly acquiring a rare doll with a higher potential resale value than others. No wonder the Pop Mart spokesperson was able to claim to News.com.au: “This isn’t just about ‘toys’ but a collectible, pop-culture movement.”That this “movement” is targeted not to children but to adults is the other conspicuous difference here. The queues, the celebrity vaunting and the online fandoms exist in a conspicuously grown-up consumer conversation. Men’s fashion mag GQ has already run an article about the doll asa popular accessory in the growing market of men’s luxury handbags.The American design academic Gozde Goncu Berk observes that trends exerting this level of heftdo not exist in a vacuum; they are embedded in a cultural context. Fads catch on because they encapsulate a convergence of social anxieties, technological shifts, and shared desires that we may struggle to articulate but attach to with instant familiarity.In this framework, the doll becomes a totem for collective introspection. Like blockbuster comic book adaptations, Ghostbusters reboots, adult colouring books, video games, Lego masters and the increasing popularity ofdollhousing, maybe Labubu offer a retreat into an illusion of childhood simplicity, to escape the complexities that presently overwhelm our adult world. We might consider that in a consumer society where possession defines us but has already stuffed300,000 objectsinto the typical home, a doll on a handbag represents the desperate seizure of a diminishing real estate opportunity. In a moment of global markets and – now, thanks to AI – mass production of everything, maybe the fantasy of limited availability substitutes for creativity or specialness. Maybe a fluff ball with a monster face is the comfort object that today’s bleakness recognises.But if we’re getting up at 3am to queue for them, friends, one thing is certain. We are the Labubu. And the Labubu is us.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsToysOpinionK-popcommentShareReuse this content"

Now more than ever we need itMartin Bell is a Unicef ambassador and a former BBC war reporterWed 14 May 2025 09.41 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 21.31 EDTShareIn a short space of time, the British government has made two decisions that will negatively affect the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world. The first was the severe cut in foreign aidannounced in March. The second was the similarly severe reduction in Foreign Office support for theBBC World Service. And these from a supposedly progressive government. It doesn’t seem progressive to me, but cheap and reactionary.I have double interest to declare. I am a long-term BBC loyalist who served the corporation for more than 30 years in the unquiet corners of the world, from Vietnam to Bosnia and from Belfast to Angola. My loyalty survived even such daft editorial decisions as to give aninterview with Prince Harryprecedence over real news. (That was little more than 10 days ago.) I have also been an MP. And since I left the House of Commons in 2001, I have served as a goodwill ambassador for Unicef UK, the British national committee of the UN children’s emergency fund. It introduced me to still more war zones, in Africa and the Gulf.It was in that capacity that I fully endorsed Unicef’s objections to the decision on foreign aid.We wrote at the time: “Now is not the time to break our promise to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable. Millions of children globally rely on UK aid to survive and have never needed it more.” We asked the government to rethink and to retract. It has not yet done so.The effect of the BBC cuts, to a service that wasalready due to cut 130 jobsthis year, is harder to quantify. They reflect the unique and ambiguous position of the corporation itself. It is not by any means a governmental organisation, but its World Service is – or has been until now – largely subsidised by the Foreign Office as a projection of British interests, values and soft power. I have no problem with that: it is my opinion that Foreign Office resources were never better spent. But all this is now in jeopardy, along with the surviving language services. It is hard to see what will remain but a shadow and skeleton of what the World Service used to be.And consider the timing, which could hardly be worse. Agents of disinformation are spreading their toxins through the world. Where the BBC withdraws and its wavelengths grow weaker, all sorts of national and international malefactors are ready to move in – not with news but with propaganda. Even today, under siege at home and abroad, the BBC remains the world’s most trusted news organisation. Its American rival and former counterpart, the Voice of America, is beingput to the swordby a White House whose megaphone is the partisan Fox News. It is challenged at home by a so-called news channel that offers a floodtide of rightwing opinions.The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, speaks of a “borderline crisis in public service broadcasting” and he is better placed than anyone to know. Not only is the World Service at risk. So is the identity and survival of the national broadcaster – the model for so many others – as we have known and (dare I say?) loved it.BBC boss says disinformation ‘trust crisis’ putting social fabric of UK at riskRead moreI find it paradoxical, having risked my life for the BBC in so many war zones, that its World Service’s funding is apparently at risk of being confiscated, among other sources, to pay for an increase in defence spending. Having served so effectively during the old cold war, it is now to be the casualty of a new one. I sense that we are living in the most dangerous times since Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. You may argue that we need sharper swords and fewer ploughshares. I would reply that, more than ever, to make sensible decisions we need trustworthy sources of information. So do the people of Russia, China, Ukraine and India, among others. This is the point of the BBC: the truth is its currency.Wherever I travelled as a foreign correspondent, in times when communication was technically more difficult, I would find my colleagues from other countries crouched over their shortwave radios to find out what was going on around them and elsewhere. And what were they listening to? It was never Moscow. It was occasionally Radio Free Europe. It was usually the BBC.And would we willingly let this go? I hope and believe not. And I urge the government to think again.But I also believe this: once we have relinquished it, we shall never get it back.Martin Bell is a Unicef UK ambassador.

That isn’t trueWed 14 May 2025 07.01 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 11.17 EDTShareYou’ve been deceived by the campaign for assisted dying. It has told you who the proposed law is for: people on their metaphorical deathbeds, no hope in sight, desperate to spare themselves and their loved ones the experience of an agonising death. And no wonder – these cases obviously merit sympathy and concern. These are the people campaigners want to talk about; this is the narrative that pushes people into unquestioning support for their cause.But what of the people the law would include who they don’t want you to consider? Proponents keep saying that the bill is tightly drawn to exclude disabled people, because it limits eligibility to those with only six months to live. But this is patently false. The line between disability and illness – a line this bill relies on – is not a sharp distinction. It is blurry, ever-moving and dependent on social factors far more than biological ones. This knowledge complicates the simple narrative the pro campaign is reliant on.Let’s take, for example, someone with a progressive neuromuscular condition such as motor neurone disease. Prognoses for such conditions are notoriously hard to get right, and even when everything is above board, it is not uncommon for people to vastly outlive their initial life expectancy. This, it is important to recognise, does not doom them to years of misery. With the right care, including social care and appropriate pain relief, people can and do live happy lives with terminal conditions. (Of course, one of the central issues is that many people do not receive such care.) But the many people living well with “terminal” conditions have been roundly excluded from the debate, because they do not fit the narrative. Instead, we are told that being terminally ill is, quite literally, a fate worse than death. The public – and MPs – need to ask themselves if they believe the wheelchair user they see enjoying time with friends in their local cafe would really be better off dead.Here, the bill’s supporters cry out that assisted dying will be voluntary; that someone who felt they could enjoy life while terminally ill could simply choose not to die. This is, at best, a deeply naive position. Because the truth is, not everything is always above board. Society is not equal, and plenty of evidence exists that medical bias and negligence are systemic issues. It is not beyond the realm of imagination to consider that a doctor (with or without consultation with the patient; the law gives them extraordinary power) could offer up a shortened life expectancy in order to help, or indeed nudge, a patient along the road to an assisted death. Talk of how much money and resources assisted dyingcould save the NHS, along with the bill’sweak definition of coercion, only makes this horrific scenario more likely. But proponents say nothing about concerns that newly disabled or newly diagnosed people, who have not had time to process their shock or secure the help they need, could be at risk from actual or perceived pressure, because they don’t fit the narrative, either.Then there are the people you would never even think might qualify. When MPs last voted on the bill, those with concerns about safeguarding and eligibility were repeatedly told that the bill could be strengthened at committee stage, where a group of MPs would scrutinise the bill’s language and table amendments. Yet over and over, the committee voted down anything that would have tightened criteria in order to protect vulnerable people. While proponents were busy telling the public that the bill was safe and only for those for whom there was no hope of recovery, their supporters in parliamentrejected amendmentsto exclude homeless people and prisoners – some of society’s most at-risk people – from its provisions. What a surprise that they are also beyond pro campaigners’ rhetoric.Perhaps most shockingly, the committee alsovoted down an amendmentthat would have excluded anyone whose physical health is so affected by a mental health condition that it warrants a six-month prognosis – in other words, people with eating disorders so severe they might die. (Having severe anorexia, for example, is not enough to render someone incapable of decision-making under the Mental Capacity Act, and therefore they would qualify to access assisted dying.) This is obviously a horrific choice for the committee to have made. Anorexia, even at its most devastating, is not necessarily a fatal disease (but it is one, let’s not forget, that disproportionately affects young women). People get better. They go on to live full lives. Nothing about anorexia deaths is inevitable. Yet allowing people with eating disorders an assisted suicide may, in the depths of their despair, create perverse incentives to get sicker. Are these the people the pro campaign wants you to think about, or the people they talk about when they lobby MPs? No. But they matter, too.Of course, the people who are the pro campaign’s focus also deserve better from this badly designed and dangerous bill. But if we are to accurately debate it, and if we are to honestly reckon with the consequences of such a monumental change, we need to at least be completely transparent about who this bill affects. And we need to ask ourselves why it is that assisted dying campaigners aren’t being so forthcoming.Lucy Webster is a political journalist and the author ofThe View from Down Here: Life As a Young Disabled WomanExplore more on these topicsAssisted dyingOpinionDisabilityDeath and dyingEnglandWalesHouse of CommonscommentShareReuse this content"

Finally they’re being listened toWed 14 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 09.02 EDTShareShould cars be illegal? Are drivers evil? The way some councils have been imposing “low-traffic neighbourhoods” over the past five years, it seems their leaders definitely think so. Not so much because they want to cut traffic (everybody does) but because of the way they have responded to people who object to the LTNs’ impact on their everyday lives.So I was more than happy when, last week, the high court ruled that Lambeth council in south London hadacted unlawfullyin ignoring local objections to its latest scheme. I live in another part of Labour-run Lambeth and have seen first-hand how the council repeatedly ignores public concerns over other LTNs in the borough.Residential roads have been cut off, causing huge traffic queues, increased petrol fumes and inconvenience to ordinary people going about their lives. Those affected include pensioners and people with disabilities facing restricted access to their homes; pedestrians and cyclists endangered by increased traffic; businesses cut off from their customers; and time-poor parents with young children whose school runs have doubled in length.And when there are roadworks (step forward, Thames Water!) or accidents or breakdowns, the streets regularly become gridlocked. Just Stop Oil protesters would get jail time for causing this kind of chaos.Objections by local people have been brushed aside, their concerns dismissed as“culture war”bigotry. This is the borough that was one of the staunchest pro-remain areas in the country. There’s no “culture war” here, just a council that has ignored petitions and public protests in a desire to claim a green identity in the absence of any other notable achievement.I have no ideological objection to LTNs. I want there to be less traffic. I love cycling and used to take my kids to school by bike whenever I could. There may be places where LTNs work, and I can’t speak for other parts of the country where they’ve been introduced. But the experience in Lambeth shows how evidence can be ignored and opposition swept to the margins.Many LTNs were introduced in 2020, without any consultation, supposedly in response to the impact of Covid (bizarre for a time when traffic levels were already plummeting). The thinking was that by closing residential streets, traffic would somehow disappear. It’s true that the roads inside the LTNs became quieter but in Lambeth, traffic was funnelled into main roads (known as “boundary roads”), creating long, slow-moving vehicle queues in less desirable areas, leaving residents of these roads to contend with the displaced traffic and fumes. Yet their concerns were ignored. It’s no surprise that Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, who tragically lost her nine-year-old daughter Ella to an asthma attack triggered by air pollution, hascome out against LTNs.Councils’ justification for LTNs later switched to the promotion of “active travel” – but in our part of Lambeth the streets are extremely hilly so cycling is not possible for most of the population. For those who are elderly or have disabilities, this is even less of an option. And if anyone thinks the council is sincerely listening to residents’ concerns, then note the disastrous introduction of the Streatham Wells LTN in October 2023. Imposed next to an existing LTN, it created catastrophic delays. Public transport was caught up too – in one case a queue ofmore than 40 London buseswas photographed snaking down the High Road. Three-mile journeys took two hours to complete. The story went global – you could probably see the bus queues from space. Yet Lambeth did not relent, and it took theintervention of London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan– dismayed that his buses were becoming unrideable – before the scheme was scrapped.Ultimately, the main problem with the LTNs is that they are all stick, no carrot. For all the restrictions and the penalty notices, there has been almost zero improvement in public transport. There are no new bus routes to make travel easier; no extra trains; and in most of southLondonthere is still no underground, a lack of investment that creates millions of unnecessary car journeys across the capital.Many people will, of course, have little sympathy with drivers, especially if they don’t own a car. Yet there’s a hypocrisy here. Because I can’t think of anyone, car owner or not, who doesn’t regularly depend on a personal driver: be that the Uber driver, the person who delivers the online shopping, or the local plumber or electrician. The time wasted in queues, the frustration and the extra fuel consumption are all outsourced to the little guy.There should be a way around this, but the first step would be to listen. Lambeth has been exposed for ignoring its residents. Those who oppose LTNs are not rabid petrol-headed rightwingers who want to burn up the planet: they’re mostly just ordinary people trying to go about their daily business whose life has been made miserable. They have a right to be heard. And those in power should remember: car ownership is not a crime. Drivers are not evil.Joseph Harker is the Guardian’s senior editor, diversity and developmentExplore more on these topicsLow-traffic neighbourhoodsOpinionRoad transportHealthTransportInequalityLondonEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

Having just blown up Malcolm Turnbull’s government to become Liberal leader and prime minister ahead of Peter Dutton and Julie Bishop, he seemed oblivious to the bloodshed he had just caused.He pointed to the framed photographs of previous Liberal leaders and prime ministers and said, in what I’m sure he thought was a Churchillian tone: “One day there will be a woman there.” The room was glum with silence, pierced only by Bishop’s quiet quip. In which century?That day marked the beginning of the Morrison and Dutton show. Women centrists such as Bishop, Kelly O’Dwyer and me jumped ship. Kerryn Phelps won Turnbull’s seat of Wentworth and Zali Steggall won Tony Abbott’s seat of Warringah in 2019, the same year as Morrison’s ‘miracle’ win. In the 2022 election, six women – business leaders, lawyers and doctors among them – pushed men out of “blue ribbon” seats that had been held by Liberal party since last century.A slow but steady trail of destruction continued. The reactionary right, emboldened by Trump 1.0, and later Trump’s second coming, has continued to flavour their talking points accordingly and develop copycat policies. They consoled climate deniers with a Gina Rinehart-friendly pro-nuclear stance, and reinforced their antiquated attitude to women by preselecting more men, and temporarily telling men and women that they would have to ditch working from home and return to the office.From punk rocker to tax policy expert: who is Sussan Ley, Australia’s first female opposition leader?Read moreWomen voters deserted the Liberal party in 2022 and fled it again in 2025 – to the Labor party and teal independents.The Liberals have finally appointed a women, Sussan Ley, as leader. Their excited declaration that this was an important moment in history – Ley is the first woman the party has appointed in its 80 years – contains the subtle implication that the appointment will fix their deep-seated dysfunctional woes and make up for a shocking electoral defeat.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe more significant historic moment, which the Liberal Party would prefer we not see, is that the 48th Australian parliament will include a record-breaking number of women and that about 50 of them are likely to be Labor MPs, compared with only about seven Liberals. Added to that number are the five women teal independents who held their seats in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. The Liberals say they are ‘the sort of women’ who should be in the Liberal party while remaining oblivious to the fact that literally millions of women have demonstrated they wouldn’t go anywhere near the Liberal Party – because they are women who care about the climate, about health and education and about the economy for future generations and who share the values of integrity, respect and equality.After the 2022 election, Ley, as deputy leader of the party and shadow minister for women, often said she was “talking with women”, going on a “listening tour”, and that the party wanted to win back the urban seats lost to the six female teals. During this time, a 60-page post-election review of the Liberal party unsurprisingly found that a decline in support from female voters was an important factor in the loss. After this year’s emphatic loss, it appears the review went unheeded; basic things such as the Liberal party’s intransigent resistance to quotas remained and the community independents movement grew.As Ley takes up the leadership, she has vowed to lead from the “sensible centre”. But how exactly? The Liberals came out of this election beholden to the National party and remain underpinned by a Trumpian support base. They went into this election preferencing One Nation and Family First in electorates across the country – parties with longstanding positions against equality, abortion, LGBTQI+ rights, multiculturalism and renewable energy. There does not appear to be anything remotely “sensible” or “centrist” left in that party room, especially when it comes to the issue of women.The Liberals have a long road to relevance – and Sussan Ley’s slim victory means she begins on shaky foundationsRead moreIt’s going to take more than the appointment of a female leader declaring a “new narrative”, and a “fresh approach” to rebuild the party.Words alone don’t cut it with the Australian people.Ley declared that her appointment sends a signal to Australian women. But does the party really believe Ley’s appointment is going to fix the deeply dysfunctional and embedded problems the Liberals face?Ley’s picture will be hung on the wall with former Liberal leaders, but more needs to be done to ensure it’s not perched on one of the biggest glass cliffs in Australian history.The most profound and meaningful signal has already been sent, and it is not the one the Liberal party sent by appointing its first female leader. It’s the one the Australian people sent on 3 May.Julia Banks is an author, leadership consultant, keynote speaker, lawyer, and former Liberal and Independent MPExplore more on these topicsCoalitionOpinionLiberal partyAustralian election 2025Australian politicsWomen in politicscommentShareReuse this content"

It is a strange combination. He is not challenged by Kemi Badenoch, who is weak in parliament and irrelevant outside it. Nor is the prime minister in immediate peril from Reform, the Liberal Democrats or the Greens. They pose electoral challenges in the coming years but they can’t stop the government passing laws in the meantime. The Labour leader is not in danger from backbench rebellion. Dissenting MPs grow in number but not at the rate that presages regicide.Starmer has been dealt a tough hand in some ways. He inherited a rotten economy in a volatile world. But he also has advantages not enjoyed by many of his predecessors: a vast Commons majority, an obedient cabinet, a splintered opposition. His greatest problem isn’t a politician or party. It isn’t an industrial lobby or foreign power. It is a question, small but deeply penetrating: why?Labour has done lots of stuff, often making people cross. Winter fuel payments have been rationed; businesses have been landed with a higher national insurance bill. There have been winners, too. Junior doctors and train drivers got a pay rise to end their strikes, but trouble averted doesn’t win political friends as efficiently as pain makes enemies.It is hard for any government to earn credit forwhatthey do if voters cannot easily intuitwhythey are doing it. This is Labour’s big problem.“Why” is a deceptively simple question, containing two different concepts. It inquires into process and motive. It asks “from what cause?” and “to what purpose?” One is an explanation about the past, the other is a story about the future.For example, one answer to the question of why cut benefits is that the Tories left a£22bn budget black hole. But that doesn’t explain why it has to be winter fuel or personal independence payments. The Conservative legacy is a cause of budget choices, not a moral compass pointing to the better path.Another answer might be that the benefits bill is a poor use of public money, going to people who don’t need it or could replace it with wages if only they would work harder. But if that is the argument, the Conservative legacy loses its potency. If there are savings to be made anyway, and that’s the right thing to do, why blame it on the black hole?It should be possible to recognise that there are perverse incentives that need ironing out of the benefits system, while also striving not to drive vulnerable people into destitution. But that is an agenda to reform the state, not shrink it under fiscal duress. So which is it? It is hard to sound authentic in defence of a policy when your party’s core economic argument and its collective body language all scream reluctance and queasy compulsion.The same problem now arises with Labour’s immigration policy. Starmer has declared that he wants to bring net migration down. Why?One answer is that voters say they want it and will back Nigel Farage if they don’t get it. The prime minister insists that isn’t the reason. In a speech launching animmigration white paperon Monday, he rejected any suggestion that government policy was about “this or that strategy, targeting these voters, responding to that party”.That wouldn’t need saying if his audience found it easy to imagine less cynical motives. But if we take Starmer at his word, what does he say is the reason for this particular set of policies?The argument is that the Tories ran an open-door policy, importing workers to do jobs that might otherwise have been done by British citizens. That the domestic workforce lacked the skills to do those jobs was also a symptom of Conservative neglect. The influx of foreigners undermined social cohesion. Without reversing these trends, Britain risks becoming“an island of strangers”, the prime minister said. The damage already done is “incalculable”.The proposed remedy is to stem the flow of migrants. The shortfall in workers will be supplied from a glut of millions who are classified as“economically inactive”in labour market data, but capable of work (or will soon be deemed as such by the Department for Work and Pensions).The gap in skills will be mended with funding from higher levies charged on businesses that request visas for migrant workers. Employers that want to bring in foreigners must also have an approved plan to boost the capabilities of domestic workers.There is a dubious simplicity in a labour market equation that neatly cancels out net migration with re-activated benefits claimants.Assuming the switch is even possible it is gargantuan in scope – a fundamental reconfiguration of the way Britain works. The white paper concedes, with unintentional bathos, that the process “will take time to establish”.It doesn’t acknowledge the cost. The Home Office could turn off the visa taps and hope for a miracle in the domestic jobs market before the NHS, social care and other services are crippled by staff shortages. More likely, the Treasury will intervene, insisting that the transition be incremental enough to keep the economic wheels turning. Net migration will come down –it is falling already– but not with such tangible demographic effect that voters will notice a change in the national complexion and thank Starmer for it.If the harm done by the Tories was “incalculable”, how will Labour calculate the reduction in harm after just a few years of running its own marginally less permissive regime? The lurid rhetoric that was chosen to define the motive behind the white paper – answering the question ofwhyStarmer is doing this – guarantees that it will be judged a failure by the very people to whom that language is addressed.And yet most of the actual policy could have been presented with the opposite inflection. The emphasis could have been on Britain’s historical record of successfully integrating migrant communities and the vast economic and cultural contribution they have made. The argument that unmanaged borders undermine confidence in government and put community cohesion at risk could still be made. So might the case for rebalancing the labour market.But there is a way to narrate those issues as a confrontation with cynical opportunists who revel in division and foment mutual suspicion. Immigration reform could be sold in terms that demolish the economic illiteracy of parties whose business model is burning bridges and turning neighbours into strangers. Labour could still talk about rules, fairness and border control, but make it a challenge to Farage instead of a tribute to him.But that would be out of character for a prime minister who has reached the top by swerving hard choices, flinching from difficult debates. His method has worked. It iswhyhe is prime minister, but only in one sense of the word. It is the reason for his victory, not the purpose.The lack of that second part, a better answer to the questionwhyStarmer is prime minister, explains how he has come to look so constrained, even with parliament at his command; beleaguered when his enemies are divided. It defines the strange spectacle of the unchallenged leader who besieged himself.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinionMigrationKeir StarmerLabourEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

And with this film’s anti-AI and internet-sceptic message, and the gobsmacking final aerial set piece, Cruise is repeating his demand for theechtbig-screen experience. He is of course doing his own superhuman stunts – for the same reason, as he himself once memorably put it, that Gene Kelly did all his own dancing.Final Reckoning is a new and ultimate challenge (actually the second half of the challenge from the previous film) which takes Cruise’s buff and resourceful IMF leader Ethan Hunt on one last maverick, deniable mission to exasperate and yet overawe his stuffed-shirt superiors at Washington and Langley. And what might that be? To save the world of course, like all the other missions.With his doughty team including Grace (Hayley Atwell), Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), Hunt must now confront a sinister and metastasising AI brain called “the Entity”, the ultimate MacGuffin-slash-baddie which is undermining truth all over the world with lies and deepfakes, setting nation against nation, nuclear power against nuclear power, so that it will be the anti-God, the evil ruler of all. And to stop it, Ethan has to take the low-tech “cruciform key” he salvaged in the last film and apply it to the “Podkova” device which is on board a wrecked Russian sub, the Sevastopol somewhere on the seabed. (Wait - should they actually have called in James Cameron in some sort of nifty submersible?) The combination of the two will be a “poison pill” which will destroy the Entity.View image in fullscreenSimon Pegg, left, and Tom Cruise Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning.Photograph: Paramount Pictures and Skydance/APIt is a wildly silly, wildly entertaining adventure which periodically gives us a greatest-hits flashback montage of the other seven films in the M:I canon - but we still get a brand new, box-fresh Tom-sprinting-along-the-street scene, without which it wouldn’t be M:I. Moreover, this eighth film gives us a terrific new character, US sub commander Capt Bledsoe, played with suavity and the tiniest hint of camp by Tramell Tillman (from TV’s Severance) who has the chops for M:I9 whenever that happens.And just as it wouldn’t be M:I without a sprinting scene, it wouldn’t be M:I without Tom hanging on for dear life at some unfeasible altitude; here he gets to cling to the wing of an old-fashioned prop plane in the blue Empyrean.

I didn’t ask about the hats. That wasn’t the kind of questioning I engaged in’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 14 May 2025 10.56 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 13.07 EDTShareWhen I began my project photographing in the southern states of the US, I’d only recently developed the confidence needed to take effective portraits. Speaking publicly or talking with people used to make me very nervous. But I was mainly photographing architecture – I knew I wanted to change and make people my subject. So I simply forced myself to endure the anxiety. I picked locations where people gathered in public, such as beaches or parks, and would make myself walk up to them and ask for permission to photograph them.If you do anything long enough, you start to get good at it, and eventually I turned myself into a very assertive photographer. I’m not an intimidating person – I’m small in stature – and generally speaking people like me. On any given day, if I were to ask 20 people to pose for me, 19 would say yes.I would ask the police what areas of town to avoid – then go thereI’d moved to Knoxville in 1982 to teach photography at the University of Tennessee, and during the first exploratory trip from my new home I really did not have a specific objective. But when I got back and processed the film, the results confirmed what I’d started to realise as the trip had gone on – that my pictures of Black Americans were the most interesting. Over the course of a number of summer road trips throughout the decade, I continued to visit Black communities across the American south.During each trip, my first stop after checking into a motel would be the local police station. I would pull out a map of the town, explain that I had some very expensive photographic equipment and ask an officer if he would circle the places I should avoid. I knew those were the places I needed to be.I would walk around with my heavy, large format 4:5 camera already mounted on its tripod, in search of opportunities. When I sensed the possibility of a photograph, I’d approach the subject and explain that I thought he or she was somehow special, that this person was, as in the theatre, clearly the star, and that what I wanted to photograph was their star quality.As an Asian man showing up in predominantly Black areas, I was clearly an anomaly, and often people were surprised I didn’t speak Chinese or broken English. Having the camera on a tripod allowed me to avoid a certain predicament that would occur with a handheld camera that you would hold in front of your face. In that instance, the subject feels as if they are undergoing a medical exam. They’re being looked at, objectified, and the photographer has all the control, whereas the ability to stand beside the camera levels the playing field. It allowed me to have a direct conversation, and invite the subject to be a participant.‘It stunned me that people had to live like this’: ​​Baldwin Lee​ on his rediscovered images of the deep south​Read morePosing the subject was when the process became very interesting. The person I was asking to photograph was not a professional actor, nor was I a director. Whatever I asked them to do, they would interpret individually and do something different, often displaying themselves in a surprising and revealing way. That’s what I wanted – to make a photograph of something that was a mutual discovery.This particular picture was taken either in Augusta or Valdosta, Georgia. I saw the woman in her yard, began a conversation and took several pictures of her outside, then asked if she would mind if I also photographed her inside. She invited me into her house and her husband was there. I asked them to stand next to each other in that doorway, then I asked them to kiss.I made a series of them together and this one turned out to be, I think, the best. I wanted a dialogue between the couple and the plaque you can see on the wall beside them, which is a relief carving of a man and a woman in a similar pose. I didn’t ask about the hats – that wasn’t the kind of questioning I engaged in. I just included objects that might allow the viewer to imagine possible scenarios.At the end of the process I would write down my subjects’ addresses and send them a print. Sometimes I saw participants again on later trips, and they would show me where they’d put my picture up in their homes. On one occasion a woman tore the photograph to pieces in front of me. The majority of times, though, they were very pleased with the results.Baldwin Lee.Photograph: Courtesy Baldwin LeeBaldwin Lee’s CVBorn:Brooklyn, New York, 1951.Trained:“With Minor White at MIT and Walker Evans at Yale.”Influences: “Minor WhiteandWalker Evans”.High point: “Having been plucked from obscurity.”Low point:“I thought I was retired but instead have been busier than ever!”Top tip: “Teach yourself to have courage.”Baldwin Lee’s photographs are on display at theDavid Hill Gallery stand, Photo London,15-18 May.Explore more on these topicsArt and designMy best shotPhotographyArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But being a Eurovision entry now looks like being part of an exhausting social media content factory, which may be driving some of the wackiness out of it. No one isgiving a wolf a bananathis year.In 2025, a Eurovision artist needs to tread on eggshells to avoid putting a foot wrong during months-long internet exposure, but must also stay interesting enough to attract likes and follows. It has also become the norm for contestants to provide alternative versions of their own or other Eurovision songs for the viral content mills. And it is difficult to do that if you are, like Ireland in 2008,sending a puppet.So if you were thinking of sending, say, novelty buxom butter churners, as Poland did in 2014 to accompanyDonatan & Cleo singing We Are Slavic, you must bear in mind that they have to commit to the bit and be prepared to churn butter all over TikTok for months, plus provide additional YouTube video for the official channel.This year’s standouts on that alternate content score include Lithuania’s Katarsis supplyinga more intense choir-laden versionof their alt-rock entry Tavo Akys, andGeorgia’s entry doing a cover of the Netherlands entry. We have also been treated toan acoustic Greek entrywith an additional lovely dog in the video, anda darker versionof Laura Thorn’s entry for Luxembourg,La Poupée Monte le Son, that arguably puts the original in the shade.The alternate version of the Luxembourg entryStill, this trend for extra content did at least give us theincredible deadpan Go_A coverof fellow Ukrainian Eurovision legendary entryVerka Serduchka’s Dancing Lasha Tumbai, so perhaps it isn’t all bad.Go_A perform Dancing Lasha TumbaiVoting atEurovisionisn’t as secret as a papal conclave, and social media success is clearly going to make a difference. The lengthy pre-contest campaign may influence people, and juries, to converge on popular acts, making the result a self-fulfilling prophecy.The number of YouTube views a song racks up also affects its betting odds. At the moment, Sweden’s KAJ lead both withBara Badu Basta. The producers who shape the running order of the final are hardly going to relegate a favourite of fans and bookies alike to an unfavourable slot on the night.KAJ with Bara Badu BastaYet the modern environment seems to have driven a lot of countries to send something safe in terms of song and artist profile. Slovenia, France, Switzerland, Israel and the Netherlands have all gone for basic Eurovision ballads. And there is a proliferation of electronic europop seeking to become club anthems. Perhaps taking a cue from 2023’s winner,Tattoo by Loreen, this year Germany, Spain, Ireland, Denmark, Cyprus and Belgium have all turned in entries that are so similar the world’s worst DJ could seamlessly mix them.Even Austria’s entry (currently second favourite), JJ’s emotional and operaticWasted Love, makes a point of finishing in a way that could be timed to work perfectly for a rave crowd watching the sunrise in Ibiza.JJ and Wasted Love, Austria’s entry for 2025Will it still be an absolute riot of fun in Basel on Saturday? Of course. With the advent of streaming there are fewer and fewer genuine live event television moments, and apart from sport they are scarce, especially one that the whole of Europe watches at the same time. Last year the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) claimed that 163 million people watched the three live shows across its 37 broadcasters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Assuming the contest doesn’t get ripped apart by rows about who participates –Ireland’s RTÉ has asked the EBU for talksafter 72 former contestants called for the Israeli public service broadcaster to be banned from taking part – countries who don’t succeed often react to failure by sending something totally different the following year.Maybe someone out there will be watching Saturday’s final in Basel and think, come on, let’s go to the 70th Eurovision song contest, and let’s show Europe something way more weird.

The team behind the musical tell its success story in reverse – from Olivier awards glory back to a Cornish bowling alleyInterviews byChris WiegandWed 14 May 2025 06.22 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 06.29 EDTShareJethro Compton (book and lyrics, director and stage designer):The Olivier awards were ahuge boostfor us. I wasn’t aware of the impact an Olivier win could have. We were already in conversations with different organisations around the world about getting the show out internationally – those have stepped up quite dramatically.Philippa Hogg (actor, musician and creative associate):The ceremony was so much fun. We came on at the Royal Albert Hall to this roar from thousands of people.Clare Foster (plays Elowen Keene):Our fans are incredible. One gave me this beautiful letter with a wooden box, which had a pickled crab design. It could belong on our set. I opened it and it was the Diary of Elowen.Darren Clark (music and lyrics, co-music supervisor, orchestrator and arranger):There are generous souls working on this show – we talk about people who are “Button”. One of those qualities is an open heart; another is a curiosity about life.John Dagleish (plays Benjamin Button):Any story that is very human works well through the lens of an absurd conceit, like a man ageing backwards. The message about making the most of the time you have is much more poignant with a life led the opposite way around because there is a finite number of years and a specific end date.View image in fullscreenDarren Clark, John Dagleish and Jethro Compton at the Olivier awards, where The Curious Case of Benjamin Button won three prizes.Photograph: Joanne DavidsonPhilippa Hogg:Everyone on that stage feels connected to the themes, particularly being an outsider. It feels like a band of misfits telling the story of a misfit. Playing instruments and singing together is an ancient art form. You have to listen so hard when you play music and sing together and that ultimately connects people on a deeper level than just playing a scene. And this is very much a non-hierarchical piece – that’s quite rare.Jethro Compton:There’s nothing like it in the West End. An actor-musician storytelling show is very different to what people are used to experiencing here. It would not have been developed this way if it had originated in the commercial sector instead of the fringe.Musicalsare so expensive to develop that producers aren’t taking risks. This show has a title that people may have heard of from the film and short story but it’s created by a group of unknown people, pretty much. That’s part of its charm.Clare Foster:Telling an entire lifespan on stage makes people reflect on their own lives. They leave wanting to call their mum or to hold their partner’s hand a bit tighter because it deals with the big stuff. When my friends come and watch, they don’t – spoiler alert! – cope with me dying very well.John Dagleish:But Jethro has this phrase that he uses: “shitting on the romance”. Whenever anything becomes melodramatic or a bit too sepia, he pumps the brakes and throws in a little gag. It allows the audience a bit of respite from the heaviness.View image in fullscreenPhilippa Hogg, leaping, in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianClare Foster:When I joined the company, Jethro talked so much about it as an ensemble show. That word can get thrown around a lot. But it really is an ensemble in its core. A cast of actor-musicians changes the dynamic of a company because there’s an inherent reliance on each other. It never feels like a particular person is singing a song with a band; it feels like a group of storytellers collaborating.Darren Clark:There’s something in the show for everyone to reflect on. I wanted the music to feel like it was sort of rushing over you like a wave. There would be moments where you felt like you were inside a storm and others when the water was lapping at your toes.Anna Kelsey (costume designer and associate stage designer):We wanted the set to feel like it was all falling into the ocean. The stage at the Ambassadors theatre is already raked. We added more of a rake, which does look great, but there was a lot of adjusting to it.Philippa Hogg:We dropped a tankard and it rolled into someone’s lap in the front row! It takes some getting used to for the body, especially when you’re dancing, as your centre of gravity is a bit wonky. But it kind of gives that rickety pier feel.Anna Kelsey:On some shows the pieces don’t all seem to come together. But with this one, they really did. We knew we wanted Benjamin to wear a suit and for it to feel like he was filling it out as as he gets younger. So at the beginning of the show, John is very hunched over and his jacket has been cut to be oversized. At one point, he changes it for one made of the same fabric but with a cut that fits him better. Then he changes his hair in the interval, too. It all helps the process without that transformation becoming the focus of the show.John Dagleish:With Benjamin, we didn’t want to do a send-up caricature of an old man, a Julie Walters “two soups” kind of thing! We wanted to find something real that wasn’t based on makeup or prosthetics – something that would be believable without being too showy. So we discussed this idea of weight in his movement and a voice like I’ve been shouting all night, a shallowness of breath.Anna Kelsey:We did talk about him having a moustache at the top of the show. We cut it because no character ageing normally through the show is aided by anything like that. Also finding a place where John could actually take it off was challenging!View image in fullscreen‘His jacket has been cut to be oversized’ … John Dagleish as Benjamin Button.Photograph: Marc BrennerJohn Dagleish:I’d forgotten about the moustache! It would have felt more like you’re doing a “bit”, rather than selling this as authentically as we could sell it.Anna Kelsey:There was this idea that the swirling ensemble are called strangers. We talked about them being sort of washed up out of the ocean. The ensemble colours were timeless tones of the earth, sea and coast. But for the main characters I referenced items like life buoys, fishing floats, manmade colours of the coastline – so Benjamin’s got a bit of yellow, Elowen has orange.Philippa Hogg:The mystical nature of Benjamin Button, and the folkloric way that we tell the story, has so much truth in it. Elowen sings the line “for a person can be old and yet be young”. We all have that childlike nature in us but then young children can have these moments of profound wisdom. You think: where the hell did that come from? If anything, the show has made me think the traditional concept of ageing is a load of rubbish.John Dagleish:Benjamin is a very wise but naive character when he’s born. Jethro described it like, he’s already had all of the experiences but he just doesn’t remember them yet. So you’re playing this kind of childish naivety but with some sense of maturity and wisdom behind it as well. And then, as the younger man, I get to play it with a wealth of experience as well as an impetuous midlife crisis kind of vibe.Jethro Compton:If you try to make the fact that he is born old in any way believable or realistic, it doesn’t work. I think the 2008 film version went wrong in that they made him baby-sized, so the whole thing is a bit weird. The more absurd we made it, the more we leaned into making it a fairytale, the quicker the audience could accept it and move on. Benjamin is born old and falls in love with a younger woman. But I was very conscious of not wanting it to be creepy or sinister.Clare Foster:There’s something that’s a little bit ick about the concept but Jethro and Darren have done such a great job. I don’t think you ever really feel the ick!View image in fullscreenThe company at the Ambassadors theatre.Photograph: Marc BrennerJethro Compton:Largely that comes down to the ages of the actors that we cast but also that Elowen is the driving force of the relationship. Benjamin is not pursuing her – she very much pursues him. She doesn’t care what age he may or may not be, she’s only interested in who he is as a person.Clare Foster:The producer Richard Darbourne, who I did Guys and Dolls with 10 years ago, messaged me and said: you should come in for this. His text said: “High stakes, big heart, you eat that shit for breakfast!” It was one of those lovely rare auditions where, in the room, it just felt like the right fit.Philippa Hogg:Before we go on stage we do a physical and vocal warmup then come together in a big circle, arms around each other. Anyone from the cast or crew then has the opportunity to dedicate that performance to someone or something they have experienced that makes them think of the show. So we have a focus for the next couple of hours.John Dagleish:Jethro sent me some recordings of the earlier production and I fell in love with the music immediately. I remember the first day of rehearsal when I joined the company. What you would normally do is sit around a table and have a read-through. But we basically had a play-through with all of these amazing actor-musicians. Within the first two songs, everyone was in tears.View image in fullscreenAnn Marcuson, Clare Foster and Philippa Hogg in rehearsals.Photograph: Marc BrennerDarren Clark:I would say there’s probably between 10 and 15 songs that were cut over the years. We’d write a version of something, then take a little bit of that and write another one and so on. It’s like making whisky, it’s about distilling the idea. My life changed so much during the period of writing it. I became a father, I got married. A lot of the life that I have now is encapsulated within those years of making the show. I put the essence of my experience as a father into some of the lyrics.Jethro Compton:We partnered with new producers for theWest End. There were definite challenges in scaling up the show. We redeveloped it, with a new cast except for two of the company from when we did it at Southwark Playhouse.Anna Kelsey:One of the challenges we had back then was how hot the actors got. We had a lot more layers of costume. Our coastal reference images included thick fishing jumpers which I love the look of but it’s so impractical as the actors were just on the move all the time.Philippa Hogg:Before moving to Southwark Playhouse Elephant, we put it on at Southwark’s Little stage with a cast of five in 2019. I remember thinking: how the hell are we going to do this tastefully? For Benjamin’s entrance, there was a big creaky puppet made of driftwood that kind of flew apart into different pieces and then James Marlowe played Benjamin until the end when we had a child puppet made of buckets and bits of beach plastic. Benjamin and Little Jack didn’t go to sea in the earlier version; they went to the mines.Anna Kelsey:We got loads of costumes from car boot fairs and charity shops. There was no time for anyone to leave the stage for a costume change, with all of the music to consider.View image in fullscreenJames Marlowe, centre, as Benjamin Button at Southwark Playhouse, London, in 2019.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDarren Clark:Guitar is my home instrument. I knew that there would be lots of guitars with Celtic folk tunings. And fiddles, mandolin and the cello which feels like a human voice. There’s nothing quite like a solo cello playing something beautiful and mournful. And then I’d always had this vision of two sets of drums. I wanted to be able to capture vast and epic, as well as intimate and beautiful. That’s the way life operates: we have big moments and tiny moments.Jethro Compton:We did a week of previews in Salisbury before we went to London. That original production was self-financed and self-produced – I built the set, drove the van, did too many jobs myself.Philippa Hogg:For the first performances, we rehearsed in Cornwall. We had a couple of cottages in Bude. It really informed the feel of the show because every night we were on the beach. We had two actors playing Elowen. So I played her in part one, which takes you to the age of about 35, and then Rosalind Ford played her in part two.Jethro Compton:We rented out a space above a bowling alley in Bude for a week. We put the whole set together, rehearsed it for a week, then did a first sharing. An invited dress rehearsal basically. A number of local people were there, including my father who played with a ukulele group beforehand then stayed to watch. The cast size was hugely different, but its heart was the same.Darren Clark:It’s a deeply flawed short story but I saw the potential in it. Jethro added the tension of Benjamin trying to hide a secret.Jethro Compton:Fitzgerald’s story is ultimately a fairytale. That folklorish quality fit really well with the world of a Cornish folk musical. I didn’t particularly enjoy reading the story – it’s very dated, cold. But I liked the fact that I didn’t like the story. In my experience, adapting something that you think is a bit flawed allows you more freedom because you’re not too respectful to the material. Sometimes you need to be unafraid to break it and make something new.View image in fullscreen‘I liked the fact that I didn’t like the original story’ … Jethro Compton.Photograph: Marc BrennerDarren Clark:When it was a show for five performers, often only two of those people were playing instruments in any number. That first version had spirit and soul, but it didn’t have the depth of the story we wanted to tell.Philippa Hogg:I’d just worked with Darren on another show and in 2018 he asked me to record a demo for Benjamin Button. It was The Moon and the Sea. I was like, wow, something special is going on here.Darren Clark:I had been rather badly burned by a previous project that made me want to test my collaborators before getting involved. So when Jethro sent me a lyric I restructured it entirely, set it to music and sent it back. I thought, if this guy can take this, then he’s the kind of guy I want to work with, because it’ll be all about the story. He came back almost immediately, added his own suggestions and the song grew even before we had officially signed a contract.Jethro Compton:After making a lot of work set in America, I wanted to do something closer to home. I thought Cornwall would be a good setting but had never made a musical before … I was terrified about how to even begin!The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttonis at the Ambassadors theatre, London, and the cast recording is available to stream from 16 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndMusicalsF Scott FitzgeraldShareReuse this content"

As a live album captures their 70s peak, their frontman remembers late friend Rick Parfitt – and reconsiders his whole sense of selfWed 14 May 2025 05.48 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 06.23 EDTShareIf you want to contemplate quite how far back Status Quo’s roots go, consider this: the band’s founders came together before the Beatles had released their first single, before the idea of “the band” was even a thing in pop music. They’re often dismissed as one-song wonders, or as proponents of brutally simplistic music – but as much as the Stones or the Who,Status Quoare carved into British rock.Francis Rossi and Alan Lancaster formed the Spectres in 1962, when the guitarist and bassist were still at school. Drummer John Coghlan signed up a year later and Rick Parfitt completed the “Frantic Four” when he joined after sharing a bill with the Spectres at Minehead Butlin’s in 1966. The Beatles showed Rossi not just what he could do with his life, but touched something very primal in him.“Everybody liked them,” he says, “and I must have been a wimpy kid, and I terribly wanted to be liked. Still do in some ways. That’s quite sad. But we tried to emulate them – that’s where we wanted to go.” Over 60 years on, he’s not there yet, despite the end of his iconic partnership with Parfitt, who died aged 68, in 2016. “I don’t know what else to do. I’m obsessed by it all, and I just keep going.”Rossi, everyone says, doesn’t like talking about the past. He doesn’t have much choice today, because we’re talking as Quo prepare to reissue the 1977 album Live!, recorded in Glasgow when the band were at their peak as a rock band: when their force and power was as blunt and brutal as the Stooges, but without the nihilism, and with added massive hit albums and singles.View image in fullscreenAlan Lancaster, Rick Parfitt and Francis Rossi of Status Quo performing in Rotterdam in 1981.Photograph: Rob Verhorst/RedfernsThe first was in 1968, with the ersatz psychedelia ofPictures of Matchstick Men. “We weren’t very happy being dressed-up pop stars. And our tour manager, Bob Young, said, ‘Well, why don’t you change?’ So we grew our hair long, got rid of the clothes and put on jeans and T-shirts. And boogie was the right music to play.”For Rossi, the boogie style – the tough, hard rock version of the 12-bar blues, exemplified by songs such asWhatever You WantorRoll Over Lay Down– also tied in with the shuffling Italian music he grew up with in south London. “There are so many things in our lives that are shuffles, even nursery rhymes – Nellie the Elephant. Our marches do that. It appealed to me and it still does.” That was crossed with what he was hearing on the university circuit Quo were playing. “We used to work with Fleetwood Mac a lot on the uni circuit,” Rossi says. “You could sit down beside the stage and they’d start playing – der-der, der-der – for an hour and a half. We wanted to do that, to be that.”Quo were constantly written off as “heads down, no-nonsense, mindless boogie”, Rossi says, and were parodied as such by Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias on a 1978 single. But there’s more to them than that. Their 1975 No 1Down Down, with its multiple sections, is like the Paranoid Android of 12-bar boogie, or consider that What You’re Proposing was one of two consecutive Top 20 hits – along with Living on an Island – about cocaine-addicted alienation. The latter, written by Parfitt, was speaking plainly about waiting for people to come to Jersey with drugs for him. The former, by Rossi, was more allusive but its theme was evident. “I used to believe what I read in the press, that there was nothing to the lyrics,” Rossi says. “But then I’d read them and think, ‘That was about my first wife, that was about such and such.’ In doing it, I think it’s far too” – he pulls a face to suggest a highfalutin intellectual – “to say, ‘I’m going to write about this now.”But the truth will out, nonetheless. “That’s what I think, yes.”The new reissue of the live album – the full sets from all three nights at the Glasgow Apollo in October 1976 – could really have been recorded anywhere and at any point during the mid-70s. For a start, their set didn’t change a whole lot through those years: “We had a good set and we stuck to it,” drummer Coghlan says. “And it meant I didn’t have to look at a set list.” And, second, Quo worked so hard through those years that they were like a juggernaut, night after night. “They weren’t afraid of hard work, and they got their heads down,” says Bob Young, their tour manager. “We were just one of those bands that liked playing,” Coghlan says, plainly.One of the curiosities of Quo is that its members almost always co-wrote, and they didn’t look far for co-writers. Young has his name on a bunch of Quo’s biggest hits, which must have made him the highest-earning tour manager in rock history. Young laughs at the thought, though accepts it was probably true: “I ended up in the unique position of being tour manager, songwriter and harmonica player.”View image in fullscreenRick Parfitt in 1979.Photograph: Fin Costello/Getty ImagesBut, as time went on, the writing with others reflected the fact they weren’t getting along with each other. “It got to a point where we should have taken some time off, maybe three or four months,” Coghlan says. But they didn’t. Coghlan left in 1982, kicking over his drum kit during a recording session and walking out without a word, sick of his bandmates. Lancaster, who had formed the band with Rossi, departed after the End of the Road tour in 1984. And Parfitt was haunted by insecurities about his status within the band – specifically about having always been viewed as No 2 in the group to Rossi, who stood centre stage and took most of the vocals.“He was my greatest friend, but someone” – Rossi can’t say who – “got to him. Somebody knew it was a weakness with him. And as we got older it got worse and worse. I always saw it as the two of us, because we made a great pair – and I think we were a bit unfair on the rest of them. We would sit in the car and hold hands and dress the same just to wind people up, and I think certain people decided to get between the two of us.”Rossi, plainly, is an unusual person. “Francis has always been his own man,” Young says. “He’ll say what he wants; he hasn’t got a lot of filter, like it or not.” In his autobiography, Rossi mentions his tendency to say inappropriate things and cause offence, and says he doesn’t visibly grieve the deaths of those he has loved, including Parfitt. I mention to him that those were both traits of mine, that I obsessed over until being diagnosed as neurodivergent and learning they were common behaviours: a lack of grief is related to object impermanence about people. Has he, I ask as delicately as I can, ever been tested?He looks not horrified but fascinated. “You’re the first person that’s ever broached that at all. And now there are loads of things going on in my mind, because that would explain …” He starts to talk about the deaths of his mother and father, how he poked at his mother’s body to be sure she was gone, how when he was told his father had died he just wanted to check on the arrangements for his own perfectly normal working day: “I said, ‘Is the car coming to pick me up?’ And it makes me feel like I’m cold. But if I’m in a situation and I’m told what I’m supposed to do, I can’t do it. I’m supposed to grieve, I’m supposed to say certain things. And I will be thinking, ‘I shouldn’t say that, that’s not appropriate.’ It’s interesting, what you said. I never thought about that before.”View image in fullscreenRossi playing with Status Quo in 2016.Photograph: Christie GoodwinRossi, 76 in May, isn’t going to give up anytime soon. He outlines his plans for the next couple of years, talking about how he still loves playing to an audience. And he says something else, something familiar from my parents’ generation of working-class people who grew up to be comfortable, but aware of their past. “The thing that worries me constantly is: will I have enough money if I stop now and there’s no more income? I’m scared shitless of that.”Of course Francis Rossi is not going to die in penury, but it’s a comment that shows he’s a more complex man than the jeans and waistcoats and winks to camera ever hinted at. Just as Status Quo were a more complex group than anyone who claimed they only had one song could ever understand.The 8-CD expanded reissue of Status Quo / Live! is out on 16 May on Edsel Records.Francis Rossi is currently touring the UKExplore more on these topicsStatus QuoPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But her painful renditions of a-ha and Pearl Jam aren’t just cringe – they signal a much bigger problemStuart HeritageWed 14 May 2025 07.21 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 20.22 EDTShareThis week’s episode ofThe Last of Uscontained a moment that froze the blood. For a split second, the hearts of the viewing audience rose into their throats in horror. This is a show that has presented us with terror after nightmarish terror but, even by these exceptional standards, this was almost too much to bear. I am talking, of course, about the scene where Ellie started playing a Pearl Jam song on a guitar.Within the broader world of The Last of Us, the song – entitled Future Days – is of enormous importance. If you’ve played the game, you’ll know the scene it hints at. It’s devastating. You’ll also know that, if the show hews closely to the source material, the general theme of guitars will eventually reduce the audience to emotional husks, teeing up the saddest, most hopeless ending to any major piece of storytelling in years.But if you haven’t played the game, the sight of Ellie picking up a guitar for the second time in as many weeks will have been a cause for alarm. Last week’s episode ground to a standstill so Ellie could sing Take on Me by a-ha all the way through, and the worry was that the same thing would happen again. And, without wanting to sound like one of those dismal review-bombers, I didn’t sign up for no musical.The fact that there could have even potentially been two consecutive acoustic sing-along episodes is indicative of a bigger problem with the shape of season two. It finds itself falling between two stools. On one hand, Joel is dead. He died in episode two, in what is likely to be the high point of the entire series. On the other hand, season three will turn the whole show on its head. Again, if it sticks to the blueprint laid out by the game, the focus will turn to Abby, the young woman who killed Joel. It promises to be a bravura piece of storytelling, recontextualising a character who seems like a complete monster.But now we find ourselves stuck in the doldrums. We have had three episodes without Joel or Abby, leaving us with the story of Ellie going to Seattle to get her revenge. And, boy, those three episodes have dragged. There have been meandering side plots about religious cults, long soliloquies by Jeffrey Wright, a love story that might be sweet but feels relatively unearned and, of course, the entirety of Take On Me by A-Ha played on an acoustic guitar.The biggest problem is Dina. As Ellie’s love interest, she should play an important role in the show, awakening her to a world beyond pure survival. This is something the show knows how to do, the stand-alone season one episode starring Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett being a shining example. But right now Dina feels a little grafted on, like a makeshift Joel replacement who exists solely to prevent the show from turning into a series of episodes where Ellie grunts in a succession of corridors by herself.View image in fullscreenDina gazes on adoringly as Ellie sings a-ha’s Take on Me … in full.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.Again, this might all pay off down the line. Dina, Abby, the cults, even the guitars will eventually have satisfying conclusions. But we’re talking a long way down the line. This week it was revealed that season three of The Last of Us won’t start filming until next year. Given that there has typically been a year and a half gap between filming and broadcast, this means that we’re expected to hold all these glimpses and hints in our heads until the last half of 2027.The Last of Us has two episodes left this season. One of them will be a stand-alone story about a character who, in the game, is seen only as a photograph. There’s a good chance that the episode will be sweet and moving, but it doesn’t offer a lot of hope in terms of plot propulsion. We’re still left with the sense that The Last of Us has been spinning its wheels since Joel’s death.Perhaps, in the grander scheme of things, this stretch was always designed as a breather, a resting spot between the intensity of what has been and what’s yet to come. But given the yawning chasm between seasons, that breather is starting to look a little like suspended animation. Let’s hope things pick up in 2027.Explore more on these topicsThe Last of UsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Much has been made of the fact that the year’s most recent breakout hit, an idiosyncratic role-playing game called Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, was made by a small team. (It has just sold its two-millionth copy). It’s a tempting narrative in this age ofblockbuster mega-flops,live-service gamesandeye-watering budgets: scrappy team makes a lengthy, unusual and beautiful thing, sells it for £40, and everybody wins. But it’s notquiteaccurate.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Sandfall Interactive, the game’s French developer, comprises around 30 people, butas Rock Paper Shotgun points out, there are many more listed in the game’s credits – from a Korean animation team to the outsourced quality assurance testers, and the localisation and performance staff who give the game and its story heft and emotional believability.Compared to the enormous teams who make the Final Fantasy games – a clear inspiration for Sandfall – Clair Obscur’s team is minuscule. The more interesting achievement isn’t that a small team has made a successful game – it’s that a small team has made the most extravagantly French thing any of us will ever play. Much to my partner’s annoyance, I’ve set the voice language to French with English subtitles, just to enhance the immersion.In Clair Obscur’s belle époque-inspired world, a sinister entity called the Paintress daubs a number on a distant totem every year, descending from 100 – and every person of that age dissolves heartbreakingly into petals and dust, leaving behind devastated partners and orphaned children. (This andNevaare the only games in recent memory to make me shed a tear at theirbeginning.) The game starts as the Paintress counts down from 34 to 33, and an expedition of brave and slightly magic thirtysomethings from the dwindling population sets out, as they do every year, to sail across to the Paintress’s continent and try to kill her and stop the cycle. I was sad to leave this opening area, because the city was so beautiful, and everyone wasimpeccablydressed. Also, nothing was trying to kill me every few minutes.View image in fullscreenThe most French thing you’ll ever play … Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.Photograph: Sandfall InteractiveMany expeditions have gone before. You find their grisly remnants all over the place as you explore, their recorded diaries left to help whoever comes next. You start off in a kind of ravaged Paris, the Eiffel Tower distorting towards a distant horizon like a Dalí painting. The game looks like a waltz through a distinguished art museum that’s about to get sucked into a black hole. One early area of the continent is a waterless ocean, the wrecked vessel of one expedition wrapped around a dead leviathan of a sea creature, fronts of seaweed waving in the nonexistent currents. It’s beautiful but extremely dangerous: you quickly have to get the hang of a pretty complicated combat system to survive even the first few boss fights.Clair Obscur’s fighting is inspired by classic and modern Japanese RPGs: rhythmic and flashy, it lets you supercharge a fireball or dodge the fist of a stone automaton with a well-timed button press. Combining your unusually distinctive characters’ abilities is the key. One of them wields a rapier and changes stance every attack, another attacks with an impenetrable system of sun and moon tarot cards, a third mostly with a gun and a sword. If this all sounds needlessly extravagant, it is – and I love it. The combat menus are a tinkerer’s dream, letting you pore over and combine characters’ esoteric powers and skills to create interesting combo attacks.What I enjoy most about this game is that it doesn’t look like everything else or, indeed, anything else. The majority of games riff on the same few predictable references: Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Marvel. Instead it draws from completely different aesthetic and thematic sources; this is a baroque fantasy that tells a story about fatalism and love and death and legacy, a European-style tale with Japanese-style action and flair. It plays very differently, but its distinctiveness and determination to actuallysaysomething with its story reminds me of last year’s excellentMetaphor: ReFantazio. (There is a strong correlation between intellectually ambitious RPGs and baffling titles, it seems.)Clair Obscur also illustrates just how good game development tools are now: if you’re wondering how a smallish team could create something that looks this high-end, that’s a large part of the answer. This makes me feel pretty optimistic about the future of this middle sector of game development, in between blockbuster and indie. In the 00s and 2010s, that was where many of the most interesting games could be found. I can imagine several large publishers deeming this game simply too French to be marketable, but Sandfall was able to make it anyway. Expedition 33 is an encouraging commercial success that will be cited all year as a counternarrative to the games industry’s prevailing doomsaying, but it’s a creative success, too.What to playView image in fullscreenA thrill a minute … Doom: The Dark Ages.Photograph: BethesdaA new Doom game is out very shortly and reviews suggest that it is a glorious heavy-metal orgy of violence. It has you massacring hordes of gross demons at once, impaling them with spikes, shredding them with a chainsaw-shield, even punching gigantic hellspawn from within a giant robot or shooting at them from the back of a mecha-dragon.Doom:The Dark Agesis slower than the other modern games in the series, with more up-close combat and (as the title suggests) a vaguely medieval flavour to its aesthetic, but it’s still thrill-a-minute.Available on:Xbox, PS5, PCEstimated playtime:20-plus hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenChaos machine … Grand Theft Auto VI.Photograph: Rockstar GamesGrand Theft Auto VI, which is delayed until next May, left a crater in the 2025 release schedule that other game companies are scrambling to fill, reports Bloomberg (viaKotaku).

Two questions: what should I call it and what game would you love to share and discuss in such a setting?”This is an excellent idea, and you’ve reminded me that I tried to do something like this a million years ago as a podcast on IGN, but I cannot for the life of me remember what we called it. Press Pause? Save Point? LFG? I would pick shorter games for a book club-style group (so that everyone could actually play them through), and I’d want ones that leave room for people’s personal histories to inform how they respond to it. I’d love to hear other people talk aboutNeva’s environmentalist and parental themes, or anyLifeIs Strangegame’s mix of emerging-adulthood drama and quasi-successful supernatural storytelling, or even a game likeWhile Waiting, what it made them think about. That would surely be more interesting than simply arguing about whether the latestAssassin’s Creedis any good.I asked my partner what he’d call a video game book club, and he suggested Text Adventure, which is annoyingly better than anything I can think of. My pal Tom suggested Pile of Shame, One More Go and Shared Worlds.

She said Combs was yelling at her and thenthrew a vase at her in the elevator lobby.“I didn’t get hit. I remember it hitting the wall. He was yelling at me and threw it at me,” Venturasaid, adding that Combs told her “that I wasn’t going to leave him there. That I couldn’t.”The jury was then shown two photos of Ventura, that she says she took of herself after the hotel assault where she is seen with a swollen lip. She said she also had a black eye beneath her sunglasses.Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sex-trafficking trial: key takeaways from Cassie Ventura’s first day of testimonyRead moreThe jury was also shown text messages between Combs and Ventura after the assault, where she told him “you’re sick for thinking it’s OK to do what you did to me” and told him that she “had a black eye”.Ventura was asked again about the various escorts she says she was forced to hire, with Combs’s money, to take part in increasingly extreme sexual scenarios over marathon sessions Combs called “freak-offs” – she has named more than a dozen since her testimonybegan on Tuesday.“That was just my job, really. It was expected of me,” she said. She told the court that if she said no to a freak-off or told Combs she didn’t want to do it, “it would be a problem, we’d end up fighting” adding that violence was “always a concern if we weren’t agreeing on something”.In a 2016 text message shown in court, Combs is seen asking Ventura to have a “proper” freak-off without the use of ketamine. Combs claimed that a “successful” freak-off was only “when we remember”, while Ventura noted that she preferred ketamine during “freak-offs” because “it was very dissociative.”Combs would often threaten to release the videos he had of Ventura taking part in the freak-offs, she said. She noted that on her birthday one year, Combs reminded her of the videos he had in his possession after she refused to leave her friends to go with him to a freak-off.“I feared for my career, my family … It is horrible and disgusting, no one should do that to anyone,” she said. “It could ruin everything I worked for, make me look like a slut … I wasn’t supposed to be on those videos. I didn’t want to be in them.”“I felt trapped,” she told the court. “Whatever was going to not make him angry or threaten me I was going to do.”Ventura testified that she would ask Combs to delete videos of freak-offs that were on his phone and that he would tell her he did. She would later see the videos still on his phone.Ventura said she experienced persistent urinary tract infections due to the constant freak-offs. but was still forced to take part even when the pain was “horrible”.After such sessions, Ventura said that she felt “empty” emotionally and “gross”. Sometimes, she said she would leave freak-offs if she felt “unsafe”, but would often return to the hotel room because Combs or one of his employees would find her and bring her back.During some freak-offs Combs would “hit me on the side of the head” and kick Ventura, which she said would prompt escorts – who could hear the violence occurring – to ask her afterward if she was OK. She testified that “it’s impossible to know” how many “freak-offs” she took part in and said the number was in the “hundreds”.“He brought the idea to me when I was 22 and would do anything for him and did,” she said during her emotional testimony on Wednesday afternoon.After their relationship ended in 2018, Ventura said that she never participated in a “freak-off” again. She said that same year, Combs raped her after they were supposed to have a “closure conversation”.She said that they went for dinner, he brought her back to her home, and he came inside. He then “raped me on the living room floor”, she said while crying.“I remember crying and saying no,” she said. “It was fast, his eyes were black, he wasn’t himself, it was like somebody taking something from you.”After that incident, she said that she and Combs were intimate voluntarily one other time.On Combs’s violence outside the freak-offs, Ventura said there was an instance in 2013 when she was in her apartment and Combs tried to attack her. Her two friends, who were in the apartment at the time, “jumped on his back” to protect her. Combs was still able to throw Ventura down, cutting her eyebrow on the corner of her bed.Combs took her to a plastic surgeon’s office in Beverly Hills to fix the cut; Ventura later texted him a photo of the wound “so you can remember”.Ventura told the court that sometimes she fought back against Combs, but that fighting back would lead to “escalating” the fight, which sometimes made “him more violent”. Multiple employees of Combs saw him abusing her over the years, she said, including members of his security team, management and assistants. Ventura even noted that one assistant told her that they quit because of how Combs treated her.She also said Combs, who is 17 years her senior and first met her when she was 19, would often show up unannounced to her apartment.On Wednesday afternoon, Ventura said that Combs was violent with others as well as her, something the jury can expect to hear more about from later witnesses for the prosecution. She told the court that he would assault some of his employees, both male and female, and had also attacked friends of hers, including punching people and throwing them into furniture. He dangled a friend of hers over a balcony, she said.Ventura also testified about her brief relationship with Scott Mescudi, also known as rapper Kid Cudi. She told the court that she dated Mescudi in 2011 during a period where she and Combs were “not in a good place”.When Combs learned she was dating Kid Cudi during a “freak-off”, she said Combs told her that “he was going to hurt” both of them and that he was going to have Kid Cudi’s car blown up.On Ventura’s lawsuit in2023against Combs, which accused him of physical and sexual abuse, the two hadsettled for a previously undisclosed sum. The lawsuit prompted the federal investigation that led to Combs’sarrest in September 2024.During her testimony on Wednesday, Ventura told the court that settlement was for $20m.When asked why she was testifying in this trial, Ventura told the court that she couldn’t “carry this anymore, carry the shame, the guilt anymore … the way I was guided to treat people like they were disposable.”“Right is right and wrong is wrong, I am here to do the right thing,” she said.Ventura is set to take the stand again on Thursday for cross-examination.The 38-year-oldtestified on Tuesdaythat during her decade-long on-and-off relationship with Combs, she endured years of abuse.Combs faces charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations.The trial, expected to last at least eight weeks, is not being televised.If convicted, Combs, who has been jailed since his arrest last year, could spend the rest of his life in prison.In the US, thedomestic violence hotlineis 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

They depict the violent confrontations at the end of the conflict but also show more casual images of celebrating US troops.Kerry Negahban, the head of senior rights and publishing at the Lee Miller archive, said the work also contributed to the US photographer’s depression after she returned to domestic life in Britain.“She really buried it, which is what a lot of people did; I think the phrase was ‘put up and shut up’. She suffered with PTSD, and was very, very depressed after the war, and then she had a child, and had postnatal depression as well,” said Negahban.“So I think she was probably as low as someone could be. She didn’t really even tell her husband much about what she’d seen and done.”Miller’s time from the frontline covering the conflict for Vogue and Life magazine featured in the recent biopic, Lee, whichstarred Kate Winsletas the uncompromising model turned war photographer.View image in fullscreenFall of the Citadel, Aerial bombardment, St-Malo, France 1944 by Lee Miller.Photograph: © Lee Miller Archives, England 2025. All rights reserved. leemiller.co.ukThe unseen images show battlements and beach obstacles in France. But there are also quieter moments. In another a pair of boots are shown poking out of a jeep outside the 44th Evacuation hospital in Normandy during 1944.There is a shot of Lt Col Kenneth Wallace of the 1st Battalion of the US army and Col John Heintges, the then commanding officer of the 7th Regiment, posing on the balcony of the Post hotel in Berchtesgaden, Germany, in 1945.A caption that accompanies the image reveals just how close the conflict was. “The left-hand smoke plume on the mountain behind them is [Adolf] Hitler’s house burning; the right-hand smoke plume is a forest fire or something,” Miller wrote. “At the time the SS were still about.”Miller’s presence on the frontline was not always welcomed. The fact she was a woman meant she faced sexism when trying to get embedded with the US troops, and the Americans placed her under house arrest for three days after the liberation of St-Malo because she was not supposed to be taking shots of the battle.“That’s when she wrote her reports [for Vogue],” said Negahban. “It was actually quite useful.”View image in fullscreenFeet, 44th Evacuation Hospital, Briqueville, Normandy, France 1944 by Lee Miller.Photograph: Lee Miller ArchivesNegahban added that Miller’s “main mission was to get it out to the general public. This is what’s happening; this is how atrocious war is,” which was a message that was initially welcomed in the UK and US, but soon after the war her most brutal images of concentration camps were buried.“The British press didn’t want to put those images in, because it was a victory, and it was felt the public had enough of seeing horrors. Whereas Lee’s point was people are still living these horrors, and you should know this … everyone should know this,” said Negahban.Another photographer at this year’s event who explores themes of conflict is Jesse Glazzard, who along with Eugenia Skvarska, followed thelives of gay Ukrainian soldiersduring the conflict with Russia.View image in fullscreenOleksandr, 2024Photograph: Jesse GlazzardOften captured in their homes, the images are intimate and the antithesis of the usual reportage images of the conflict that are taken on frontlines or in the aftermath of a missile strike.“It felt so important for it to just feel intimate and raw,” said Glazzard. “I just don’t think you see that often, usually it’s those New York Times-style images of soldiers and army personnel.”Captured on film and then reproduced as a Riso print to imitate the look of newsprint and punk zines, the pair shot 10 queer soldiers, many of whom were children when Russia invaded Crimea.Skvarska said the men had decided to take part in the project despite facing potential discrimination or reprisals if they were captured by Russian troops.She said: “One of the main quotes of this project is: ‘If I will die, I will die as a gay man,’ because they found that it’s really important to tell the truth about who they are.”Photo London is at Somerset House in London from14-18 MayExplore more on these topicsLee MillerPhotographyUkraineLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

You know, drank a little bit, never to excess, never any big public demonstrations. I was very quiet and private about it. But it became a dependency for sure.”In 2018, she toldPeople: “I was ahead of the curve of the opiate epidemic. I had a 10-year run, stealing, conniving. No one knew. No one.”From The Substance to Mormon wives: the year pop culture’s stretched, stuffed faces became too strange to ignoreRead moreCurtis has now been sober for 26 years and in 2023 spoke about her journey. “I’m lucky. I didn’t make terrible decisions high or under the influence that then, for the rest of my life, I regret,” shesaid. “There are women in prison whose lives have been shattered by drugs and alcohol, not because they were violent felons, not because they were horrible people, but because they were addicts.”The star has previously expressed concern about the rise of cosmetic procedures. “The current trend of fillers and procedures, and this obsession with filtering, and the things that we do to adjust our appearance on Zoom are wiping out generations of beauty,” Curtissaidin 2021. “Once you mess with your face, you can’t get it back.”This week the actor alsospoke outon social media about a “totally AI fake commercial” which uses her likeness. She implored Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg for help in taking it down.“If I have a brand, besides being an actor and author and advocate, it is that I am known for telling the truth and saying it like it is and for having integrity,” she wrote. “This (MIS)use of my images … with new, fake words put in my mouth diminishes my opportunities to speak my truth. I’ve been told that if I ask you directly, maybe you will encourage your team to police it and remove it. I long ago deleted Twitter, so this is the only way I can think of reaching you.”Later in the day she added: “IT WORKED! YAY INTERNET! SHAME HAS IT’S VALUE! THANKS ALL WHO CHIMED IN AND HELPED RECTIFY!”The 66-year-old won her first Oscar in 2023 for her role inEverything Everywhere All at Once.

It is a departure from the deeper and more complex style of writing expressed in Greene’s better-known psychological and political thrillers including The Third Man, Our Man in Havana, The Power and the Glory, and Brighton Rock.Duel Duet, a collection of Graham Greene’s short stories to be released by Penguin in July.Photograph: Penguin“Greene wasn’t just a masterful novelist, he also excelled at the short story form, producing numerous classics,” said Andrew F Gulli, managing editor of Strand Magazine.“As a huge admirer of Graham Greene, whom I’ve often considered one of the 10 greatest writers of the 20th century, this piece was a personal highlight. It’s especially meaningful given that he published a chilling ghost story,A Little Place Off the Edgware Road, in the original Strand Magazine back in 1939.“While the story featured here may carry less overt menace, it still demonstrates Greene’s remarkable ability to hold a reader’s attention and subtly blur the line between entertainment and drama. Greene is a very serious author, and here there’s humor. It’s a playful yet chilling nod to the great supernatural stylists.”In the story, the protagonist recalls how reading Dracula and horror stories by MR James traumatized him as a child, and from then “he had never enjoyed reading alone in bed anything which might prove ghostly or violent”.So when he finds himself alone in the bedroom of a “strange” rented house on the Côte d’Azur, in the middle of a raging storm, and with only a paperback anthology of stories for company, his old fears come rushing back. In both the creepy story he reads, and the bedroom he is reading it in, there are mysterious scratching noises on the glass of the windows.Gulli said the manuscript was found in archives at the Harry Ransom Center library at the University of Texas at Austin, and was subsequently evaluated and transcribed by Camilla Greene, steward of the Greene literary estate and granddaughter of the writer, who died in 1991.“This eerie gem remained tucked away until now,” Gulli said.“It’s a story you can identify with. Weird things can happen to you when you’re traveling alone, not weird like this story, but I’ve had odd knocks on the door in the middle of the night, or some unusual creaking, or you have a nightmare or something.“It’s kind of like an everyday event andGraham Greene, with his great turn of phrase, his great style, turns it into something where it’s a what-if that can go a little too far, but just far enough to have a lot of interest to it.”The story by Fleming, meanwhile, called The Shameful Dream, is also a separation from the author’s traditional fare. It builds suspense through a series of recollections of previous firings as a London periodical’s literary editor prepares for a potentially fateful meeting with the publication’s overbearing proprietor.“While forever associated with the tuxedoed glamor of 007, Fleming was a talent who could transcend genre,” Gulli said.“This piece has no martinis, no Aston Martins and no villains bent on world domination. It’s a quietly unsettling story about a washed-up journalist wrestling with the dread of an invitation to a sadistic media mogul’s mansion, a tale more literary than spy thriller, revealing Fleming’s lesser-known capacity for irony and sharp social observation.”The story will also feature inTalk of the Devil, a collection of Fleming’s writings incorporating short-form fiction, travel essays, lectures, and correspondence with his friend and crime novelist Raymond Chandler, set to be published later this month.In July, 22 of Greene’s short stories will feature in another new collection, calledDuel Duet, published by Penguin.Duel Duet by Graham Greene (Vintage Publishing, £18.99).

We have so much to be proud of in the UK: our tolerance, our innovative spirit, our creativity, our humour, our sense of fairness. But I think that unless we act, we will drift, becoming weaker, less trusting, less competitive.”Ministers demand BBC World Service plan for cuts as aid budget slashedRead moreIn a rapidly changing media world in whichless than half of young people watch live TV each week, Davie said the days of the “old priesthood” of broadcasters deciding and controlling what information people consumed were over. However, he said that it had meant “disinformation is thriving”.“There is no doubt that this new age is fostering polarisation and threatening communal trust and putting more power in the hands of global social media platforms,” he said. “We see profound changes in people’s trust in the information that they receive … Many feel there is no agreed backbone of facts upon which to base constructive deliberation.“Those we disagree with become enemies, not friends who think differently. Empathy withers without understanding.”Davie’s address in effect served as the first major salvo in lengthy talks over how the BBC will be changed as its charter is up for renewal. With the future of the licence fee continuing to be in question, Davie pitched the BBC as a rare unifying force.He revealed plans to “dramatically increase” the amount of BBC News content on YouTube and TikTok, both of which were platforms where disinformation could flourish, he said. He said the BBC was “not being dragged there”, but wanted to reach the audiences using the platforms.He said: “In the election, we found enormous numbers of young people coming to [BBC Verify] factcheckers because they were just confused. We think [putting] things like that into YouTube will be very powerful.”However, after the Guardian revealed that the BBC had been asked byministers to draw up cuts to the World Service, Davie issued a direct challenge to the government – instead demanding “hundreds of millions” more to boost the World Service at a time when Russia and China alone are spending billions on their state-run media channels, designed to influence world opinion.“When it comes to funding the World Service, we do need help,” he said. “There’s never been a more important time to invest in this priceless national asset. We believe the UK should be ambitious about its future, and the government should invest for significant growth, not survival … We’ve got to make a decision as a country, are we in this game or not?”While he maintained that turning the BBC into a subscription service or one supported by advertising revenue were his red lines in talks with ministers, he suggested that a universal licence fee could be renamed, modernised or adapted.It suggests the BBC may be looking at whether wealthier households could pay more. “We keep an open mind and we continue to actively explore all options that can make our funding model fairer, more modern and more sustainable,” he said.After theGuardian highlighted the crisis inside the TV industry, Davie also backed greater tax breaks for vulnerable areas of television.He expressed his disapproval about a social media post briefly shared by Gary Lineker on Instagram that was labelled “Zionism explained in two minutes” and featured an illustration of a rat – historically used as an antisemitic insult and used in Nazi Germany to characterise Jews.“The BBC’s reputation is held by everyone and when someone makes a mistake, it costs us,” he said. “I think we absolutely need people to be exemplars of the BBC’s values and follow our social media policy.

I’m OK. I’m OK.’ And she really clocked that in a really deep way.”Naomi then went upstairs. Ashley said she later followed to check on her mother and “saw that she had harmed herself”.“I spent the next whatever it was – half-hour – just holding my mother and talking to her,” Ashley said on the program. “And the first thing I said to her was: ‘It’s OK, I’ve seen how much you’ve been suffering.’“And we just breathed together, and I talked to her and told her how much I loved her, and it’s OK to go.”Ashley continued: “When she died, my earnest wish was to make sure that she was relieved and absolved of her guilt and her shame. I was holding her hand. I was kissing her. She was so soft. She smelled so pretty.“It was like this final consummation of the love in the relationship that we had transformed. What an honor, to be born in this human life, to be chosen by her. I got to hold space – I got to bookend. And I’m just so glad I was there.”Ashley Juddspoke to the Guardianin early 2023 about undergoing a physically and mentally taxing type of psychotherapy known asEMDR– which involves patients moving their eyes in a specific way while they process traumatic memories – as she grappled with the aftermath of her mother’s death.It was like this final consummation of the love in the relationship that we had transformedAshley Judd in The Judd Family: Truth Be ToldShe said her treatment was made more complicated than it otherwise could have been by the fact that a tabloid published graphic photographs depicting the scene of Naomi’s death. The outlet also ran a photo of a Post-it note at the scene suggesting that Naomi’s other daughter – fellow country singer Wynonna, Ashley’s sister – would not be allowed at the funeral, though she ultimately did attend.Those pieces violated standards on how to safely and responsibly report on deaths like that of Naomi, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention said at the time.Nonetheless, the tabloid ran that material after outlets obtained it through public records requests issued to the first responders who were called out to the site of Naomi’s death.Naomi Judd’s daughters and her widower, the former Elvis Presley-backing vocalist Larry Strickland, laterpushed for Tennessee’s state legislatureto limit what authorities should have to release in non-criminal deaths. The restrictions they proposed were relatively similar to ones in place in California and Florida, which are generally considered to be public records-friendly.A statement on Tuesday from Judd family representatives said that effort “effectively died” after the legislature’s attention became occupied by a shooting that killed three nine-year-old children and three adults at Nashville’s Covenant school in March 2023. The attacker who carried out the slayings at the school was killed by police, too.Born Diana Ellen Judd in Ashland, Kentucky, Naomi Judd was working as a nurse before she and Wynonna began to sing together. Their blending of acoustic music, bluegrass and blues earned them a devoted following. And it also propelled the duo to 14 No 1 hits and five Grammy wins over nearly three decades performing.Unfortunately for her, in 1991, at the peak of her and Wynonna’s popularity, Naomi Judd was diagnosed with hepatitis. She said she was forced to stop performing, and her mental state deteriorated significantly before dying one day away from being inducted alongside Wynonna into theCountryMusic Hall of Fame in Nashville.“Our matriarch was dogged by an unfair foe,” the Judd family had previously said in a statement.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineat 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

It’s a chance for fans who haven’t seen the band to see them, or at least for some of them to … there’s no plan for any new music.”The tour, which reunites the Gallagher brothers after years of fractious relations and verbal sniping in the press, will kick off on 4 July in Cardiff, and encompass 41 dates across the UK, Ireland, North America, east Asia, Australia and South America.There was phenomenal demand for tickets, with millions queuing online – and some consternation when fans were forced to pay more than they were expecting, thanks to dynamic pricing technology.McKinlay is co-director of management company Ignition, who have managed Oasis since 1993, and is also the director of Oasis’s label Big Brother.He added: “Probably the biggest and most pleasing surprise of the reunion announcement is how huge it was internationally. Honestly, we knew it would be big here, and that doesn’t take much intuition. But looking outside the UK, we knew they had a strong fanbase, we did all the stats. We were quite cautious about what that would mean when it came to people actually buying tickets but we were just bowled over by how huge it was. We could have sold out half a dozen Rose Bowls in Pasadena and probably eight MetLife stadiums in New York in a day.”Gallagher brothers perform together for first time in 16 years in London members’ clubRead moreIn the run-up to the tour, Oasis recently reissued their single Some Might Say in a vinyl edition. A reissue of debut album Definitely Maybe for its 30th anniversary took them back to No 1 in September 2024, and their 2010 best-of compilation Time Flies hasn’t left the UK Top 100 since 2017, going as high as No 3 amid the excitement of the reunion announcement.In Aprilit was reportedthat the Gallaghers performed together for the first time since their 2009 split, filming promotional material at a members’ club in north London.Explore more on these topicsOasisLiam GallagherNoel GallaghernewsShareReuse this content"

In one way this doesn’t seem particularly remarkable: Wilson is an esteemed food writer who presumably has a surplus of kitchen utensils crammed into her bulging cupboards. This tin, though, was different. For one thing it was heart-shaped. For another, Wilson had used it to bake her wedding cake 23 years earlier, taking care to leave out the cherries because her husband-to-be loathed them. (This now strikes her as ominous: “Maybe a man who was so fussy about cherries was not the man for me.”) Lurking at the back of Wilson’s mind had been the thought that she would soon be using the heart-shaped tin to bake a cake for their silver wedding anniversary. But now here it was, lying dejectedly at her feet and, she couldn’t help noticing, spotted with rust.In this delightful book, part memoir, part anthropological investigation, food writer Wilson explores the way that kitchen objects have the power to move, soothe and even reproach us. There’s the plate you feel compelled to eat off because it makes everything taste nicer, or that bowl you keep but can’t bear to use because it reminds you too much of the person who gave it to you. In the maelstrom of her new living conditions, Wilson worries that she is overdoing the anthropomorphism: there is a big cast-iron knife that she can’t bear to pick up because it is the one her ex-husband always used and “to touch its smooth handle would have felt like holding his hand”.It turns out that Wilson need not have worried that she was, in her words, going “mad” by ascribing personalities and human meaning to bits of wood and stainless steel. Magical thinking, the textbooks reassure her, is a universal aspect of human cultures. It also provides the propulsion for this engaging collection of 30-odd short essays organised around ordinary people’s complicated feelings for egg whisks and apple corers. Among the kitchenalia that Wilson sets before us is a much-loved pressure cooker belonging to a Tuscan diplomat’s wife which saw service after the second world war in Senegal and Mumbai (pressure cookers, incidentally, turn out to be ancient bits of kit, going all the way back to 1679). There’s also a silver toast rack that Wilson’s mother, slipping into Alzheimer’s, is convinced has been stolen by a burglar who wants it for a particularly fancy picnic.Closer to home is a humble red, plastic washing-up bowl. It was a gift from a thoughtful neighbour who spotted that the newly single Wilson was now in charge not only of the cooking for her three hungry children but all the washing up too. The bowl had a cheerful, purposeful look to it, as if urging Wilson to look on the bright side. And it worked: “Every time I looked at it filled with hot sudsy water, I felt that washing up might actually be cool and Danish rather than tedious and mildly oppressive.”A book concerned with rummaging in other people’s kitchen drawers might start to feel claustrophobic, but Wilson is careful to let the light in. She interviews Sasha Correa, a Venezuelan who recalls how for 60 evenings in a row in 2002, her family – five sisters plus their mother and father – went out on to their balcony in Caracas and banged pots for an hour to protest against the authoritarian policies of the country’s president, Hugo Chávez. These “casserole protests” have become a feature throughout Latin America, though recently they have been seen in Europe, too. During the “Kitchenware Revolution” of 2009-2011, Icelandic citizens clashed and clattered in protest at their government’s dire handling of the country’s financial crisis.It is no surprise to learn that Wilson’s obsession with kitchen vernacular has a genetic element. Her grandfather, Norman Wilson, was the production director of Wedgwood during the middle decades of the 20th century. Under his auspices, thousands of dinner plates and gravy boats sailed out into the world in a variety of patterns from the classic Willow to Summer Sky, a beautiful pale pearlescent blue with a white trim. By far and away Mr Wilson’s personal favourite, though, was Kutani Crane, featuring a turquoise crane set against a multicoloured floral arrangement. Although extremely popular with customers, Norman Wilson’s descendants found Kutani Crane fussy and clotted, and competed to offload unwanted heirlooms on each other.Consequently, Wilson admits that she has developed ambivalent feelings about the family china. Recently, she opened another little-used cupboard only to find two Kutani Crane vegetable tureens squatting, dusty, unloved and vaguely malevolent. Despite feeling “strangled” by them, filial obligation had so far stopped her from sending them to the charity shop. Looking at them now, Wilson has a revelation: “What if I had become the Kutani Crane in the marriage?” – in other words, something that her ex-husband felt a grudging duty towards, but not quite enough to keep. In the end, the tureens, unlike the marriage, get a last-minute reprieve. Bundled up into the attic, they are biding their sulky time until Wilson’s children are old enough to decide whether a clean break is in order.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But is there really any point in making them recall these hideous crimes? And why have crucial details been omitted?Lucy ManganWed 14 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 04.26 EDTShareAnother day, another addition to the “point and gasp” school of true crime documentaries; one which adds nothing to our understanding of a terrible crime or of those who committed it, nothing to our safety as individuals or as a society, nothing except our appetite for voyeurism and the normalisation of it. Most true crime documentaries are in this school. Fred & Rose West: A British Horror Story is no exception. Perhaps the sordid, exploitative aspects of the genre are felt more strongly here precisely because it is one of our own stories, and one many of us remember reading about in the papers and seeing on the news as the awful discoveries were made at the time. Usually we watch these films at one remove. We can at least feel we are learning about how terrible America can be, or that a victim who would otherwise be forgotten amid the great mass of victims evil people create has been memorialised. Here, we are more fiercely confronted with our complicity and the weakness of the arguments for watching.The best that can be said about the latest three-part testimony to human depravity is that it is superficial. It does not delve into the one aspect of the 1994 case that has the potential to edify – the backgrounds of the killers, the psychology of their relationship, and whether the world would have been different if they had not met; it also glosses quickly over the system’s failure to prosecute Fred West for rape early on in his murderous career – but neither does it dwell on the baser details of the case, the ones I suspect the officers and relatives interviewed here have in mind when they say how much this experience still haunts them.‘These murders still live with me’: the show that goes inside Fred and Rose West’s ‘house of horrors’Read moreThe first episode – titled simply “Fred” – covers the discovery of the bodies of, eventually, nine young women buried under the patio and in the basement of 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, home to Fred, Rose and the remainder of their 10 children who had not yet been taken into care. The programme gives the impression that the children’s references to their missing sister Heather being buried under the patio had simply become too frequent for the authorities to ignore. In fact, suspicion was primed by the claim of rape of one of the children that led to most going into care, where they were found to have many signs of physical and sexual abuse.View image in fullscreenFred and Rose West.Photograph: NetflixWe hear Fred’s voice on the police interview tapes as he is questioned about why he and Rose never filed a missing person’s report for Heather, who has not been seen since June 1987, and see him in the footage taken by police during his several visits to Cromwell Street to guide them round. He can’t remember the names of all the girls and women he (not Rose, he vehemently and repeatedly attests) bound, tortured, raped, killed and dismembered, but he marks the locations of their bodies as best he can with spray paint. At least one, Shirley Robinson, was heavily pregnant with his baby.The second episode, “Rose”, focuses on the police efforts to find the evidence that would tie her to the killings. There was no way, they felt, that she could not have known about the murders Fred had admitted to committing. The question was how much she was involved and how much they could prove. The safe house they had put her and the older children in was bugged, but she was only ever heard loudly proclaiming her innocence.The final episode outlines the trial. Fred killed himself before his could take place, but Rose stood accused of 10 counts of murder. The Wests’ former nanny Caroline Roberts testified at trial to Rose’s involvement with Caroline’s own kidnapping and subsequent ordeal. It was also proved that Fred was in prison when Charmaine West, his stepdaughter with his first wife (Rena, whom he killed), was murdered. Eventually Rose was unanimously found guilty of all 10 murders and given a life sentence, with the judge emphasising that she should never be considered for parole.And what are we to do with this information? What is the point of a programme that is little more than a bald summarisation of a bleak and terrible tale? This happened, then that happened, then this, then that. So what? What is the point? If you are not even calling proper attention to the many, many times authorities had concerns and could have intervened before nine people (at least – Fred suggested there were many more) died in horrific ways, what are you doing? Reminding us that evil can exist? Also pointless. If it brought a measure of peace to the victims’ relatives interviewed to remember them in public, I’m glad. But beyond that, it’s just a ratings hunt and it stinks.Fred and Rose West: A British Horror Story is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Oedipus at Colonus at the Greek theatre, Syracuse.Photograph: Michele PantanoTheatreReviewOedipus at Colonus/Electra review – a double shot of Sophocles in SicilyGreek theatre,SyracuseTwo searing new productions, performed in a hallowed space by intense ensembles, bring strikingly fresh energy to the ancient dramasChris WiegandWed 14 May 2025 04.20 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 May 2025 04.21 EDTShareConcurrent London productions recently presented Oedipus as a modern politician pledging a new start (Mark Strong in the West End) and as a distant detective investigating a climate catastrophe that jeopardises Thebans’ future (Rami Malek at the Old Vic).Sophocles’ late play Oedipus at Colonus, less commonly known, looks not ahead but backwards. This elegiac tragedy finds the exile reaching the end of his life. The 5,000-strong audience at Syracuse’s ancient outdoor theatre hear Giuseppe Sartori’s barefoot Oedipus before they see him. His wooden staff strikes the steps as he descends among us, down to the front row and on to a stage populated by trees that thicken the woodland around the theatre. “It seems this place is sacred,” announces Antigone (Fotinì Peluso) at the wanderer’s side. That goes for this Sicilian playing space as well as the drama’s setting of Colonus, near Athens.Physically frail, Oedipus is approaching his resting place, yet Sartori strikingly shows us a man who steadily grows stronger not weaker in the face of death. Aside from the dependable Theseus (Massimo Nicolini), the inhabitants of Colonus recoil at his arrival, not just because he traipses across the forbidden ground of the Eumenides. Without even introducing himself, his stain is apparent. One local desperately cleans the dirty footprints this ragged stranger leaves behind him.View image in fullscreenIndelible … Giuseppe Sartori in Oedipus at Colonus.Photograph: Michele PantanoIn the play, Oedipus makes sense of, or rather comes to terms with, a past that is unspeakable – literally so, when he begs not to retread the horrific revelations about his parents. Sartori clutches his cloak around himself, as if covering his modesty, only to reveal a bare chest as the events of the earlier tragedy are unpicked. He discovers that he wields a power in choosing the place of his death and can control the outcome of the battle between his sons. But the play’s most affecting conflict is internal, as Oedipus finds peace with himself and the staff is tossed to one side: “I did what I did unknowingly.”Healing and a sense of purification are at the heart of Canadian Robert Carsen’s taut production using Francesco Morosi’s emotionally direct translation for this season, where plays are performed in Italian with other languages available to audiences via earpieces. Jugs of water are ritually emptied in the orchestra, the space between stage and audience, by the chorus. Or rather, by one of the choruses. As well as the turbulent pack of white-suited men, a sisterhood in verdant gowns arrive to deliver a speech signalling the radiant beauty of Colonus, their words spoken as if intoxicated by its beauty and their bodies posed to evoke green shoots of renewal. The women, too, are given Sophocles’ painful yet moving assessment of the inescapability of suffering and death. Only the decision to lend Oedipus some of their choreography strikes an odd note that weakens the mysterious, secretive quality of his transformative death.Carsen balances the contrasting paces of a play which, with the scheme hatched by Creon (a suavely malevolent Paolo Mazzarelli), momentarily grips like a thriller amid the heavily reflective pronouncements. “Time sees everything,” runs one. As if to remind us, designer Radu Boruzescu’s tall trees, planted on a stage of tiered rows akin to the hillside audience’s, observe it all throughout.View image in fullscreenHer pain twists through her … Sonia Bergamasco as Electra.Photograph: Franca CentaroThe resilient forest of Colonus is a stark contrast to Gianni Carluccio’s set design for Electra, the second tragedy in the season at Syracuse. Carluccio’s stage is sloped rather than stepped; much of the drama plays out on a tilted floor that resembles a building’s collapsed exterior. The fall of the house of Atreus.The dust-covered piano and busted bedstead give a sense that Electra still resides in a world before the brutal replacement of Agamemnon with Aegisthus at Clytemnestra’s side. The windows, at this angle, become open graves; a plaintive string composition reverberates from within alongside the looped sound of broken glass. The scorched slabs at the back of the set begin to resemble fragments, too, of papyri.Under Roberto Andò’s direction, this piercing new translation by Giorgio Ieranò sharpens Electra’s affinity with the natural world. Her opening speech (“O pure sunlight”) is given at the piano. In the title role, Sonia Bergamasco is as indelible as Sartori’s Oedipus – her pain similarly twisting through her gestures (one knee is bandaged and she moves like a wounded animal) while her mind logically processes her father’s actions. Dressed in ragged grey, she seems to merge with the floor when she lies still but is otherwise a frenzy of rebellion. A similar heat rises from a hair-flicking, often hissing female chorus in shift dresses. The sight of the urn supposedly containing Orestes’ ashes is felt in the gut: she crumples from within, tenderly caressing the object as if it was his body.View image in fullscreenThe fall of the house of Atreus … Electra.Photograph: Franca CentaroIt’s frequently asked why Orestes extends Electra’s pain, fussily stage-managing his return, but Roberto Latini gives us a brother who after coolly planning the events is stunned by their reunion, almost unable to fathom it himself, fearful of her reaction. The moment is richly complex. Unlike Brie Larson inthe recent London production, Bergamasco succeeds throughout in entwining the anger with grief. She is a sardonic match, too, for Clytemnestra (Anna Bonaiuto) who detonates the lines: “Being a mother is a frightful thing. For as much as they hate you, there is no way to hate your own children.” This Electra is as physically disgusted as Hamlet is by the mother’s “enseamèd bed”.A sense of contest is inseparable from Sophocles’ work, which was regularly entered in Athenian competitions, and one of the play’s toughest scenes to conquer is Paedagogus’s action-packed fabrication detailing Orestes’s death in a chariot race. Danilo Nigrelli steers the speech superbly, only the wind to be heard during each pause, its transfixing effect heightened by a chorus who inch closer towards the teller. You almost believe the lie yourself and reach the edge of your seat as Electra’s stasis is succeeded by a swift and ruthless revenge.The Greek theatre’ssummer programmeruns until 6 July in Syracuse, Italy.

All the fuss is justified. Set against the impending execution of Anne Boleyn, 1536 is an effortlessly funny, bold and ballsy play, which asks the question: just how much have things really changed for women today?View image in fullscreenCaptive for too long … Liv Hill in 1536.Photograph: Helen MurrayWhile the historical backdrop is dramatic, this is largely a play of small and arresting moments. Max Jones’s stark set – full of long lush grass and empty horizons – never changes. We’re in a forgotten field in Essex, where three female friends meet, talk, prod and tease each other. The long grass blows and the sky, thanks to Jack Knowles’ emotive lighting, seems to throb with the promise of other, grander lives playing out somewhere far away.It might have felt a bit static were it not for Pickett’s brilliant eye for detail and three captivating central performances. There’s midwife Mariella who – rather refreshingly – hates her job and whom Tanya Reynolds imbues with a bristling, fragile competence. Liv Hill is lovable and loathable as “good girl” Jane, who longs for marriage and brims with anxiety, vulnerability and – as the plot darkens – something steely and ugly too.At the heart of things is Siena Kelly’s thunderbolt of a character, Anna. Practically half the scenes begin with her thrust up against a tree, as she dangles her sexuality in front of men like a horribly dangerous toy. She’s selfish. Brave. Naive. Knowing. As news of Boleyn’s awful fate reaches these three women, Kelly’s Anna seems to physically bolt and buck against the world – a wild horse frantic at being kept in captivity for far too long.‘I don’t buy it’ … Ava Pickett on her play about Anne Boleyn’s treason and incestRead moreDirected with wit and vigour byLyndsey Turner, 1536 is both an easy and a deeply unsettling watch. The contemporary parallels sometimes feel slightly overplayed and, dare I say it, I could have seen more of the men. When they do appear, the scenes glimmer with menace and we are plunged into a world where even the slightest gesture – the refusal to eat a sweet, say – feels fraught with an all-too recognisable danger.At theAlmeida, London, until 7 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreAlmeida theatreLyndsey TurnerMonarchyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Hallow Road is the kind of property that often emerges after a spell on Hollywood’s “Black List” of much admired but as yet unproduced screenplays. It is a gripping, real-time suspense thriller with a twist of the macabre, a film about family guilt and the return of the repressed, written by National Film and Television School graduate William Gillies, a scary-movie enthusiast who here makes his feature script debut. British-Iranian film-maker Babak Anvari directs and Matthew Rhys andRosamund Pikegive forthright, excellent performances as the two leads.Rhys plays Frank, a stressed executive married to Mads (Pike), a paramedic. They have one child, Alice, a troubled and vulnerable student played by Megan McDonnell who only appears in the film as a terrified voice on the end of the phone – that being a jarring contrast to her perky leave-a-message voice which her anguished parents keep reaching. Her smiling face which comes up on their phone is also, we can assume, a jarring contrast to her actual face.Frank and Mads are tensely alone together in the family home, because Alice stormed off hours earlier after a colossal row, taking her dad’s car, driving down Hallow Road in the middle of a remote forest favoured by local youths as a location for weed-smoking, adored for its legendary associations with paganism. It is from there that the terrified Megan calls her mum; something terrifying has happened and her parents need to get there.Almost the entirety of the film is taken up with Frank and Mads in Mads’s car, a kind of dashcam cinema which owes something toSteven Knight’s ultra-lo-fi Locke from 2014, which showed Tom Hardy as a construction engineer trying to rebuild his life from the wheel of his car with his mobile on speakerphone. They are frantically calling her, giving instructions, trying to keep it together, wheedling, being stern, rowing with each other, ineffectively suppressing their panic, changing their minds about what to do, at first content not to call an ambulance in case their beloved daughter gets into the kind of official trouble that will ruin her life and theirs, too. Frank, who has always spoiled and indulged Alice, starts planning a cover-up and as they get closer to the forest, they approach the dark centre of their own secrets.A spoilsport might notice that Frank and Mads appear to be the last parents left in the UK who don’t monitor their child’s whereabouts on their “Find my Phone” app, but this is a really exhilarating, disturbing picture which foregrounds excellent writing and performances.Hallow Road is in UK and Irish cinemas from 16 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsThrillersRosamund PikereviewsShareReuse this content"

The narrator, a young woman who considers herself unexceptional, recalls a break in a water main at the big roundabout, a rupture that revealed “white quartz pebbles being washed clean, rattling as they went like in any stream bed”. The surfaces we have built on the face of the Earth to sustain us are just that, only surfaces, easily cracked open to show what’s roiling beneath.And this is how it is at the end of the world in Water in the Desert Fire in the Night. The setup for this slender, evocative debut will be eerily familiar to all its readers, albeit with the disaster quotient kicked up a notch. A pandemic arises and begins its cull, only this one is unstoppable: it results in whole streets full of the dead. Those who survive – and we don’t know why they do – must stick together, and so this is a tale of unlikely alliances between a group of travellers determined to reach a refuge in the south of France, a place called Digne-les-Bains.One of this scrappy band, an older woman called Sarah, had spent time there in the 1970s – according to her it is an “epicentre of practical possibilities for the new world of disorder”, with hot springs, rich forests, wild mushrooms, plentiful deer. Like Cormac McCarthy’s The Road or Octavia E Butler’s Parable of the Sower, this is the novel of a journey both away from and toward. Its originality lies in the appeal of the narrative voice, one of millennial diffidence that is still somehow salted with optimism. “So, to be straight: I didn’t see it coming, I don’t know why it happened, and I don’t know what’s going to happen.”Dick creates a world where everything has not quite fallen apart, though we know that real collapse can’t be far awayDick creates a world where everything has not quite fallen apart, not yet, though we know that real collapse can’t be far away. One might argue that there are three vantage points from which to consider societal destruction, whatever its source. There’s the moment of violent change – HG Wells’s The War of the Worlds fits this pattern. There is radical alteration long established, as in Margaret Atwood’sThe Handmaid’s Tale. And there is the space just past seismic change, when a novel’s characters acknowledge what is gone, still recall how things used to be, must find their feet in a new and frightening reality – Ben Smith’sDoggerlandcomes to mind. Water in the Desert falls into this category, prompting the reader to wonder: how will I fare when things go belly-up?So it’s easy to identify with the narrator as she goes along for the ride of survival. Along with Sarah – a retired midwife, which comes in handy – and the narrator are the charismatic Pressure Drop, a Dubliner who has turned to Rastafarianism, and the young and idealistic Adi. They leave London for the Sussex coast and prepare to cross the Channel; there they encounter Martin, whose practicality will aid the expedition and who will capture the narrator’s heart. “I don’t believe in love at first sight, but actually whether you believe in something or not has nothing to do with whether or not it exists.” Yet these characters never feel fully rounded; there is something thin about them as they make their way towards imagined safety. The narrative can stray towards the obvious, as when one suffers a minor injury – something that would once have been easily treatable but now proves fatal. It’s hard to be moved by this death, which feels instrumental; designed to prove a point, rather than emotionally true.One of the most compelling characters in the book sits firmly in flashback: the narrator’s late mother Heike, born in East Germany, married to an Englishman, who made a life for the family in Cuba before settling in London. She is just the kind of person you’d want around at the end of the world, but a memory must suffice. “Even as a mortified teenager I knew that it wasn’t just right the way we lived, it was cool. And it made an amazing backdrop, because it was beautiful through and through: her rows of jars of many-coloured pickles and preserves; her allotment overflowing with everything worth growing; the cover of a thousand mends that she crocheted for the sofa that was in the house when we arrived, and was still in it twenty-odd years later when I left.”The destination isn’t the point of this novel; it is the journey. Somehow, hope endures. “There’s only forward, and you can only go forward from where you are, however wrecked that place is.” Words to live by, these days.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s the late 1980s, protesting students have shut down the campus and now, midway through a tense meeting, someone has set off the fire alarm. But here’s the thing, Gallaudet University in Washington DC is the world’s first deaf university. The students can have a conversation just fine with the alarms blaring – in sign language. But trustee chair Jane Bassett Spilman does not sign. In fact, she appears to be completely ignorant about deaf culture – and, dressed like a Margaret Thatcher lookalike, all handbags and helmet hair, she is the easy-to-loathe villain of this fascinating documentary.Co-directed by actor and deaf activist Nyle DiMarco with Davis Guggenheim, this is the story of an eight-day student protest at Gallaudet in 1988. Trouble started when the board, led by Spilman, appointed a hearing person as the university’s president, over two deaf candidates. The film’s heroes are the four students who led the uprising: Bridgetta Bourne-Firl, Jerry Covell, Greg Hlibok and Tim Rarus; they are entertainingly interviewed here. With a blend of archive footage and re-enactments the film-makers skilfully recreate the urgency, passion and energy of their protest.In the end, the students won and Gallaudet appointed its first ever deaf president,I King Jordan. Fascinating, too, is the shift in attitudes. What Spilman and her cronies represented was an old mindset that deafness was something to be fixed, that deaf people needed to helped; the students had grown up with that audism. One former student describes being smacked with a ruler at school if he signed, another explains that his deaf grandfather told him not to sign in public. But their generation were done with it. Their energy and spirit of resistance are glorious.Deaf President Now! is on Apple TV+ from 16 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsDeafness and hearing lossUS universitiesHealthreviewsShareReuse this content"

Doubt it,” he says.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Fast forward a couple of days and we’re in a park ranger’s motorboat bumping around the far-flung Lastovo archipelago in the Adriatic. All its 46 islands (including the main Lastovo island), islets and reefs weredeclared a nature park in 2006. By luck, I’m with the ornithologist whose discovery of the nesting sites of some of the Mediterranean’s most endangered birds – yelkouan and Scopoli’s shearwaters – was instrumental in Lastovo getting the official protection it deserves.Croatia map updatedBetween Robert Crnković, a retired army officer turned full-time ornithologist who surveys the birds here several times a year, and Alexandra Horvat, Lastovo nature park’s head ranger, I’m getting a crash course in the region’s birdlife and biodiversity. Robert points to our right. “Oh look – shearwaters! You can see them sniffing the water. They’re searching for food.” He mentions that yelkouan and Scopoli’s shearwaters are breeding on the islet within sight of my holiday apartment. “Maybe at night you can hear them calling like a baby crying … ”View image in fullscreenMary Novakovich spotting shearwaters with Robert Crnković.Photograph: Adam BatterbeeThat’s one mystery solved. Here on one of Croatia’s most remote inhabited islands – next stop, Italy – I am uncovering Lastovo’s secrets. Time slows down on that terrace as I watch life go by in Zaklopatica Bay – fishers cleaning their catches, older ladies chortling after a boozy lunch, young boys driving and mooring their boats. Ladders and steps along the quayside turn the bay into one giant swimming pool, where I jump into impossibly clear waters. On the horizon is bigger, busier Korčula.On the northern coast, wooded cliffs and the shearwater-inhabited islet give Zaklopatica bay plenty of natural shelter. Three waterside restaurants do a roaring trade feeding the yachting crowd.I’m getting a sense of Lastovo’s fragility, and the battle to keep it from going the way of other parts of Croatia’s overdeveloped coast and islandsAmong measures introduced to protect the marine ecosystem, particularly the posidonia seagrass, is a system of “ecological mooring”, using buoys instead of anchors. Boats need an entrance ticket to enter the archipelago too, while rangers look out for illegal fishing and diving, and maintain 125 miles (200km) of footpaths and hiking trails on a hilly island that’s 70% covered in forests.I’m quickly getting a sense of Lastovo’s fragility, and the battle to keep it from going the way of other parts of Croatia’s overdeveloped coast and islands. Despite its natural park status, there are fears things could change. Diana Magdić in the tourist office worries the protection may not be enough, and estimates that Lastovo has about 10 years before unscrupulous developers exhaust other areas and try to do the same here.View image in fullscreenThe town of Lastovo.Photograph: Adam BatterbeeFor now, the island remains gloriously unspoilt. Lastovo town lies a few hundred metres inland from the coast – this distance was useful centuries ago, when marauding pirates brought violence and fear to locals’ lives. The village’s 15th- and 16th-century stone houses with colourful shutters sit alongside vineyards, olive groves, orchards and market gardens whose produce ends up on local restaurant plates when it’s not being bartered among neighbours.A squiggling road leads us downhill from the village to pretty Lučica Bay, where fishers’ cottages squeeze around a bay too narrow for anything bigger than a dinghy. At compact Konoba Lučica, we sit at one of the restaurant’s two outside tables with a romantic sea view. We dine on grilled squid served by owner-chef Ante Kovačev, who fell in love with this spot after being stranded here on a sailing trip and left his home in Šibenik to set up this enchanting pint-sized place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here we findPorto Rosso, a restaurant and nautical centre whose numerous terraces hover over a pine-shaded beach. Although it’s mid-June, the summer season hasn’t kicked off yet, so we have an absurd amount of empty space in which to lounge after a satisfying lunch of seafood risotto. Gazing at the sea and swimming in transparent waters, we allow the afternoon to slip by in total relaxation.Lastovo does this to people. When we decamp from Zaklopatica and cross the little bridge to Prežba, the archipelago’s only other inhabited island, I immediately fall in love with the huge flower-filled terrace in our roomy apartment overlooking Malo Lago Bay in tiny Pasadur village. The atmosphere is less yachtie than Zaklopatica, and the peaceful bay looks more like a channel, flanked by wooded hills. “You’ll have to drag me from here,” I warn my husband.View image in fullscreenThe peaceful bay at Pasadur on the island of Prežba.Photograph: Adam BatterbeePine-shaded coves are tucked into Prežba’s indented coast, also pockmarked by old naval tunnels and bunkers from the days before 1988, when Lastovo was a military base and closed to tourists. Although the beaches beckon, we are again seduced by the ease of jumping into the clean waters from the sunny quayside.It takes five hours to get to Lastovo from Split via two ferries, and three hours on a catamaran from Dubrovnik (leaving you reliant on the island’s sole bus that is actually a minivan). It won’t suit everybody (thank goodness), especially drunk partygoers from Hvar who get on the wrong boat and wonder where all the cocktail bars and nightclubs are (answer: there aren’t any, and yes, this does happen).For Diana in the tourist office, who, like Alexandra Horvat, originally came from Zagreb, Lastovo harks back to 1980s Yugoslavia, “when every tourist was a guest, a friend”. Lastovo just made a new friend.Studios inApartments Marijain Zaklopaticafrom £60 a night (minimum two-night stay). Studios inVilla Agatain Pasadurfrom £64 a night.

The recipe is adapted from the traditionalaçordaof Alentejo, where it’s thought of as the region’s signature dish. Açorda is said to have been born from necessity, a waste-saving and resourceful soup that’s transformed by olive oil, plentiful herbs and rich egg. I find this take on it particularly interesting because, instead of simmering the coriander, garlic and egg in hot broth, they are instead put in a bowl and the broth is poured over them. This enhances the powerful flavours of the garlic and coriander, and the whole lot is then ladled over stale bread. For a vegetarian version, just omit the fish.Açorda – Portuguese garlic and coriander bread soup with optional codThis is a chunky, fragrant and very flavourful soup. A fresh egg is gently cooked by the residual heat of the broth, and thickens the soup along with the bread, giving it a wonderful viscosity.Although a traditional Portuguese stock for açorda might be made with vegetables or bacalau (salt cod), in the spirit of this column, and because they are delicious and often free (or at least very cheap) from most fishmongers, I’ve chosen to make my version with cod’s head. It’s a humble cut, but deeply flavoured and ideal for stocks. Don’t get me wrong, this is a delicious soup when it’s vegetarian, but any omnivores who do add a cod’s head will be rewarded by an extra-savoury, umami-rich and gelatinous fish broth.Serves4–61kg cod’s head, rinsed and gills removed1 bay leafVegetable scraps5 eggsSalt and black pepper100g bunch coriander4 garlic cloves, peeled100ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve200g stale bread(for example, ciabatta, sourdough orpão alentejano), torn into pieces4 pieces of toast, to serve (optional)For a vegetarian take on this soup, simply omit the fish. Put the cleaned cod’s head in a large saucepan with one and a half litres of water, the bay leaf and any vegetable scraps you have to hand. Bring to a boil, turn down the heat and simmer gently for 30 minutes, skimming off any foam that rises on the surface. After 25 minutes, drop in four unshelled eggs, cook for five minutes, then lift out the boiled eggs and the cod’s head and put to one side. Strain the broth, then return it to the pan. Once the cod is cool enough to handle, pick off any good flakes of meat, add to the strained broth, season to taste and keep warm.Meanwhile, tear the stale bread into four bowls. Finely chop the coriander from stem to leaf, then put it in a large bowl. Finely chop the four garlic cloves, add to the coriander and pour in the extra-virgin olive oil. Crack in the remaining egg and beat until well combined.Pour the hot broth into the coriander bowl, stir, then ladle the soup over the torn bread and serve with the boiled eggs and optional toast on the side.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteSoupBreadVegetablesPortuguese food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These recipes for one are also speedy, low-fuss and involve minimal cooking – perfect for maximising your time outdoors.Chilli oil udon (pictured top)These are inspired by my travels across China and its love for all things spicy noodles. A perfectly balanced sauce made with soy, vinegar and herbs means these salty, sweet, sour and spicy noodles are incredibly addictive.Prep10 minCook15 minServes1200g fresh udon, or 100g dried udon30g fresh coriander, roughly chopped¼cucumber, julienned1 fried egg, to serve (optional)For the chilli oil1 garlic clove, peeled and minced½ spring onion, white part minced½ tsp cayenne powder½tsp sweetpaprika1 tsp roasted sesame seeds¼tsp Sichuan peppercorns, crushed1 tbsp vegetable oilFor the sauce1 tbsp light soy sauce1 tsp dark soy sauce1 tsp oyster sauce1 tspblack Chinese vinegar1 tsp white sugar½ tsp MSG½ tsp sesame oilPut all the ingredients for the chilli oil, bar the oil, in a serving bowl (the one you plan to eat from) and stir to combine. Put the vegetable oil in a small frying pan on a high heat for a minute, until just shy of smoking, then pour this over the contents of the bowl and stir to coat. Add all the ingredients for the sauce, then stir until the sugar dissolves and everything is well combined.Cook the noodles in a pan of boiling water for a minute shy of the packet instructions (to ensure they’re al dente). Drain and transfer to the bowl with the sauce. Top with the coriander and cucumber, then toss very well, to make sure all the sauce at the bottom of the bowl is incorporated and coating the noodles. Serve topped with a fried egg, if you like, for some protein.Salmon noodle saladView image in fullscreenJustin Tsang’s salmon noodle salad.This packs a serious punch and barely requires any cooking.
