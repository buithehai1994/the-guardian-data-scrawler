And if you want to work, the government should support you, not stop you.”Starmer said the government would promise to “make work pay” for those who could work and that a safety net would be there if people needed help.But echoing the words of the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, last week, Starmer said: “This is the Labour party. We believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the dignity of every worker, which is why I am not afraid to take the big decisions needed to return this country to their interests whether that’s on welfare, immigration, our public services or our public finances.”After the meeting, MPs privately criticised the prime minister for failing to respond to a direct question on Pip when one directly challenged him. The MP described his own daughter who has significant disabilities, and asked for reassurance about the cuts, saying they would have a huge impact on his own family. “There was audible support in the room but the PM did not respond,” another MP said.Another MP said there was otherwise little specific dissent in the room. “People wanted to know how to make the argument … And he talked about how many young people are on these benefits and how that cannot be right.”Starmer’s intervention came as a group of leading disability and poverty charities urged ministers to think again about the planned cuts, saying they would have a devastating impact on the some of the UK’s poorest families.Labour to ‘fix benefit system to get people back into work’Read moreThe group’s letter to Rachel Reeves said that while the charities agreed with the government that the benefits system was broken and needed reform, they believed the the human cost of cuts in the value of benefits would be too great.The letter said: “Making cuts to disability benefits would have a catastrophic impact on disabled people up and down the country. Scope’s analysis of government figures shows that without Pip, a further 700,000 more disabled households could be pushed into poverty.“Life costs more for disabled people. Huge numbers already live in poverty as a result of these extra costs. The impact of any cuts to disability benefits would be devastating.“We agree with the government’s ambition to support more disabled people into work. However, making cuts to disability benefits will not achieve this goal or fix the system. In fact, there is little evidence to suggest cutting benefits increases employment outcomes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Claimants assessed as having “limited capability for work-related activity” receive about £5,000 a year on top of the standard universal credit award, and are exempted from having to find work.Disability benefits are not means-tested and not linked to employment status. They are meant to help the recipient with the extra daily costs of disability. Pip is worth between about £1,500 and £9,600 a year, depending on the assessed level of disability.The government is concerned that the recent growth in the bill for these benefits, which rose by nearly £13bn to £48bn between 2019-20 and 2023-24, is unsustainable.The rise has been at the centre ofculture warrows, with rightwing politicians and media claiming the benefits are too easily claimed by young people with mild mental illness.Critics say there is little evidence that the UK is spending proportionately more of GDP on working age incapacity and disability benefits than it was 20 years ago. There isno evidence the benefits are easier to claim, or that the rise is out of sync with health data showing more people are ill and disabled.Charities say cuts or tightened benefit eligibility restrictions will undermine the government’s stated ambition to cut child poverty. JRF estimates that 900,000 children live in a household where someone receives sickness benefits though universal credit.Starmer also told MPs on Monday that the time had come to step up defence spending, hours after he spoke to the US president, Donald Trump, asleaders prepared to meet in Saudi Arabiato discuss a Ukraine ceasefire deal.He said the international turmoil could be a moment of opportunity to reshape the economy. “The real world is moving quickly and people look to their government not to be buffeted about by that change – not even to merely respond to it – but to seize it and shape it for the benefit of the British people,” Starmer said.“Our defence and the security of the British people must come first. The extra defence spending I announced last week will rebuild industry across the country. It will support businesses, it will provide good, secure jobs and skills for the next generation. That is what we owe the British people.”Explore more on these topicsBenefitsDisabilityPovertySocial exclusionKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

But the Solong’s owner, shipping firm Ernst Russ, later said a search was under way for a missing crew member, while its 13 other crew were safe.Matthew Atkinson, divisional commander for HM Coastguard, said: “Thirty-six crew members were taken safely to shore, one person was taken to hospital.“One crew member of the Solong remains unaccounted for. After an extensive search for the missing crew member, sadly they have not been found and the search has ended.“The two vessels remain on fire and coastguard aircraft are monitoring the situation.“An assessment of any required counter-pollution response is being carried out by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.”Crowley, the shipping company that manages the MV Stena Immaculate, said there were “multiple explosions onboard” after the oil tanker’s cargo tank was ruptured.TheBBC reportedthat the Solong was carrying toxic sodium cyanide, but it remains unclear if the substance entered the water. The broadcaster said it was understood the Stena Immaculate was transporting jet fuel for the US government.Footage from the scene showed clouds of black smoke billowing into the air.A spokesperson for Greenpeace UK said it was monitoring the situation “very closely” but that it was too early to assess the extent of any environmental damage.Crowley said in a statement: “At approximately 10am on 10 March 2025, while anchored off the North Sea coast near Hull, United Kingdom, the Crowley-managed tanker Stena Immaculate was struck by the container ship Solong.View image in fullscreenAn emergency operation was launched after the collision on Monday morning.Photograph: Getty Images“The Stena Immaculate sustained a ruptured cargo tank containing Jet-A1 fuel due to the allision. A fire occurred as a result of the allision, and fuel was reported released. The Stena Immaculate crew abandoned the vessel following multiple explosions onboard. All Crowley mariners are safe and fully accounted for.”An emergency operation was launched after the collision. A helicopter was scrambled and lifeboats launched from four different bases along the coast.According to the ship tracking tool Vesselfinder, the US-flagged tanker was at anchor at the time of the incident. It had departed from a Greek port in the Aegean Sea and was heading towards Hull, according to the Marine Traffic website. The Solong was destined for Rotterdam.MapFootage of the incident showed both ships on fire, with flames spreading across the water and clouds of black smoke coming from the oil tanker.The UK transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “I am hugely grateful to HM Coastguard, the RNLI and emergency services who have responded to this incident.“They were on the scene swiftly, have helped rescue those in immediate danger and I know they will continue to work tirelessly over the coming days.“My thoughts are with all those involved, especially the family of the missing crew member.“The Maritime Accident Investigation Branch has begun a preliminary assessment, and I am working closely with the MCA (Maritime and Coastguard Agency) as they conduct an assessment of any counter-pollution response which may be required over the coming days.”View image in fullscreenBlack smoke billows into the air after the crash off the coast of East Yorkshire.Photograph: Bartek Smialek/PAThe leader of Hull council, Mike Ross, said: “The scenes across the East Yorkshire coast are deeply shocking. My thoughts are with all those affected. There will now be massive emergency response efforts from people right across the area and beyond.“As Hull’s council leader, I will work with the team here urgently to do everything we can to support the response needed now.”A spokesperson for Greenpeace UK said: “Both the high speed of the collision and the footage of the aftermath are cause for great concern.”They added: “Right now, our thoughts are with all those affected by the incident and the emergency services responding to the situation.”David McFarlane, the director of Marine Risk and Safety Consultants, said several warning systems, including radar and a ship’s horn, were onboard aimed at preventing such collisions. About 200 to 300 collisions happened at sea each year, he said.“They would have sighted each other over radar, called automatic identification system, onboard. The ships would be able to see and identify another vessel via AIS, and can call them up via very high frequency radio, and ask them what they are doing.”A ship was visible on another ship’s radar from as far as 24 miles away, McFarlane said. All vessels should have someone on lookout at all times. “But you wouldn’t get anxious about another ship until it was about four miles away, depending on speed.”If the other ship did not respond on the radio, vessels have a last-minute warning system, the ship’s horn, he said. “The next thing to do would be to blast the horn of a ship, which can be heard from miles away.”If a ship is at anchor, however, it can take up to an hour to hoist it up, he said. “I’ve heard that one of the ships was at anchor. If so, there’s a possibility it would have picked up its anchor, or was in the process of doing so, we don’t know. But it can take up to an hour to pick up anchor.”McFarlane said it was too early to speculate about what happened but human error was often to blame for collisions. He said that while there had been reports of pockets of fog in the North Sea at the time of the collision, that would not have affected the ability of any approaching vessel to warn of an approach, given the AIS.Explore more on these topicsUK newsNorth of EnglandShipping industryYorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

It could get even worse, the scientists said, as more microplastics pour into the environment.About 700 million people were affected by hunger in 2022. The researchers estimated that microplastic pollution could increase the number at risk of starvation by another 400 million in the next two decades, calling that an “alarming scenario” for global food security.Other scientists called the research useful and timely but cautioned that this first attempt to quantify the impact of microplastics on food production would need to be confirmed and refined by further data-gathering and research.The annual crop losses caused by microplastics could be of a similar scale to those caused by the climate crisis in recent decades, the researchers behind the new research said. The world is already facing a challenge to produce sufficient food sustainably, with the global population expected torise to 10 billionby around 2058.Microplastics are broken down from the vast quantities of waste dumped into the environment. They hinder plants from harnessing sunlight to grow in multiple ways, from damaging soils to carrying toxic chemicals. The particles have infiltrated the entire planet, from thesummit of Mount Everestto thedeepest oceans.“Humanity has been striving to increase food production to feed an ever-growing population [but] these ongoing efforts are now being jeopardised by plastic pollution,” said the researchers, led by Prof Huan Zhong, at Nanjing University in China. “The findings underscore the urgency [of cutting pollution] to safeguard global food supplies in the face of the growing plastic crisis.”People’s bodies are already widely contaminated by microplastics, consumed throughfoodandwater. They have been found inblood,brains,breast milk,placentasandbone marrow. The impact on human health is largely unknown, but they have beenlinked to strokes and heart attacks.Prof Denis Murphy, at the University of South Wales, said: “This analysis is valuable and timely in reminding us of the potential dangers of microplastic pollution and the urgency of addressing the issue, [but] some of the major headline figures require more research before they can be accepted as robust predictions.”The new study,published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, combined more than 3,000 observations of the impact of microplastics on plants, taken from 157 studies.Previous research has indicated that microplastics can damage plants in multiple ways. The polluting particles canblock sunlightreaching leaves anddamage the soilson which the plants depend. When taken up by plants, microplastics canblock nutrient and water channels, induceunstable molecules that harm cellsandrelease toxic chemicals, which can reduce the level of the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll.The researchers estimated that microplastics reduced the photosynthesis of terrestrial plants by about 12% and by about 7% in marine algae, which are at the base of the ocean food web. They then extrapolated this data to calculate the reduction in the growth of wheat, rice and maize and in the production of fish and seafood.Asia was hardest hit by estimated crop losses, with reductions in all three of between 54m and 177m tonnes a year, about half the global losses. Wheat in Europe was also hit hard as was maize in the United States. Other regions, such as South America and Africa, grow less of these crops but have much less data on microplastic contamination.In the oceans, where microplastics can coat algae, the loss of fish and seafood was estimated at between 1m and 24m tonnes a year, about 7% of the total and enough protein to feed tens of millions of people.The scientists also used a second method to assess the impact of microplastics on food production, a machine-learning model based on current data on microplastic pollution levels. It produced similar results, they said.“Importantly, these adverse effects are highly likely to extend from food security to planetary health,” Zhong and his colleagues said. Reduced photosynthesis due to microplastics may be also cutting the amount of climate-heating CO2 taken from the atmosphere by the huge phytoplankton blooms in the Earth’s oceans and unbalancing other ecosystems.Prof Richard Lampitt, at the UK’s National Oceanography Centre, said the conclusions should be treated with caution. “I have considerable concerns about the quality of the original data used by the model and this has led to overspeculation about the effects of plastic contamination on food supplies,” he said. The researchers acknowledged that more data was needed and said this would produce more accurate estimates.The world’s nations failed to reach an agreement on a UN treaty to curb plastic pollution in December, but will restart the talks in August. The scientists said their study was “important and timely for the ongoing negotiations and the development of action plans and targets”.Prof Richard Thompson, at the University of Plymouth said the new study added to the evidence pointing towards the need for action. “While the predictions may be refined as new data become available, it is clear … that we need to start towards solutions. Ensuring the treaty addresses microplastic pollution is of key importance,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsPollutionFoodFood scienceFood securityPopulationnewsShareReuse this content"

I have got children, this is not true.”The 49-year-old actor is suing Guardian News and Media (GNM) in relation to seven articles and a podcast published between April 2021 and March 2022 in which more than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.On his first day in the witness box, Clarke was asked about a series of allegations that had been made against him by a number of women.They included an account by Mila*, an actor who claims he made sexually inappropriate comments during a scene in which she was required to strip, and also obtained inappropriate and intrusive footage of her which he shared.Clarke told the court that Mila’s motivation for complaining about him years later was that, after her career prospered, she regretted doing the film.“She regrets the fact that people can look back and see a film where she was semi-nude … If she regrets that there is nothing I can do about it,” Clarke said. “I’m sorry about that because she’s lying.”He claimed that she had “jumped on the bandwagon”, saying: “You [GNM] flashed my face across the papers and I became a target for people who wanted to air their grievances.”The court heard that in December 2020 Clarke spoke to Mila because he had heard that she was unhappy and she told him she had been “very uncomfortable”.The actor said that he agreed to a conversation because he was panicking. He told the court someone was trying to blackmail him with allegations of sexual assault.But Millar said the real reason Clarke had been panicking was because of the worldwide reckoning against men who had mistreated women.“In 2019, the #MeToo movement began to catch up with you and women began talking about your sexual misconduct,” said the barrister.Another actor, Sophia*, alleges Clarke grabbed her hand and put it on his crotch while undoing his trousers.Denying the allegations, Clarke said: “She is lying, she has filed it [her witness statement] to get attention. She has filed it to be a part of something she thinks is noble.”Asked by Millar how she would get attention, given her witness statement was filed under a pseudonym, Clarke replied: “You [at the Guardian] all know who she is.”He said she would get “comfort” from speaking to Guardian journalists and criticised her for not giving oral evidence.He was also questioned about Thalia Hambi-Fisher, a choreographer and dance teacher, who claims that, during a 2009 lunch with Clarke, he asked her to go to the bathroom and take a photograph of her “pussy” for him.“That doesn’t sound like something I would say,” the writer-director said. But asked by Millar if he liked seeing pictures of women’s vaginas, Clarke replied: “I can’t say no to that completely.”He told the court he could not say Hambi-Fisher was lying as he could not recall going for lunch with her, but added: “I will not have said those words to her regardless of what you have said about my like for certain things.”Asked whether it would constitute sexual harassment, Clarke said: “In today’s lens, if it was said, sure. In 2008 or 2009 it might have been a cheeky comment.”The actor also criticised Millar for “attacking my art” and telling him how to to do his job when quizzed on his conduct during sex scenes in films he was directing.“You expected a dozen rapes [to be alleged in response to the initial Guardian article] and you got Doctor Who allegations from 21 years ago,” he told the court.Another actor, Penelope*, claims Clarke touched her with his erect penis, close to the entry of her vagina, while filming a sex scene, and also exposed it to her in between takes. Footage of the finished scene was shown in court in which Clarke pulls down his trousers.He told the barrister: “There’s no way I can get an erection that quickly … Maybe you can.”After one exchange with Millar, Clarke became visibly emotional, and used a tissue to wipe his eyes.He admitted to being “flawed”, not having a “halo” nor being “a perfect guy”, but stressed: “I am not what they [the Guardian journalists] have branded me.”Clarke is expected to continue giving evidence until Wednesday, with the trial scheduled to conclude next month.*Some names have been changed for legal reasons.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianGuardian Media GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

He was admitted on 14 February with a severe respiratory infection that has required evolving treatment.In its latest medical update, the Vatican said the pope’s doctors had decided to lift an earlier “guarded” prognosis, meaning the pontiff’s life was no longer in immediate danger.“The improvements recorded in previous days have further consolidated, as confirmed by both blood tests and clinical assessments, as well as a good response to his drug treatments,” it said.Although the doctors lifted their earlier prognosis, the Vatican said they still expect Francis “to continue medical drug treatment in a hospital setting for further days”.No exact timeframe was given for his discharge.The pope has been described as being in a stable or improving condition for the past week, following two crises of “acute respiratory insufficiency” on 3 March.The Vatican said earlier on Monday that Francis was continuing his treatment and was undergoing respiratory physiotherapy to help with his breathing.The pontiff, who has used a wheelchair in recent years due to knee and back pain, also continued with some physical therapy to help with mobility, it said.The pope is receiving oxygen in hospital, using a small hose under his nose during the day and noninvasive mechanical ventilation at night while he sleeps.The pope has experienced several bouts of ill health over the last two years and is prone to lung infections because he had pleurisy as a young adult and had part of one lung removed.Double pneumonia is a serious infection in both lungs that can inflame and scar them, making it difficult to breathe.Francis, who will celebrate the 12th anniversary of his 2013 election as pope on Thursday, has not been seen in public since entering hospital, the longest such absence of his papacy.Doctors not involved in Francis’ care said the pope is likely to face a long, fraught road to recovery, given his age and other medical conditions.The pope, who is known to work himself to exhaustion, has continued to work from hospital.On Sunday, the pope held his third meeting during his recovery in hospital with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s second-ranking official, and Parolin’s deputy.The Vatican said the pope has also been watching the live stream of an annual week-long spiritual retreat that many Vatican officials are attending as part of preparations for Easter in April.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismChristianityReligionThe papacynewsShareReuse this content"

A minister – Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson – says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It’s inconceivable.”Gove said that Dyson’s prototype ultimately “did not get through testing” and that “whenever confronted with brute facts about safety or otherwise, I would always accept them”.The former minister accepted he had more “direct involvement” with Dyson’s proposal than with other applicants, but said he “could not tell the MHRA what to approve and would not”.Elsewhere, the inquiry was shown an extract from an email from Gove’s private office that read: “MHRA and GRW [Gareth Rhys Williams, then the chief commercial officer at the Cabinet Office] to ensure that by the end of Friday, the Dyson product has been tested and approved by MHRA, a small number of products have been provided to hospitals for human testing, and the final product has started to be manufactured. GRW to escalate any blockages to ministers.”Asked about why he had been able to give “clear instruction that not only would the Dyson product have been tested three days later, but also approved by MHRA by that time”, Gove said: “I could not tell the MHRA what to approve and would not. I think that this is the private office’s shorthand for ‘we would hope that it had been tested and if tested satisfactorily approved by the MHRA to that timescale’.“It’s absurd to imagine that I or any other minister would instruct the MHRA, an independent regulatory agency, to approve a product. If I had told the MHRA to approve a product, they would have told me where to get off.”Meanwhile, the inquiry heard that the senior Cabinet Office civil servant John Manzoni had been “concerned” that “indirect pressure was being placed on the MHRA to approve the supplier’s design” after a meeting with Gove, Dyson and Rhys Williams.“I felt I had to, and did, intervene in this meeting to ensure that the MHRA approval system, as the regulatory system, was properly applied and to protect the integrity of the process,” Manzoni said in a statement.In a separate exchange with Manzoni on 25 March that year, Rhys Williams had said he felt Gove was “being unreasonable”.“Even if he was correct that we had delayed anything, which I don’t believe he is at all, his tone is … regrettable. But see below. It would appear that the Dyson sample is not yet ready to be shipped by them.“MHRA could have been testing something else this evening.”Gove also told the inquiry he did not believe that time and effort spent on Dyson’s ventilator proposal meant that the same resources could not be devoted to other bids.The inquiry continues on Tuesday.The inquiry previously heard that Lord Agnew, a Tory Treasury minister, had warned a senior official that ventilators might need to be bought from Dyson“so that he [could] then market [them] internationally”as “being used in UK hospitals” after the businessman spoke to Boris Johnson.A Dyson spokesperson said last week: “Sir James Dyson responded to a personal call from the prime minister … to develop and make a medical-grade ventilator in 30 days during the national emergency.“Dyson had no intention of manufacturing ventilators for profit. Far from receiving any commercial benefit, there was significant commercial cost to Dyson, which diverted 450 engineers away from commercial projects.“Mercifully, treatments changed, and mass use of ventilators was no longer seen as an effective remedy, the UK government cancelled the order it had placed, and none were ever sold overseas.”Explore more on these topicsCovid inquiryMichael GoveJames DysonDyson LtdConservativesHealth policyCoronavirusnewsShareReuse this content"

The platform, formerly known as Twitter, had been unresponsive for many users as posts failed to load.“We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources,” the platform’s CEOposted. “Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved.”Downdetector, a website thatmonitors outageson various sites and platforms, showed thousands of reports of outages that initially spiked at about 5.45am before returning to normal for a few hours. A second surge in reported outages carried on throughout midday, with the majority of them occurring on the company’s mobile app.Tweets that failed to appear displayed a message that “something went wrong” and told users to try reloading.The richest man in the world did not provide any evidence for his claims. His post came in response to a cryptocurrency influencer who suggested the outage followed other opposition to Musk’s enterprises. Protests against the so-called “department of government efficiency” initiative Musk leads andvandalism against Tesla dealershipshad taken place throughout the previous week.Musk reiterated his claim of a cyber-attack during an interview on Fox Business later that day, suggesting that the perpetrators may have been from Ukraine.“We’re not sure exactly what happened but there was a massive cyber-attack to try and bring down theXsystem with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area,” Musk said.Musk has been heavily critical of the Ukrainian government as relations between it and the Trump administration have soured. Musk stated over the weekend that the country’s “entire front line” would collapse if he turned off his Starlink satellite communications provider and called the Democratic senator Mark Kelly a “traitor” after the lawmaker posted about a visit he made to the country.The SpaceX chief executive, who acquired Twitter for $44bn in 2022, has also claimed that previous platform outages were the result of cyber-attacks. When his livestreamedinterviewwithDonald Trumpalmost immediately crashed last year, Musk alleged that it was because of a “massive DDOS attack”.

He calls me and goes: ‘Jo – you need to phone the police. We have a stowaway.’”She added: “I am so angry. It is so frustrating because we have done the right thing and phoned the police.”In an email exchange to the Home Office, seen by the BBC, Adrian Fenton, 57, wrote: “At no point did I believe I would be fined by taking correct and moral action.“This action taken by Border Force to impose a fine only encourages travellers [or] holidaymakers in this position not to call the police but to let the stowaway abscond.”Joanne Fenton said she offered the boy a bottle of water, to which he said: “Thank you.”She added he told police he was from Sudan and that he was 16 years old.The couple were travelling in Australia over Christmas when they received an email from the Home Office which stated they failed to “check that no clandestine entrant was concealed in the vehicle”.Joanne Fenton contested that technically the boy was clinging to the outside rather than aboard the motorhome.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am pursuing this with ministers and will demand that the fine be withdrawn.”In October, a retired ambulance driver and his wife were fined £6,000 after UK Border Agency staff found a man in a trailer attached to their mobile home in France.Peter Hughes and Anne Lawton, from Droylsden, Greater Manchester, told the BBC they had no idea a young Sudanese man had concealed himself.The couple had stopped at a supermarket before heading for the ferry atCalaislast May.

Tesla’s shares had their worst day since September 2020, falling 15%.The fall came a day after Trumpskirted aroundquestions about a potential recession on Sunday. Asked if he expected a recession, Trump said: “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big … It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.”Kevin Hassett, the head of the national economic council, told CNBC on Monday that any uncertainty around Trump’s trade policies would be resolved by early April and that the policies were “creating jobs in the US”.“It’s starting to have the intended effect of onshoring in the US,” Hassett said, citing recentjob figuresthat showed an increase of 10,000 manufacturing jobs in February. For context, the increase represents about a 0.08% increase in manufacturing jobs, of which there are about 12.7m in the US.Hassett insisted: “There’s a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish going forward,” saying that theTrump administrationwas still aiming for “the biggest tax cuts in history, massive deregulation and a productivity boom from artificial intelligence”.Trump tariffs policy ‘misguided’ and US economy ‘very wobbly’, ex-adviser saysRead more“Everyone is talking about uncertainty. Surely there’s uncertainty in exactly how the trade policy will work itself out, but the tax policy is almost sure to work,” Hassett said.Over the last week, as the US stock market has slumped, Trump and his administration have been busy working the talkshow circuits trying to allay growing concerns of a recession and continue to push for his trade policies.Since coming into office, Trump has started a trade war with America’s three largest trading partners. Trump has increased tariffs on China, first by 10% and now by 20%. He haspulled backon 25% tariffs against goods from Mexico and Canada, though he is still threatening to impose the tariffs against the two countries next month.Atlanta Federal Reserve’s closely followed GDP Now tracker – which forecasts US economic growth – is suggesting the economy could contract in the first three months of the year, largely due to an outsized drag from net trade.Trump has repeatedly balked at the idea that his trade policies have causeduncertainty.Howard Lutnick, Trump’s commerce secretary, told NBC’s Meet the Press: “There’s going to be no recession in America,” comparing doubts about Trump’s trade policies to previous skepticism over Trump winning the election.“You are going to see over the next two years the greatest set of growth coming from America,” Lutnick said.Explore more on these topicsUS economyTrump tariffsTrump administrationStock marketsnewsShareReuse this content"

He messaged Young and said: “I am not going back … and sitting in the middle.”Young did not realise the “significance” of the back desk and did not understand that Walker was concerned about his status being undermined.The tribunal concluded Walker had been right to see the desk issue as a “demotion”.Judge Reindorf said: “From [Mr Walker’s] point of view, finding out that Mr Gooder was sitting at the back desk and he would be sitting at the middle desk amounted to being told that he would be assistant manager and Mr Gooder would be branch manager.“This was a logical conclusion for him to draw in circumstances where communication with him about the logistics of the Rickmansworth move had been poor …“The tribunal finds [it was] … conduct that was likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence.“Either becoming assistant manager or becoming joint manager with Mr Gooder would have amounted to a demotion by comparison to the role he was performing at Chorleywood and that which he had performed at Rickmansworth previously, since at both offices he had been the sole manager in charge of the branch.”Walker’s compensation will be decided at a later date.Explore more on these topicsEmployment tribunalsEmployment lawHertfordshireWork & careersnewsShareReuse this content"

HTS then assumed power, forming a transitional government led by the group’s former leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, who previously went by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani.Sharaa assured the country, as its new president, that the rights of religious minorities, including those from the Alawite sect from which the Assad family hailed, would be respected under the new government. Since taking power, however, incidences of revenge killings have happened sporadically in Alawite villages, which the Syrian government called “individual cases” and promised to investigate. Syrian security forces also faced continual attacks by fighters loyal to the ousted Assad regime.Syrian security forces execute 125 civilians in battle against Assad loyalistsRead moreNonetheless, the situation in north-west Syria, and specifically the coastal provinces that were Assad’s former stronghold, remained mostly calm until last week.On Wednesday, Syrian security forces and checkpoints were attacked simultaneously across Syria’s coast by Assad regime loyalists. Syria’s ministry of defence said that the attacks were “coordinated and premediated”, while an adviser to the minister of foreign affairs said the attack involved up to 4,000 Assad loyalists.A former Assad security officer,Miqdad Fatiha, is thought to be playing a leading role in the operation.Chaos and confusion reigned for a few hours while security forces, caught by surprise by the attack, were overwhelmed and killed en masse. Assad regime loyalists began firing at cars randomly, attacking civilians and burning public buildings such as police stations.Syria’s authorities issued a call for reinforcements and thousands of fighters from across the country poured into the coastal provinces. Civilians, many of whom were armed, also joined the military convoys.How did the killings start?Security forces, buoyed by reinforcements, began to fight Assad regime loyalists and push them back from villages in Syria’s coast. The loyalists retreated into the countryside, burning state property and killing as they went.A resident of the Qusour neighbourhood of Baniyas in the Latakia countryside described how Assad loyalists fled from Jableh to the area on Thursday night. “They hid in the hospital behind my house and started shooting at public security, some of them went first to the police station and burned it,” the resident said, speaking anonymously for fear of retaliation.As Syrian government forces and armed civilians began to move into Alawite villages in north-west Syria, videos of abuses began to surface. Civilians began to report wholesale killings by security forces, in accounts corroborated by rights monitoring groups.The resident from Qusour described how a faction consisting of Chechen foreign fighters came to their neighbourhood after battling Assad loyalists on Thursday and entered their home, threatening to burn it down unless they gave them their car keys and mobile phone. On Friday, a group of Syrian fighters entered their building and rounded up the Alawite men in the building, taking them to the roof and shooting them.“They took a 16-year-old boy, he had a nervous breakdown, telling them not to kill him. They didn’t say anything, they just took him and killed him,” said a second resident from Baniyas. Other residents of coastal villages reported knowing dozens of people who were killed.Videos seen by the Guardian showed fighters wearing fatigues executing unarmed people at point-blank range, and dozens of corpses in civilian clothing piled on top of each other in the village of Mukhtariya in Latakia.Who is responsible for the killings?According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), which employs exhaustive documentation standards and is considered independent: Assad regime loyalists killed 383 people, including 211 civilians and 172 Syrian security forces, while Syrian security forces killed 396 people, which includes civilians and disarmed fighters. Killing disarmed fighters is against international humanitarian law. The statistics do not account for the number of Assad regime loyalists killed.The vast majority of unlawful killings of civilians and prisoners by Syrian security forces were committed by two specific factions, as well as individuals who joined military convoys, according to the SNHR.Specifically, the two factions responsible for the majority of the killings of civilians were the Abu Amsha and Hamzat divisions. Both are rebel groups previously affiliated with the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army. Both factions and their leaders are under US sanctions for alleged serious human rights abuses including rape and torture.Both factions are among the disparate groups that the new Syrian government is trying to incorporate into its national army. They are nominally under the auspices of the new state, with Abu Amsha appointed head of Hama province’s military brigade. However, in reality the state exercises limited control over them.According to the founder of SNHR, Fadel Abdulghany, these factions would commit abuses in villages until HTS security forces arrived, upon which they would move to the neighbouring town until they were driven out once again. At least four residents of villages in Latakia described a similar process of factions evading HTS security forces.What happens now?In a speech on Sunday, Sharaa vowed to hunt down the Assad regime loyalists who sparked the violence and to hold those who killed civilians to account.“We will hold accountable, with full decisiveness, anyone who is involved in the bloodshed of civilians, mistreats civilians, exceeds the state’s authority or exploits power for personal gain. No one will be above the law,” Sharaa said.He announced the formation of a committee to issue a report on the clashes and the ensuing violence in north-west Syria, as well as a committee to address the Alawite community’s concerns.Holding perpetrators to account and ensuring real transitional justice in war-torn Syria is seen as key to the country’s recovery from its 14-year civil war, and to the success of the new government.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaBashar al-AssadexplainersShareReuse this content"

And then I think when we look atCanadaas a country in the world, we’re probably threatened and have the sense of being threatened in a way we haven’t in many generations.”Carney,who won an overwhelming majority in the Liberal leadership race, used his victory speech on Sunday evening to warn the “greatest crisis of our generation” came in the form of Trump, leader of Canada’s closest ally and largest trading partner.“The Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country. Think about that for a moment. If they succeed, they will destroy our way of life,” he said, pledging to supporters that Canada would remain unbowed to US threats.“America is not Canada. And Canada never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape, or form. We didn’t ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves.”Carney’s predilection for a hockey metaphor was in full view on Sunday as he promised to keep Canada’s retaliatory tariffs in place until the American ones were fully removed, adding the country’s southern neighbor needed to show “respect” to one of its largest trading partners.“So, Americans should make no mistake … In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win.”A Nanos poll, conducted for CTV News and released on Sunday, found 36% of respondents saw Trump as the most important issue influencing their vote. The economy followed at 29%.Before his victory in the Liberal party race, multiple polls showed that Carney was viewed as most capable of dealing with the economic fallout of a Trump-inspired trade war.Carney, 59,was head of the Bank of Canada from 2008, when he helped Canada avoid the worst of the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. In 2013, he became the first-ever noncitizen to run the Bank of England since its inception in 1694, and helped blunt the consequences of Brexit in the UK.Carney also hinted at the degree to which Trump will feature as a foil in the upcoming national election against the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre,whose lead in the polls is wilting.chart showing canada opinion poll averages“Pierre Poilievre’s plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,” Carney said. “Because a person who worships at the altar ofDonald Trumpwill kneel before him, not stand up to him.”The shift in political sentiment hasbenefitted Carney’s Liberalsbut he nonetheless warned of “dark days” ahead for the country.“I’ve learned from long experience that in a crisis, ‘plan beats no plan’, and that you need to first distinguish between what you can change and what you can’t change. We can’t change Donald Trump. We must understand what we can, and must change. We are masters in our own house,” he said. “We can give ourselves far more than Donald Trump can ever take away.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyAmericasDonald TrumpTrump tariffsUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

He is also notably more hard right than Farage, with his feed heavily focused onpledgesto mass-deport a million-plus illegal migrants, or complaints about criminals from “alien cultures”.In the most recentregister of MPs’ interests, Lowe set out that his income from posting on X, where some users are paid a share of advertising revenue based on how many people their content reaches, is currently more than £3,000 a fortnight, about four times as much as Farage makes.In part this is about the much greater frequency with which Lowe posts. But unlikely online influencer as he might seem, he is very much an influencer, with his posts routinely “liked” tens of thousands of times. At the time of writing, the previous 24 hours of Lowe’s tweets had been viewed more than 2.5m times.In part this reach is down to occasional amplification by Elon Musk, with the X owner and Donald Trump right-hand manendorsing Lowe’s robust viewsin January.Do Lowe’s X statistics make a case for this? Experts argue probably not. As many other politicians have learned to their cost in recent years, social media is not real life, and endless adulation in a likely echo chamber does not always help at the ballot box.Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, described Farage’s more careful language on areas such as migration as “the difference between the dog-whistle and the fog horn – and it feels to me likeRupert Lowehas been tooting on the fog horn”.For all that Lowe’s method brings likes on X, a stream of comments about deportations, “wokery” andIslamhas appeal to a niche electoral audience, Bale said.“There is an extent to which Lowe is addressing the extremely online part of Reform’s potential audience, whereas Farage is going way beyond that, talking to all sorts of people who wouldn’t dream of spending any time on Twitter.“They might care about some of the issues that both of them talk about, but would probably find some of what Lowe and those who he retweets talk about as too extreme.”Researchby the advocacy groupHope Not Hate backs up this idea. It has found that the fastest-growing group of new Reform recruits are more positive about multiculturalism, with the Lowe-style “core anti-immigrant” vote likely to peak at about 15%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nigel, on the other hand, is not an ideologue. A lot of people think Nigel is a rightwing firebrand, but he’s actually very pragmatic. He’ll go where it’s expedient to deliver himself into the public eye and into office.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKRupert LoweNigel FarageanalysisShareReuse this content"

How do you appear to look busy enough to appease an ever-present boss?Thirty years ago, Seinfeld’s George Costanza had atheory: “Always look annoyed.” That way, “people think that you’re busy.” Today, performative productivity goes by a new name.“Bosses beware, gen Z are ‘taskmasking’,”reada recent, rather narc-y Fortune story. “They’re going the extra mile to look like they’re working hard while actually hardly working.” One example of taskmasking: moving quickly though the office while carrying a laptop or clipboard – straight out of a West Wing walk-and-talk. Another example: typing loudly, like a DMV employee having a bad day, even if what you’re typing has no relevance to your job.Both a TikTok trend and something managers and HR types are seeing in action, the rise of taskmasking comes as more employers mandate a return to office. In September, Amazonannouncedit would require all workers to come in five days a week, as if it were 2019 all over again. Companies including Goldman Sachs, Dell, Condé Nast and the Washington Post issued similar decrees. (A couple of small hitches: because their offices don’t have enough space for all employees to comfortably work together, Amazon delayed return-to-office and Condé Nast’s editorial union isprotestingthe requirement.)A swath of the US’s young office workers came of age when the pandemic required staying home. This might be the first time they’ve been asked to consistently commute to a job site instead of getting tasks done on their own schedule, in the privacy of their home. Now, physically surrounded by colleagues and higher-ups, they must learn to visually communicate busyness.In 2019, the culture writer Anne Helen Petersen described the similar phenomenon of “Larping your job,” borrowing the acronym forlive action role playing.“You can Larp your job in person (holding lots of meetings, staying late and getting there early as a show of ‘presentism’) and digitally (sending lots of emails, spending a lot of time on Slack, or whatever group chat platform your organization uses),” Petersonwrote.Gabrielle Judge, a 28-year-old content creator and writer known as theAnti Work Girlboss,used to work in tech and remembers the ways she and her coworkers would taskmask or Larp their jobs in the office.“People would look really busy when they were actually just getting lunch, or would wear their AirPods all day so it looked like they were in meetings,” Judge said. “A lot of people would also just stare intensely at their computers.”Coffee breaks or water cooler meetups – that is, if offices still have the antiquated device – count as taskmasking if coworkers talk about their jobs rather than last night’s big game or award show. “You can drum up a conversation with someone to look busy,” Judge said. “There’s a lot of performative work at the office.”While taskmasking might not help get any real work done, it can feel like a full-time job of its own. “It’s exhausting having to mask all the time at work,” Judge said. “We get so tired going into an office, even if you didn’t do anything differently than you would at home. It’s just the tiredness that comes with the social exhaustion of playing a role.”Cierra Gross runs Caged Bird HR, anindependent human resources consulting firmthat workers hire to help with workplace claims of harassment and discrimination. Before leaving corporate life in 2022 after experiencing burnout and depression, Gross spent years in traditional HR departments at Google and ExxonMobil. She calls taskmasking a symptom of the broader issues surrounding hiring, talent management and workforce planning – namely, bosses’ desire to get folks back in the office at all costs, mostly for the show of it.“It is inevitable that there will be people who try to game the system in every company,” Gross said. “Taskmasking might be associated with low performers, but high performers who quickly finish their work can also do it, too.”It’s not uncommon for workers to complete a big project and then have nothing to do in the office. “As far as your manager is concerned, your work is done, so you can just sit at a computer and surf the web,” Gross said.We can expect taskmasking to stay strong as more workers outsource the brunt of busy work toAI, freeing up their days for more loud water cooler conversations and fake typing sessions. Still, bosses may be on to them: a 2021 study found that 80% of companies monitor remote and hybrid workers, with many usingspecialized softwareto track online activity, location and keystrokes. And according to Wired, the surveillancecontinuesinside offices too, where new technology – including motion, light intensity and humidity sensors – is available to bosses who want to spy on specific rooms and desks.For now, taskmasking lives on as a way for employees to take back some control. “Gen Z has graduated high school and college remotely, done so many milestones from home, so the idea that work can only be done in an office is so far off,” Judge said. “Taskmasking is a result of how people feel bitter and frustrated over this. I think it begs the question to employers: how important is being together?”"

The world hasn’t felt less safe in decades. European leaders desperately scrabbling to secure a peace in Ukraine that isn’t a capitulation to Russia. A US manchild president who is giving a convincing impression of a Russian asset. Vladimir Putin struggling to believe his good fortune.So a big thank you to Reform for providing so much comic relief. Never has the UK needed a good laugh more than now. Which isn’t to say that the very public squabble between Nigel Farage and Rupert Lowe was in any way unexpected. Given enough time away from dissecting the niceties of the Nazi salute – these things matter to supporters of Reform. Strictly arm out to the front, not the side – Nige can usually manage to fall out with anyone. Apart from Richard Tice. Dicky only exists as an echo to Farage. Without a mind of his own. His tragedy has been to be born a man of limited intellect and charisma.To recap. Last Thursday, Lowe – who has endorsed Tommy Robinson and apparently won the admiration of Elon Musk and Reform voters who worry the party has gone soft on foreigners – gave an interview to the Daily Mail in which he accused Nige of acting like a second-rate Messiah and having no real interest in policy.Now, Farage is nothing if not thin-skinned and wasn’t going to take that lying down. So he responded by going public with allegations of bullying and bad language against Rupture and withdrew the whip from his MP. Finally, all Reform MPs could happily fit into the back of a black cab again without anyone having to sit on Lee Anderson’s lap.Since then Reform has been a party at war with itself, with Farage and Lowe trading insults via the media and X. It has been a joy to witness. The People’s Front of Reform up against the Reform People’s Front. Splitters! Lowe has insisted that the allegations weren’t made against him but against a member of his staff and that, in any case, they were entirely vexatious.Not so, squeaked Nige. Reform apparently takes bullying against staff extremely seriously – who would have guessed that Reform would take HR procedures quite so seriously? Deep down, Farage has a desperate desire to win the approval of the wokerati – and had asked a KC to investigate the allegations. It was just a total coincidence – of course it was – that Reform had chosen to go public with all this on the same day that Rupture had dared to trash talk the Messiah.Cue further mayhem. Nige then wrote a piece for the Sunday Telegraph, more in sorrow than in anger, saying what a shame and surprise it had all kicked off like this. Nothing like this had ever happened to him before, he sobbed. And it had been with deep regret that the Reform chief whip had been forced to take action.Yup, Lee Anderson, who has form for telling the little people to fuck off, was shocked and saddened to hear that Lowe had used bad language and allegedly mocked women. All this was most unlike Lowe who was renowned throughout Westminster for his courtesy.Lee may have said to himself – I can’t fucking believe what that wanker has done. I’ve got zero fucking tolerance for anyone who swears at colleagues. There’s a line here. He’s fucking dead to me.Lee is now chief whip to just one MP. Maybe it’s a full-time job making sure that James McMurdock doesn’t beat up another woman.Lowe wasn’t going to take any of this lying down. He had also heard that Nige’s supporters were claiming that he had dementia. Though how would anyone necessarily know? Rupture isn’t noted for his contact with reality.Then there were the allegations of racism that had been made against his own supporters who had never liked the fact that Zia Yousuf had been appointed as party chair. Well, what did everyone expect? Surely the whole point of voting Reform was to give your racism a free ride. Nigel had sold out the whole project by being too nice to foreigners. It’s come to something when Farage is the moderate voice.Rupture came out fighting. He had spoken to the KC who had been hired to investigate him. For one thing the allegations weren’t even against him, they were against another member of his staff and the KC had said she was dismayed and shocked at the lack of evidence against him. Something that was later denied by the KC herself. By this time, it was getting hard to keep with the backstabbing and infighting within Reform. Just imagine if Suella Braverman had defected. She and Nige would have fallen out on day one.Then the piece de resistance. Lowe had backup. Step forward Andrew Bridgen. Now not everyone would have thought that the former MP who was kicked out of the Conservative party for comparing the Covid vaccination to the Holocaust was the kind of credible character witness you would like. But beggars can’t be choosers. In Reform World everyone is a bottom feeder. Long and short of it was that Bridgen reckoned Rupture was innocent.To end the day, Lowe conducted a media blitz. If you can count an interview with Dan Wootton on his YouTube channel as a media appearance. Wootton, it needs to be said, is the idiot’s idiot. A half-witted hamster masquerading as a discredited GB News presenter. There’s a lot of them about.“Tell me that the allegations are untrue, Rupert,” Danny oozed. “I don’t believe them for a minute – I think you are a wonderful man – but I just want to hear from you that you also think they are untrue.”Absolutely, agreed Lowe. He would never knowingly indulge in any unchristian behaviour. Apart from mass deportations, but they didn’t count. He only had sympathy for his former colleagues who had strayed from the path of righteousness like lost sheep. What Reform needed was more experts. Like him. And no, he wasn’t suffering from any health issues. All he had done was challenge Nige’s narcissism with his own.“Tell me,” said Danny, breathlessly. “Has Elon Musk ever DM’d you?”“Yes.”Wootton allowed himself an explosive orgasm on screen. This was the kind of online contact he could only dream about.The rest of the interview was inevitably an anticlimax. Reform had just eaten itself. It had been fun while it lasted.Explore more on these topicsReform UKThe politics sketchcommentShareReuse this content"

They can close valves in their nostrils and ears and a special membraneover their eyes; their epiglottis, the flap that stops water entering the lungs, is inside their nose instead of their throat; they use their tongue to shield their throats from water; and their lips to shield their mouths – their lips can closebehindtheir front teeth. Their teeth are rust-orange, because they are strengthened with iron.Their back feet are webbed like a duck’s; on land, their front feet act like hands, digging, grasping and carrying things from the riverbed to the surface – rocks, for example, tucked under their chins and cradled by their arms. When they swim, they do so while holding their front paws to their chests, like a severe governess in a Victorian novel, or a child pretending to be a rabbit. They prefer to carry branches in their teeth, like dogs. The biggest beavers weigh 50kg.View image in fullscreenA beaver shortly after emerging from its den, looking for food on a river in Devon.Photograph: Josh Huxham/Getty Images/iStockphotoBeavers are monogamous. The males have a bone in their penis. Beaver kits are born with their coats, and mew, squeak and cry to get attention. Adults, to get attention – mainly to warn other beavers of danger – will slap water with their tails.Their tails – which they tend to sit on like a saddle, between their legs – were once a European delicacy. The Catholic church, believing that beavers were half animal, half fish, designated that half as an appropriate food for lent. The naturalist Pierre Belon described the taste as like a “nicely dressed eel”.In the Divine Comedy, the pilgrim Dante is in the seventh circle of hell (Violence) and compares the presence of a Geryon – a dragon-like monster with hairy arms and the “face of a just and honest man” sitting at the edge of the abyss that will carry him down to the eighth circle (Fraud) – to a beaver (il bevero), which moves between water and land:As boats will sometimes lie along the shore,with part of them on land and part in water,and just as there [...]the beaver sets himself when he means war,so did that squalid beast lie on the marginof stone that serves as border for the sand.Beavers have, in fact, played an important, if unwilling, role in several violent wars. The beaver fur trade was at the centre of the Beaver or Iroquois wars, King William’s war, and the French and Indian war. Beavers themselves are fairly comfortable with conflict, once the terms have been established. They behave in a way described as the “Dear enemy” phenomenon, where they will stop fighting with neighbouring territorial animals once their boundaries are set.In some ways, they have established this relationship with us. Beavers have, several times, ignored humans and simply got on with it, in a way that has benefited us hugely. Recently, on a river south of Prague in Czech Republic, where government negotiations to build a dam had been delayed, a group of beavers went ahead and built several dams themselves,saving the government more than a million euros in construction. The wetland the beavers created was twice the size of what the government had planned.View image in fullscreenA female Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) grooming on the River Otter as one of its kits gnaws a willow sapling she’s cut.Photograph: Nick Upton/AlamyBeavers build dams because creating deeper bodies of water allows them to build homes – called lodges – that can be accessed by swimming underneath the entrance.This stops predators who can’t swim from being able to chase and eat them. They start with layers of mud and stone plugged with grass and other softish green things. Then they put sticks and branches on this layer, facing upstream. These are held in place with more mud and stone, and any remaining holes are plugged with more vegetation. They carry mud in their paws, or bring water weeds up to the surface by scooping them up with their heads and noses. They look so proud, adding materials to the wall.Beavers build such good dams that they are now being intentionally introduced to areas where these would otherwise be built by people. They change the way water moves through a landscape, preventing flood and drought, creating ponds where certain species thrive.They do all this while eating only plants. In summer, water lilies, rushes, sedges and grasses. In winter, bark and wood from only the prettiest trees: aspen, dogwood, willow, alder and birch. They shit sawdust.Helen Sullivan is a Guardian journalist. She is writing a book for Scribner AustraliaDo you have an animal, insect or other subject you’d like to see profiled by this columnist?

Next door a mountain range of old sheets, stiff and stained with paint, obscure what might be a sofa. There is a huge, dusty mirror in which we both appear, spectrally: she a slight figure in a brown floor-length skirt, her slippers paint-encrusted. I ask her if she sleeps in the metal-framed bed. Sometimes, she says, but she shows me her bedroom. It is equally spartan, but for the immense piles of books. “You didn’t get round to building many bookshelves,” I observe weakly, in the face of this almost unimaginably austere existence.Paul – likeEdmund de Waal, a contributor to thevast monographabout her work that is about to be published – is now as much respected for her writing as for her art. In 2019 herSelf-Portraitcame out, a memoir that, among other things, described her relationship with Freud, who seduced her when she was 18 and he in his 50s. In 2022 cameLetters to Gwen John, a one-sided correspondence with one of her favourite artistic forebears. These books were published in her 60s. On her shift to writing, she says, “It is a way of articulating thoughts that otherwise justbrew. That can work evocatively in painting. But with words, you need to have order of a different kind. One sentence does have to follow another. And that’s what I needed to do.”Lucian put a tap in the background of one painting – as if to say: Turn the faucet offGetting things down in prose – “the hurt mixed with love in my relationship with Lucian” – stirred up much that she is now working through in paint, she says, the fruits of which will be seen inan exhibition at the Victoria Miro galleryin London. Paul met Freud when he came into theSlade, where she was a student and he a visiting professor. Reading about his seduction of the teenager in Self-Portrait is painful. It is clear that she was emotionally in thrall to him. The reaction to the book was powerful, too. One especially pungent responsewas from novelist Rachel Cusk, who implied that Paul was still trapped by the older painter, long after his death. Paul did not agree, and has made many paintings in order to prove the point – works that enact her memories and changing feelings about not just Freud, but the circle of men in which he moved.View image in fullscreenAn appraising gaze … Reclining Painter, 2023.Photograph: © Celia Paul Courtesy the artist and Victoria MiroShe shows me a painting in the studio. It’s called Weeping Muse and Running Tap. It is based on Freud’sLarge Interior W11 (After Watteau), which is an enormous early 1980s painting of Paul along with one of Freud’s previous lovers, her child, and one of his children. Paul’s version retains just her own figure, her feet seemingly submerged in water. “I really, really didn’t like sitting,” she says. “I felt trapped, and I didn’t want to chat. I was always crying. And he found that incredibly exasperating. I think men are very perplexed and often exasperated by women crying.”There is a tap in the background of Freud’s original painting – “a sort of signal to me,” she says, to “switch off the faucet”. Her riposte in her new work is to double down on the waterworks – that pool of tears under her feet. “I think men find crying exasperating because it’s quite a strong thing to do, isn’t it? I mean, it’s so ‘not done’. But it’s quite a subversive thing.”Near it is a portrait of her mother. It is back in the studio so she can adjust a detail before it goes on show again. She made it when her mother was about her own age now – 65 – and she was 30. “I can’t be detached enough to see it as a painting,” she says. “It just seems to me to be her.” The older woman, a devout Christian, used the time as her daughter’s sitter for reflection and prayer. Freud, by contrast, liked his sitters to focus on him and chat, and hated it when Paul would disappear into her own world. I observe that her paintings are spiritual and inward-gazing, where his are about surface, skin and flesh. “I think that’s what Lucian found very unsettling about my paintings. It’s where our paths really divided. When he saw me going in that different direction, it was disturbing to him that he couldn’t control me,” she says. “Because his way of painting is actually about control.”View image in fullscreen‘I feel quite haunted’ … Colony of Ghosts, 2023.Photograph: © Celia Paul Courtesy the artist and Victoria MiroChat was always torture to the shy young Paul when Freud took her out to dine with his grand painter friends:Frank Auerbach(whom Paul did adore, naming her and Freud’s son after him);Francis Bacon; andMichael Andrews. “Francis knew how to be incredibly polite, but devastatingly cutting,” she says. “I didn’t say anything throughout those dinners, but one time Lucian said, ‘I wish you would say something,’ and so I resolved next time to actually pipe up. We were talking about a Michael Andrews exhibition and I expressed some opinion. Francis just looked at me with this very condescending air, and turned back to Lucian. Afterwards Lucian said it was because my voice sounded too hysterical.”She says this matter-of-factly, leaving it to me to editorialise on the cruelty and sexism of this exchange. Her own response comes in paint. There is awell-known photographby John Deakin of the men – confident, animated, handsome, boozy – dining at Wheeler’s restaurant. Paul has used it as the basis of a new painting, Colony of Ghosts. In her work they stare forth greyly, no longer animated, as if from another dimension.She has also painted a companion piece of herself, lying on the uncomfortable chaise longue on which I have been perching. It is meant to hang opposite Colony of Ghosts. She is very self-possessed in this painting, and offers an appraising gaze to those men who once intimidated her. There is something of Jacques-Louis David’sPortrait of Madame Récamierabout it. The works, she says, “refer to my experience of being at the table, but being shut out and not welcomed in. But there’s also a feeling that now they’re really not approachable at all, because they’re all dead.” She adds, “Here I am in this studio space which Lucian bought for me, with all these memories very alive. I feel quite haunted by all of them.”View image in fullscreen‘I thought: “I really need to change my life.”’Photograph: © Gautier Deblonde Courtesy the artist and Victoria MiroPaul may have dined silently at the table of the men, but she is only five or so years older than the Young British Artists, who rose to prominence in the 1990s and with whose work her own could not be less in harmony. “I found those years very, very difficult, because people really were saying ‘Painting is dead,’” she says. “That was devastating, because painting was my life. There seemed to be this party going on that I was definitely excluded from.”She had had great early success but by 1991, when she had her first solo exhibition with the Marlborough Gallery, the tide had already turned. There was barely any response. By this time she and Freud had split up. She had the flat, and Marlborough gave her a stipend of £14,000 a year as an advance against sales. Her son was mostly brought up by her mother in the country, while she continued to work during the week in Bloomsbury, painting despite everything. “It was an incredible struggle for a long, long time.”The cultural climate eventually shifted. Painting crept back into the conversation. In 2012, Pallant House Gallery in Chichester showed her work alongside that of her beloved Gwen John. Victoria Miro Gallery took her on. But there was also a shift inside her. “Lucian died in 2011. I hadn’tfeltinhibited by him. But I think I must have been, because it was at that point I thought, ‘I really need to change my life.’”The works that converse directly with Freud’s paintings are only one way she has been grappling with the past. She has also made many self-portraits – herself as she is now, herself as she once was, and even herself as she imagines she was once seen by men. There is a core of newfound strength and self-assurance in these works. But she is also planning to retreat again, into the world of the interior and of the spirit. Once the new exhibition is out of the way, there is a stack of blank canvases in her flat, waiting to be painted.Celia Paul: Colony of Ghosts is at Victoria Miro, London, from 14 March to 17 April.

You can’t help but root for himRebecca NicholsonMon 10 Mar 2025 18.00 EDTShareIn Michael Sheen’s Secret Million Pound Giveaway, the Welsh actor Michael Sheen – that is how he says people describe him, so I am merely obliging – is putting his own money on the line to expose the world of high-interest debt and credit. Due to the murky issue of reselling debt, Sheen discovers that it may be possible for him to buy £1m’s worth of debt for a relatively paltry £100,000. Over two years, this documentary shows him working towards buying up the debt, which he plans to write off immediately, pulling off what he calls a “heist”.But this heist is only a framework; Sheen’s Robin Hood act, while impressive, is more of a carrier for the message. The real point of the documentary is to simplify the story of debt, credit and interest rates and to reveal the extent of the problem, particularly in areas with high levels of deprivation.Sheen focuses on his home town, Port Talbot, and meets ordinary working people who are struggling to get by. Ceri, the manager of a community centre and boxing gym, explains concisely how debt can spiral. She describes getting through her savings, turning to food banks and credit cards, then being stuck with high-interest repayments, thus exacerbating the problem.‘It’s not because I want people to think I’m great’: Michael Sheen on paying off £1m of his neighbours’ debtsRead moreThis documentary compares the breathtaking profits made by banks and other financial institutions with the suffering on which some of that profit is built. Sheen is indignant at the unfairness of the system. He reads out a slew of statistics, including that, in October 2024, 2.2 million low-income families in the UK had high-interest credit loans. These arrangements have an enormous impact on the households that can least afford it. Sheen digs into loan sharks and unofficial lenders, uncovering stories of violence and intimidation, of missed payments leading to interest doubling and doubling again. He hears about one man who borrowed £500 and ended up repaying £5,500.The persistent and repeated refrain is that the people who have the least are being forced to pay the most, often just to get by. So when it comes to Sheen’s idea for a heist – “Ocean’s … one,” as he calls it – you can’t help but root for him. With the assistance of his man on the inside, Roland, he secretly sets up a debt‑collecting company and applies for the necessary licence and paperwork. The secrecy is necessary, because debt collectors are “reluctant to have that corner illuminated”. Sheen explains that lenders sell on debts for a lower cost if they no longer consider them to be profitable. Of course, the borrower still has to pay off their original commitment.View image in fullscreenProof that the poor continue to be exploited at every level … Michael Sheen’s Secret Million Pound Giveaway.Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones Photographer/Channel 4The process takes Sheen about two years. While he waits for official approval, he tries to get banks and financial bodies to explain why they refuse to provide more affordable loans, given the obscene profits they make. Not one will send a representative to speak to him, perhaps sensibly, given that it’s hard to justify the unjustifiable.The title is far more feelgood than the documentary itself. It will be eye-opening for viewers oblivious to the problem; viewers, perhaps, who are more cosseted by their class, wealth or environment. For others, it is confirmation that the financial system is rigged and that the poor continue to be exploited at every level. But to see that laid out with such clarity is useful and important.In fact, it’s a credit (so to speak) to Sheen that this remains engaging and infuriating for the full hour, because finance is not the most visually arresting of topics. People tend to be shy about money and debt is a sensitive topic. We see spreadsheets with their contents blurred out; the big climax – the debt being written off – is illustrated by a piece of paper being ripped up. For privacy reasons, we don’t get to see whose debt is wiped out, or how this will affect their lives.But that isn’t really the point. Sheen’s documentary –for which he wasn’t paid and in which he uses his own money to pay others’ debt – provides a decent, moving and clear explanation of the injustice. It also shows that action is powerful, as is his pure belief that the system can be changed. We may not all have £100,000 to throw at it, but Sheen’s dogged determination to do something “one brick at a time” should be an inspiration to all.Michael Sheen’s Secret Million Pound Giveaway is on Channel 4 nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMichael SheenreviewsShareReuse this content"

But that was five years ago. The flurry of interest it roused in the subject has long since fallen back to normal levels. Chess Masters has no moment to capitalise on, except for what it assures us is “Britain’s booming chess community”, 12 of whose “rising stars” compete over eight episodes to, well, beat the other 11 at chess.This has clearly presented the producers of the show with a number of problems, none of which has been successfully solved. There is the question of how you make an essentially silent, cerebral game telegenic and accessible. They have hired a presenter with glasses to acknowledge the intellectualism of the pursuit, but made it Sue Perkins to try to give warm, Bake Off vibes too. But it is still inescapably people frowning over an abstract strategy board game, not constructing model cities out of profiteroles or coaxing clouds of pistachio and rose-flavoured cakes out of the oven like culinary gods.They have provided two sub-presenters – grandmaster and three-time British champion David Howell plus chess coach and former Traitors contestant Anthony Mathurin – to explain what is going on, but have then run scared of allowing them to do so. We get a hurried handful of descriptions of games’ pinch points in each episode (“Active back rank … strong centre … triple stack … sleeping pieces, retreating queens … and that’s a pin and win”) that are too fast for the ignorant (Hi!) to understand and too basic to be useful to anyone else (“That’s what’s known in chess as a blunder”). And Mathurin’s effortful enthusiasm for the camera is almost unwatchable.View image in fullscreen‘This is what’s known in chess as a blunder’ … David Howell, Sue Perkins and Anthony Mathurin on Chess Masters: The Endgame.Photograph: BBC/Curve Media/Alistair HeapThe contestants have, as ever, been chosen with an eye primarily on their backstories. Like 56-year-old Nick, who discovered the salvatory properties of the game while in prison and now runs chess clubs in Charlton and Greenwich, to try to spread the word. And 46-year-old Navi, who picked up his previous hobby again when he was diagnosed with stage-four cancer (he is now in remission) and found it the perfect mental escape from the world of appointments and treatment. He and his children all play together now, which is all lovely, but doesn’t make things much more interesting to watch.All the candidates have been lumbered with embarrassing nicknames. I presume this was a producer’s idea too, partly because not one sounds as if it has sprung up organically and partly because I simply cannot believe there are a dozen sentient adults in the world who prefer to be known in chess competitions as “The Unruly Knight” (34-year-old Cai – a classically trained actor, who says chess gives him discipline, though he apparently also thrives on “chaotic play”; God, you never know where you are with actors), “TheChessPrincess” (26-year-old chess content creator Lula, who was actually inspired by The Queen’s Gambit to give the game a try) or “The Unrelenting Warrior” (Navi).Chess returns to the screen on Monday with Chess Masters: The EndgameRead moreThe first two episodes focus on the first six contestants as they go head-to-head in matches held in the ballroom of Cardiff’s former coal exchange, then compete to solve chess puzzles (set by Howell) in the fastest time possible. As he gravely inspects each board and the participants wait to hear the fateful words “Puzzle complete!” or “Puzzle incomplete!” it is all faintly reminiscent of the IT Crowd episode when Moss gets involved with “street Countdown” (“Gimme one of those sweet, sweet consonants”). The encroaching bathos is not helped by the insistence that winners ascend to the “balcony of dreams” (the ballroom’s balcony) while losers wait elsewhere for their chance to avoid elimination.Chess Masters: The Endgame could have been gentle and charming if somebody involved had had some faith in the game, in the potential for people to be interested in explanations of its finer points, or allowed Perkins off the leash a bit to make more jokes – yes, even in the face of such a terribly serious game! Instead, it feels thin, tired and scared. Let’s have the courage of your convictions next time, people, and, if you have none, that’s absolutely fine. Just don’t bother at all.Chess Masters: The Endgame aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionChessReality TVThe TraitorsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In 1984, black townships across the country revolted. By 1986, the white minority government had imposed a state of emergency. But in the segregated white enclaves, life was affluent and peaceful.“While the country as a whole was very much in flames and in turmoil, we were blissfully very safe in our little leafy suburbs, going about our very normal life,” said Jonathan Stewart, who was a year above Musk at Pretoria boys, which also counts the Labour politician Peter Hain, the Booker prize-winning novelist Damon Galgut and the murderer and Paralympian Oscar Pistorius among its former pupils.“You had this wealthy set, in relative terms, and everybody else was excluded.”View image in fullscreenMusk (middle row, 2nd from the left) at Pretoria boys high school in 1988.Photograph: Pretoria boys high schoolMusk, who was born in Pretoria in 1971, railed on his social media platform X last month against the “openly racist laws” of the country of his birth and responded “yes” to the statement: “White South Africans are being persecuted for their race in their home country.”After the posts by the man now at the helm of Donald Trump’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge), a special group Trump has created, the US president signed an executive order accusing South Africa’s government of“unjust racial discrimination”against white Afrikaners, citing a law allowing land to be expropriated in certain circumstances. The order cut aid to South Africa, which receives 17% of its HIV/Aids budget from the US, and offered asylum to Afrikaners.It was not clear the extent to which Musk, who left South Africa in 1989 for his mother’s country, Canada, and then went to the US, had a direct hand in encouraging Trump to issue the order.Trump has taken an interest in the alleged persecution of white South Africans since his first presidency, when an Afrikaner rights grouptravelled to the USto claim, falsely, that white farmers were being murdered for their land with the complicity of the government. Trump saw one of the group’s leaders interviewed on Fox News and tweeted his support.Trump has also been influenced by other interests, including US groups critical ofSouth Africa’s case against Israelat the international court of justice (ICJ) over the war in Gaza, which he referred to in his executive order.View image in fullscreenPupils at Pretoria boys high school, where Musk was a day pupil.Photograph: Moeletsi Mabe/The GuardianBut with Musk now among Trump’s closest advisers, it is unlikely he has not made his views known to the president, given they are also tied up with his business interests in South Africa.Musk has claimed that land reform laws, in a country where the white minority, who make up just 7% of South Africa’s population, still ownmore than 70%of agricultural land, are racist and amount to theft. He has endorsed claims that the killings of white farmers amount to genocide;researchsuggests the crimes are financially motivated.Musk’s attacks have ratcheted up at a time when he is in a dispute with the South African government about affirmative action laws, as he tries to sell his Starlink satellite network in the country. The world’s richest man objects to a law requiring that foreign investors in the telecoms sector provide 30% of the equity in the South African part of the enterprise to Black-owned businesses.Trump’s executive order will add to the pressure on South Africa’s government to exempt Musk from the Black empowerment laws.X’s press team and Musk’s lawyer did not respond to interview requests or emailed questions.To what extent Musk’s years growing up under the collapsing apartheid regime influenced his positions today, frommaking what looked like a Nazi salute– a characterisation he rejects – at Trump’s inauguration celebrations last month to his embrace of far-right political parties such as Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland, remains an open debate.View image in fullscreenMusk’s name on the donor list in the new auditorium at Pretoria boys high school.Photograph: Moeletsi Mabe/The GuardianWhite, English-speaking South Africans such as Musk’s family benefited from apartheid’s racial hierarchy but lived mostly separate lives from the ruling Afrikaners.Musk spent the first two years of South Africa’s five high school years at the all-white Bryanston high school in Johannesburg’s leafy northern suburbs. Founded in 1968, it is a mixed-sex, English-language, fee-paying state school, made up of rectangular mid-century buildings.Like South Africa then and now, Bryanston high was sports mad. “It was a little bit like when you think of American society,” said Lesley Burns, who finished at the school in 1984, Musk’s first year. “There were all the jocks and the popular guys in the football team.”Musk, who was on the school’s chess team in 1985, was viciously bullied. The hounding culminated with him being thrown down a set of stairs, beaten so badly that he was hospitalised. The school declined an interview.View image in fullscreenMusk (front left) in the chess team from the school’s 1985 yearbook.Photograph: Bryanston high schoolMusk’s father moved him and his brother, Kimbal, to Pretoria boys, where he was well liked, according to Gideon Fourie, who had computer science classes with Musk.“He was a very average personality,” Fourie said. “He wasn’t in any way like a super jock, or a super nerd, or a super punk … He had a group of friends.”South African media were subjected to strict government censorship. Newspapers would appear with censored sections blacked out, particularly reports of the growing unrest in the townships and mass arrests, until those were also banned.In contrast, the fee-paying Pretoria boys was liberal, for its time. In 1981 it became the first government school to admit a Black pupil. The then headteacher, Malcolm Armstrong, used a loophole that allowed it to let in the sons of diplomats from the “homelands” within South Africa that the apartheid system claimed were independent states.“Armstrong even defied the authorities by meeting with the ANC [African National Congress] in Dakar while it was still banned,” said Patrick Conroy, who was in Kimbal’s year, two years below Musk. “He frequently addressed our school assemblies, emphasising the importance of democracy, human rights and social justice.”The school’s current headteacher, Gregary Hassenkamp, was also in Kimbal’s year and has similar memories of his predecessor, although he noted that not all teachers shared Armstrong’s liberal views.View image in fullscreenGregary Hassenkamp, Pretoria boys school’s current headteacher.Photograph: Moeletsi Mabe/The Guardian“I remember him forcing boys to think about the country in which we lived and the attitudes we had,” Hassenkamp said in an interview in his wood-panelled office, wearing a flowing black gown and a tie and socks in the school’s red, white and green colours.Musk has previously described himself as “not a conservative” and backed the Democratic candidate in every presidential election going back to Barack Obama’s victory in 2008, until he moved to the right. But Musk is clearly suspicious of democracy and the leaders it produces.In the 1930s, his grandfather headed an anti-democratic fringe political movement in Canada with fascist overtones, which campaigned for government by elite technocrats. He then moved to apartheid South Africa because the racist system appealed to him.Musk now appears happy to embrace the US version of the “strongman” ruler by backing Trump’s claim that the will of the president is paramount.Some of Musk’s school peers speculated that his current views of South Africa may be influenced by his missing out on the ups and downs of the negotiations to end apartheid and the “miracle” of Nelson Mandela becoming the country’s first Black president in 1994.Since then, the governments led by Mandela’s ANC party have failed to address the world’s worst economic inequality. While itsBlack economic empowerment policiesoffer tax breaks and state contracts to Black-owned companies, Black people are five times likelier than white people to be unemployed. South Africa also has one of the world’s highest murder rates.It is not uncommon to hear white South Africans say they arebeing discriminated against, often citing affirmative action laws. In mid-February,hundreds gathered outside the US embassyin Pretoria carrying signs with slogans such as “Thank God for President Trump” and “Make South Africa Great Again”.View image in fullscreenHallways in the Pretoria school’s main building.Photograph: Moeletsi Mabe/The GuardianWhile it is rare to hear white South Africans say they want a return to apartheid, it is also not uncommon to hear older people express nostalgia for that time.“It was a good time, because we had no crime. There were no problems. People, Blacks and whites, got on very well with each other,” Errol Musk said in a video interview from his spacious Cape Town home, when asked about his son Elon’s childhood. “Everything worked. That’s the reality. Of course people don’t want to hear that, but that’s the truth.”Musk and his two younger full siblings, Kimbal and Tosca, have had a tumultuous relationship with their father. Kimbal told Musk’s biographer Walter Isaacson that their father would scream at them for two to three hours, calling them worthless and pathetic. Their mother, Maye, has accused him of physical abuse.“It’s rubbish,” Errol said when asked about the allegations, which he has repeatedly denied.The brothers became estranged from their father in 2017, not for the first time, when he had a child with his 30-year-old stepdaughter, Jana Bezuidenhout, according to Isaacson. In Errol’s telling, they got angry with him when he expressed his support for Trump in 2016, at a party in Cape Town they threw for his 70th and Musk’s 45th birthdays.“Things changed when Biden came in and Elon realised they’re trying to destroy America,” Errol said. “Now we exchange messages about every day. Of course, he’s not always able to answer, so his PA will answer me.”Additional reporting by Chris McGrealExplore more on these topicsElon MuskSouth AfricaTrump administrationRaceSchoolsAfricaUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Solving the issue means challenging false assumptionsGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailMon 10 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 18.15 EDTShareHuman sexuality is often likened to a fingerprint: our desires, fantasies and physical responses are as unique as the ridges on our fingers. In session, when I share this analogy with couples, they are relieved to know it’s actuallynormalto be different from their partner.While it’s true that no two people are the same, when it comes to “mismatched libido” a predictable scenario will usually play out. In my first session with a couple, they will sit on opposite sides of the couch and say they haven’t had sex in months, or years. They are lost and desperate. One of them will share that they feel unwanted, and the other will admit that theywantto want it, they just don’t. Because of this, they feel broken. They both agree sex is important for their relationship, but now it has become a stressful, awkward topic where discussion almost certainly ends in conflict. Desire discrepancy, or as many call it a “mismatched sex drive”, is one of the most common reasons people come to see me. It’s also why I dedicated a whole chapter to navigating desire in my bookThe Modern Guide to Sex.Couples assume I’ll tell them to have sex every single night, or schedule it in their shared iCal. Most people think the solution is to “just do it more”. This isn’t the case. To resolve a sexual impasse, we need to step back and understand what desire is, what’s affecting it and how a couple can create more mutual pleasure.What is desire?View image in fullscreen‘Another misconception is that low desire is a gendered issue.’Illustration: arvitalya/Getty Images/iStockDesire is a longing, wanting or motivation for sex. At times it may feel existentially threatening, like hunger or thirst, but unlike food and water, not getting enough sex is not going to kill you. Understanding that there’s no “right” or “healthy” amount of sex is essential, which is why in session we challenge words like “mismatched”. You’re not necessarily in a mismatched relationship just because you don’t want to have sex at the same time.I’ve found these assumptions often assign the blame to the person with lower desire. They can feel that they’re the one with the problem, and may even turn up to a session on their own, leaving the partner with the self-proclaimed “high sex drive” at home. We’ve been socialised to think that the person who wants sex is normal, but desire discrepancy is a relational concern. Both people have contributed to the sexual dynamic, which means both people need to be in a session if they want to make progress.I’m a sex educator. Here’s the biggest myth about desire in long-term relationshipsRead moreSign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWe start by looking at what happens outside of the bedroom. In recent years, the awareness of desire styles has been pivotal in reframing the expectations of sex. Many people assume we should want sex instantly, but there are actually two desire types that exist on a spectrum. On the one end we havespontaneous desire, which, as the name suggests, is an urge for sex that seemingly comes out of nowhere. We see this in a lot in porn and in movies, and tend to experience it at the start of a relationship. But there’s another style –responsive desire– which emerges in response to external or internal cues. Rather than feeling an innate urge, those who are responsive may experience desire after receiving neck kisses for a few minutes, feeling emotionally connected to their partner, being away on holiday or watching a sex scene.Couples assume I’ll tell them to have sex every single night, or schedule it in their iCalWhen working with a young queer couple, one of them shared that a big part of her desire for sex was the build-up – she wanted to be touched slowly and sensually, she wanted to be flirted with outside of sex. In learning about responsive desire, she realised she didn’t have a low sex drive, it was that she was not getting enough of what she needed in order to feel turned on.Most couples who struggle with desire are waiting for it to smack them in the face or to feel the way it did at the start of their relationship. In reality, they may need to actively create the context for themselves and their partner, instead of hoping it will just happen.Another misconception is that low desire is a gendered issue. It’s widely assumed men have higher desire than women. This is not true. Recently a heterosexual couple told me they struggled with this pervasive assumption. While the woman in this couple believed intellectually it was normal for her to want sex more than her partner, she still felt there was something wrong with her. As if she was greedy or obsessed with sex. Meanwhile, he felt inadequate, like he was letting his partner – and his gender – down. Your genitals or your gender say nothing about how much you will want sex. Sexual desire is a multifaceted and dynamic phenomenon, and it is influenced by a wide range of factors, both internal and circumstantial.What affects desire?When I asked another couple to talk me through their day, the 40-year-old woman was responsible for everything: their kids, managing the household and all the invisible, never-ending labour. She spoke about the resentment building for her husband knowing his primary focus was getting himself to and from work. At night, when she collapsed on the couch for her first moment of reprieve, she then felt her husband’s hand wandering up her leg and was “repulsed” by the idea of sex. Sure, she didn’t have anything else to do at that moment, but she also had nothing left to give. Sex was the furthest thing from her mind.As I do with all couples, with this pair we mapped out the things that turn them off (sexual inhibition) and the things that turn them on (sexual excitation). It’s different for everyone but factors such as stress, fatigue, mental load, low sexual confidence, performance anxiety and relationship conflict all affect desire. So even if you love your partner deeply and are attracted to them, you may experience a decrease in desire due to the turn-offs at play. It is virtually impossible to desire or prioritise sex when you’re overwhelmed by turn-offs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On a practical level that may mean sharing the mental load, taking more time to build arousal before jumping into sex, or working on conflict resolution skills. Couples also need to engage in more turn-ons: doing things with and for each other that feel sexually exciting.Creating more pleasureView image in fullscreenExplore moments of pleasure without the pressure: kissing on the couch, showering together and sending flirty texts, for example.Illustration: arvitalya/Getty Images/iStockphotoOften, the person with lower desire for sex is so cautious about giving their partner the “wrong idea”, they withdraw any kind of sensual or sexual intimacy. They stop kissing their partner, they stop telling them they look good, they stop touching them. They fear that if they do any of these things, it may suggest sex is on the table, which means they’ll have to go through the guilt-ridden process of saying no –again.In these cases I assign an experiment: don’t have sex for a month and instead explore moments of pleasure. This removes the pressure and couples start doing things that feel comfortable and doable: kissing on the couch, showering together, sending flirty texts, sharing fantasies, reading erotica together.‘I felt like I was his carer’: why straight women in relationships lose interest in sexRead moreWhen I suggest this experiment I’m met with a blend of scepticism and relief. They are hesitant to take sex off the cards. Some fear they will get too comfortable and never have sex again. But their relief is enough to motivate them, which quickly turns to excitement when they realise they actuallywantto be sexual with their partner. Feeling excited about dry-humping on the couch for 30 minutes can be enough to reassure someone their desire isn’t dead. After doing this experiment, couples come back to session saying they are more sexually fulfilled, more connected and that they’ve started to desire more.The most sexually fulfilled long-term couples are the ones who define sex as being about pleasure, rather than penetration, and who engage in frequent and playful sexual moments. They are more sexually satisfied than couples who have frequent and unfulfilling penetrative sex. These couples value sex, agree it’s important for their relationship and recognise it may not always be front of mind, and that it may change over time.They also commit to doing things that feel pleasurable for themselves and their partner. By staying in bed on a Saturday morning rather than going to the gym, leaving the washing pile for an extra hour, and sharing the mental load so that both people can access more pleasure without the burden of stress, these couples prioritise sexual intimacy. They set dates and have sex before they go out, because they know they’ll be too tired and full by 10pm. They try to make sex about fun, pleasure and feeling good, rather than about performance and pressure.I see firsthand how distressing desire discrepancy can be, but I also see couples who walk into my practice feeling hopeless and lost then leave feeling connected and more sexually satisfied. They inch closer to each other on the couch and even hold hands through the tricky bits. You are not broken if you’re struggling with sex, but you will need to do things differently if you want it to change.Georgia Grace is the author ofThe Modern Guide to Sex, published by HarperCollins.

Let’s not waste time wondering who’s wrong and who’s rightMon 10 Mar 2025 12.26 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 13.44 EDTShareIhave one primitive but foolproof tool of political analysis. Trying to balance competing claims in any matter of party discipline – unless it’s a party of which I am a member, in which case, of course, I have already picked a side – I think: “Does it sound as if anyone’s done the kind of vetting even I would know how to do?”Rupert Lowe has been suspended from Reform over claims of bullying and physical intimidation, which he says are without basis. He went on to say, on X, that he was “disappointed, but not surprised” by the allegations, which has a conspiratorial whiff. He has already said the allegations are false, so if he is not surprised to hear them made, it surely indicates that he thinks he is dealing with the kind of people who will expediently exploit any kind of nonsense.In other words, it’s time to settle in for this fight, which will not end quietly.Any party that returns more MPs than it expected to ends up with some dodgy ones – that is just a fact. It was as true for Jeremy Corbyn in 2017 (I know he didn’t win, OK?) as it was for Boris Johnson in 2019. General elections are just one rolling exam crisis and nobody prepares for the questions they don’t expect to come up – questions such as: “What happens if Labour wins Sheffield Hallam?” (The answer being, of course, that within months it finds itselfsuspending the new MPover misogynistic and homophobic comments.) Then there are the questions that aren’t so much niche as existential: what happens if another large party, which gets much of its energy from racist dog-whistling, turns out to contain MPs who whistle a lot more audibly when they are not in front of a camera? You can’t really prepare for that eventuality – you just have to hope nobody is taking notes.You would think Reform would be immune to this kind of jeopardy, having returned only five MPs – it’s a lot to get to from zero, but it’s not much for a compliance team to get their teeth into. But Reform wasn’t immune, so here we are. Let’s return to my primitive rule: how long would it take a person like me to discover a blot on anyone’s copybook? I don’t have any connections with the police, a background in IT or experience in HR. I am not a psychologist, or psychic, so even though, like all middle-class women of a certain age, I am pretty confident I can spot a wrong ’un when I see one, I have no qualifications in this area.All that being said, if anyone had ever had a tantrum at work, if they had even put their cup down in an irritable manner, I would definitely, positively have known about it five minutes later.None of which is to adjudicate on Lowe’s guilt or innocence, merely to note that you can understand why people might think that either Reform’s leadership has been keeping these charges in its back pocket, for use in an emergency, or that they are not true.The only demonstrably true thing about this debacle is Lowe’s inflammatory remark that Reform is a “protest party led by the messiah”. If Nigel Farage has anything to say, he is more likely to say it on GB News than in parliament. If he has any discernible long-term strategy, it relates to how close he wants to stay to Donald Trump, and how vocally. That doesn’t even align with the views of his own party, let alone try to meet the rest of the country halfway (although, sure, how you meet an electorate halfway, between “I hate Trump” and “I should like to apply for the position of his lickspittle running dog”, is open to question).None of which, again, is intended to determine the truth about Lowe: it’s possible for everybody in this party, plus all its members, to be wrong. This doesn’t have the air of a professional political organisation because it was never intended to be one; it’s like the dog who chases cars, in that it would have no use for the car if it caught it. The car – by which I mean every other party in British politics – should stop running so scared of the dog.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They have made that shameful choiceMon 10 Mar 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 15.07 EDTShareWhether it’s the front pages or your Uncle Frank’s Facebook posts, you’ll have done well lately to avoid news about upcoming disability benefits cuts. After months of speculation, the government is reportedlyset to pull £6bnfrom the “welfare budget” ahead of its spring statement, with some Labour MPs already threatening revolt.Read much of the commentary and you’d believe this was all about the public purse – see talk about“savings”and changing“global factors”such as trade tariffs and the war in Ukraine. And yet, dig a little deeper and Labour’s proposed reforms appear to be based not just on budgeting, but a belief: paid work is a virtue (and people who don’t perform it deserve a worse life than everyone else). As Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary,said last week: “There is a moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work.”Since taking office last summer, Keir Starmer has made work a central tenet of the new government. At a time when the number of people off sick long-term isat a record high, the prime minister’s repeated use of the phrase “working people” has not exactly been subtle.This has never just been about arguing work is the best way to pay the bills – it is about painting it as a virtue in the pursuit of economic growth. Just look at how a recent PR video for the government’sKeep Britain Workingreview refers to disabilities as“work-limiting conditions”. It is a rebranding of distress, where, say, Parkinson’s is not a painful illness that affects human beings but an obstacle that prevents arms from stacking shelves for shareholders.Even Labour’s NHS reforms and health policies have been framed in terms of getting people back into the labour market, with ministerspondering weight-loss jabsfor unemployed people andwork coachesvisiting patients on mental health wards. It is reminiscent of a “your country needs you” recruitment poster, where the long-term sick are expected to battle through the pain for the sake of the taxpayer. Under Labour, health is a prerequisite – not for a good life for yourself, but to be a good worker for the nation.This is hardly a new narrative. Back in 1834, thepoor lawssaw the “deserving poor” sent to the workhouses to be housed and fed in exchange for gruelling labour. More than 150 years later, New Labourcut single mothers’ benefitsto nudge them into work under the principle that the state should start“demanding more of individuals”. And who could forget the coalition government thatpegged £10bn of cutsto the “welfare bill” on the moral mission to target so-called scroungers who – as the then chancellorGeorge Osborne notoriously put it– have their “blinds down” in the morning while strivers go to work.Fast forward a decade and it is clear these ideas are taking hold again, from institutions and the press to social media. When the rightwing thinktank Policy Exchangepublished a report last week– backed by former Labour work and pensions secretary Lord Blunkett – calling for a regressive overhaul of disability benefits, it notably did so on the basis that the system wasn’t working fiscally, technically “or morally”. Even the seemingly neutral term “economically inactive”, which has entered the lexicon in recent years, is morally loaded, defining human beings by whether they add value to the economy or are – literally – inactive.Of course, all of this speaks to the nature of work under capitalism. It exploits workers for profit while claiming only those who labour – not the unemployed – will get improved material conditions. It ignores the reality that much work is unfulfilling and hard, and in 2025 increasingly fails to meet basic living costs. Instead, this moral case for work creates a vision of a benevolent boss class gifting the joy of a 9-to-5 to the masses. As the current work and pensions chief, Liz Kendall,said in January, getting disabled people into employment gives them “purpose”.‘Don’t punish the vulnerable’: Labour MPs uneasy over planned welfare cutsRead moreBut it also evokes – and fuels – specific prejudices about disabled people that go far beyond the Labour party. The same arguments that equate “productivity” with a person’s value have long been used to portray those who can’t earn a wage due to disability as a burden on the working population. Every time you see a headline on “the cost of the benefits bill”, what you are really reading is “the cost of disabled people”. That Labour’s reforms reportedly include raising the universal credit basic rate for those looking for or in work,while cutting itfor those judged as unfit to work, is a particularly blatant message. Such policy casts individuals who “overcome” their condition to work as worthy, and those who fail to as just not trying hard enough.It is why any drives to get disabled people into work always go hand in hand with a punitive benefits system, despite all evidence showingsuch measures are counterproductive. As Nick Ferraritold LBC listenerslast week (while making mock crying sounds, no less): people on benefits who are deemed not to be looking for work should get more “hassle” from job coaches and their money docked – as long as they’ve “got use of [their] arms”. If work brings moral reward, unemployment comes with punishment.In this context, Labour’srefusal to introducea wealth tax to meet costs is less a temporary outrage and more a natural extension of the status quo. We should all know the rules of the game by now: in a culture that equates wealth with respect, and productivity with value, rich and healthy people are applauded as hard-working and deserving, while poor and sick people are demonised as idle and unworthy. Before you know it, a Labour government is choosing – and it is a choice – to take money from disabled benefit claimants rather than tax high earners. You might ask, is that the moral thing to do?Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist. Her latest book,Who Wants Normal?

This one featured my best friend, M:admiring a dosa, stroking her cat, holding a pair of Parisian melons and lying in my garden. It made me smile and when I told her, she said her phone had had the same idea. “It keeps trying to get me to put you as wallpaper,” she messaged, showing me its suggestions. Like pushy parents, it was as if our phones had got together and decided it was time we had a playdate. The worst of it is they are right: I really miss her.It reminded me of all the other ways my phone parents me. When I get out of choir practice, it volunteers, unprompted, that it will take 12 minutes to get home by my usual route. It helpfully offers to count down a minute when I am at the gym and want to time my rests between weights sets. When I get into the car on Saturday afternoons, it always shows me the way to the supermarket. At bedtime, it offers a shortcut to TikTok because it knows watchingcats confused by Ramadanand RuPaulexplaining how to parallel parksoothes me.It should feel intrusive to be known so intimately by your phone – all that personal data harvested in the service ofsurveillance capitalism– but I find it obscurely comforting.

Your phone can prompt you to text your auntie on her birthday, suggest a nice walk when you are down, nag you to drink more water or even to pee. It is, basically, your mum.

It was a clever move by the navy’s top brass to invite him. They know that the aircraft carrier, and her sister, HMS Queen Elizabeth, are being questioned as luxuries Britain can ill afford. They are completely unsuited to modern warfare. As if to acknowledge the point, while defence chiefs struggle to find weapons desperately needed by Ukraine, including basic ammunition, they are sending the Prince of Wales to “fly the flag” in south-east Asia.The carriers, the largest warships built for the navy, cost more than £6bn, well above the original estimate of under £4bn. Maintaining and repairing the ships, hit by serious mechanical problems over their short lifespan, has already cost nearly £1bn.Soon after he retired as chief of the defence staff, Gen (now Lord) David Richards described the carriers to me as “unaffordable, vulnerable metal cans”. They were “behemoths”, he said. The carriers were considered to be so vulnerable to attack that the navy last year advised they should not be deployed to the Red Sea toprotect merchant ships from Houthi missiles.The navy does not have enough sailors to crew the ships needed to protect and supply the carriers. The number of F-35 fighters available to fly from the carriers is also well below the ships’ capacity. We now face the extraordinary situation where the navy’s most expensive ships, designed to carry the world’s most expensive warplanes, will soon become a base for drones: drones that can cost as little as a few thousand, even a few hundred, pounds, and are proving to be the most deadly weapons in Ukraine.For too long, Britain’s defence establishment has been allowed to get away with procuring military equipment that is more relevant to past wars, turning a blind eye to the mounting evidence of fundamental changes in the nature of military conflict. Years ago, I asked a top official what mistakes theMinistry of Defencewas making, what it was ignoring. He gave me a one-word answer: “Cyber.” To the frustration of the intelligence agencies, the MoD was slow to recognise the growing threat of cyberwarfare. Russian defence chiefs were already acknowledging that their country could not beat the west by force alone, despite Vladimir Putin’s rhetoric, suggesting that “non-military” tactics – arson, subversion and sabotage, including attacks on undersea communications cables – could be more effective than traditional warfare.0:40UK’s largest warship enters Portsmouth – videoYear after year, the National Audit Office, backed by the Commons public accounts committee, castigates the MoD for failing to learn from past mistakes. British taxpayers are spending more than £5bn on the army’s Ajax armoured vehicle, now finally beingdelivered eight years late, after tests revealed serious design faults, with soldiers getting ill from vibration and noise. Serious problems have also hit plans for the army’s new communications system, the navy’s nuclear-powered Astute attack submarine fleet, and the fleet of Type 45 destroyers.Meanwhile, Britain spends a larger portion of its military budget on nuclear weapons than any other state,researchby the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons shows. Annual spending on Britain’s nuclear weapons has more than doubled since 2012, the website Defence Eye hasreported. The MoD has singled out uncertainties about the cost of Britain’s nuclear weapons programme as one of the reasons it failed to publish its spending plans.In 2023, the NAO pointed to a £16.9bn black hole in Britain’s defence equipment programme. Now, for the second successive year, the MoD has failed to publish an annual report on the state of its equipment programme. The NAO has not been able to produce an independent assessment of the government’s arms procurement plans.Earlier this year, the chairs of the Commons defence and public accounts committeeswroteto the MoD’s most senior official expressing their “deep frustration” at an “unacceptable loss of transparency … severely undermining the ability of both committees to scrutinise the estimated £300bn of taxpayers’ money to be spent on defence equipment over the next decade”.In a recent and timely book, The Retreat from Strategy, co-authored with the defence academic Julian Lindley-French, Lord Richards warns against “wallowing in nostalgia”, with British defence policy “incoherent and purposeless, with little relation between defence strategic ends, ways and means”. The final recommendations of the strategic defence review by George Robertson, the former Labour defence secretary, are being studied by the government. Promised by the end of June, it will be the most important test yet of how, or indeed whether, the government has learned from its past mistakes. Recent history tells us it is not so much the amount of money devoted to the armed forces, as how it is spent: the waste must end.Richard Norton-Taylor writes for the Guardian on defence and security and is a contributor to a forthcoming alternative defence reviewExplore more on these topicsMinistry of DefenceOpinionDefence policyMilitaryRoyal NavycommentShareReuse this content"

Fifteen thousand years ago, most of the country was buried a kilometre deep in ice – not ideal conditions for life. That all changed as we moved out of the lastice ageinto the current, milder climate phase. The ice sheets retreated, leaving an empty landscape for anything with the wherewithal to seize the opportunity and move in. Tens of thousands of species did, mainly heading north from the European continent to which Britain was then joined. The result was a native biota where almost every species is an immigrant. Our ancestors were among them.Immigration is a natural process, but it’s one that has been fundamentally changed thanks to humanity’s wanderlust. As we’ve moved around the world we have taken many other species along with us – some deliberately, some accidentally – to areas they couldn’t have reached without our assistance. These include many of the most familiar denizens of the British countryside. Grey squirrel, ring-necked parakeet, horse chestnut, rhododendron– none of these would be in Britain if they hadn’t been brought by people. They are what ecologists call aliens. Anywhere people live you’ll also find aliens.Invasive alien species (IAS) are immigrants, but of a sort never before experienced in nature. Most natural colonists come from nearby. Now, pretty much anything can get anywhere from anywhere. Japanese knotweed,giant rhubarb(Gunnera), Himalayan balsam and Canadian pondweed are aliens living in Britain. Natural colonists need to have the traits necessary to make the journey to a new environment, but aliens don’t. Rats didn’t have the strokes to reach the Isles of Scilly, but humans lent a hand. Likewise, stoats to Orkney. ThemidgeEretmoptera murphyimade it from South Georgia to the Antarctic peninsula, 500 miles away, despite being flightless.Humans have been moving species for thousands of years, but the rate at which aliens are arriving is speeding up. For most of the last 500-odd years, a new alien species has appeared somewhere roughly every other month or so, or around seven new aliens per year worldwide. The rate of arrival started to climb in the middle of the 18th century, as trade routes between the European colonial powers and their possessions were regularised. It has continued to climb ever since. By the end of the 20th century, more than one new alien species was appearing somewhereevery day, on average. More alien bird species arrived in the 17 years between 1983 to 2000 than there had beenin the 400 yearsbetween 1500 and 1900.The rate at which aliens are arriving is accelerating, and so is the rate at which the arrivals spread. Take the1,000-plus alien insect speciesexpanding across Europe. For most of the last two centuries, they spread at an average of 3.3km a year – not especially fast, but moving. That speed has slowly picked up though – to 12.1km/yr for insects first seen between 1970 and 1989, and a speedy 37km/yr for insects appearing after 1989.The reasons for the great alien acceleration are pretty obvious. Humans have always travelled, but in just a few centuries we’ve gone from wind-driven carracks to diesel-powered container ships, and now planes. We’re moving further, faster and with greater capacity to carry cargo with us. Trade deals eliminate borders and reduce the opportunities to intercept aliens, but that trade also supplies a demand for novel species. At least 1,000 species of alien mammal, 2,600 species of bird and 2,200 species of reptile weretraded on the international marketbetween 1975 and 2021, most probably as exotic pets. The internet facilitates this. It’s easy to find websites where you can buy 60 different species of spider, 50 of scorpion and dozens of other types of invertebrate. The Royal Horticultural Society’s Plant Finderlistsmore than 70,000 plant varieties available for sale in Britain, the vast majority of which will be alien given our native flora isonly around 1,750 species. Any plant that comes with soil is probably bringing in invertebrates and microbes too. Even a Colombian tree frog, in one well-publicisedrecent case.You’ve probably been told that biodiversity is good, so why not just welcome all these aliens? The short answer is that aliens have impacts. Aliens drive extinctions of naive natives – they’ve been fully or partly responsible for moreextinctions in the last 500 yearsthan any other cause, even habitat destruction. Aliens affect human health – think malaria or yellow fever in the Americas – and are estimated to wipe at least$423bnoff global economies. That might not sound like a lot, but it is nearly half of what developing countries have beenarguing they needannually by 2030 to combat the devastating effects of climate breakdown. It’s true that most aliens don’t have (or have not yet had) impacts, but we often don’t know which ones will until it is too late.‘Substantial’ increase in grey squirrels in England is concerning, campaigners sayRead moreWe have a moral duty to address the environmental problems we’ve caused, and there is plenty we can do to stem the tide of alien species. Strict biosecurity regulationsreducedthe rate of alien plant arrivals in New Zealand to almost zero, and havegreatly reducedthe arrival of new aliens in the North American Great Lakes. Public awareness of threats helps – the earlier a problem species is noticed, the easier it is to deal with. Vigilance by beekeepers and the wider public have (so far)prevented the establishmentof the bee-killing Asian hornet in the UK. While some might balk at the implications – lethal control of alien species will often be required – looking the other way is simply making a choice about where deaths fall. Asian hornets or honeybees. Scilly’s rats or the seabird chicks and eggs they consume.Tim Blackburn is professor of invasion biology at University College London and author of The Jewel Box: How Moths Illuminate Nature’s Hidden RulesExplore more on these topicsInvasive speciesOpinionWildlifeConservationcommentShareReuse this content"

Will technology push us over the edge or help us exit our many crises?Mon 10 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 13.44 EDTShareToday we live in an era defined by crisis. Indeed, we are facing multiple overlapping threats at once: from acceleratingclimate breakdownto the rise ofauthoritarianismacross the world, we are in a situation that the historian Adam Tooze calls “polycrisis”. It is no wonder that hope is scarce, pessimism is high and despair is pervasive. As one meme that captures the grim, morbid mood of our age reads: “My retirement plan is civilisational collapse.”But not everyone shares this gloomy outlook. On the extreme other end of public sentiment sit Silicon Valley billionaires: they are some of the most optimistic people on earth. Of course, it’s easy to be optimistic when you are sitting on enough money to sway national politics. And yet, the source of their optimism isn’t simply money. It is also a deep-seated faith in unfettered technological advances.The left is rightly skeptical of the rosy “techno-optimism” advanced by the likes ofElon Musk, far-right mega-donorPeter Thieland hedge fund billionaire Marc Andreessen. To tech oligarchs, technological advancement is best delivered by unfettered free market capitalism. The democratic state is a hindrance to be opposed, dismantled anddestroyed– a set of goals that they now enjoy the power to achieve. Their ideology ignores inequality and glosses over the material harms their companies wreak on workers and the environment. Silicon Valley’s billionaire techno-optimism is clearly incompatible with leftwing values and should be rejected.Donald Trump is turning America into a mafia state | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreBut can and should the left advance its own techno-optimism? Can it put forward a vision of a brighter future that can compete with the grand visions of space exploration presented by Musk? Can it make the case that science and technology ought to be harnessed to deliver breakthroughs, abundance, sustainability and flourishing of human potential? And what would a progressive, leftwing techno-optimism look like? A techno-optimism that the 99% could get on board with, especially communities of color, and Black people who have historically been excluded, or even harmed, by scientific and technological breakthroughs? These are some of the questions that this new series, Breakthrough, launched by the Guardian examines.The left used to embrace technology. Indeed, the most leftwing prophet of all, Karl Marx, was so pro-technology that he is oftendescribed as “Promethean”,a reference to the Greek god who stole fire to give to humans. And it was feminist Shulamith Firestone who in the 1970s envisioned a day where we might have artificial wombs and be liberated from housework, thanks to automation: a feminist utopia delivered by technology.Some of the most groundbreaking sci-fi imagery that we encounter in books and movies like the Matrix, such as people living virtual lives entirely untethered from their bodies, were first popularized by JD Bernal, the Marxist scientist and futurist who designed the so-called Bernal spheres, for permanent space settlement, in 1929. Writing of Bernal’s influential book, The World, the Flesh and the Devil: An Enquiry into the Future of the Three Enemies of the Rational Soul, Arthur C Clarke, considered one of the fathers of sci-fi, wrote that it was “perhaps the most remarkable attempt to predict the future of scientific possibility ever made, and certainly the most stimulating”. And it was all rooted in a firmly leftwing – and specifically, socialist – world view. And, of course, Star Trek, one of the most successful sci-fi series of all time, is widely considered to be depicting asocialist post-scarcity utopia.Today, however, the left is either fearful, agnostic or hostile towards technology. The green“degrowth” movement, for example, views industry and technology as the root of our climate crisis. For them, the solution to the climate crisis is not more technological growth and innovation, but less. As Kohei Saito, the author of the bestseller Slow Down: The Degrowth Manifesto, said in an interview: “I was initially more optimistic about the development of technology” but, after reading degrowth theories, “[I] abandoned the possibility of green growth.”Degrowth has an image problem it desperately needs to overcome | Larry ElliottRead moreSaito goes on to say: “If we want to have more, in today’s sense, it will simply bring about ecological catastrophe.” Reducing consumption and production – austerity and retreat, in other words – is the only path forward for the degrowth movement. But this ignores the fact that technology can help us replace fossil fuels with other sources of clean, affordable and scalable energy that would allow for continued growth and advancement, without harming the environment.Meanwhile, leftwing leaders such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are very good at the necessary and essential task of confronting tech monopolies and billionaires, who concentrate economic and political power in their hands. But what is often lacking is a positive, bold vision for what a science and technology agenda for the 99% would look like – how technology in the right hands might help provide abundance for all.This is a lost opportunity. For all the pessimism and decline that we are witnessing – declining rates of graduation, declining birth rates, declining rates of homeownership and a rise in deaths of despair and skyrocketing rents – we also may well be on the brink of unprecedented breakthroughs and advances that could create record levels of wealth to be enjoyed by all, if these breakthroughs are accompanied by a political system that favors the wellbeing of all over billionaires. It may be hard to imagine such a system at the moment, given that corporate interests have seized nearly all levers of power, but it is nonetheless critical to do so. Do we have a political vision of how tech and science might work for us all?In 2024,artificial intelligence(AI) was recognised with not one, but two,Nobel prizes.Google’s DeepMinddiscovered 2.2m entirely new materials – 800 years worth of science in a few months. Last year saw the first time that sickle cell disease, a disease that was hitherto incurable and predominantly affects people of African descent, was reversed in a novel Crispr gene-editing therapy. Cancer and heart disease vaccines could beready within the next five years. And now, for the first time, AI issolving the intractable protein-folding problem– one ofbiology’s greatest challenges– and designing new proteins, which is essential for discovering new drugs and understanding why certain diseases occur.View image in fullscreenSo why is it that technology is almost never invoked by the left as a solution to polycrisis in general, or the climate crisis in particular? Why is it that the only people who offer bold, inspiring visions for the transformative role of technology are the likes of reactionaries like Musk?There are, of course, reasons for this. Technology alone is no panacea. Nor does technology guarantee progress. In fact, periods of technological advancement have almost always been accompanied by violence, dispossession and war. Many leftwing philosophers in the post-war period, having witnessed the ravages of fascism and Nazism, equated technology – and even the very idea of progress itself, with violence.As the Frankfurt school philosophers Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer – both of whom were Jewish intellectuals forced to flee Nazi Germany – argued in Dialectic of Enlightenment: “Technology … aims to produce neither concepts nor images, nor the joy of understanding, but method, exploitation of the labor of others, capital.”And Black artists such as Gil Scott-Heron, witnessing the advances of the space age, asked what benefit the Apollo mission might have for those struggling to make ends meet back on Earth. In Whitey on the Moon, Scott-Heron writes:“A rat done bit my sister Nell.(with Whitey on the Moon)Her face and arms began to swell.(and Whitey’s on the Moon)I can’t pay no doctor bill.(but Whitey’s on the Moon)Ten years from now I’ll be paying still.(while Whitey’s on the Moon)”Those critiques continue to resonate with many today. Especially as we witness one billionaire after another fly into space, as life on Earth grows more perilous by the day. And as billionaires push not simply the frontiers of space, but of the human body itself, it is right to remind ourselves of the legacy and history of eugenics. We can only benefit from warnings – such as those made byTimnit Gebru and Émile Torres– that the pursuit of longevity and eternal life, as well as transhumanist projects such as Neuralink, risk perpetuating eugenicist ideals in the 21st century.Perhaps, though, we would do well to adopt the position of the Frankfurt school philosopher, Herbert Marcuse, who accepted many of the critiques that his colleagues made of the Enlightenment, but who also left space for the possibility that it could go either way. In a 1941essay on technology, he wrote: “[Technology] can promote authoritarianism as well as liberty, scarcity as well as abundance, the extension as well as the abolition of toil.”He envisioned a world in which technological progress might allow human flourishing and self-realization. In a world that is technologically advanced enough, “everyone could think and act by himself, speak his own language, have his own emotions and follow his own passions” once we are “no longer chained to competitive efficiency”.Perhaps the most important condition for us to flourish is to address our climate crisis. Today, to warm our homes and cook our meals, we still set fire to things. Those who cook on gas stoves heat their food over literal flames, as cavemen once did. If we are to move out of the fossil fuel era into a new, cleaner and sustainable era – while still maintaining our freedom to travel and fly and enjoy the material comforts that we do today – this will require a combination of political will and technology. Whether fusion energy, fission or a host of renewables, the path to a new era of energy production requires new technologies and breakthroughs. Right now, for example, Silicon Valley billionaires areinvesting billionsin chasing theholy grail of limitless, clean fusion energyto power AI. Can and will the state match those efforts? And should the left make the case that it should?There is no inherent value in technology. It is neither good nor bad. It is up to us how machines are used. And indeed, who makes those machines, how, and to what ends are all political questions. While we push to change our political system and direct it towards a more equitable, inclusive and liberatory path, let us also, at the same time, push for technology to move in that direction, too.AI is ‘beating’ humans at empathy and creativity. But these games are rigged | MJ CrockettRead moreWe live in dark, depressing and – frankly – terrifying times. Our planet’s fragile ecosystem is fast spiraling out of control. Our democracies are fracturing. And billionaires are seizing for themselves all of the spoils of the digital era. Technology might well be the thing that pushes us over the edge. But it could also, if we play our cards right, allow us to exit our era of polycrisis. But that won’t happen on its own. The path towards better technology – tech for the 99% – can only be achieved through a politics of the 99%. And it must start with a vision.It is time that the left deploy all of our energies and powers towards a political vision of abundance. Abundance that is delivered by a movement for the 99% that pushes for technological growth and development for the benefit of all.We hope this series might be a place for that political vision to be discussed, debated and laid out so that optimism about the future – in particular, techno-optimism – is no longer just something that the very rich in this world can have.Amana Fontanella-Khan is the Guardian US opinion editorExplore more on these topicsTechnologyBreakthroughUS political lobbyingUS politicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Elon MuskClimate crisisHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

The sense was that he was eager to get back to Canada to run for office in the next federal election. But that election came and went in 2019, and Carney instead extended his tenure at the Bank, ultimately leaving it in 2020. A year later, the Guardianasked himwhether he’d be prime minister of Canada some day. Carney was deliberately coy. “Er, look at the time!” he laughed, with a raised eyebrow.No need to be cute any more. On Sunday evening, Carneywon the Liberal leadership racein a landslide, capturing 85.9% of the overall riding points on the first count. The party allocates 100 possible points to each constituency (or ridings, as they’re known), and those points are distributed based on the ratio won by each candidate in each riding (the ballots are ranked). Carney’s commanding win outdoes even that of his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, who won the leadership in 2013 with a little over 80% of the points.Carney is now not only Liberal party leader, but in the coming days will be sworn in as prime minister. His grip on the latter will be tested quickly. The expectation in Ottawa is that Carney will quickly call a federal election, both because he otherwise would be open to accusations of illegitimacy – as a prime minister without a seat in the House – and because, for the first time in two years, the Liberals arebeginning to close the gapon the opposition Conservatives in the polls.View image in fullscreenJustin Trudeau leaves a news conference after announcing his resignation as Liberal leader outside Rideau Cottage, Ottawa, 6 January 2025.Photograph: Canadian Press/REX/ShutterstockIt has been a stunning turnaround. Just two months ago, when Trudeau announcedhis resignation, the Liberals were barely scraping 20% support among Canadians. Now, the party is pushing 30%. Donald Trump is partly the catalyst for this. He has quickly refocused Canadians’ attention externally, and forced them to rethink their priorities, including whom they trust to deal with the US president. Since early February, the answer to that for Canadians broadly has increasingly been the Liberals –with Carney at the helm. “Everything in my life has helped prepare me for this moment,” Carney told the Liberal crowd on Sunday. At the moment, it seems a lot of Canadians agree.No doubt this has frustrated Carney’s main rival in the leadership race, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland. On Sunday, Freeland finished second in the party voting, but with just 8% of the points. Carney even handily beat Freeland in her own riding, by 1,322 votes to 188. It was, frankly, a terrible outcome for her – and one that few would have predicted a few months ago.Freeland’s own resignation from cabinet on 16 December – on the morning she was due to present the government’s economic statement, no less – was what finally pushed Trudeau to step aside in early January. It also immediately positioned Freeland as the assumed frontrunner. But her campaign was bad. As abrupt as her break with the Trudeau government was, it was impossible for her to separate herself entirely. And at times, particularly when it came to Trump, she didn’t want to. Freeland told everyone she knew from experience how to deal with a Trump administration.Few believed her.Freeland finished her campaign on a lacklustre note, by promising to appoint Carney as her finance minister, should she win – an obvious acknowledgment of the trending mood. Carney has not yet made a reciprocal offer.Still, on Sunday night, Carney thanked Freeland and the others for running, and praised Trudeau’s “strength and compassion as a fighter for Canada”. It was perhaps a nod to Trudeau’s last few weeks as much as the preceding nine years. Trump helped make Canadians nationalists again, no question. But it’s Trudeau, in his final act, who has helped Canadians feel like they still belong together. He has always been good in a moment of crisis, and his responses to Trump’s tariff imposition(s) are proof. Trudeau’s frank language, his direct appeals to Americans, and his framing of Trump – or “Donald” – as a buffoonish tool, have matched the national mood perfectly. He has also, finally, wrongfooted the Conservatives. Party leader Pierre Poilievre’s years of negativity and snark have undermined his credibility as a force for unity. That’s clearer now than ever.Back in 2021, Carney explained: “If I had stayed in private finance, the opportunity cost of me being in public service for 20 years is enormous. Do I care about money? Obviously, I have a family to provide for and stuff, but I am in bloody Ottawa. I am back in Ottawa.” That is truer now than ever. An election looms soon for Canada, and we’ll see whether everything in Carney’s life has prepared him for one more win. In the meantime, it seems like Carney is right where he wants to be.Colin Horgan is a Toronto-based writer and a former speechwriter for Justin TrudeauExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionMark CarneyAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

Having built a political career on railing against the establishment – while, paradoxically, embedding himself within it – Mr Farage finds himself embroiled in yet another melodrama. This time, however, the threat comes not from the usual suspects – remainers, the BBC or “woke” elites – but from hisown side.The affair revolves aroundRupert Lowe, a little‑known businessman, elected as one of Reform UK’s five MPs in 2024 under Mr Farage’s leadership. That should have been the beginning of a forgettable contribution to British public life. Yet, thanks to theinterventionof Elon Musk – the world’s richest man and Donald Trump’s “government efficiency” tsar – Mr Lowe has a starring role in Mr Farage’s latest soap opera.Earlier this year the tech billionaire was so annoyed by Mr Farage’s decision todistancehimself from the imprisoned far-right agitator Tommy Robinson that he touted Mr Lowe as a possible replacement. Relations between Mr Farage and Mr Lowe have deteriorated since. Their feud burst out into the open this month, culminating this weekend with Reform UK alleging misconduct by Mr Lowe, which he denies. Mr Lowe, who has been suspended from the party and lost its whip in parliament, derides it as a vanity project driven by one man’s ego. He hasthreatenedto sue Reform UK for libel.Mr Farage’s reaction, however, is telling. For all his bravado aboutfree speech, the moment a rival emerges – however minor – his instinct seems to be to cut them down. This is not the first time. His political parties –Ukip, theBrexit party, Reform UK – have operated more like personality cults than democratic organs, and loyalty to the leader has eclipsed ideological purity. Challenging Mr Farage doesn’t end well for those who dare. The difference this time is that Mr Musk’s intervention gives the affair an absurdly transatlantic flavour.This illuminates a larger problem. If Mr Farage’s goal is to broaden his electoral appeal, association with Trumpism is ahindrance, not a help. While Mr Trump retains a firm grip on the Republican party, the US president remains deeplyunpopularin Britain, where even Tories see him as aliability. The perception that Mr Farage is toocloseto Mr Trump and too sympathetic to Vladimir Putin is hurting him in the polls. The opportunist in Mr Farage knows this. His strategy has been to present himself as the plebeian face of rightwing populism – foregrounding his love of pints over his attendance atMar-a-Lagobanquets. Yet the contradictions are piling up.Mr Farage seeks to appear an insurgent, yet he operates like an autocrat. He wants to court the support of Trumpianfigures, yet he knows their influence is more likely to repel than to attract British voters. He wants Reform UK to grow – but only under him. For all the bluster, this latest episode only highlights that Mr Farage, like Mr Trump, has always been far better at breaking things than building them. That ought to be a warning to mainstream parties seeking to emulate Trumpian talking points around cuttingforeign aidor sackingbureaucrats– especially with an upcoming byelection in a Labour stronghold. If Reform UK eventually ends up on the scrapheap of history, it won’t be because of Mr Lowe or Mr Musk, or even Mr Trump. It will be because, in the end, Mr Farage is his own biggest problem.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Going forward, she should channel the spirit of Jacques DelorsMon 10 Mar 2025 14.25 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 16.07 EDTShareIn apress conferenceon Sunday to mark 100 days since the beginning of her second term as European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen erred on the side of understatement when asked whether she still considered the US to be an ally. The answer was yes, she replied, before adding that “we have our discussion points without question”.Hard to argue with that. Regarding the war in Ukraine, internationaltradeand existential questions concerning the future of European defence and security, the geopolitical landscape bears no resemblance to the one that Ms von der Leyen looked out upon on 1 December. As Mr Trump and his “America first” outriders have confounded cherished assumptions about thetransatlantic alliance, they have also sought toencourageauthoritarian nationalism in EU member states.In France and Germany, the fabled engine of European integration, this has been uncomfortably akin to knocking at an open door. In Paris, days after Ms von der Leyen reassumed office, Michel Barnier’s shortlived governmentcollapsedwhen Marine Le Pen pulled the rug from under it. In Germany, well before Elon Musk and JD Vance championed its cause, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party had reached historically high levels of support that would see it finish comfortablysecondin February’s snap German election.As Ms von der Leyen put it on Sunday: “Our European values, democracy, freedom, the rule of law are under threat.” The response, from Brussels and in national capitals, needs to be both robust and more expeditious than is often the case in the labyrinthine world of EU policymaking. Happily, the initial signs are positive.The move last week by EU leaders to disapply the bloc’s fiscal rules to military spending, potentially freeing up £670bn, is a significant step towards achieving greater strategic autonomy from Washington. It followed the unveiling of extraordinarily radical proposals in the same week by Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz. Bypassing a constitutionalrestrictionon state borrowing, these are designed to facilitate not only far greater spending on defence, but also on the modernisation of a stagnating economy.After decades in which EU economic policy has been skewed by Berlin’s traditional debt aversion – shared with other“frugal”member states such as the Netherlands and Denmark – this is a verydifferentdirection of travel. As Europe exits an era defined by an uncritical commitment to free trade and dependency on the US security umbrella, it is also the right one. Recognising the desire of many member states to formalise common borrowing arrangements introduced following Covid, Ms von der Leyen said “nothing is off the table” in relation to defence. But, as theDraghi reportargued last autumn, the same kind of fiscal firepower is required to meet the challenge of the green transition and compete with the US and China for the jobs and future industries of the 21st century.Last month in Brussels, a different kind of centenary was marked when abustof a former commission president, Jacques Delors, was unveiled. Born in 1925, Mr Delors became the preeminentchampionof a “social” vision, in which common EU institutions would deploy pooled resources in order to build a Europe where solidarity and growth were intertwined. That perspective faded from view following the neoliberal turn in the 1980s. As Ms von der Leyen navigates the rest of her five-year term, its time has come again.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Trump and his far-right coterie of plutocrats and supine Republicans want freedom for themselves to accumulate even more wealth and capital, to accelerate the plunder of other people and to promote the destruction of our planet.It’s not just bad behaviour towards a peaceful neighbour that is at issue. This is the real meaning of the “polycrisis” referred to in your recent article (What is this era of calamity we’re in? Some say ‘polycrisis’ captures it, 6 March). The term is an empty signifier, devoid of any explanation or useful meaning.So what is the situation we are in and how should we conceptualise it? I prefer the terminology of Antonio Gramsci, who, noting the “morbid symptoms” arising in the interregnum in 1930s Europe, wrote “the old is dying and the new cannot be born”. The term he used for the interwar period was “organic crisis”, something long-lasting, involving struggle and conflict. That crisis only ended with the most lethal war in history.Today, we are in a planetary organic crisis and, unless we confront it, we are part of the problem and not the solution. That is whyCanadamatters – it is one of the many morbid symptoms of an increasingly far-right reactionary capitalism propelling the planet and its people towards disaster. Calling out bad behaviour is not enough.ProfStephen GillYork University, Toronto,CanadaHere in Canada, the death ofNatois already an established fact, plain to all. The supposed leader of the alliance is threatening us with annexation and the other members are studiously looking away. Even Britain, in whose defence Canadians gave 107,000 lives in two world wars, struggles to find a few words in our defence. Unlike Britain in 1940, which at least had Canada as an ally, we truly do stand alone. We already know that if Trump moves against us, no one will come to our aid.As your editorial says, Canada is suddenly on the frontline in the worldwide battle to protect an international order based on respect for sovereignty. To many people, that battle can seem abstract and distant at times. But the Ukrainians know it isn’t. And when my son told me he was scared of the Americans, and I couldn’t honestly tell him that his fears were groundless, I knew it too.Owen DyerMontreal,CanadaCongratulations on your editorial. Finally, someone in Britain has spoken up for Canada, in the wake of Donald Trump’s obnoxious expressed intention to annex our country. The pusillanimous fawning displayed byKeir Starmerand King Charles will not be forgotten here in a hurry. In laying out the red carpet for this convicted criminal and admirer of dictators, and omitting to defend the sovereignty of Canada – of which Charles is in fact king – they have managed to undo all the good that Charles’s mother did in her long reign. The Commonwealth is done.Richard ArthurToronto,CanadaI am sure President Trump would be delighted to visit Canada’s head of state to sort out their differences.

People in public life who take action in light of heavy criticism to improve our environment, like Sadiq Khan, should be congratulated. Unfortunately, the current prime minister and his deputy, Angela Rayner, at the timepublicly criticisedKhan for implementing Ulez, blaming it for the loss of a byelection that year.Your article referred to the report published by the GreaterLondonAuthority “with findings extensively reviewed by an independent advisory group of experts”, which said “Ulez had had a positive impact and that London’s air quality had improved”.Perhaps a public apology from Keir Starmer and his deputy for criticising the mayor would be welcome. Their recognition of Khan’s courage in implementing a policy that works and improves health would help restore faith in public life.Peter WalkerWimbledon, LondonSadiq Khanshould be congratulated for his determined efforts to improve London’s air quality, as he has also shown the way for his far less courageous counterparts in other cities.The greatly improved air quality in London will not just benefit adults. There is preliminary, but worrying, data that links in-utero exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to adverse outcomes in children including reduced IQ, depression, anxiety, ADHD and antisocial behaviour. PAHs are a combustion product generated by smoking, wood‑burning stoves and diesel, but for those women who do not smoke in pregnancy and who are not exposed to wood-burning stoves, diesel exhaust becomes a significant source.One has to wonder whether the epidemic of mental health disorders afflicting British schoolchildren is linked, at least in part, to the fact that diesel vehicles as a percentage of new car sales rocketed from less than 10% in the 1990s to more than 50% by 2015.Dr Robin Russell-JonesMarlow, BuckinghamshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Ratcliffe is clear that this is the fault of players his football department inheritedwhen taking over last year, the billionaire Ineos owner referencing the transfer fee instalments they will have to pay in the close season.“If you look at the players we are buying this summer, that we didn’t buy, we’re buying Antony, we’re buying Casemiro, we’re buying Onana, we’re buying Højlund, we’re buying Sancho,” Ratcliffe said in an interview with the BBC. “These are all things from the past, whether we like it or not, we’ve inherited those things and have to sort that out.“For Sancho, who now plays for Chelsea [on loan] and we pay half his wages, we’re paying £17m to buy him in the summer. It takes time for us to move away from the past into a new place in the future.”Antony is also on loan at Real Betis, after his £81m transfer from Ajax in 2022 during the same summer Casemiro arrived for £70m from Real Madrid. Højlund, who cost £72m from Atalanta, and Onana (£47m from Inter), joined the following summer. Ratcliffe was asked if he meant this quintet are not of the requisite quality for United.View image in fullscreenAngry Manchester United fans protested about the state of the club before the draw with Arsenal on Sunday.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images“Some are not good enough and some probably are overpaid, but for us to mould the squad that we are fully responsible for, and accountable for, will take time,” the 72-year-old said. “We’ve got this period of transformation where we move from the past to the future. There are some great players in the squad as we know, the captain is a fabulous footballer. We definitely need Bruno [Fernandes] – he’s a fantastic footballer.”After Ten Hag was sacked on 28 October, Amorim was hired on a two-and a-half-year deal. Ratcliffe suggested the Portuguese coach would be in charge for far longer. “If I actually look at the squad which is available to Ruben, I think he is doing a really good job, to be honest,” he said. “I think that Ruben is an outstanding young manager. I really do. He’s an excellent manager and I think he will be there for a long time. You are beginning to see a glimpse of what Ruben can produce. I think you saw a glimpse of it against Arsenal.”Ratcliffe pointed to injuries as mitigation regarding United’s league position and the number of young players named as substitutesin Sunday’s 1-1 drawagainst Arsenal. “How many players against Arsenal on the bench did you recognise? How many have ever worn a Manchester United shirt for [the first team] – there’s no squad left. We are down to the last 10 or 11 men in the squad really, of proper first-team players. Ruben is doing a super job.”United’s finances are severely constricted after losing £300m in the past three years. Yet despitebuying only Patrick Dorgu for €30m(£25.1m), plus up to €5m of add-ons, in the January window, Ratcliffe said Amorim would have money to spend in the summer market. “Obviously that budget changes – but upon who we may choose to sell because that would supplement the budget.”View image in fullscreenJim Ratcliffe revealed United would still be paying for Rasmus Højlund’s transfer fee this summer.Photograph: Getty Images/Sportsphoto/AllstarAs homegrown players, Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho would represent 100% profit under profitability and sustainability rules. But Ratcliffe denied they and other academy players would be sold to generate funds. “No. We won’t be selling players because of the state we are in financially.”Ten Hag came close to losing his job last May when Ratcliffe assessed several alternatives. The Dutchman remained in place and was consulted regarding a summer spend of £200m. Ratcliffe admitted that not removing him then was a mistake, along with the hiring of Dan Ashworth, the sporting directorwho departed in December.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think there were some mitigating circumstances, but ultimately they were errors. I accept that and I apologise for that. If you look at the time we made the decision about Erik – the [new] management team hadn’t been in place for more than five minutes. It became clearer three months later and we got it wrong. We corrected it and we are in a very different place today.”Ratcliffe’s Mission 21 aims to claim United a 21st title by 2028, the club’s 150th anniversary, and he believes this remains realistic. “I don’t think it’s mission impossible. I think it’s good to have goals and objectives,” he told the Times. “Liverpool is quite a good example regarding timing, where Jürgen Klopp came in 2015. The process of rebuilding the squad in Liverpool started in summer 2015, they rebuilt the squad in 2015, ’16, ’17 and ’18, then in the next three years they won everything.”Ratcliffe is to make another 200 redundancies for a total of 450 since he took over last February. Other money-generating decisions includeclosing the club canteen, ending free lunches for staffand the raising of the minimum ticket price for all categories to £66.Ratcliffe emphasised the necessity of these cuts, saying the club would have gone bust by this coming Christmas without them. The Guardian firstrevealed Ratcliffe’s fearsover United running out of money in February.“Manchester United would have run out of cash by the end of this year – by the end of 2025 – after having me put $300m [£232.72m] in and if we buy no new players in the summer,” he said. “We are in the process of change and it’s an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans. The simple answer is the club runs out of money at Christmas if we don’t do those things.“The club had got bloated so we reduced that and will finish it with a lean and efficient organisation. That’s how we will address the costs. The player decisions will all be focused on how we are going to improve performance. That’s all.”Ratcliffe also defended his stated focus on the men’s side over the women’s team. “Of our £650m of income, £640m of that comes from the men’s team and £10m comes from the women’s team,” he said. “With my business background you tend to focus on the bigger issues before you focus on the smaller issues.”An announcement is expected on Tuesday regarding plans for what the club has previously said may be “the most iconic football stadium in the world”. This would be built to replace Old Trafford on the current stadium’s site.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedJim RatcliffeRuben AmorimErik ten HagnewsShareReuse this content"

It started very well in terms ofbeating Southampton.

What I mean by complete is, OK, we have faced Arsenal and City and they are not big margins, but the intensity they played at combined with the quality they have and they are one of the richest clubs. Maybe there is one club a bit further ahead.“They have so much quality and a great manager who has the team playing in a way that is not easy to play against. He brings the best out of every player and brings out an incredible work-rate. We have to be at our best. But we didn’t have ball possession at City away – the other richest club in the world together withParis Saint-Germain– and at home we had a completely different performance against City.”Reports from the PSG dressing room have claimed Luis Enrique’s players felt Arsenal and Bayern Munich were tougher opponents in the Champions League group than Liverpool. Slot did not rise to the bait, insisting PSG have changed and improved since the group phase, but he denied the Premier League leaders were poor in Paris.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The areas in which racegoers can drink alcohol have expanded to include much more of the open standing area in front of the grandstands, while ticket prices were also frozen at last year’s level.However, the admission that crowds are still expected to drop suggests that another initiative – offering a ticket for a second day at the meeting from Tuesday to Thursday at a 20% discount to anyone buying a single ticket – has not caught the imagination of racegoers.“We have heard both anecdotally and directly that the cost of accommodation is impacting attendance,” Lavender said. “It is a situation we are looking to address directly with Room To Race, launched in partnership with a local sports travel company, to provide more affordable hotel, ticket and travel packages for this festival and beyond.”Another key indicator for most punters at the end of festival week is their profit or loss on the week, and Tuesday’s opening day dangles a significant carrot for many backers in the shape of four rock-solid favourites in the card’s Grade One events.Kopek Des Bordes, the market leader for the opening Supreme Novcie Hurdle, drifted to 11-10 from evens on Monday in the face of support for Henry de Bromhead’s Workahead, the mount of Rachael Blackmore. Majborough (4-7), Lossiemouth (8-11) and Constitution Hill (8-13) all remain odds-on however, implying combined odds for the four-timer with most firms of around 8-1.Explore more on these topicsCheltenham festival 2025Cheltenham festivalCheltenhamHorse racingnewsShareReuse this content"

The exciting stuff, they hope, comes when they return to London with hopes of ending their long wait for silverware this weekend. The Carabao Cup final approaches and, for all that this performance will not have sent a shiver down Liverpool’s spine, Eddie Howe was entitled to dwell on the positives after his side boosted their hopes of Champions League qualification with a professional victory over West Ham.It was vital that spirits were lifted after last week’sexit from the FA Cupwas compounded by a handful of key players being ruled out against Liverpool. That made the avoidance of further injuries highly welcome, while a first clean sheet in over a month was satisfying before Newcastle plot how to keep Mohamed Salah quiet. Howe, though, will not get carried away. Liverpool will pose far more questions than a limited, cautious West Ham attack managed here. Newcastle, who were clearly holding back at times, did not have to do much beyond wait for Bruno Guimarães to score the goal that lifted them two points off fourth place.West Ham v Newcastle: Premier League – liveRead more“A massive win,” Howe said. “One of our best games of the season. I thought we dug in, we were disciplined. We defended our goal magnificently. We’ve had a challenging week. It’s a brilliant response. It’s exactly what we needed. We needed the players to empty the tank.”Howe went on to praise Guimarães, who has come under fire in recent weeks. “Bruno’s been brilliant for us,” he said. “He stands up in the big moments.” Guimarães then produced some big talk, saying the final is “like the World Cup” for Newcastle. “We want to make history for this club,” Newcastle’s captain said.A night that began with the home fans paying tribute to Michail Antonio, who made an emotional appearance three monthsafter breaking a legin a horrific car crash, saw West Ham in a deceptively dangerous mood early on. Newcastle, their defence shorn of key personnel, had a scare when Mohammed Kudus exposed Fabian Schär inside the first minute. The Ghanaian’s wicked delivery exposed holes left by Sven Botman’s absence with a knee injury but Tino Livramento atoned for a dozy attempt at a clearance by forcing Tomas Soucek to shoot over.View image in fullscreenMichail Antonio is given a warm welcome by West Ham supporters in a pre-match appearance.Photograph: Dalton Bowden/ShutterstockLivramento was in at left-back for Lewis Hall, sidelined for the rest of the campaign, and West Ham sought opportunities down his flank. Another attack followed, Jarrod Bowen the instigator this time, Dan Burn almost turning the forward’s cross into his own net.Yet West Ham’s aggression subsided. Newcastle asserted themselves, even if thoughts often drifted to Wembley. Harvey Barnes, desperate to prove he can provide solutions on the left with Anthony Gordon suspended, tested Alphonse Areola when he flicked Kieran Trippier’s shot goalwards.The mood was tepid. Newcastle probed patiently, Guimarães and Sandro Tonali clever in midfield, and advanced into decent crossing positions. West Ham responded with flashes from Kudus and Bowen, who shot at Nick Pope after a slip from Livramento. Areola pushed away a header from Barnes.Newcastle, who fretted at Tonali needing treatment after being caught by James Ward-Prowse, laboured. West Ham squeezed the space with a compact back five but they too lacked conviction in attack. Kudus was timid and tackled by Trippier when clean through. “It’s not quite happening for him,” Graham Potter said of a forward who has gone 12 games without a goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is a necessary departure from the disorder of Julen Lopetegui’s reign, a way to protect a team woefully short of speed, but it has come at the expense of attacking ingenuity. With a midfield of Edson Álvarez, Ward-Prowse and Soucek providing zero dynamism or invention, Kudus and Bowen are doing a lot of heavy lifting. For Potter, the challenge for the rest of the season is working out how to strengthen in the summer.West Ham, who are in little danger of going down, meandered. Newcastle stirred, forcing Areola into acrobatics to prevent Max Kilman scoring an own goal. Alexander Isak turned the rebound over but the visitors were playing with more belief. They pushed again and Barnes dinked an inviting cross to the far post for Guimarães, who escaped Ollie Scarles and poked past Areola from close range. Isak, with a little shove on Kilman, had cleared the path for his teammate. “It’s clear,” Potter said. “It’s two hands on the back.”Potter’s complaints fell on deaf ears. He responded by throwing on Lucas Paquetá, Carlos Soler and Evan Ferguson. Paquetá tried to release Bowen, who appealed for a penalty after tangling with Guimarães. West Ham, beaten in three of five home games under Potter, were shut out. They did nothing; Newcastle did enough.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

He doesn’t make the rhythm easy.“I got off to a slow start, I missed a couple of opportunities early on. But I’m glad of the way I fought and competed.

I’d never seen someone coach that way’Suzanne WrackBudding coach talks role models, marathon running and the excellence of Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-SkellyMon 10 Mar 2025 18.30 EDTShareIf there are nerves whenJack Wilsherewalks into the room and sits behind the table emblazoned with the England logo, they are not evident.The 33-year-old has been in press conference rooms many times as a player, but as a head coach it is an alien proposition. He is at St George’s Park and is part of a cohort of 25 on the Uefa Pro Licence course who are briefed on a fictional scenario they might face as a head coach before they take a seat in front of a small group of journalists to be brutally grilled on it. The process is a little extreme and not entirely true to life, but it is designed to put them under pressure and test the media skills they have learned that day.‘I don’t want to say that’: Arteta refuses to give up on title despite United drawRead moreThe fictional scenarios are far from straightforward, but Wilshere is unfazed. There is a humanity, an honesty, and an all-around likability to him that means that when he steps away from the table after his interrogation there is little to fault.When Wilshere, who in real life is a first-team coach at Norwich, sits down with the same journalists afterwards to be interviewed, those humble characteristics are mixed with a burning ambition. It is evident the pursuit of excellence that drove him as a player has been rechannelled into his coaching.“I like to have an end goal in sight and that is to be a head coach,” he says confidently, before admitting that was not always the case. Plenty of players do coaching badges routinely while they are still playing with one eye on a possible future career path, but it was watching theArsenalmanager, Mikel Arteta, that lit the coaching spark. “Mikel was the one,” says Wilshere. “I’d never seen someone coach that way, I’d never seen his passion, I’d never seen how he would try to teach the players, both in meetings and on the pitch. I was invited back to train when I was between clubs, I saw it, I was on my Uefa A Licence at the time and it inspired me.”In July 2022, four daysafter Wilshere had hung up his boots, he was appointed head coach of Arsenal’s under-18s and guided the team to the 2023 FA Youth Cup final in his first season,which they lost to West Ham. After two years and three months with Arsenal’s youngsters a first senior opportunity arose, as a first-team coach under Johannes Hoff Thorup at Norwich.View image in fullscreenJack Wilshere and Mikel Arteta during a training session at London Colney in 2014.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/AFC/Getty Images“I love it,” says Wilshere. “When I first started my coaching journey, I wouldn’t say senior football scared me, but it was the unknown and I wanted to go in at under-18s level.” At the end of his second year in the Arsenal academy he had “the itch to go to a first team”, but he could still see an opportunity for self-development, so he stayed, until the Norwich sporting director, Ben Knapper, called and made a move into senior football feel “like the right step”.Wilshere played at the top level, accruing 34 England caps and demonstrating exceptional skill in midfield, but coaching is like “starting anew”, he says. “It doesn’t matter how good you were as a player, how bad you were as a player, whatever you want. It’s a completely different skillset you need.”View image in fullscreenEthan Nwaneri signs for Arsenal’s under-eights with Jack Wilshere in 2015.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/AFC/Getty ImagesIt can be hard for a player of such prodigious talent to work with people who do not match that level of ability, but important lessons have been learned in that respect. “When I first went in as under-18s head coach, I couldn’t quite understand why they could or couldn’t do certain things,” explains Wilshere. “I thought: ‘Well, you’re at Arsenal, you’re an under-18, you should be able to do this, or you shouldn’t be doing this still.’ My assistant at the time, Adam Birchall, who has now taken the job I left, helped me massively. He came through the Arsenal academy, had a similar journey to me, but I obviously went and played for Arsenal while he went and had to make a career in League One, League Two.“We had a really nice balance of my understanding of what it takes to get there and him understanding the different stages of development there are, because he coached all the way through, and the requirements needed to have a career at the lower levels.“I was lucky as well, though, because when I first started with the team there was Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly who were doing things that none of the other players could do. You could see and measure where they were versus where others were. I understood that those two were probably going to go on and play for Arsenal and that for this other group of players, which was just as important, we needed to find a way of making them have a career in the game.”The fear is that young players are products of their academies to such an extent that there is a uniformity to their play. “I was taught to play the game in a certain way,” says Wilshere. “Arsène [Wenger] gave a lot of responsibility. The academy played the same way as the first team, but it wasn’t: ‘This is how we play, this is what you need to do.’ It was: ‘We’re going to put you in a position and your own understanding of the game, your own insight, will create moments for you.’ Now, everyone plays the same … let’s see if the game changes and players have to take on more responsibility and have more freedom with that, because at the moment it’s very structural.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More importantly, Myles is very team-oriented, he’s more of a natural leader and wants to bring everyone with him. Whereas Ethan is just really driven, he’d come and seek advice, feedback from coaches.”With England light at left-back, it is not implausible that Lewis-Skelly could find himself in the national team squad forthe 2026 World Cup. Wilshere says he would “be able to handle it” and thinks England can be bolder in their selection of young talent.View image in fullscreenJack Wilshere presides over the pre-match warm-up before Norwich’s match against West Brom in November.Photograph: Gareth Evans/News ImagesAlamy“I was in the first team at Arsenal and then I was being called up for the under-19s at England. Don’t get me wrong, at that point I was just happy to represent my country,” says Wilshere. “I wasn’t thinking: ‘Now I’m ready for the first team.’ But I was going from training with Arsenal first team, playing in the Champions League and playing in the Premier League, to going and playing in the under-19s. Of course there was still some developing to do but I think we can be braver as a nation.”There is no topic Wilshere shies away from. He explains, for example, that he is running the London Marathon for the British Heart Foundation, after his daughter Siena had to have open heart surgery to repair a congenital heart defect. He pivots back to his training having a purpose, an end goal.“I never ever thought I’d be doing a marathon,” he says. “Never really wanted to. I was convinced to do it by a friend of mine. The other day I ran 20k, it took me two hours. It’s probably harder mentally [than physically]. Because I’m not going fast enough to make it hard for me in my lungs. But obviously your legs start to feel heavy.”The Arsenal academy has crafted many young talents, Wilshere among them, but it has also seemingly produced an intelligent and hungry young coach. When injuries stall or prematurely end players’ careers, they might be forgiven for thinking their best days in the game are behind them. At 33, Wilshere’s may still lie ahead, on the unknown career path he didn’t see himself taking.Explore more on these topicsJack WilshereArsenalNorwich CityinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Norway is one of the traditional powers within ski jumping, and the scandal at its home world championships has caused a massive outcry in a country that prides itself on its winter sports prowess.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Two Norwegian ski jumpers, Marius Lindvik and Johann André Forfang, were disqualified from Saturday’s men’s large hill competition after organisers said their suits broke the rules. Lindvik had finished second in the event before he was disqualified.The federation on Sunday admitted that the suits had been deliberately altered, after a video emerged online of the alterations being made. “The way I consider this … we have cheated,” said Jan-Erik Aalbu, general manager of the federation. “We have tried to cheat the system. That is unacceptable.”Brevig told Norwegian media on Monday that several team members had been involved in the decision to alter the suits, but added: “I should have stopped it.” He claimed it was the first time they had stitched in an extra seam, but made a sailing analogy to explain why a stiffer suit would help the jumpers fly farther in the air. “A tighter sail is better than a loose sail,” he said.The federation said Brevig and Livelten would be suspended indefinitely while inquiries continue. The International Ski and Snowboard Federation said Sunday that it had opened its own investigation.Explore more on these topicsSkiingnewsShareReuse this content"

Further, a bigger and more immediate problem was energy poverty, Wright said.“Where is the Cop conference for this far more urgent global challenge,” he said, referring to the annual United Nations climate talks, known as the Conference of the Parties (Cop). “I look forward to working with all of you to better energize the world and fully unleash human potential.”The night before his CERAWeek plenary session, Wright had a meeting with top executives of fossil fuel firms including TotalEnergies, Freeport-McMoRan, Occidental Petroleum, and EQT, Axios and Reuters reported. Trump’s interior secretary, Doug Burgum, who will address CERAWeek attenders on Wednesday, also attended the dinner meeting.Trump obtainedrecord donationsfrom the fossil fuel industry in his 2024 campaign. In April, he came under fire for a meeting at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, at which he reportedly asked more than 20 executives, from companies including Chevron, Exxon and Occidental, for $1bn and promised, if elected, to slash climate policies.Under Biden, Wright said, ordinary Americans suffered. “The expensive energy or climate policies that have been in vogue among the left in wealthy western nations have taken a heavy toll on their citizens,” he said, putting the word “climate” in scare quotes.US citizens “heat our homes in winter, cool them in summer, store period foods in our freezers and refrigerators and have light, communications and entertainment at the flip of a switch,” he said – a lifestyle that “requires an average of 13 barrels of oil per person per year”.Meanwhile poorer countries lack energy, he said, meaning they need more fossil fuels.“The other 7 billion people on average, consume only three barrels of oil per person per year,” he said. “Africans average less than one barrel.”The comments came after Wright addressed the Powering Africa Summit in Washington DC on Friday, saying that it would be “paternalistic” and “100% nonsense” to encourage Africa to halt coal development because of climate concerns.View image in fullscreenA child collecting chunks of coal looks on at a colliery while smoke rises from the Duvha coal-based power station in Emalahleni, South Africa, in 2021.Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters“Coal transformed our world and made it better, extended life expectancy and grew opportunities,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

And Trump has launched a war on renewable energy,temporarily suspendingall clean energy development on federal lands and attacking wind and solar in speeches.Wright’s speech was not made available to the public via live stream, sparking outrage from climate advocates.“As energy secretary, Chris Wright is supposed to serve the American people, not the fossil fuel industry,” said Allie Rosenbluth, a campaign manager at the non-profit Oil Change International. “It’s unacceptable, though not surprising, that this former fracking CEO is depriving the public of the chance to see what he’s saying to fossil fuel executives.”Wright has long been a fixture at the CERAWeek fossil fuels conference. Before joining the Trump administration, he led the oil and gas company LibertyEnergyfor 13 years.Ahead of his press conference, one representative from an oil industry podcast said the energy secretary was “brilliant”.“He’s one of us,” the person said. “He gets us.”Additional reporting by Oliver MilmanExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationFossil fuelsOil and gas companiesEnergy industryEnergyClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

The White House has alsobegun a purge of climate references from government websites.Campaigners told the Guardian these actions would have a major impact on the ability of poor countries to cope with extreme weather. Anne Jellema, the executive director of 350.org, told the Guardian: “The US retreat from its global climate finance commitments is a staggering blow to the chances of keeping global temperature rise to 1.5C [above preindustrial levels]. By abruptly axing nearly a tenth of the limited funds for climate protection in developing countries, it is effectively abandoning millions of communities who have done nothing to cause global heating but who are losing homes, livelihoods and lives because of it.”She called on other countries to step up. “Now is the moment for wealthy nations to rise above politics and show real leadership. The world is watching, and the stakes have never been higher. We must act together to keep hope alive for a livable future.”Trump’s newly formed “department of government efficiency”, headed byElon Musk, has been firing USAid staff and ending shipments. Though some have been reinstated after controversy and court orders, Trump is likely to continue his efforts to cut all forms of aid, with climate a key target.Under Trump’s last presidency, climate finance also fell sharply. This time, it is likely to fall further under the onslaught on all forms of government spending.The US has long contributed far less to climate finance, proportionate to its status as the world’s biggest economy and biggest carbon emitter, than other developed countries. Though Joe Biden markedly increased the funds during his term, he faced a struggle with the Republican-dominated Congress to do so.US contribution to climate financing chartClimate finance is needed to help poor countries cope with the already evident impacts of the climate crisis, such as droughts, floods, heatwaves and storms. The developing world is sustaining hundreds of billions of dollars in damage as a result, with the effects expected to intensify further.These countries are already spending large chunks of their existing domestic budgets patching up the damage and trying to improve their resilience, depriving them of funds needed for health, education and economic development.Rich governments carry an obligation under the Paris agreement to provide funds to poor nations, which have done little to contribute to greenhouse gas emissions but bear the brunt of the damage.Last November, at the annual conference of the parties (Cop) of the UNFCCC, all countriesagreed that climate finance should reach $1.3tn a year by 2035. The bulk of this will come from the private sector, some is likely to come from charges on high-carbon activities such as shipping and aviation, and at least $300bn is to come from the developed world.Without sizeable contributions from the US, the world’s biggest economy, those numbers are likely to be much harder to reach.Harjeet Singh, founding director of the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, said: “As the largest historical emitter, the US bears a significant share of the blame for the climate adversities affecting vulnerable populations worldwide. We must hold them accountable and ensure they contribute their fair share towards global climate reparations.”Countries with rapidly growing economies that are still classed as developing under the UN, such as China, the United Arab Emirates, and other oil states, also contribute to climate finance.Pressure on those emerging economies to contribute moreis also likely to grow, from developed areas such as the EU, as the US steps away and they face increasing demands for defence spending.The US state department was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsClimate aidUSAidClimate crisisDonald TrumpElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

There is the US government, which will limit its participation [but] the US is a country with such amazing technology, amazing innovation – this is the US that can contribute. The US is a central country for these discussions and solutions.”Brazil has also vowed to hold an “ethical stocktake” aimed at examining climate justice issues, for poor and vulnerable people, and to give Indigenous people a key role at the talks.Corrêa do Lago wrote to all UN countries on Monday, setting out Brazil’s expectations thatall governments will draw up national plans for steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissionsbefore the conference starts in Belém, a rainforest city at the mouth of the Amazon, in November.“Cop30 will be the first [summit] to take place at the epicentre of the climate crisis, and the first to be hosted in the Amazon, one of the world’s most vital ecosystems, now at risk of reaching an irreversible tipping point, according to scientists,” the letter said. “Change is inevitable, either by choice or catastrophe.”As well as the formal negotiations at the summit in which only national governments can take part, there will be forums for regional and local governments – including those from the US – and for businesses and investors. Corrêa do Lago said these would be essential for progress because the Cop should involve an ongoing process of implementing climate action, rather than simply a focus on two weeks of technical negotiations.“There is a perception these Cops are just about negotiation,” he said. “But we believe that accelerating implementation [of previously agreed actions] is very important. Let’s see how we can accelerate what we have already agreed.”Brazil faces one of the worst geopolitical situations of any “conference of the parties” (Cop) since the UN framework convention on climate change, parent treaty to the 2015 Paris agreement, was signed in 1992. Trump has not only begun the process of withdrawing the US from theParis accord, but is also rescinding climate finance pledged to the developing world, anddismantling federal support for climate science.Trump’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the resulting rearmament of Europe which is under way, have left the developed world in turmoil. Many developing countries areconcerned that they will be left further behind, amid the wrangling of the biggest economies.Ana Toni, the chief executive of Cop30, pointed to theoutcome of the recently reconvened conference of the parties to the UN convention on biological diversity, which produced agreement on a plan to finance nature protection. “It was a really challenging moment, but we did see agreement,” she pointed out.Many investors and businesses were expressing an interest in Cop30, she added. “We need to ensure [country’s emission-cutting] plans are investable and implementable,” she said. “We have had some very, very positive engagement with investors so far. They know the transition [to a low-carbon economy] is inevitable, and are looking for places where investments can be made.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Quoting Hannah Arendt, the philosopher who studied Hitler and his associates, it said: “Arendt denounced the ‘banality of evil’ as the acceptance of what was unacceptable. Now, we face the ‘banality of inaction’, an irresponsible and unacceptable inaction.”The letter also invoked the Brazilian concepts of “mutirão”, which comes from the Tupi-Guarani language, and refers to a community coming together to work on shared task, and “virada”, which means fighting back in a game when defeat seems almost certain.Ilan Zugman, the Latin America and Caribbean director at 350.org, said: “The proactive and detailed nature of this letter from the Cop30 presidency is an encouraging sign – especially in contrast to Cop29. This early engagement signals an intent to shape the agenda rather than react to it.“It emphasises unity in the face of climate change rather than cynicism, aligning with Indigenous perspectives on collective action. However, Cop30 must be about delivering action, not just having discussions and announcing commitments without clear ways for them to be implemented.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisBrazilDonald TrumpAmericasShareReuse this content"

They includePhilip Hammond, the former chancellor and foreign secretary, who has declared payments totalling £816,000 during the last two years from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait.The findings have drawn criticism from campaigners who say peersshould not be working for any state whose “priorities or values on issues such as human rights are at odds with the UK’s”.There are no restrictions under the House of Lords ruleson members taking up such consultancies, provided they declare who they are working for and how much they are being paid.Calls to toughen Lords rules as it is revealed one in 10 peers are paid for political adviceRead moreIn general, peers are not required to register the fees they receive for their consultancies and directorships. But in 2021 the Lords tweaked the rules and since then peers have had todeclare how much they are paidif they are receiving money from foreign governments or institutions that are, or even appear to be, controlled by foreign states.This tightening of the rules followed worries thatoverseas governments, particularly Russia, were meddling in British democratic processes.The Lords authoritieswarn peersto be “especially cautious when coming into contact with representatives of corrupt or repressive regimes”.Tom Brake, the director of the reform groupUnlock Democracy, said: “There should never be any doubt that a UK legislator’s top priority is to defend UK interests. But UK politicians, paid by foreign states, will crash into unavoidable conflicts of interest, where their loyalties will be tested.“To avoid any such risk, they could do worse than follow a self-denying ordinance and avoid working for any foreign state, particularly those whose priorities or values on issues such as human rights are at odds with the UK’s.”The analysis is part ofthe Lords debate, a Guardian investigation into members of the Lords, at a time when theLabour government has made moves to raise standards and reduce the size of the upper chamber.Paid by Middle Eastern regimesLord Hammond, the peer who has received the most money from overseas governments, said: “I have a diverse portfolio of outside interests, none of which is related to my membership of the House of Lords.”He emphasised there were “rigorous” rules that he closely followed and added: “All my roles are fully compliant with both the letter and the spirit of the Lords’ rules and guidance, and I have engaged extensively with the Lords’ authorities over the years to ensure that each new role is fully compliant.”View image in fullscreenPhilip Hammond is the peer who has received the most money from overseas governments.Photograph: Alberto Pezzali/APFourteen peers have received payments from five authoritarian Middle Eastern regimes, including five peers who were paid nearly £700,000 by Bahrain.Gerry Grimstone, who was the minister of state for investment in Boris Johnson’s government, was paid £150,000 to advise the Bahraini regime on its “modernisation and reform efforts”. He works through a consultancy, Equilibrium Global.Before his two-year stint in the government, he had been a banker for many years, with jobs in the Middle East. When he took on the Bahrain post last year, Lord Grimstonesaidhe saw the role as “restarting my private sector career after a period of unpaid public service, and returning to a part of the world which I know well and where I believe I have been highly respected for many years”.Qatar, another Middle Eastern state with apoor human rights record, paid at least £100,000 over the last two years to Alex Carlile, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. The peer has a consultancy with John Scarlett, the former head of Britain’s spying agency MI6, providing advice on UK foreign and public policy. Lord Carliletold the Lordsthat he “takes no part in any parliamentary proceedings relating to any client”.The rest of the worldPeers who were paid by statesin other parts of the world included Archie Hamilton, a former defence minister. He receives £60,000 a year as a director of FM Capital Partners, a UK investment company controlled by the Libyan government. It manages frozen assets that areunder British sanctionsand therefore needs to apply for official licences to operate in some cases. Hamilton is paid an extra £1,000 for every board meeting he attends.Mark Sedwill, a former cabinet secretary and national security adviser, has been paid at least £100,000 a year for advising Temasek, an investment fund owned by the Singapore government.Do you have information about this story?

In my opinion, there can be no objection to a member of the House of Lords who is a lawyer advising and representing clients, including foreign governments, on legal issues provided that – as the code of conduct now requires – that interest is declared in the register.”Peter Goldsmith, who was attorney general under Tony Blair, was paid just over £95,000 in the last two years for legal work for the governments of Azerbaijan, Israel and South Korea.Grimstone, Carlile, Hamilton and Goldsmith declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsThe Lords debatePhilip HammondPeter GoldsmithHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

She died at the scene despite the efforts of emergency services.A 42-year-old man from Talbot Green has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is in police custody.On Monday, South Wales police said in a statement: “Although formal identification has yet to take place, we believe the victim to be 40-year-old Joanne Penney.“Her next of kin has been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.“We would ask that their privacy is respected at this difficult time.”Neighbours expressed their shock at what had happened, with some describing hearing a gunshot.Tyler Davis said he received multiple phone calls just after 6pm on Sunday and came out of his house.“I saw lots of police and the ambulance outside,” he said. “I couldn’t have imagined it would be what it was. I don’t know the people who live there personally.“We have had a few incidents, my neighbour upstairs was killed about 18 months ago, but nothing of this type. A lot of people are concerned about living here. We don’t feel safe.”Alex Davies-Jones, the MP for Pontypridd, said on Facebook: “Last night, a woman’s life was tragically cut short. Her name was Joanne Penney. She will be mourned by our whole community.“I am in close contact with the police regarding the investigation and am grateful an arrest was made swiftly. I have also raised the case with the UK minister for policing and crime prevention.“I have been deeply moved seeing the tributes from Joanne’s friends. May she rest in peace.”Neighbours and residents of the town brought flowers to police officers at the cordon.One woman, who lives near the property where the incident took place, walked through with two bunches of flowers.She said: “You couldn’t wish for a lovelier person. She was a lovely woman.”A number of residents described concerns about the area, including allegations of drug issues.Rhondda Cynon Taf county borough councillor Sarah Jane Davies posted on Facebook that she had spoken to the police and crime commissioner and raised “the concerns of residents”.She said the shooting was the second serious incident in six weeks, referencing an alleged attack at Talbot Green police station on 31 January.Davies said councillor Andrew Morgan, the leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf, and Davies-Jones “appreciate and understand the real concerns in the local area”.Speaking in the early hours of Monday, a South Wales police spokesperson said several crime scenes had been set up in the area and road closures were in place.DCI James Morris said: “I understand the concern this will cause the local community, and I want to reassure people that a team of experienced detectives are already working at pace to piece together the events of last night.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Madonna and Child ended up in the possession of Barbara de Dozsa, who now believes that it belongs to her, partly because her deceased former husband, Baron de Dozsa, bought it in good faith in 1973. Until their divorce, they kept it at their 16th-century Norfolk home,East Barsham Manorin Fakenham, which Henry VIII is said to have described as his “small country palace”.In 2017, De Dosza tried to sell the painting through a regional auction house, but it was spotted by someone linked to the Belluno museum, who confirmed that it is on the “most wanted” lists of police forces, including Interpol and the Italian Carabinieri.Due to delays caused by the Covid lockdown, the Italian authorities were unable to supply relevant documents requested by the British police, and so the painting was simply handed back to De Dozsa in 2020.Christopher Marinello, a specialist art lawyer, has tried repeatedly to persuade her to return it to its rightful owner. “It’s the right thing to do,” he said.But she has cited the Limitation Act 1980, which states that someone who buys stolen goods can be recognised as the legal owner if the purchase was “unconnected to the theft” after more than six years.Marinello said: “Her first argument was that when the British police gave her the painting back, they gave her good title. So I wrote to the police, and they sent her a formal letter saying ‘by no means do we convey title to the painting’.”Asked why the police did not just hand it back to Italy if it was stolen, he said: “It’s a good question. It just shows the failure of law enforcement to help the Italians out. The UK police said that this woman didn’t commit a crime, so we’re not going to treat it as a criminal matter. It’s a civil case.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hisprevious recoveriesinclude a Matisse painting that was stolen in 1987 from Stockholm’s Museum of Modern Art and whose whereabouts had been shrouded in mystery for 25 years until it surfaced in London.He believes there is a moral argument for De Dozsa to return the painting – particularly as he has understood from her that she does not even like it enough to hang it on her walls. He is not working for a fee and is driven only by a belief that it belongs to the people of Belluno, from where his own family originated.De Dozsa had argued that, as well as the cost of storage and insurance, she had to pay £6,000 in legal fees to resolve this problem.Marinello claimed he understood from her that if he could reimburse those fees she would return the painting.After securing permission from the Italian police, he found an insurance company that would donate the £6,000 – only for her to allegedly change her mind.He said: “Her husband could not have paid more than a couple of hundred back in 1973. It’s only worth maybe £60,000 to £80,000 now. She refuses to cooperate unless she gets paid the full value, but she can never sell the painting. No legitimate auction house will ever touch it … the Carabinieri have it on their database and will never take it off. As soon as that painting goes to Italy, it’s going to be seized.”Norfolk constabulary said: “Norfolk police have been advised by the UKCA [UK Central Authority] to release the painting to Mrs De Dozsa given several years have passed and there has been no response from Italian authorities in relation to the investigation. We have returned the painting but would not, as the police, return this in a judicial capacity in terms of awarding legal title to the painting.”De Dozsa declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsNorfolkArt theftArtItalyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It might be something as simple as that. Or it might be asking people to write essays defending views that they actively dislike or perhaps even detest.“There are other sorts of psychological techniques, for instance like deep listening, or should we use Chatham House rules [sic] in classroom discussions? Or should we have rules about [restricting] recordings? There’s a whole range of things that we can do practically, and I’m keen for universities to think innovatively about what they can do to get people talking.”The Chatham House rule – named after a meeting place in London where discussions are held without views being attributed to individuals – “might be a way of encouraging people to raise and discuss controversial matters”, he said.Ahmed said that in his experience as a teacher, students needed encouraging “not to feel scared to raise subjects or put forward points of view that people might find difficult, offensive, shocking, disturbing.“When it comes to really important matters, whether it’s life or death matters, abortion, euthanasia, immigration, race – all of these things – it’s really important that people feel feel to discuss them freely, and even if they don’t endorse certain views they should be free to discuss those views. Otherwise we can’t have a proper conversation.”Deep listening, another technique Ahmed champions, involves a listener making a summary of an opponent’s position and revising it until the opponent agrees it is accurate. Researchers have found success in using the techniques in divided communities such as Cyprus.Ahmed hasbeen in the role for nearly 18 monthsbut the general election last year and the incoming government’s decision to suspend implementation of the new campus freedom of speech law left him in limbo.But the government is to issue revised regulations later this year, allowing him to fulfil his role for the first time since his appointment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is it because Zia Yusuf thought I was talking too much about deportation or mass deportation, or the Pakistani rape gangs? I simply don’t know,” he said.The Great Yarmouth MP, who has tacked to the right of Farage on migration, said the party had asked him toexcise a reference to “mass deportations”he planned to make at a rally in Kemi Badenoch’s North West Essex constituency.The party’s internal strife erupted on Friday when Lowe had the whip suspended over bullying complaints made by two female staff members and separate allegations he had threatened Yusuf with violence.Lowe has strongly denied the claims, saying the bullying complaints did not relate to him personally and involved staff members who themselves faced disciplinary proceedings. He has also denied threatening Yusuf with violence and questioned why a police complaint was only made three months after the alleged incident. The Metropolitan police have said they are assessing an allegation of ”verbal threats”.Lowe called on the party to retract and apologise to him on Monday after pointing to a social media post by the former Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen, who said that one of the women alleged to have made claims of bullying was his former parliamentary aide.Bridgen wrote on X: “She has told me that her original complaint had nothing to do with Rupert personally and was related to the actions of another member of his staff. I have her permission to post this tweet.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sources close to Lowe said that as many as 7,000 members had resigned over the weekend in protest at his treatment, though the party denies this.Opponents of Farage’s leadership are urging Lowe to lead a rival party on the hard right. “We had been having bets about when Rupert would be ousted,” said Alex Stephenson, one of 10 councillors who split from Reform in Amber Valley in January and who are working with other groups. “It was surprising that he lasted so long but hopefully now we can continue building up a new organisation. Rupert’s very popular with the Reform grassroots and it’s clear why: he tells it as it is.”Party members have been trading barbs on Facebook groups, with a moderator on the Reform UK Clacton group – which includes members in Farage’s own constituency – complaining of Yusuf being subjected to “veiled and overt religious and racial discrimination” in recent days.Explore more on these topicsReform UKRupert LoweNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

But instead of letting go when she tapped him, as he had done on previous occasions, he continued to hold her before stabbing her repeatedly at the home they shared in the St Andrews area of Bristol on 20 October last year.He rang the emergency services 20 minutes later, shortly before 6.30pm, and told them: “I stabbed my sister to death.”The court heard that he had told operators they had not been having an argument, but said: “I hated her my whole life and I don’t know, I just didn’t want to ever see her again.”In a prepared statement he later gave to police, Bennett-Smith said his sister, who had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, was “annoying” and he felt she bullied him.He told officers: “After watching a video, I went downstairs to the lounge and I asked Luka if I could practise a headlock on her. She agreed, we have done this before and when she needed me to stop we had an agreement where she would tap me on the arm.“On this occasion I had decided I was not going to stop, I wanted to kill her, I had enough with regards [how] she had been treating me over the years and recently.”The court heard that Bennett-Smith had grown up on a remote farm in New Zealand, but after his parents divorced he moved to the UK with his sister and mother with the intention of going to college to prepare to join the army.He later dropped out of his college course, the court was told.Ray Tully KC, defending, said Bennett-Smith had severe dyslexia and dysgraphia and, that although he had an above-average IQ, he was found to have below average “processing speed”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tully said he would disappear into a world of video gaming and become dissociated from the real world.“Mali did not know how to manage his increasing feelings of frustration and resentment towards Luka,” he said.Judge William Hart said: “It’s often said in courtrooms when a child has died: ‘It must be every parent’s worst nightmare’. The horror of the loss of their daughter at the hands of the son they still love is beyond even the worst nightmares.”Sentencing him, Hart said: “The killing was shocking and brutal. It has deprived Luka of her life, your parents in effect of two of their children, and will deprive you of your liberty.”The judge lifted reporting restrictions on naming the defendant after an application by the PA Media news agency.Explore more on these topicsBristolCrimeKnife crimenewsShareReuse this content"

She’s been a part of a family,” her father, Paul Burke, a consultant in the steel industry, said.Canadian authorities told her to go back to the US and fill in new paperwork before returning to cross into Canada.However, when she tried to re-enter the US she was handcuffed and put in a cell before being taken to Tacoma Northwest detention facility in Washington state.“She’s been there for over 10 days now,” Paul Burke said. “We haven’t got any clear timeline for her release. I really can’t understand why someone, a tourist, would be incarcerated and locked up.”“It’s like we’re living in a nightmare we can’t wake up from,” he added. “It’s like we’re having an out-of-body experience. We’re watching ourselves go through the motions of life, but we’re not really doing it, we’re not really there.”His daughter wants to leave the country and fly back to the UK, he said, but he feared the immigration crackdown in the US meant there could be a long delay before her case was dealt with.“She’s in this orange prison outfit,” he said. “She just feels so isolated and desperate, you can imagine, she’s saying, ‘I want to come home’.”She is safe, he said, but living “in horrendous conditions” and had not had access to legal representation. He was taking comfort from the fact that the other women at the facility, many of whom have been incarcerated for months or even years while fighting deportation, had “all been really nice to Becky,” Burke said.Burke said he and his wife, Andrea, had naturally had some worries about their daughter travelling, but thought the US and Canada would be one of the safest places for her to go as a solo traveller, and her plan to stay with host families provided further reassurance.“The only thing really we were concerned with, in general, was our little girl was going off for four months as a solo traveller,” he said.“We knew for a long time in advance of Trump being inaugurated what his plans were for immigration, but that didn’t enter our minds with respect to Becky,” he added. “She was going on a four-month backpacking tourist trip. We wouldn’t even think of her as an immigrant.“We were horrified about what was planned for immigrants and illegal aliens in the US, just like many people around the world were,” he added. “But why would we put that together with Becky making this trip? We now know better, because we believe it’s had a direct impact.”Burke said he wanted to warn other families who may have children travelling to the US. “The key thing is check and double-check and triple-check the visa requirements, especially if it’s an extended visit like Becky’s was, rather than just a couple of weeks’ holiday,” he said. “I really don’t want anyone else to go through this.”The family’s local MP Catherine Fookes, the Labour MP for Monmouthshire, said: “I am deeply concerned about my constituent’s welfare and the distress this situation is causing her and her family.“Her family is desperate to bring her home, and I share their urgency in seeking a resolution.“Since being made aware of the case, my team have been in regular contact with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and other relevant authorities to press for urgent action. We have relayed the family’s request for voluntary departure and continue to push for clear answers on the next steps to get her home as soon as possible.“My team and I will continue doing everything in our power to secure a swift resolution and will not stop working until my constituent is safely reunited with her family.”A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting a British national detained in the USA and are in contact with the local authorities.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

A young baby girl who undoubtedly would still be alive if it was not for the reckless and ultimately grossly negligent conduct of the two defendants.“They were the parents of that young baby girl, but they put their relationship and their views of life before the life of that little baby girl.”The court heard that the pair went on the run with the baby after their car burst into flames on a motorway in Greater Manchester on 5 January 2023. They then travelled hundreds of miles across England in taxis at a cost of hundreds of pounds.After travelling from Harwich to Colchester in Essex and on to east London, they made their way to the South Downs where they “essentially went off grid and lived in a tent with hardly any clothes, no means of keeping and remaining warm and dry and with scarcely any food”.The “risk of hypothermia was blindingly obvious”, Little added.Having dumped a buggy hours after purchasing it, the defendants had transferred the baby to a Lidl bag for life, it was claimed. Little said: “The need to try to keep warm in wet and damp and cold conditions in a small, thin and flimsy tent also created obvious suffocation risks, both with items and with themselves. So too, as I have said, the risk and reality of hypothermia. It was this grossly negligent and obviously dangerous conduct that caused the death of their baby daughter.”Little added that, after the baby died, the defendants did not hand themselves in but instead remained off grid, “leaving the body of their dead baby in a shopping bag covered in rubbish, which they carried around and then left in a disused shed”.Jurors were told the defendants were convicted at an earlier trial of concealing the birth of a child and perverting the course of justice.Little told jurors Marten came from a wealthy family. “She has not had a deprived upbringing. She has a trust fund.” He added she had “access to as much money as she wanted, had she chosen to do the right thing rather than make bad decision after bad decision”.Judge Mark Lucraft KC, the recorder of London, told the jury that Gordon was not in the dock with Marten, but that he might join the proceedings later by video link.In a police interview, Marten said the baby had died after Marten fell asleep with her tucked under her coat and claimed the child had “ample clothes”.Little said: “We say that, having considered all of the evidence, you can be sure that death was caused by hypothermia or by smothering and suffocation whilst co-sleeping.”Referring to the previous trial, Little told jurors: “At that trial the defendants were each convicted of the offence of concealing the birth of a child and the offence of perverting the course of justice.“Those convictions involve overlapping conduct but in short they involve hiding the body in order to hide the existence of the birth of the baby, but also hiding the body and not reporting the death of the baby intending to pervert the course of justice, which would have been the inevitable investigation.”The convictions were relevant, the prosecution says, in that they support the fact that the baby did not die by reason of an accident and support the prosecution case on the homicide offences.The court was also told of the defendants’ history with social services, which led to a family court decision in February 2021 that their four other children should be adopted.The retrial is expected to last for up to eight weeks.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

This was brought home by her live anchoring from Beirut, which was at the centre of international news after Hassan Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, waskilled in an Israeli airstrikeon the city days before.Foster, a BBC News at One presenter, will begin presenting Today from next month. It means the programme will finally have a complete presenting lineup, alongside Justin Webb, Nick Robinson, Amol Rajan and Emma Barnett.Many had expected the post to go to the BBC’s Europe editor, Katya Adler. Both she and Sarah Smith, its North American editor, had previously stepped in as Today presenters. Royal correspondent Jonny Dymond and business editor Simon Jack had also presented the show recently, but appointing one of them would have left only one woman on the regular roster.Some senior BBC figures had also been keen for the corporation to poach a big figure from another broadcaster, with several said to have wanted ITV’s Julie Etchingham to be approached. She moderated the first election debate between Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer and was regarded by many as the real winner from the encounter.Another figure discussed was Sky’s Sophy Ridge, who was recently announced as presenter of the year at the Royal Television Society awards. John McAndrew, director of programmes for BBC News, knows Ridge’s work from his time at Sky. He has just been given huge power within the corporation, heading up the new BBC Live and Daily News department.However, a huge premium was placed on Foster’s knowledge of international news and specialism in the Middle East, having previously served as a correspondent in the region. She also honed her radio presenting skills by previously hosting Radio 5 Live’s drive-time show.Foster’s appointment ends the long-running saga of finding Husain’s replacement. There has been huge frustration within the corporation over the failure to retain Husain, with insiders claiming that more should have been done to keep her. She left to join Bloomberg as editor-at-large and to host a global interview series.The weekly audience for the Today programme now stands at 5.73 million, according to the latest industry figures. While it has declined significantly since the 7.5 million it reached in 2016 during theaftermath of the EU referendum, its performance is relatively stable.

Foster said that there were “few more exciting opportunities for a journalist than presenting Today, and I’m thrilled to be joining the team”.She said: “I’ve always loved making important, agenda-setting, engaging radio, and there’s nowhere better to do that. It’s such a beloved programme to so many people, and I can’t wait to be a part of it.”Mohit Bakaya, the controller ofRadio 4, said: “Anna is a terrific addition to the Today team. She brings important international reporting experience at a time when it is needed so urgently by listeners to Radio 4. She is a brilliant journalist and skilled presenter, and I can’t wait to hear her, alongside Nick, Amol, Justin and Emma, getting to grips with the important stories on the nation’s biggest speech breakfast programme.”Explore more on these topicsRadio 4BBCRadio industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Share prices also fell in Europe, as the FTSE 100 tumbled 0.9% in London, Germany’s Dax was down 1.7% and France’s CAC fell 0.9% on Monday.Economists said the risks of a “Trumpcession” had increased as the president’s brinkmanship and stop-start approach to tariffs rattled global investors, exemplified by last week’s decision topause US tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexicofor the second time in as many months.Trump declined on Sunday to rule out the possibility that theUS economy could tumble into recessionthis year as he warned businesses and households to brace for a “period of transition” and the potential for higher inflation.Analysts said the president could have used the interview with Fox News as an opportunity to calm jitters in financial markets but that he instead chose to press on with an increasingly chaotic approach to his second term in office.Kathleen Brooks of the trading platform XTB said Trump was putting his political goals ahead of the strength of the economy and the stock market. “[His] flip-flopping on tariffs, and his old-fashioned views of America first, is weighing on consumption and knocking confidence.”Wall Street economists have downgraded their growth forecasts for the US, warning that Trump’s trade wars are proving more damaging for theUS economythan first anticipated.Analysts at Goldman Sachs said on Friday that the chances of a US recession had increased from 15% to 20%, as it revised its forecasts to incorporate higher tariffs and inflation, alongside a hit to gross domestic product and employment.Morgan Stanley cut its 2025 GDP growth forecast from 1.9% to 1.5%. “While we did expect growth-constraining policies (tariffs and immigration controls) to precede growth-supportive initiatives (tax cuts and deregulation), their severity has been greater than we anticipated. This is especially the case with tariffs, which have come in faster and broader than we had pencilled in,” it said.Many economists still reckon the US will avoid the widely accepted definition of a recession – two consecutive quarters of shrinking output – but warn that the latest figures show the risks are mounting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The reading can be volatile and is influenced heavily by the ballooning US trade deficit, which is likely to be unwound in future months.“Markets are now starting to get concerned about the prospects for growth in 2025,” said Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS global wealth management. “Trump’s tariff policy has been unpredictable, with a series of retreats so rapid they almost collide with the next tax hike announcement.“The rather chaotic US tariff policy still allows companies to sell a story to their customers to cover for price increases, and some may also try to raise prices in anticipation of tariffs that actually end up being retreated from.”Explore more on these topicsUS economyDonald TrumpTrump tariffsTrump administrationStock marketsEconomicsGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

Combat had started after fighters loyal to the ousted Assad regime launched a coordinated attack on Syrian security forces across the coast on Thursday.The fighting triggered a five-day battle in north-west Syria that killed more than 1,000 people, including at least 745 civilians. The attack also triggered revenge killings of mostly Alawite civilians in villages across the north-west.According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, Assad regime loyalists killed 211 civilians and 172 Syrian security forces, while Syrian government forces killed 396 civilians and unarmed prisoners.How did deadly Syria clashes start and who is responsible for civilian killings?Read moreAl-Sharaa promised accountability for the killings, saying: “We will hold accountable, with full decisiveness, anyone who is involved in the bloodshed of civilians, mistreats civilians, exceeds the state’s authority or exploits power for personal gain.”It is unclear how the spate of killings will affect the process of the SDF’s handing over of military authority to the state, as Syria’s Kurdish population is wary after decades of historical oppression under the Assad regime.The Syrian government also needs to make a deal with the Druze community in southern Syria, which has retained autonomy under the country’s new rulers.Syria also faces an Israeli incursion in the south, with Israeli leaders threatening military intervention in the country if the central government harms the Druze population. Druze leaders in turn have rejected any Israeli intervention in the country.On Monday night shortly after the agreement was signed between Damascus and the SDF, the Israeli air force bombed military sites in Daraa, southern Syria, according to Syria TV, a government aligned broadcaster.Explore more on these topicsSyriaKurdsMiddle East and north AfricaBashar al-AssadShareReuse this content"

Carney will then swear oaths of office and allegiance and form a cabinet. This is expected to happen in the coming days.After his meeting with Trudeau, Carney said the transition “will be seamless and it will be quick.’Under Canadian law, an election period must be at least 37 days and no more than 51 days, with the vote falling on a Monday. Party insiders have indicated Canadians will probably vote on 28 April or 5 May.Theformer governor of the Bank of England and of Canadatakes the job of prime minister as Ottawa finds itself at odds with its closest ally and largest trading partner. Last week Trump announced a 25% tax on all Canadian goods, with a carve-out for the automotive and energy sectors. The tariffs have the power to push Canada’s fragile economy into a recession.Carney spent much of his acceptance speech on Sunday evening foreshadowing the theme that will probably define his tenure as prime minister: conflict with the volatile and unpredictable president who has threatened repeatedly to annex Canada.“America is notCanada. And Canada never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape or form,” Carney told supporters. “We didn’t ask for this fight. But Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,” Carney said. “So the Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade as in hockey, Canada will win.While the Liberals trail slightly in the polls, Carney’s ascension within the party, and Trudeau’s exit, has dramatically revived their chances of eking out a victory in the next election – a result that was widely seen as unthinkable just weeks ago.A line graph of Canada opinion poll averages across January 2023 to January 2025 with Conservative hovering around 40%, yet falling in recent months to 38% and Liberals decreasing gradually to 20%, until a sudden increase to 34% after January 2025. NDP is shown currently at 14% and BQ is at 6%Carney, a political novice who has never held elected office, also criticised his main political rival: the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre.“Donald Trump thinks he can weaken us with his plan to divide and conquer. Pierre Poilievre’s plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,” Carney said. “Because a person who worships at the altar ofDonald Trumpwill kneel before him, not stand up to him.”Canada’s Liberal party was left for dead, but Trump might have just given it a second chanceRead moreCarney also suggested Poilievre’s partisan nature was a liability in the existential fight for Canada’s future. “His anger isn’t action. His division isn’t strength. Division won’t win a trade war,” he said.Earlier that evening, Poilievre accused Carney of being “sneaky” at a Sunday evening rally in London, Ontario.“And now our Liberal friends, after they’ve caused all this damage, are going to pull a sneaky trick. They’re going to try to get elected for a fourth term. A fourth term by replacing Justin Trudeau with his economic adviser, Mark Carney,” he said. “Carney’s advice drove up taxes, housing costs and food prices, while he personally profited from moving billions of dollars and thousands of jobs out of Canada to the United States.”Carney’s dominant win outshone most expectations and provides the leader with both a strong mandate and a unified party. He won in all 343 of the Liberal party districts. His closest rival, the former finance minister Chrystia Freeland finished a distant second with only 8% of the vote, and was unable to win the most votes in her own district.Explore more on these topicsCanadaUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationAmericasTrump tariffsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

While he said the series of interviews was meant to explain the US position, he also defended the talks by saying that Washington is “not an agent of Israel”.“We weren’t prepared to just sit back for two weeks,” Boehler said, adding: “You’ve got a real chance for some movement and seeing hostages home in the next few weeks.”Those remarks are said to have provoked behind-the-scenes fury from Netanyahu’s strategic affairs adviser Ron Dermer, as well as public anger from rightwingers in the government including the ultranationalist finance minister Bezalel Smotrich.“[Boehler] attempted to negotiate the release of American hostages. We made it clear to him that he cannot speak on our behalf, and if he wishes to negotiate on behalf of the United States, then good luck to him,” Smotrich told Israel’s Army Radio, according to the Times of Israel.The Israeli minister did not specify how this message was conveyed to Boehler. However, on Monday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, further sought to tamp down concerns over the talks between Boehler andHamas.“That was a one-off situation in which our special envoy for hostages, whose job it is to get people released, had an opportunity to talk directly to someone who has control over these people and was given permission and encouraged to do so. He did so,” Rubio told reporters while flying to Saudi Arabia.“As of now, it hasn’t borne fruit. Doesn’t mean he was wrong to try, but our primary vehicle for negotiations on this front will continue to be Mr Witkoff and the work he’s doing through Qatar,” Rubio added, referring to Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.In Israel,the revelation of direct talks between the US and Hamashas provoked mixed emotions. Official reaction from the Israeli government has been limited to a single terse statement by the office of Netanyahu acknowledging the negotiations and some broadly neutral comments from more junior officials.One key question has been whether Israel knew of the contacts before they were revealed by US-based media. Boehler did not answer questions about when the contacts began during interviews with Israeli media.Kan, the national public radio network, reported “behind-the-scenes tension between Israel and the US over the direct talks between Trump’s envoy Adam Boehler and the terrorist Khalil al-Hayya, talks that Israel only learned about from sources and only later was formally notified”.Others have welcomed the prospect of progress towards a diplomatic agreement that might ensure the return of more hostages.The mass-market newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said: “Israel was stunned to discover that, behind its back, Trump’s envoy had flirted for weeks in Doha” with Hayya, a senior Hamas official.“Hamas got what it could only have dreamt of getting under Biden: legitimacy,” the paper wrote.The newspaper gave details of what it said was “a fraught conversation” between Boehler and Dermer, a close adviser of Netanyahu.“Dermer thought that the Americans had agreed to an excessively large release of terrorists and that this would set the tone for the talks on the second stage. Boehler was stunned by Dermer’s insolence and spoke about that in conversations with other people,” the newspaper said.Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, described the contacts as “quite a big deal”.“Let’s see how it plays out. This kind of contact … can be positive. It can certainly move forward diplomacy.”Lovatt said that Hamas was unlikely to be overawed by dealing with the US.“Hamas negotiators have been quite professional. They’ve been able to make concessions but also to stand their ground. They are quite a robust partner so that will make a difference.”The Trump administration has sought to shut out its allies in negotiations both with Hamas and in Ukraine, where advisers are seen to be negotiating with Russia directly on a “reset” in relations and have increased pressure on Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, by cutting off military aid and intelligence sharing.Trump’s envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Gen Keith Kellogg, has said the US cut off support in order to get the Ukrainians’ attention,comparing the tactic to hitting a mule in the face with a wooden beam.Explore more on these topicsHamasIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

It would be sold like wine.”Sarabia on Monday insisted that changing the approach from a punitive one towards a more humanitarian one did not imply “normalising or coexisting with drug trafficking”.Colombian authorities have seized more than 1,900 tonnes of cocaine and destroyed 454 clandestine laboratories since Petro took office in August 2022 up to January this year, said the minister.Explore more on these topicsColombiaDrugs tradeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

However, Copenhagen fears that if voters give strong backing to the largest opposition party, Naleraq, a prominent pro-independence voice and supporter of US collaboration, Greenland could instead strengthen its ties with the US.On Monday the territory’s prime minister and chair of the Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) party, Múte B Egede, accused Trump of being “unpredictable” and said he had failed to treat Greenlanders with respect.View image in fullscreenMúte B Egede says Greeenland ‘deserves to be treated with respect’ after Trump’s recent comments.Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images“It is a fateful choice we have,” Egede told Danish broadcaster DR.“The things that are happening in the world right now worry me quite a lot. That there is a world order that is faltering on many fronts, and perhaps a president in the United States who is very unpredictable in a way that makes people feel insecure,” he said.“We deserve to be treated with respect, and I don’t think the American president has done that lately since he took office.”In his speech to Congress last week, Trump said that he would acquire Greenland“one way or the other”. And on Sunday, he attempted to appeal to Greenlanders directly by reiterating his invitation to join the US and pledging to “invest billions of dollars to create new jobs and make you rich”.However, while many in Nuuk are open to strengthening collaboration with the US, the idea of Greenland being acquired by the Trump administration has been widely rejected.Trump’srecent remarks were not helping, Egede said. “We need to draw a line in the sand and spend more effort on those countries that show us respect for the future we want to draw,” he added.Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland’s minister for natural resources, equality, business and justice and a member of IA, said Trump’s latest comments were seen as “crass and inappropriate”. “It’s the wrong way to do foreign policy if you want to get a closer tie with Greenland,” she added.Of the six parties running, only Naleraq has promised to hold a snap vote on independence and all parties, except for Atassut, support secession – although with varying degrees of urgency.Greenland’s longstanding independence movement has gained significant traction in recent years after a series of scandals highlighting Denmark’s racist treatment of Greenlanders – includingthe IUD scandal, in which 4,500 women and girls were allegedly fitted with contraception without their knowledge, and“parenting competency”tests that have separated many Inuit children from their parents.‘It’s very unpredictable’: divided Greenland prepares to vote amid Trump-inspired existential crisisRead moreWith the US administration expressing interest in Greenland’s “incredible natural resources”, chiefly its mineral wealth, Egede’s IA and another party, Siumut, have said they would set up a national mining company to enable Greenland to profit more from its raw materials.Nathanielsen said that despite the geopolitical drama the issues on voters’ minds were the usual preoccupations such as education and healthcare.“We are getting asked the exact same questions as usual by voters,” she said. “But on top of that there is, of course, a real concern about what is going on the world stage, especially with regards to Greenland.”Trump’s promises of interest and money in Greenland have so far been “very vague”, she said. “Right now it is just talk and very unclear what they [the US] actually think and what he [Trump] means by making Greenlanders rich, that’s still to be seen.”High school student and first-time voter, Aviâja Korneliussen, 18, said: “I am excited but also very nervous because we don’t know how it’s going to affect our communities and we know that the whole world is watching and waiting.”Korneliussen said she had not yet decided whether to vote for Naleraq, IA or the Democrats. She wanted Greenland to become independent and to have more connection with the Arctic region rather than with Denmark or the Nordics orEurope. But she was unsure when it came to the US.“I’m a bit conflicted because we know [what] the US has done to their own Indigenous groups and how they can manipulate things to be their way. But I get the idea they want to work together to be more independent from Denmark, so it’s a bit 50/50 for me.”Trump had been “disrespectful … he looks at us as objects to own” and she did not want Greenland to become the 51st state, she added.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDonald TrumpDenmarkEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said troops would remain “for the coming year”, meaning residents would not be allowed back in that time.Israel says its operations target militant Palestinian groups. The refugee camps are historically home to fighters who consider themselves armed resistance.“Israel’s complete disregard for international law in the war inGazais now being replicated to the West Bank,” said B’Tselem’s executive director, Yuli Novak. “Its activity there, as yet on a smaller scale than in Gaza, is already causing indiscriminate and disproportionate killing and destruction.”The parents of a boy shot when he went to buy bread and the uncle of two children, aged five and eight, who were killed in an airstrike are among relatives of six child victims who told the Guardian about how attacks documented by B’tselem have shattered their lives.Rigd Gasser, father of 14-year-old Ahmad Rashid Jazar, said his son was hit in the chest by a single bullet on 19 January while leaving a shop in his home village of Sebastia, where he had been on an errand to get bread.View image in fullscreenPalestinians stand by a damaged road in the Tulkarm refugee camp as residents evacuate their homes amid an Israeli military operation on 9 March.Photograph: Alaa Badarneh/EPAGasser was in a cafe when he heard the gunshots and rushed out when he heard calls for help. “I got closer and recognised my son. I knew him by his clothes, his body was all covered in blood,” he said. “Since the beginning of the war, they [Israeli forces] have been coming here every day. They launch raids in the morning and evening.”Israel sent a surge of troops, including tanks, to the West Bank after theGaza ceasefire began in January. Military operations in the three refugee camps – Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams – came on top of what had been Israel’s deadliest bombing campaign in the occupied territory. In the 17 months since 7 October 2023, B’tselem documented64 airstrikes that killed 261 Palestinians, including both militant and civilian casualties and at least 41 minors.That is more than three times the total toll from airstrikes during the second intifada, which lasted more than four years, when B’tselem recorded 78 deaths including 10 children between 2000 and the end of 2004.The group’s report described the increased use of airstrikes as part of a “broader conceptual and operational shift” in Israeli military tactics that put civilians at greater risk. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions.Muhammad Khreiwish’s niece and nephew were among the youngest victims. Sham Abu Zahara, eight, and Karam Abu Zahara, five, were killed with both their parents and another uncle on 3 October 2024, when an airstrike targeted a cafe in Tulkarm.The cafe was on the ground floor of an apartment building, and the Abu Zahara family lived next door. Khreiwish was arriving to visit his sister Saja when an explosion threw him off his bike. As people raced away from the site, he ran in to look for the family.Inside he was met by a horrific scene. “I found pieces of bodies that I couldn’t recognise, and then I saw my niece,” he said. He called for help but she had been killed immediately. All he could do was wrap her shattered body and take it to the hospital morgue.The strike killed 18 people and at least six of them, or a third of the total, were civilians, B’tselem investigators found.The Abu Zahara siblings were two of 180 children killed by Israeli forces over the 17 months since the Gaza war began, the deadliest period in the West Bank of Israel’s nearly 60-year-long occupation according to B’tselem.Until 2023 the most dangerous time for Palestinian children in the West Bank was the second intifada, when B’tselem documented 246 children killed in 63 months – a rate of killing half current levels from all Israeli operations.B’tselem said looser rules of engagement were one reason for the rise in child deaths. The Israeli military has expanded its “open fire” rules, with soldiers now allowed to shoot to kill targets including anyone they suspect is “messing with the ground”, Israeli newspaper Haaretzreported.The cousins Reda Basharat, eight, and Hamza Basharat, 10, were killed near home by a drone strike on 8 January. The children could not go school that morning because Israeli forces had launched a raid near their village, Tammun, and so roads were closed, Hamza’s mother, Eman Basharat, said.View image in fullscreenEman Basharat holds a picture of her son Hamza, 10, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on 8 January.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianHamza, born after a years-long IVF struggle, was a cheerful child who normally loved studying and was angry about missing an English test scheduled for that day.The boys were sitting outside with their 23-year-old cousin Adam, who was drinking a morning coffee when they were targeted. Eman raced out to look for her son as soon as she heard the explosion. She found Hamza injured and struggling to breathe. “I held his body. I cleaned the blood from his face and I recited the Shahada [the Muslim profession of faith]. He died in my arms, he didn’t look like he was in pain.”Israeli soldiers arrived soon after and took away all three bodies for several hours, before returning the children to their grieving families without explanation.“When I think about what happened to my son and remember the images of their bodies, and I see what is happening in Gaza on TV, I felt suddenly that they are doing the same thing,” Eman Basharat said.It is a comparison that has also been made by Israeli officials. The West Bank campaign was a based on “a lesson from the activity that took place in Gaza and other places”, Katz told the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. “We need to clean up a place and not allow terrorism to return to it.”Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has said Palestinians in the West Bank should know that “if they continue with terrorism … their fate will be like Gaza”. He said the “Tulkarm and Jenin [refugee camps] will look like Jabaliya and Shujayah [in Gaza]”.An Israel Defense Forces spokespersonhas previously deniedthat soldiers forced Palestinians from their homes, saying camp residents who chose to leave to escape fighting were “allowed” to do so.Dozens of homes have already demolished. Similarities with larger-scale displacement and destruction in Gaza were clear to Palestinian families crowded into mosques, wedding halls and the homes of relatives where they had sought refuge.The Guardian spoke to three families who said they were ordered to leave their homes either directly by Israeli forces or through messages broadcast on loudspeakers.Fatma Shab, 63, is living in the women’s area of wedding hall, separated from her severely ill husband, Yusuf Shab, 68. Permanently connected to oxygen, he cannot walk and had to be evacuated by ambulance.View image in fullscreenFatma Shab in the wedding hall where she is living after being displaced.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianAs Israeli forces advanced the Shabs fled from their home in Nur Shams refugee camp to the house of their son, which has since been demolished. Soldiers broke into the building and told them to leave immediately, with no time to pack.So they moved again to a nearby Kafr al-Labad town where they have found temporary, basic shelter in al-Diah wedding hall. They only have two bathrooms for 14 people, and just drapes separating crowded sleeping areas.Even so, the families sheltering there are terrified they will have to leave after Ramadan, as it will be needed again for weddings once the holy month is finished.View image in fullscreenYusef Shab, 68, is connected to oxygen 24 hours a day and cannot walk.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian“People here are kind, but in my home I am more comfortable,” Fatma Shab said. “Even just being able to go to my closet to choose some clothes to wear. Now I’m just wearing what I have on, there are no choices.”She said she did not know if she would see the house she built with her husband for their retirement again. “It’s just a short distance away, but I can’t go home. In Gaza they were forced out and killed, and here now it’s the same.”Explore more on these topicsWest BankGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

A few weeks later, news came of coordinated arrests in Britain of members of a Bulgarian spy ring believed to be working for Russian intelligence.Last week at the Old Bailey,a jury found three of the group– Katrin Ivanova, Vanya Gaberova and Tihomir Ivanov Ivanchev – guilty on espionage-related charges. Overmany weeks of court hearings, the jury heard how the trio were part of a group that travelled to Vienna and other European locations to surveil Grozev. Plans were developed to kidnap and deliver him to Russian operatives, which ultimately were never implemented.The plotters’ ideas were sometimes more bluster than substance, and occasionally prompted laughter from the jury, but Grozev said he was relieved at the guilty verdict nonetheless. “They may have come across as muppets, but it’s clear that their plans could have been incredibly dangerous,” he said.Grozev first came to prominence with his work for Bellingcat, a group of online sleuths who used traditional journalistic tools combined with combing leaked Russian databases to identify Russian operatives – firstuncovering the suspects in the 2018 Salisbury novichok poisoningof Sergei Skripal and his daughter, who were from Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency. Two years later, heidentified the FSB poisoning squadbehind the attempt to kill the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, also with novichok nerve agent. At the time, Navalny called him “a modern-day Sherlock Holmes”.These investigations apparently put Grozev firmly in the sights of Russia’s vengeful intelligence apparatus, along with his collaborator,the Russian journalist Roman Dobrokhotov, with whom he now works for the online outlet the Insider, and who was also surveilled by the Bulgarian ring.While he knew there was a danger of reprisals for his work, the appearance of a concrete threat forced him to introduce new security measures into his life. But just as he was adapting to them, in the weeks after the initial warning in New York, he received more unwelcome news – his father had died unexpectedly in Austria. “I had to breach all of these instructions and fly there to attend to the funeral,” he said.On that visit, he spent three days living in a safe house, but there was no burial because Austrian police impounded his father’s body for tests to see if there was anything suspicious. Grozev said he never received a conclusive answer as to whether there was any foul play, but seeing evidence presented in the London trial of how the Bulgarian ring had located his father’s apartment led to increased suspicion.“I had written it off as a coincidence, but something that brought that story back is the photo of Ivanova in front of my dad’s apartment with an arrow on how to get into it. I guess we’ll never know,” he said.During the trip back for his father’s funeral, the Austrians told Grozev the group tracking him apparently had links to Jan Marsalek, the Austrian-born fugitive executive of Wirecard, who is accused of coordinating his actions with handlers in the Russian intelligence structures.Marsalek contracted a Bulgarian living in Britain, Orlin Roussev, to run the spy ring. Roussev pled guilty and did not stand trial, but the evidence included thousands of messages exchanged between him and Marsalek, who is believed to be in Moscow.Grozev had published numerous investigations into Marsalek, an unusual player in the global espionage game. He is wanted in Europe over a €1.9bn (£1.6bn) bank fraud, and disappeared soon after news of the scandal broke in 2020. Reporting by Der Spiegel suggests he may have been recruited by Russia as early as 2014.In the messages presented to the Old Bailey, Marsalek repeatedly refers to discussions with “our friends” over mission planning, suggesting that he became a trusted freelancer for the Russian intelligence services.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over a period of many months, the team followed Grozev, covertly recorded him, had Gaberova friend him on Facebook with the goal of setting up a honey-trap sting, and even claimed to have broken into his Vienna apartment. A plan was discussed to launch a kidnap mission during a visit to Kyiv, but this was called off by Marsalek at the last minute.Grozev does not recall ever spotting his unwanted followers, but his teenage daughter may have done so. On one occasion, when he took her to an outdoor restaurant in Vienna for lunch, she told him she thought there was a Russian spy surveilling them. “She told me: ‘He’s been walking back and forth like four times, and every time I look at him, he raises his camera and he pretends to be filming or take photographs of the building above us. And this building is very ugly, so there’s nothing to photograph!’”At the time, Grozev told his daughter to leave the spy tracking to him, but much later, it transpired that this was the day on which Ivanchev had been tracking Grozev in Vienna.These days, he prefers not to disclose too much about his current living arrangements, but he has been forced to stay away from Vienna. “I have no idea where my home is. Apparently it cannot be Bulgaria, it cannot be Austria or any Schengen country. There is a feeling of unrootedness that has plagued me for two years now.”Antidote, a documentary film featuring Christo Grozev and his investigations, is in select cinemas from 14 March, and will be shown as Kill List: Hunted by Putin’s Spies on Channel 4 on 25 March.Explore more on these topicsEspionageBulgariaRussiaInvestigative journalisminterviewsShareReuse this content"

During that confrontation, Vance accused Zelenskyy of disrespecting the US, leading “propaganda tours” of the destruction resulting from Russia’s invasion – and of being ungrateful for American aid to Ukraine after it was first invaded by Putin’s troops while Joe Biden was in the White House in February 2022.“Donald Trump and my cousin clearly believe they can placateVladimir Putin,” Nate Vance said to Le Figaro, as translated by Google. Invoking a moniker historically often applied to people who are taken advantage of by ruthless political leaders, Nate Vance continued: “They are wrong. The Russians are not about to forget our support for Ukraine. We are Vladimir Putin’s useful idiots.”Nate Vance also contended that the diplomatic breakdown – which occurred after Zelenskyy sought to attach US security guarantees to the minerals pact – was “an ambush of absolute bad faith”.“When he criticized aid toUkraine, I told myself that it was because he had to please a certain electorate, that it was a game of politics,” Nate Vance said.Nate Vance specifically took aim at JD Vance’s remarks to Zelenskyy that Vance had “watched and seen … stories” justifying his distrust of Ukraine and its president.“I thought I was going to choke,” Nate Vance reportedly added. “His own cousin was on the frontlines. I could have told him the truth, without personal interest. He never tried to find out more.”He said he subsequently left messages for the vice-president at his office, but none had been returned. Nate Vance also recounted how he did not want to risk being captured after Trump won a second presidency in November with JD Vance – who was previously one of Ohio’s US senators – as his running mate. So he said he returned to the US in January, shortly before JD Vance took office as Trump’s vice-president.Nate Vance’s father is the brother of JD Vance’s mother. He described having previously vacationed with the vice-president. The cousins each also previously served in the US marines.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Change of this magnitude is never easy, but our strength comes from our shared commitment to our mission and each other.”Many will see the elimination of Nasa’s office of the chief scientist as an abrupt U-turn in the agency’s climate policy, and another attack by conservatives on science and evidence-based decision making.The agency’s current chief scientist and senior climate adviser, Dr Kate Calvin, wasappointed in January 2022by the then Nasa administrator, Bill Nelson, a former Democratic senator.“Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing our nation and our planet. Nasa is a world leader in climate and Earth science,” she said at the time.She took a senior role in advising Nasa leadership of all aspects of its science programs and science-related strategic planning and investments, especially as they relate to the climate emergency and actions of humans on global warming and rising sea temperatures.The closure of the DEIA office represents a similar reversal in policy for an agency that as recently as September waspromoting its partnershipwith the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to increase engagement and equity for underrepresented students in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.After succeeding Nelson, Petro insisted in January that such programs “divided Americans by race, wasted taxpayer dollars, and resulted in shameful discrimination”.The third Nasa office cut on Monday – technology, policy and strategy – was established in 2021 within the office of the administrator to “bring together diverse, multidisciplinary experts to provide Nasa leadership with analytic, strategic, and decisional insights”.It housed the agency’s chief technologist and chief economist, and its analysis of Nasa policies was recognized as a critical check and balance.Immediate reaction to the cutbacks on social media was largely critical.In apost to X, Grant Tremblay, an astrophysicist at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, conceded Nasa was in need of some reform, but wholesale elimination of departments was excessive.“Nasa is small, but it is arguably the most legendary and globally beloved agency in American history. Its gutting has begun and the cuts to come are so massive that we won’t recognize it in a year,” he wrote.“Many of these cuts are likely to be essentially irreversible. It’s hard to build something great from a pile of ash and rubble. The people you lose will not come back. When you lose a lead, you never recover it. Memory lost is lost for good.”Explore more on these topicsNasaSpaceTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

So shouting “Ho hey!” from the stage got people’s attention. We were doing it to be heard. Then suddenly everyone started listening’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 10 Mar 2025 11.15 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 17.23 EDTShareWesley Schultz, songwriter, vocals, guitarAfter growing up in Ramsey, a small town in New Jersey, we moved to New York to try to make it in music but found it a very difficult circuit to break into. Bars would let you play because they wanted your friends to buy drinks, but then they’d kick everybody out to get the next group in. Whenever I would meet people, I’d tell them, “I’m a waiter but I play music,” and they’d go, “Yeah, so does my cousin.” The prospect of playing somewhere like the [iconic New York venue] Mercury Lounge felt about as likely as playing a stadium.I wrote Ho Hey about these experiences. I had the beginnings of another song that was going to be called Everyone Requires a Plan, but it had no words or melody. Once I started strumming it again, Ho Hey just poured out of me. Looking back, I was writing about two heartbreaks at the same time. A person had recently broken up with me and I was also leaving New York and moving to Denver – breaking up with the city that I thought held all my dreams. I felt steamrollered by both events.The opening lines are me trying to convince myself that striving to become a successful musician was a noble pursuit: I had been “trying to do it right” and “living a lonely life”. The hook is pure defiance: you might have broken up with me but “I belong with you, you belong with me”.It’s an unconventional song in that it doesn’t have a chorus. We made numerous attempts to record it. We even tried recording it in the bathroom to get natural reverb. The song needed a kind of looseness. When producer Kevin Augunas stepped in to finish it, he pointed out that a lot of our favourite records had been recorded without using a click track, or metronome, so suggested we try that. Suddenly it worked. The bit where it goes “one, two, three” is a cue for us to slightly speed up.I came up with the “ho hey” chant after listening to the Felice Brothers cover the old railroad songTake This Hammerand wanting something similar. We were moving away from bar band covers to doing our own songs, so shouting “Ho hey!” from the stage got people’s attention. We were shouting to be heard. Then suddenly everyone started listening.Jeremiah Fraites, songwriter, percussion, backing vocalsA little bar in New York used to pay us $100 and give us cheeseburgers and beers to play. Whenever we’d do a Bob Dylan or Coldplay song, all ears were on us. But when Wes would say, “Here’s an original,” everyone would flee for a cigarette break or to play billiards.View image in fullscreen‘It’s an unconventional song’ … the Lumineers perform at the Grammys in 2013.Photograph: Kevin Winter/WireImageAfter we moved to Denver, we would do 14-hour drives to play in New Mexico or Nebraska. The journeys were killing us and we were losing money on gas, so we needed songs that could really grab people. Because Ho Hey was acoustic, we could unplug our instruments, physically leave the stage and go out into the audience.Initially, Wes created a fragment of it, then we worked on the song in my parents’ attic like crazy. At one point it was heavier, like a White Stripes version with driving guitar. At the same time, I was learning about home recording, so we burned a raw version of Ho Hey and six other songs on to 200 CDs. Our friends would say stuff like: “You should rerecord it. It sounds like shit, but I listen to it 30 times a day.” So we knew it had something.After we got management, we recorded a studio version in some woods north of Seattle, trying to recreate the sound of my boots stomping on a wooden stage, which we had liked at an open mic. There’s no bass on Ho Hey: it’s a cello pizzicato which we made much louder. The song is like Italian cooking – there are so few elements that every ingredient needs to be perfect. When Kevin remixed the entire album, he pared everything back: the version of Ho Hey that became a hit is very similar to the one on that first burned CD.Initially, it charted at No 90. Then a TV show called Hart of Dixie played the whole song at the end of an episode and immediately people were asking: “Who are the Lumineers?” A DJ in Seattle started playing it back-to-back and then it just took off.The Lumineers’ new album, Automatic, is out now.

The poet laureate of social media. I’m not being snarky here; I genuinely love her tweets, and they are one of the only things that bring me joy in a rapidly Nazi-infested platform.

She has published 58 novels – but more importantly, she has written 170k tweets. Her targets are broad and plentiful. There are political takes: dozens of tweets a day aboutHarris v Trump, andIsrael’s war on Gaza. She’ll be outspoken on trans rights one day, and writing aboutJD Vance’s tiny eyes on another– but she also isn’t afraid to venture into worlds of whimsy, such asher cat pondering the trolley problem.The point is that she posts frequently, without the agenda to sell something, and seemingly with unabashed sincerity. In interviews, she’s dismissed the medium as“ephemeral and quickly forgotten”. But her relationship to the platform feels pure.

Pete Tong and Gilles Peterson remember a pivotal figureAlexis PetridisMon 10 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 17.22 EDTShareNorman Cook can remember the first time he met James Hamilton very clearly. “He wasenormous,” he laughs. “Enormous and very well-spoken, called everyone ‘dear boy’, quite camp. He looked so …unlikely. Not a party animal, not into anything apart from dance music and the vibe and the culture of it all. Not interested in being cool, he was like, ‘it’s OK to be nerdy as long as you really know your music’, but I think he really enjoyed the fact that every club he went to, everyone would know who he was and they were all going to tell him some gossip or give him a record.”Moreover, Cook remembers their meeting because James Hamilton had caused him a whole world of trouble. It was the 80s, a decade before Cook became Fatboy Slim, superstar DJ and multi-platinum producer of countless dancefloor hits: he was still the bass player in indie band the Housemartins, who had quietly put out his first solo single – “a kind of cut-up rap record calledThe Finest Ingredients” – under a pseudonym, DJ Megamix, further masking his identity by trying to make the 12in look like an American import.“And James Hamilton found out who I was, and when he wrote about it in Record Mirror, he put ‘Norman from the Housemartins’. And all hell broke loose: the rest of the band were going ‘What are you doing? You have to stop this! We’ll lose fans if they think that you’re into hip-hop!’ It was that era of ‘hang the DJ’ – you couldn’t be in an indie band and like dance music. So the first thing I said to him was ‘oh, thanks for outing me – how did you know?’”It’s a very James Hamilton story: it makes reference to his imposing physical stature, his fabled public school poshness (he was 6ft 8in, and variously described as resembling “a country squire”, “an eccentric aristocrat”, “a headmaster that had turned up in the middle of a nightclub” and compared to James Robertson Justice, the fearsome star of theDoctor at Largefilms). It notes the sheer improbability that someone like that would be a pivotal figure in the world of dance music, however encyclopedic his knowledge.View image in fullscreenDJ Norman Cook (AKA Fatboy Slim).Photograph: Mick Hutson/RedfernsBut a pivotal and pioneering figure in dance music history is exactly what James Hamilton was: so important that Pete Tong describes him as “the oracle”. At a time when Black music tended to go ignored by the mainstream music press, he wrote a column in Record Mirror that began in the mid-70s, reviewing every new release that might conceivably be of interest to club DJs, in a deeply idiosyncratic, adjective heavy style: tracks could be “jittery” or “jogging” , a “jiggly smacker”, a “solid clomper” or – a personal favourite – “gallopingly exerting”.The first of two collections of Hamilton’s writing,James Hamilton’s Disco Pages 1975-1982, has just been published: it’s edited by Mike Atkinson, a writer and podcaster whose stepmother married Hamilton in 1994. His writing “was like an actual different lexicon, that you’d eventually understand,” says broadcaster and DJGilles Peterson, who describes seeing his name mentioned in print by Hamilton for the first time as “the highlight of my life up to that point”.Hamilton also dished out news, gossip and tips from across Britain, encouraging DJs to send in lists of their biggest records that he compiled into the first ever UK dance chart: in an era when, as Cook puts it, DJs “very rarely played outside their own local catchment area”, it was as if he was trying to singlehandedly forge a country-wide dance scene. “I mean, it’s impossible for kids with the internet to believe, but there were all these little scenes going on in different places, and unless you went to visit a mate for a weekend, you’d never know what was going on in the next town, there was no cross-pollination between different cities – if you lived in Brighton, you would have no idea whatthe Wild Bunchwere playing in Bristol,” says Cook. “James Hamilton was the conduit for everything.”Perhaps most importantly of all, after a visit to New York where he visited the Paradise Garage and heard the legendary DJLarry Levan, Hamilton relentlessly promoted the idea of matching the tempos of different records and seamlessly mixing them together: a hitherto-unknown concept in late 70s Britain, where club DJs tended to get on the microphone and talk between records.View image in fullscreenTop disco in Ilford, Essex, in 1978.Photograph: Paul Fievez/ANL/ShutterstockIt’s hard to imagine in a world where mixing records is what club DJs do as a matter of course, but Hamilton’s idea met with a combination of indifference and outright hostility. Pete Tong believes it was “down to resistance of the unknown, like ‘I don’t really understand how to do this’,” but DJ and producer Greg Wilson – an early adopter of mixing, who ended updemonstrating his turntable skills to a visibly baffled Jools Holland on The Tube in early 1983, and who is publishing the new collection – thinks it had more to do with the possibility that it might frustrate their aspirations to become broadcasters. “DJs didn’t travel all over the country, they weren’t stars in the same way they are now, so their ambition was usually to get on the radio. So the idea of putting the microphone down in order to mix records … they were absolutely dead set against that.”But Hamilton persisted, taking British DJs with him when he returned to the Paradise Garage. Most of them seem to have been distinctly nonplussed, but one,Steven “Froggy” Howletthad what Wilson calls “a Damascene conversion” and apparently imported the UK’s first set of Technics decks on his return. He started peppering his writing with suggestions about other tracks you could mix into the one he was reviewing, and started counting records’ speeds – their beats per minute – with the aid of a stopwatch and adding that information to reviews too: whenever you see a BPM measurement attached to a dance track, that’s basically down to James Hamilton.Hamilton was a fascinating figure. Quite aside from his writing career and the various innovations it spawned, he’d spent the 60s alternately working with the Beatles in America, and DJing at legendary London mod nightclub the Scene under the name Doctor Soul; he then built Britain’s first custom-made mobile DJ console, and took to playing at aristocratic country house balls, where requests tended more to the Blue Danube and Scottish jigs and reels than the latest US imports.View image in fullscreenDiscos column by James Hamilton, 1982.Photograph: Record MirrorAnd yet, 29 years after his death from cancer, Hamilton remains an almost entirely forgotten figure. “No one under the age of 50 knows who he is,” laments Wilson.The new collection offers an endlessly intriguing glimpse into a forgotten world of 70s and 80s nightlife, filled with unexpected details – the sudden surge of interest in 40s swing music among soul fans in the mid-70s, which led to not one, but two versions of Glen Miller’s In the Mood making the Top 40; the fact that the first mixed DJ set in Britain was played not in a hip nightclub, but at a roller-skating event at glamorous-sounding Pickett’s Lock Sports Centre in Edmonton – the writing testament to Hamilton’s surprisingly catholic tastes.He was quick to pick up on the importance of gay clubs in the development of dance music, running charts from their DJs from the mid-70s onwards and was, a little surprisingly, a huge fan of punk, approvingly – and characteristically – referring to the Sex Pistols’ Anarchy in the UK as a “noisy bubblegum chugger”. “In the mod days he saw the Who as a rock band followed by mods who spent most of their time dancing to soul music at the Scene,” says Atkinson. “Then he saw people at the Lacy Lady in Ilford dressing in punk gear” – “festooned with chains, safety pins dancing to soul, funk and disco, and made the connection between the Sex Pistols and the Who.”View image in fullscreenAfrika Bambaataa and GrandMixer DST at Camden Palace, London, in 1983.Photograph: David Corio/RedfernsHe was also impressed by the burgeoning new romantic movement, talking up the Blitz club’s DJRusty Eganand coining a weirdly familiar term for the music he played: electronic dance music or EDM. This, however, proved a step too far for the purists. “There was a record shop and label that really took umbrage at him covering this white, electronic music, and threatened to withdraw their advertising from Record Mirror, so he had to stop,” says Wilson. “The irony is that in the US, Gary Numan and the Human League were being played at Black block parties in the Bronx, and that’s how you ended up with records like Planet Rock by Afrika Bambaataa.”‘Blokes who would normally fight would get off their boxes and dance’: Sanctuary, the club that made Milton Keynes massiveRead moreHis influence finally began to wane with the arrival of acid house in the UK. Hamilton liked the music, but was wary of the accompanying drug culture (invited by Paul Oakenfold to his acid house nightSpectrum, Hamilton famously surveyed the club, then turned to Oakenfold and said “I’ve heard the crunch of amphetamines on the dancefloor before, you know”). And, as Peterson points out, acid house was “sort of creating a new movement that didn’t want to be associated with the past”. “It was our punk rock moment, it was year zero,” agrees Tong. “It was almost like everything that came before was forbidden. Things like the Boy’s Own fanzine were really influential and they were a bit ‘fuck off, soul boys’. It’s how the phrase ‘it’s all gone Pete Tong’ came about – I was accepted, but in print, they took the piss out of me because I was connected to the past.”Moreover, acid house was too big a scene for one writer to oversee (Record Mirror folded in 1991 and specialist dance titles including Mixmag and DJ sprang up, although Hamilton kept reviewing for the latter until his death). And its impact on British culture was so vast it tends to overshadow everything that came before, no matter how impactful and influential it was.“People forgot about the world before the rave scene,” says Wilson. “So these very important characters like James got forgotten. We’re in a weird position today, where people in Britain can tell you all sorts about what was happening in New York clubs in the 70s, they know aboutthe Loftor everything Larry Levan was playing, but they’re at a loss when it comes to the UK. That’s one of the important aspects of doing a book, to bring history into play, so that people understand that there was a scene here, with a different approach, its own character, its own background, and James was a part of that – he pushed things forward.”James Hamilton’s Disco Pages 1975-1982, edited by Mike Atkinson, is out now, published by Super Weird Substance, £30Explore more on these topicsDance musicClubbingDiscoFatboy SlimfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Drop, as indicated by title and trailer, is a one-room thriller for the digital natives: what would happen if your phone was barraged by mysterious AirDropped memes telling you to kill your date, or your family dies? It’s a simple premise familiar to anyone who has received an unwanted dick pic on the subway, and one that writer/director Christopher Landon drills into with fresh and invigorating precision.Holland review – twisty Nicole Kidman thriller is a disappointing messRead moreAnd one elevated by two well-cast leads in Meghann Fahy and Brandon Sklenar, who both keep their cards just close enough to their chests. Sklenar, recently inIt Ends With Us, once again convincingly plays the nice, understanding guy to a woman who has survived domestic abuse; sweet and self-effacing, he’s more “fuck” or “marry” material than “kill”. But this is Fahy’s movie as Violet, a therapist for survivors of domestic violence and a single mother to a five-year-old son. She is no stranger to it; the film opens with a scene one could assume is a flash forward, with a bloody and bruised Violet crawling limply away from her late husband, who brandishes a loaded gun.Years later, when enough time, healing and celibacy have passed for her to have no new dinner outfits, Violet finally braces for a first date with a man from the apps. Henry, 32, a photographer, lives in Chicago and looks friendly enough. Until the drops begin, Landon makes smart and natural use of one’s iPhone; Violet swipes through his profile for the pleasure of her sister Jen (Violett Beane), the babysitter and cheerleader for the evening, to show the familiar contrived blend of earnest and goofy. In person at a fancy high-rise restaurant, Henry (Sklenar), is amiable, thoughtful and helpful in attempting to help Violet identify the source of increasingly hostile “DigiDrops” – AirDrops without the copyright infringement – sharing files to her phone in chilling meme-speak from within a 50ft radius.But once the devil emoji in her phone tells her to check her security cameras, revealing a masked intruder in her home set to kill her son if she fails to poison her date first, Violet is on her own. This is unfortunately rendered as text-on-screen rather than glancing the phone itself – one of the great scourges of modern movies, as it will never not look cheap and silly, and my only ick with this one. But Landon, director of theHappy Death Daymovies and, more pertinently to millennials on the dating market, the screenwriter of 2007’s Disturbia, keeps things snappy, scary and unpredictable enough to distract from the corny font.Drop deftly threads the needle between the absurd – this is an extreme case of main character syndrome proved true, for reasons that don’t really make sense – and the grounded, with some of the most believable flirting attempts that I’ve heard in awhile and the right level of bad waiter comic relief in Jeffery Self. The stomach drop of first date anticipation, waiting for the guy from the phone to walk in the door, turns out to be a similar sensation to the jump-scare of ominous, anonymous messages. Landon gets plenty of mileage from Violet scanning the room for potential culprits, only to see every single person illuminated by the screen in their hand. Every screen a camera and a portal, every message visible and traced, no place to hide.Dear Daphne: why Meghann Fahy was the real star of The White LotusRead moreFor the sake of surprise, I will say no more, other than that Violet plays a game known to generations of women: keeping up the facade of being fine for survival. She must charm Henry enough to stay, exude authenticity and explain her increasingly weird behavior while messaging the villain and plotting potential escapes. A lot for any woman to handle, and played with aplomb by Fahy, finally finding a role worthy of hertalent for glimpsing unseen depthsas displayed on the second season ofThe White Lotus. That Drop takes a few too ludicrous steps and still mostly sticks the landing is a testament to her command of the character, who is given very little in terms of characterization yet never feels two-dimensional.Her dialed-in performance is thankfully matched by an overarching crispness to the proceedings – just enough flourishes, an enjoyable but not unbearable amount of stress, no wasted time, a perfect match of star, script and style. For those who sort for lean and limber in their thrillers, Drop is a date worth making.Drop is screening at theSXSW film festival and is out in cinemas on 11 AprilExplore more on these topicsSXSW FilmFirst look reviewThrillersSXSWFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Fresh from becoming a side quest for Taylor Swift’s legion of fans due to her admiration of their 2003 hit I Believe in a Thing Called Love – a song dispatched here with undimmed bombast – the Darkness have a new record out shortly that, if Hawkins’ pumping of the faithful for pre-orders is to be believed, might return them to the top of the charts.Justin Hawkins: ‘The worst thing anyone’s said to me? “I would love to go on a date with you, but I’d be too embarrassed”’ | The Q&ARead moreBut they are a different band to the one that achieved the same feat with their blockbuster debut Permission to Land more than two decades ago and perhaps all the better for it. With budgets slashed and venues smaller there is less reliance on, or desire to reach for, stadium rock spectacle tonight. In its place is something honest and homespun as Hawkins banters and saunters while his brother Dan, dressed like Johnny Ramone but holding things down with the beautiful reliability of Malcolm Young, riffs hard on Mortal Dread and Barbarian.In opposition, though, is a mix that’s coruscatingly loud and absolutely unforgiving. It ruins Rock and Roll Party Cowboy and The Battle for Gadget Land, a couple of intriguingly spiky new songs, and is equally dismissive of Growing on Me, a banker from the old days that’s rescued at the last when Hawkins, spotlit in a neckerchief and retro-futuristic jacket like Doc Holliday fronting Sparks, peels off a head-spinning solo.

Maybe it will help us reflect or inspire us. Isn’t that part of a life well lived? And if you don’t go to a gallery, maybe you’ll find yourself lingering on a picture at home, reading a novel, going to the theatre or listening to music. But what if you didn’t? What if there were no galleries, theatres, publishers or concert halls? What if we got rid of art?The impulse seems philistine at best, authoritarian at worst, yet a remarkable number of modern artists were seduced by it. André Breton, the leader of the surrealists, repeatedly called for the end of literature. Theo van Doesburg, the founder of the De Stijl movement, proclaimed that “art has poisoned our life”, while his friend and compatriot,Piet Mondrian, believed that if we did abolish art, no one would miss it. In December 1914, as the first world war entered its first winter, the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky declared that art was already dead. “It found itself in the backwater of life,” he wrote. “It was soft and could not defend itself.”These points of view were rooted in a historical moment, particularly in the shock and disillusionment occasioned by the war, yet it’s easy to see resonances in our own time. Many back then had a distrust of culture that was elite in the wrong way: expensive, inaccessible, obscure. If you’ve been to an art fair recently, you’ll notice that this kind of art is in rude health. Characters such as Mondrian and Van Doesburg wished not to abolish creation or self-expression – but to break art out of its frame, to transfigure our whole environment so there would be no distinction between art and ordinary objects. The rise of modern design has perhaps brought us closer to that goal, yet Mondrian hoped that his own style, with its distinctive primary colors and geometric planes, would form the basis for a single, universal, anonymous language of design, and instead it has degenerated into Mondrian-kitsch, to be found on everything from socks to aprons. It seems as if we like designers more than design.Like a young radical entering middle age, art has steadily grown more conservativeThe most intriguing of those old impulses to abandon art derived from suspicion of an art that was empathetic and humanistic. During the war, Breton had worked as a psychiatrist tending to traumatised soldiers, and these experiences made him wary of any art that might attempt to redeem all the horror they had witnessed. If the world was wretched, shouldn’t we be transforming it, not distracting ourselves from it? Yet for most of us, that’s precisely the role art plays in our lives. If you’ve had a bad week at work, you relax with art. It blunts your ire, and by Monday you’re ready for the boss again. But what would happen if we didn’t soothe ourselves with imagined utopias, but instead did as John Lydon once suggested, and used anger as an energy?It should be obvious that these early calls to end art didn’t achieve their goals. Mondrian talked the talk about art’s end, but his love of painting made him equivocate, and eventually he blamed society for being ill-prepared for his brave new artless world. Also, the proposed alternatives weren’t always so viable. Among several ideas, Breton suggested walking in the city as a new form of poetic activity. He felt that a disjunctive kind of verse, a collage of sights and signs and feelings, would emerge from the chance encounters and lateral thoughts occasioned by a walk. Maybe it would if you were strolling through the historic parts of Paris in the 1920s, but when I tried wandering at random around my own neighbourhood in an outer borough of New York City, I found my “poems” were banal and forlorn. I struggled to disengage from thoughts of goals and destinations, and crossing the busy street posed its own risks. I concluded that we partition our lives for a reason: we rationalise to get stuff done, we fantasise to relax. In other words, art and life don’t mix.Recent developments suggest that artists agree. After a flurry of attempts to democratise art in the 1960s, things have quieted somewhat, and like a young radical entering middle age, art has grown conservative. While once we wanted avant-garde performance, or sculpture made of documents or heaps of dirt, today patrons want portraits once again. There’s much to be said for the notion that art should consist of beautiful objects. In a world that is increasingly digital, dematerialised and accelerated, the pleasures of pausing and looking at something exquisite help us slow down and rest in the moment. Yet to accept that this is all art should aspire to is to accept that a whole realm of human creation devoted to beauty, thought and feeling will be confined to the boundaries of a picture frame or a plinth, and sold to the highest bidder. That is the sorry spectacle on show at most art fairs today, in which prestige attaches not to the experience of beauty, nor to public discourse about it, but merely to the acquisition of expensive trophies.So while calling for the end of art can sound like a mantra for hare-brained radicals or philosophers and obscurantists, believing in its possibility can help us see the world anew, and puts us in distinguished company. We tell ourselves that an everyday experience, no matter how odd and arresting, can never be the highest art – but André Breton thought it could. We tell ourselves that the colours we paint on walls at home can never be art, no matter how much pleasure they give us – but Piet Mondrian thought they could. Instead, we accept defeat, and tell ourselves that art is something that only someone else has the privilege to own. Keep the creativity; these are the attitudes we ought to abolish.How to Be Avant-Garde by Morgan Falconer (Sotheby’s Institute of Art) (WW Norton & Co, £25).

Testing mattresses is more like weight-lifting hippos. Manoeuvring these floppy giants around a small house would be hard enough for a normal person, but as a 53-year-old woman who never reached five feet tall, I wouldn’t be anyone’s first pick for a mattress-lifting team.The Filter’s invitation to involve my extended family intestingthebest mattressesdelighted me because it meant they could do the lifting. They joined my husband, Alan, and our cat, Iggy, who favoured theSimba Hybrid Profor radiator-adjacent spread-eagling and theIkea Valevågfor claw sharpening.Before any testing could commence, Alan and I discovered that removing these beasts from their giant condom-like sheaths is part precision surgery, part gladiatorial warfare. Bed-in-a-box mattresses commonly weigh more than 50kg and come vacuum-packed so tightly that you have to be careful not to get knocked out when you cut the wrapping. None of the mattresses were wrapped in anything approaching sustainable, and if I’m ever sent one that doesn’t come with a hatchback’s worth of plastic, it’ll receive serious review kudos.Having a houseful of mattresses expanding to full size and giving off a weird chemical smell (normal and temporary, but not pleasant) felt like what I imagine living with toddlers to be like. The same goes for the relief of off-loading them on to relatives. My family offered some disappointing feedback at first, with my dad and sister initially resistant to switching from pocket-sprung mattresses to spongy foam. Reports soon eased into broadly positive and occasionally ecstatic, punctured by moans about the “pointlessly massive”Origin Hybrid Pro, which was too deep for a standard fitted sheet, and the magic staining powers of the Valevåg. “It gets dirty if you just look at it,” said my niece, 22, although it should be noted that she lives in a student flat.Measuring sleepView image in fullscreenEach mattress was donated after testing was complete.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianWhat I really wanted from them was detailed feedback on how well they slept, although I worried that even the richest grumbling would be too subjective to be useful. I was reassured by a chat with sleep expert Kevin Morgan, emeritus professor of psychology at Loughborough University. “Asking people, ‘How would you rate the quality of your sleep last night?’ using a 10-point scale is standard practice in research,” he told me. “Insomnia is diagnosed exclusively on subjective experience of sleep.”Even so, I ran some lab-style tests for a more objective comparison. Careful use of Alan’s bottom and other kit tomeasure key factors, such as sinkage and motion isolation, delivered some surprising and messy results. The budgetIkea Valevågromped to glory in the heat-retention test, which required Alan to sit on a pre-heated spot (for ages while reading Moby-Dick, which did not help the time pass any faster). It bombed in the motion-isolation test, however, bouncing enough to topple a glass of water as Alan turned over.Alas, poor Valevåg. Claw marks, spillage, dirt and a student flat. Despite this onslaught (and after a good clean), it made its way to a gentler home via a local charity, but it took some persuading. Donating mattresses, even nearly new ones, is a hit-and-miss affair because they have to be pristine. For my next batch of mattress tests, I will invest heavily in cat-proof mattress protectors.This week’s picksThe best air fryers, tried and tested for crisp and crunch‘Hands down my favourite bit of kit’: 13 kitchen gadgets top chefs can’t live withoutThe best head torches: six tried-and-tested favourites for running, hiking and campingFrom resistance bands to squat-proof leggings: the pilates kit you need – and what you can do withoutWhich brand makes the best plant milk?

Traditionally, a comedian deftly – sometimes remorselessly – responds to uncivil hecklers. By contrast, a news organisation falls over itself to confess blame: witness a crossword editor’s sackcloth and ashes whenever an aubergine is defined as a vegetable.This is not the whole picture: standup Dave Gorman,who sets here as Fed, says the heckler as commonly understood is “a bit of a myth really”. Sometimes, a loose cannon at even the self-flagellating BBC will respond directly – I’m thinking of the early days of accountability blogging, whenEddie Mair repliedto an entry in the broadcaster’s Listener Log: “You could try listening properly, you cloth-eared buffoon.”What about crossword setters? They’re not a boisterous bunch; they’re also the kind of people who create intricate constructions solely to make others happy. When they come across a complaint that’s not entirely valid, they tend to offer thanks for the feedback, or wonder whether the furious commenter has a point, or save their actual feelings for private conversation.View image in fullscreenSpot the difference with the image above.Photograph: Dave Gorman/U&DaveSo it’s an exhilarating change of pace to watch the same Dave Gorman/Fedon free-to-view channel U&Davetake a commenter’s series of complaints so seriously that it, like the audience, joyously collapses – and all with Gorman’s characteristic cheery goodwill. And he tells us that audience members have been in touch to say that they have since entered the apparently arcane world of cryptics because “the discovery that it’s also about pop stars, football and poo makes them think it might be more approachable”.Meanwhile, inour cluing conference for BACKWARD, the audacity award is shared by Wellywearer2’s “Sense makes this how?” and Croquem’s “Hesitant at first because Alan Connor knows we are really dim”.

Mass-produced fake fur is often plastic-based, and its critics argue that even if made from recycled plastic, a fake fur coat is not sustainable – a plastic bottle can be recycled many times, whereas once converted into a coat, the plastic is destined for landfill.View image in fullscreenModel on the runway at the Balenciaga show in Paris on Sunday.Photograph: WWD/Getty ImagesThen there is the vibe-shift. Quiet luxury is out, and “boom boom” is in. Boom boom means gold and greed, visible hierarchy, the return of masculine and feminine as stay-in-your-lane aesthetics. A mink coat is as “boom boom” as it gets. And while real furs have all but disappeared from most shopfloors in the past decade, they are easy to find in vintage stores – which have become aspirational shopping destinations for many younger style consumers.Another through line ofParisfashion week has been an about-turn from stadium-scale catwalk spectaculars to intimate shows in smaller rooms with fewer guests, to emphasise an up-close-and-personal reveal of the clothes.AtBalenciaga, the catwalk was whittled to the width of a pavement flanked with simple black office chairs. There was no seating plan – a mind-bendingly radical twist at the shows, where hierarchy is observed with courtly precision. “I wanted proximity to the clothes, because fashion should feel urgent,” the designer Demna said backstage after the show. This desire for intimacy echoed Friday’s debut at Givenchy by the British designer Sarah Burton, where the designer limited the guest list to 300 and narrowed the catwalk to a width which she said was based on “how close can we get without being caught on a handbag?”Similarly, at Schiaparelli, models were spritzed with fragrance before they stepped on to the runway, to emphasise how close they should be to the audience.At Balenciaga, the first three models were dressed in simple black business trouser suits with no discernible gimmicks. They wore glasses and carried briefcases, and their suits had tiny nicks in the fabric, or creases at the back from being sat on. A man in a cotton polo shirt wore a bike helmet, like a courier just stepped off a bike, a woman in a party dress had her phone in her hand.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fashion is about right now, fashion is about what people wear,” Demna told a scrum of reporters after the show, before his democratic debrief was paused for an interruption by the French actor Isabelle Huppert, the crowd parting for her to give him a post-show kiss. At Paris fashion week, iconoclasm knows its bounds.Intimacy took a different form at Valentino, where the designer Alessandro Michele created a set based on nightclub toilets, complete with strip lighting and stainless steel soap dispensers, with each model making their entrance from behind a cubicle door.“A lot of disclosure and intimacy happens in this place, in the toilets of a club, in front of those mirrors,” Michele said after the show. The look was Chappell Roan goes to Glyndebourne: grand-soiree glamour, but with thrift-store tastes and a wink to kink.Explore more on these topicsSustainable fashionFashion weeksFashion industryParisParis fashion weekFranceBalenciaganewsShareReuse this content"

I tried everything from CBT to mindfulness, until one day something finally shiftedAmmar KaliaMon 10 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTShareIused to think I was great at therapy. From 17 to 23, I saw a total of four therapists for anywhere between two weeks and three months. Each time, I would sit in their quiet, softly furnished rooms and reel off the story of why I was there: my mum had been diagnosed with terminal cancer when I was 15 and given six months to live. She survived, but I continued to live in fear as she relapsed, then went into remission and finally died four years later. I gave them the narrative, talked about how my relationships or work were adding to my stress, then took on their tips, fromcognitive behavioural therapytomindfulness.I was a conscientious student, eager to implement their advice so I could continue coping. Once my allotted number of sessions was up, I would leave, knowing that if things began to feel stressful again, I could return and pick up new strategies. Therapy was a tool and I felt confident using it.Except, at 23, things fell apart. I was unemployed and living at home with my dad, applying for jobs and constantly being reminded of my mum’s absence. I was running away from romantic relationships and feeling a rising sense of dread at the state of my life. Depression set in and the future seemed pointless.View image in fullscreen‘Life wasn’t panning out the way I thought it might’ … Ammar Kalia in 2018.Photograph: HandoutAs my mental health deteriorated, I realised I needed to return to therapy, but the NHS waiting times were too long and I could no longer rely on university services for free sessions. I began searching privately. I ventured to one session where the therapist stared at me silently for 50 minutes as I cried and then charged me £80 for the pleasure. After a few months, though, I found another professional, with a similar Asian background to mine and a wealth of qualifications.At our first session, rather than telling my story, we spoke about my day and how I was feeling in the moment. I left feeling strange about having paid for, essentially, a chat. Still, I went back the next week and this time discussed my mum and my living situation, about the pressures and expectations I placed on myself and how life wasn’t panning out the way I thought it might.‘Be picky’: how to start therapyRead moreI wasn’t leaving with much practical information, but after each session, I felt lighter, even if the ground we covered was unexpectedly difficult. As the weeks turned into months and then a year, I began to feel a shift within myself. Having a structured space in which to engage with my feelings was allowing me to confront the deeper issues in my life. I realised that relationships had become difficult because I wasn’t able to be vulnerable with others; I had been overwhelmed by depression because I wasn’t allowing myself to experience difficult feelings.I have been seeing that therapist for seven years. Committing to that space where I can self-reflect and be challenged has been transformative. Life’s challenges and the pain of my mum’s death are still with me, but I am also excited about my future. I am sure I will stop therapy eventually, but when I do, I will continue not simply to cope but to live, however uncertain a process that might be.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But many cat and dog owners struggle to copeSarah Ann HarrisMon 10 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 06.03 EDTShareAs I sat on the sofa with my sister, my gorgeous and affectionate new cat ambled between us, purring. That’s when I finally had a meltdown. Weeks of anxiety had come to a head and, exhausted, I told her I was considering whether I should give my new housemate back.Leo wasn’t the problem. With just three legs but a huge heart, he was the ideal pet for me. He was a little nervous, often hiding under the bed, but he was incredibly sweet-natured. This had not been a rash decision either. I had spent a long time thinking through all the ramifications and responsibilities of owning a pet, and felt well prepared.So why was I feeling so hideously anxious?Rachel Meier, from Canterbury, had a similar experience when she got her two cats and found herself “terrified”. “It was exhausting. I don’t think I realised until they were a bit older how tiring and stressful it had been,” she says.Willow Gelphman, who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, also struggled when she brought home her cat, Mew. “She would cry constantly and run laps around the apartment until she was panting,” she recalls. “This is normal, of course, for new cats, but my anxious brain was convinced that I was doing something wrong, that she hated me (even though she was still affectionate) and that my life would be forever constrained by her needs.”View image in fullscreenWillow Gelphman with Mew.Photograph: Supplied imageI spent the first few weeks of cat ownership in tears almost every day, dreading Leo’s little squeaks every time I left the house. Why did I feel as if there was a huge weight pressing down on my chest? Why was I obsessed with the idea I was a terrible owner, not giving this beautiful little creature the love he deserved?Alice Snape, from London, describes bringing her pet, a nervous rescue dog called Lucy, home as “one of the most overwhelming experiences of my life”.“I kept thinking, no, no, no, I don’t think I can do this. At home, I was overly aware of every single thing she did. I couldn’t relax. We were both so wary of each other. Sudden sounds or movements would startle her. And she wouldn’t even sleep on the bed we’d bought for her.”At times, her feelings were “so intense and overwhelming that I couldn’t see any way out. I imagined having to live this way for ever, with a creature I couldn’t understand.”I couldn’t understand why I was floundering after taking on Leo – I had been through some intensely difficult experiences without feeling this way. But, it turns out there are several reasons that the arrival of a pet might provoke feelings of anxiety. “A new pet means new responsibility,” says Heidi Soholt, a therapist and member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy. “They will be dependent on you for food, medical care, cleanliness and safety. It is natural that this would trigger some anxiety, however longed-for the pet may be. Anxiety is often linked to a fear of not being able to cope and making mistakes that you may go on to regret.”“Human brains like to feel in control,” she adds. “This stems from ancient times when humans lived in circumstances where they needed to defend themselves from dangers such as animals who preyed on them. The reptilian, ancient part of our brains hasn’t really caught up with evolution, and will often sound an alarm when we contemplate entering new territory, such as becoming a pet owner.”Just knowing that could take a weight off your mind. “Remember that anxiety shows you care, that you are taking this decision responsibly,” Soholt advises. “Remind yourself your anxiety is showing up because you are going through a change, not because you have made a mistake. Think about other times in your life when you have gone through changes – anxiety tends to settle once we get used to new circumstances.”This is especially the case with dogs: “The ‘puppy blues’ is a well-known phenomenon that can set in after your dog joins your home. Try to remember that this doesn’t mean you are in any way a ‘bad’ owner, that it is temporary, and that your dog and family will settle in together given time. Hold on to the positives of having your pet, and the reasons you wanted them in the first place. Allow space and tolerance for mistakes – it’s a learning curve. Don’t expect perfection from yourself or your pet.”View image in fullscreenAlice Snape with Lucy.Photograph: James StittleThis is the advice I wish I’d had. Finally opening up to my sister that day on the sofa was a turning point. I stopped feeling embarrassed or afraid someone would accuse me of being a terrible owner, and was able to be truthful when friends asked how I was getting on. A few weeks of honesty, as Leo and I got to know each other, and things began to improve.Meier also found that with time things got better: “I think it’s easy for people to focus on the cute fluffy thing and forget about the hard bits, so being able to talk about it is really important. So many people suggest that pets help with mental health issues, and they really do, but they can also add to pre-existing anxieties and worries. Being aware of that can really help.”Now Leo and I are inseparable. Those horrible feelings are long gone, and nothing relaxes me quite like a cuddle with him. I’m so grateful I pushed through those tricky first months, and I can’t imagine life without him. And this is the case with all the other pet owners I spoke to.“There will come a point where you fall madly in love with your dog,” says Snape. “It might take time, but it will happen. You need patience with yourself and with them. Try and look at the world through their eyes, too. Don’t just expect them to slot into your life. You need to get to know them, learn their personality, their quirks, what they like and they don’t.“Now I can’t imagine my life without Lucy. She jumps in bed in the morning for a cuddle and I can’t believe how much I love her smell. And I am always up early. I have a cup of coffee and then head out for a walk and it’s my favourite part of the day – just me and Lucy on an adventure.”Explore more on these topicsPetsHealth & wellbeingMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The ongoing saga of readers haunted by the utilities sectorAnna TimsMon 10 Mar 2025 04.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 14.24 EDTShareBelieve me, I would love to write a drama aboutsomething other than the energy bills of strangers, but try as I might to find new inspiration, nothing creates tension, plot twists and psychodrama like the utilities sector. So here we go again …Act IThe scene is London, whereAHhas discovered that his spending power is spent. His credit rating has plummeted by two-thirds and his credit card limit slashed to £150. With a reputation like that, he’s unlikely to get the mortgage he plans to apply for. The culprit, it turns out, is British Gas, his old and unlamented supplier, which has invented a missed payment on his credit record.The story begins in 2023 when his account is one ofan unknown number to be screwedwhen British Gas migrated it to its new ­billing system. The new account on the new platform showed an inaccurately low balance, so AH unwittingly fell into arrears. By the time British Gas got round to noticing the shortfall and informed him that his direct debits needed to rise by 100%, he owed £1,500. That was last April. AH promptly transferred to another supplier and, in the meantime, agreed a monthly payment plan with British Gas to make up the shortfall.AH’s bank statements show that his payments have not once faltered, but British Gas suddenly decide he’s missed one and record a default on his credit record. When he complains, British Gas initially professes to be as baffled as he is since it can see the incoming payments, then claims it has received no payments at all and that he is hundreds of pounds in arrears.So a monthly payment plan set up because of the incompetence of British Gas has trashed his creditworthiness because of the incompetence of British Gas – and thus matters might still have stood had I not asked the company what it was playing at. It has nothing to say about the cause of its blunderings, but glibly it declares that it has now applied all AH’s payments to the account and ­rectified the erroneous default notice. To acknowledge the weeks of stress and hardship, British Gas has dug into its coffers and produced £50 in “goodwill”.Act IIThere’s consternation in Selsey, West Sussex.AN’s father is ­receiving electricity bills from Ovo. He is not, and never has been, an Ovo ­customer. The bills are in his name, but the supply address is an empty flat in a neighbouring block. The tenants, it seems, have done a runner without settling their dues and Ovo has decided that since someone must pay, it may as well be AN’s father. He successfully persuades Ovo that he has never set foot in the place and his name is removed from the account. To be replaced by AN’s.AN lives in her parents’ house and this time the address on the bills is her family home. Ovo is not interested in the fact that the house is supplied by British Gas, nor that the debt they are chasing was accrued at an address next door. AN therefore faces a vandalised credit rating through no fault of her own.Happily, a pending headline bestirs Ovo. It claims its tracing agent matched AN’s father to the debtor’s address and blames the flat numbers in the block for being potentially out of sync with Royal Mail’s property database. AN’s ­family does not live in a flat in the block. Their names have now been removed from the account and they’ve been sent a food hamper for the “inconvenience”.If you thought energy firm horror stories were frightening – wait until you hear about the insurersRead moreAct IIIThe scene shifts along the coast to Brighton. Here lives a woman who is desperate to pay for her energy but can’t interest her supplier in her cash. Because she hasn’t received any bills for over seven months and therefore hasn’t settled her unspecified debts, she’s unable to escape to a more proactive provider.The saga began with a smart meter, those ingenious devices designed to make our bills more accurate and our lives easier.RM’s smart meter was installed by EDF last June but the technician failed to link it to the network. Its clever screen has therefore remained blank ever since and it’s unable to produce manual readings. EDF has ignored her pleas for estimated bills and ignored an ombudsman’s decision in November that the meter should be commissioned. Regulations require suppliers to address faulty meters within five working days and RM fears being clouted with a cobbled bill for over seven months’ worth of consumption.EDF tells me it hasn’t ignored the ombudsman’s decision three months ago to repair the meter; it’s just that installers are hard to come by. By sheer good luck it manages to secure one as soon as I question the delay. It has already credited RM the regulatory £180 compensation for delays plus an extra £100 in goodwill.Email your.problems@observer.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

This arid, golden landscape is home to many rare species of cacti, which attract professional and amateur botanists from around the world keen to make discoveries and experience the thrill of naming a new species.But they are not the only ones prowling the sands: Atacama has become a hotspot for succulent smuggling.The parallel market in plantsis growingand rare cacti are in high demand. It is a lucrative cross-border trade. Individual specimens – particularly those that are visually attractive or interesting – can sell for tens of thousands of dollars.But the trade has a huge negative impact on biodiversity, and has become the frontier of a novel legal approach to conservation: suing criminals not just for smuggling but to restore the wider damage they have done to ecosystems.In February, Andrea Piombetti and Mattia Crescentini were found guilty of illegally importing and exporting cacti by the public prosecutor of Ancona in Italy. They were given suspended sentences of 18 months in prison and a €25,000 (£21,000) fine; and one year in prison and a €18,000 fine respectively.Their conviction followed alarge-scale investigationin 2020 – Operation Atacama – during which law enforcement agencies discovered cacti in theEriosyceandCopiapoagenera at a home in Ancona and traced them back to Chile. These endangered species are particularly sought after by collectors.View image in fullscreenItalian police with some of 1,035 cacti that were smuggled from Chile and seized during Operation Atacama in February and November 2020.Photograph: Andrea Cattabriga/IUCNThe two men had posted the cacti from Chile to contacts in Greece and Romania, who redirected packages to Italy. The intention was to sell the plants on to a network of buyers across Europe and Asia. They also illegally sold cacti directly to customers in the US and Japan.Piombetti alone had uprooted more than 900 cacti during repeated trips to the Atacama desert. Piombetti and Crescentini could not be contacted for comment.The difficulty is how to attach monetary value to a species? It should be proportional to the harm causedLovish Sharma, Wildlife Trust of IndiaThese activities are illegal under Italian laws that apply the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (Cites), which aims to ensure that no wild species “becomes or remains subject to unsustainable exploitation”. It lists rare succulents among the plants under its protection.Cactus expert Andrea Cattabriga, president of the Associazione per la Biodiversità e la sua Conservazione(ABC), says succulents in the Atacama desert are already under threat from the climate crises and mining, and poaching is exacerbating those problems.View image in fullscreenAndrea Cattabriga, president of the Association for Biodiversity and Conservation, tends to his homegrown rare cacti in San Lazzaro di Savena, Italy, June 2021.Photograph: Trisha Thomas/APAs well as harming particular species, the illegal trade in cacti damages the wider ecosystem, including the insects that rely on their flowers for nectar. “The collection of a few specimens can really affect the species that could face extinction,” says Cattabriga. “But each living form in the desert is important because it is a very selective environment where biodiversity is very complex.”Cattabriga helped investigators identify the species and get them sent safely back home to Chile.He then became involved in the legal case, entering a civil claim alongside the criminal one with the support of the NGOConservationLitigation. They argued that poaching and smuggling damaged ABC’s work in cacti conservation, making it harder to protect species in the wild and to promote sustainable legal production in nurseries. This is known in legal terms as “moral harm”.The court agreed, ordering the criminals to pay the organisation €20,000 (£16,000) to further its conservation work, as well as legal costs. Cattabriga said this would be used to fund cacti research projects, including some in Chile.View image in fullscreenACopiapoa cinerea ssp. columna albacactus in Pan de Azúcar national park in Chile’s Atacama desert.Photograph: Krystyna Szulecka/AlamyThe case, part of agrowing trend of biodiversity litigation, is one of the first successful claims of its kind. And conservationists around the world are hoping it will not be the last.‘It shouldn’t be that easy’: inside the illegal wildlife trade booming on social mediaRead moreBlair Atwebembeire, an environmental lawyer in Uganda, is exploring similar lawsuits linking environmental and wildlife laws, to try to tackle poaching of pangolins – themost trafficked animal in the world. “Any remedy that looks at a deeper solution that restores the environment is key … as opposed to only looking at one animal that has been killed or one tree that has been cut down.”Lovish Sharma, legal adviser to theWildlifeTrust of India and an advocate at the high court of Delhi,is trying to raise awareness of existing legal provisions in India that allow parties to seek compensation for damage done to the environment.He says there have been some successful cases involving wild boar and deer hunting, although compensation was low. “The difficulty is how to attach monetary value to a species? It should be proportional to the harm caused. We are developing scientific reports which would be tabled before the judicial officers at the time of conviction, so that they have a better understanding of how to compute the damage.”View image in fullscreenA forensics student at a fake rhino poaching scene at the Wildlife Forensic Academy in South Africa.

State troopers turned their truncheons on a peaceful march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge at the behest of Alabama’s stridently and infamously racist governor George Wallace, protecting Alabama segregation and white supremacy.John Lewis, then the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, later served in Congress – and as a moral force in American politics – for decades. He bore scars from the beating he took that day through the rest of his life.How should Americans meet today’s challenges to civil rights and democracy? That question percolates among the activists and visitors crowding Selma’s streets this weekend as the Trump administration wages an intense, wide-ranging war on America’s anti-discrimination policies.Bloody Sunday: restored photos show the violence that shocked a nationRead more“We have a tyrant that’s running the federal government,” said Delvone Michael, a political strategist from Maryland. Lewis would be going from campus to campus, mobilizing for a confrontation, he said. Michael described the moment as a stress test of American resolve that isn’t being met with sufficient opposition either in Congress or the street.“We don’t see the people that are actually standing up like what happened here, where everyday people stood together and raged against the machine,” Michael said. “You’re not seeing that right in this moment, at the scale necessary to stop this guy.”Progressive congressional leaders are hearing this criticism.“We’ve got to make sure that we’re not normalizing this moment and stepping up and being unafraid, and I think we are still here playing by the same book when they don’t follow one,” said Congresswoman Nikema Williams as she walked up the bridge on Sunday afternoon. Williams serves in the Atlanta house seat vacated by Lewis’s death in 2020.The moment today is designed to create chaos, she said. Activists say it should be answered with the kind of effort civil rights leaders of Lewis’s era presented in the face of strident, violent opposition, if the gains of that generation are to be maintained.“Don’t get me wrong, the last 70 years have not brought us where we should be, but the last 70 years made significant progress in this country, and we have been the beneficiaries,” said Marc Morial, former mayor of New Orleans and president of the National Urban League. “What falls to us is to ensure that our children and children’s children are not going to litigate the battles of our grandparents.”View image in fullscreenJohn Lewis is beaten by an Alabama state trooper on Bloody Sunday, 7 March 1965.Photograph: APThe election of Donald Trump has led the civil rights division of the justice department to end investigations of discrimination against racial minorities in cases like the “goon squad” assaults in Mississippi and the death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis. Trump fired two commissioners of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission – in violation of the law – and its acting chairman has pledged to root out “unlawful DEI-motivated race and sex discrimination” instead of its prior role protecting workers of color against race-based discrimination.“I got a lot of folks saying, what are we going to do?” Morial said. “And they almost are looking for a one-punch knockout. Isn’t that one lawsuit? Isn’t there one political move? This is a long trench warfare.”The US supreme court last year established a doctrine of absolute immunity for acts committed by a president “within their core constitutional purview”, and at least presumptive immunity for official acts within the outer perimeter of their official responsibility. The 6-3 ruling creates a predictable flash point in the conflict between an authoritarian government and American civil rights: a moment when Trump faces a court decision he doesn’t like.“We’re going to fight in the courts wherever we can, and it’s not going to be enough,” said Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center. “We’re actually going to have to mobilize people around the country. There are a lot of people who are upset right now, but they’re not standing up, they’re not seeing themselves as protagonists of this story.”Caleb Jakes, 20, of Newark, described generational despair.“Too many of us are stuck between fear and anxiety,” he said of other Black twentysomethings looking at the world on fire. “So many of us are paralyzed just from imagining that even if I went for it, it’s not going to happen … The regular way of trying to get the system to work in my favor just aren’t appealing enough any more to merit the effort to stay after it.”People under 20 have known nothing except losses – economic crisis, civil rights rollbacks and political turmoil, added Donneio Perryman, 20, from Chicago. “Most of us, if we are not stricken by poverty and trying to get out, are just trying to make a way for ourselves and our families right now as our main goals and not the entirety of our race.”Activists regularly suggest that Trump may be looking for a rationale to invoke the Insurrection Act, declare martial law and turn troops or police on protesters, tempering their enthusiasm for mass demonstrations.“There are some of us who are going to be willing to bleed,” Huang said. “Not everybody has to. We are not asking everyone to lay down their lives, but we are saying to everyone that this is your fight, and you have to be counted when the chips are down.”Sixty years ago, demonstrations that led to conflicts also led to progress.“We went where we were called,” said Andrew Young, former ambassador to the United Nations and a contemporary of Martin Luther King and Lewis who marched in Selma in 1965. “Amelia Boynton came to see Dr King just before that Christmas, and she told him that Jim Clark would not let them hold meetings in their churches because he said they were too political.”View image in fullscreenPeople march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.Photograph: Alyssa Pointer/ReutersBoynton was a young Selma activist who organized the march from Selma to Montgomery after an Alabama state trooper killed Jimmie Lee Jackson while he tried to protect his mother from being beaten after an earlier protest. Selma was considered beyond salvation by civil rights activists at the time, but Jackson’s murder and Boynton’s plea drew marchers.King told Young not to go, Young said.“We thought they would just turn us around,” Young said of the state troopers. “They didn’t even give them time to pray, or to discuss anything. They just immediately charged.”The beatings on the Edmund Pettus Bridge shocked the nation. Pictures of Lewis on the ground with a trooper looming over him, or of Boynton lying broken in the street amid teargas and horses, ran on the front page of newspapers across the country. ABC News interrupted a documentary about Nazi war crimes as the attack unfolded, cutting to show the violence live in Selma.The metaphor was not lost on the public or lawmakers. Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1965 five months later.What is the next Selma?“I don’t know. And I shouldn’t know,” Young replied. “I mean, there’s nothing, yet I see all the signs. I see the things that people are saying.”The streets of Selma fill with marchers every year on this Sunday in March, commemorating the events of 1965. This year has drawn an unusually large crowd. Hotel rooms are full for 30 miles in every direction.Selma itself is caught in amber. Like many towns in Alabama’s Black belt, Selma has been losing population for decades. Many buildings downtown are a ruin, pock-marked by damage from a tornado in 2023 and unchanged since Bloody Sunday. The march has become a carefully stage-managed parade, with politicians jockeying with the scions of the movement for position at the front of the procession where they can be seen by throngs of photographers from across the country.The march was scheduled in waves, with thousands of people grouped in time slots by the hour for their chance to walk and be seen.“I think part of the reason that so many of us came to Selma is because we really draw inspiration in people who had no reason really to believe that they could get freedom,” said Jocelyn Frye, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families. “They were facing what may have looked like an all-powerful force, but they had a faith and desire to work for something bigger and better, and I think we’re here because we have that same spirit.”The memorial of Bloody Sunday gives the city an economic boost, but after the crowds leave, little changes, said Gary Ransom, a Selma photographer pushing for redevelopment.“We’ve always been in the spotlight because of all the historic things that happened here,” Ransom said. But between the hurricane and a growing gun violence problem, Selma has been bleeding population, “because the kids don’t have nowhere to go or nothing to do”.For Bernard Lafayette, a civil rights leader and attorney who marched in Selma on Bloody Sunday, the answer is to build a Black economic fortress that can withstand attack.“We’re still commemorating Bloody Sunday 60 years later,” he said. “It’s time to make a paradigm shift.” Lafayette has been raising capital to build a factory to manufacture solar panels in Selma. Asked what a 20-year-old activist like Lewis might be expected to do today, Layfayette’s answer was blunt.“They should be saying, ‘To hell with them and focus on manufacturing,” Lafayette said. “Focus on our resources. Focus on the $2tn per year that we generate. White folks are never going to help us. They enslaved us. We have to come to our own rescue. We have to save ourselves, and we can only do that by using our resources for our people.”Explore more on these topicsAlabamaThe fight for democracyRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

There were also the words to the songs, portraying an idyllic Alpine life surrounded by pristine nature and overseen by a benevolent God, the men in charge and the women presented either as naive girls, self-sacrificing mothers or nagging wives. Kaiser couldn’t get past them: “The beautiful melodies with these completely outdated lyrics.”So, in 2022, she founded Switzerland’s first feminist yodelling choir, and Echo vom Eierstock (“echo from the ovary”) has been rewriting traditional yodelling songs and dragging the Alpine folk music scene into the 21st century ever since.While they have no qualms about changing the words, they remain lovingly faithful to the musical tradition underpinning them. Yodelling is characterised by rapid changes in pitch, alternating between a low-pitched chest voice and a high-pitched head voice. While yodelling calls – such as the “Yodel-Ay-Ee-Oooo” that most people associate with the Swiss Alps – were probably used by cowherds over millennia to communicate from one hill to another and bring in the cows, theJodellieder,or yodelling songs, developed in the 19th century, combining verses with a yodel refrain.The yodelling choral tradition was formalised in 1910 with the founding of the Federal Yodelling Association and became closely enmeshed with the country’s “spiritual national defence”, a cultural movement that sought to strengthen Swiss values and traditions in the face of rising fascism inEurope– hence the insistence on promoting an idealised version of Swiss life.“We wanted to defend the country with our values, our traditions,” says Simone Felber, the choir’s musical director. “How do you do that? How do you reach people? With music, among other things.”View image in fullscreenSwiss farmers in traditional attire yodel before theAlpabfahrtcattle drive in Urnäsch, in the canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden.Photograph: Gian Ehrenzeller/EPA/ShutterstockToday, the association includes 780 regional yodelling clubs, with about 12,000 members in total, and keeps a tight rein on yodelling traditions. Though there are also mixed and women’s choirs, the scene is still overwhelmingly male, says Felber. “The association is also very closed – it’s difficult to get involved as an outsider.”While leading yodelling workshops across Switzerland, she noticed that many more women were interested in the practice than men, and when Kaiser reached out to her about the choir, she saw an opportunity to create a space where women of all backgrounds could yodel together regardless of skill level.While Echo vom Eierstock is the most prominent example of a sea change in the Swiss yodelling scene, it’s not the only one. Last year, the Jodlerklub Männertreu, the first yodelling choir for gay men, was founded with the slogan “Where gays jodeln”, and Dayana Pfammatter Gurten became the first Swiss person to complete a master’s in yodelling, marking the transformation of a diverse grassroots tradition into an academic subject.Felber herself, a classically trained mezzo-soprano who is exploring new possibilities within folk music through a number of progressive-minded ensembles, was honoured with a Swiss music prize in 2024, lauded for giving “a new voice to yodelling and Swiss singing culture”.Echo vom Eierstock’s runaway popularity means they have also had to become selective, capping membership at 50. “This goes a bit against my philosophy,” says Felber. “But at some point, you’re simply at capacity.”Carmen Bach, who moved to Switzerland from Germany in 2010, had long been interested in taking up yodelling, but as a woman and a German she felt out of place in the traditional scene. As soon as she heard of Echo vom Eierstock, she knew she had to try out. “I thought: ‘I can’t yodel that well and maybe I’m not enough of a feminist,’” she recalls. “But somehow I got in, and it’s fantastic.”The choir brings together a diverse group of women, ranging in age from mid-20s to others well into their 70s, with some driving from Zürich or Berne for weekly rehearsals in the small town of Stans. While the choir is invariably labelled as leftwing, Bach finds that absurd: “We never wrote down a political agenda and said: ‘OK, we’re going to fight for feminism now.’ We just do it by creating and singing together.”View image in fullscreenEcho vom Eierstock in performance.Photograph: Bernhard MatineeYet the lyrics, wrapped in four-part harmony and a soft Swiss dialect, send an unmistakably feminist message. In traditional yodelling songs, “women are made out to be sweet, small, helpless, and defenceless when a man comes to call”, says Felber. “Which we’re not, and it doesn’t correspond with our self-perception at all.”In the versions sung by the Eierstöcke (“ovaries”), as the choir members call themselves, a dance no longer automatically ends in marriage; the girl and boy in a love song become “me” and “you”, and instead of thanking God, another song thanks life itself. They sing about wearing short skirts and sometimes simply not giving a damn, and promise that “when [they] get paid too little again, [they] fight back and don’t stay silent”.In one traditional song, a girl asks her mother: “Is dancing a great sin? Look, Franz is already waiting, may I go dancing with him?” and tells her later: “Don’t worry – I’m not going to be a nun; look at my curly hair! I saw how pretty I am in the mirror today.” In the version performed by Echo vom Eierstock, the conversation is a radically different one, with the girl asking: “Does the world need more children? Should we still be mothers in this day and age?” “The world is a gift,” her mother reassures her, but the daughter counters: “You don’t know in advance what kind of gift it is.”At first, the choir commissioned local songwriters to rewrite lyrics, but over time a songwriting group has formed within the choir that does a lot of the creative heavy lifting. “We started small and are figuring things out as we go along,” says Felber. “It’s an ongoing process, and an exciting one.”“It’s also what sets us apart from traditional choirs,” adds Kaiser. “We don’t say: ‘We’ve been around for a hundred years and we’ve always done it this way.’” Dissenting opinions and discussions are welcome, and in the end, matters are always settled with a democratic vote, says Kaiser: “After all, we’re in Switzerland.”Unsurprisingly, the choir caused quite an uproar at the beginning, and received its fair share of hate mail. But after the initial shock subsided, the response has been overwhelmingly positive, says Kaiser. They’ve performed at numerous local festivals and venues, and last year even in the parliament building in Berne on International Women’s Day. Their work has also kickstarted some overdue introspection in the yodelling scene. “I’ve had people tell me that they’re listening to the words they’re singing for the first time,” says Kaiser.At the heart of their work is a wish to make yodelling more accessible to everyone. A century after yodelling choirs were conscripted into promoting an idealised version of Swiss life, the traditions and customs associated with them are often seen as old-fashioned and reactionary. “Especially in times like these, I think it’s incredibly important to set a counterpoint to this and say: ‘You can yodel and you don’t have to be conservative,’” says Felber. “Everyone’s allowed to do it.”Explore more on these topicsSwitzerlandChoral musicEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wood is facing execution on 13 March for the 1987 murder of Fulton’s teenage daughter, Desiree Wheatley, along with five other girls and young women.“I promised Desi at her gravesite that I would find out who did this and make them pay,” Fulton told Wood’s lawyers that afternoon. Now, she was making plans to attend the execution. “I’ll feel like it’s a promise I kept to her.”Despite her vow, the mother agreed to listen. The lead attorney, Greg Wiercioch, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, told her that during his 16 years on the case, he’d come to believe Wood hadn’t killed her daughter or anyone else. He pointed out that DNA testing of a bloodstain on one of the other victims’ clothes had matched a different, unknown male, who could have also killed Fulton’s daughter.In the years since the DNA test, Wood, who is 67, has become one of the longest-serving death row prisoners in history. His lawyers have repeatedly asked state and federal courts to order testing of additional items, but multiple judges have declined, accusing them of simply trying to delay the execution. Wiercioch hoped Fulton might support more testing, even if it meant more waiting.For a moment, Fulton seemed open. “You don’t want to condemn a man to death if you’re not certain,” she told Wiercioch and Naomi Fenwick, an assistant federal public defender on the case.But when she spoke to the Marshall Project a few weeks later, she remained certain of Wood’s guilt. “I’m not going to fault them for doing their job,” she said of the lawyers. “But they’re just grasping at straws.”Two days later, Wiercioch filed a 371-page petition in state court making the case for Wood’s innocence.Defense lawyers regularly bring forth new arguments and evidence as execution dates loom. Prosecutors often say the defense is primarily doing this to delay justice. In the last few years,severalTexasprisonerswho maintained their innocence were granted last-minute stays of execution. But judges also frequently refuse to look at new evidence, appearing to accept the risk of executing an innocent person.Why do they accept that risk? And why does the system take decades to resolve disputes over the facts of murder cases, only to then appear so hasty?The answers are complex, but they circle around the fact that the death penalty cannot be undone, so judges tend to allow for more scrutiny. When the punishment is a prison term, it can be carried outduringappeals. But when the punishment is death, appeals become obstacles to the end of the process. Put another way, if Wood had been sentenced to life in prison, Fulton would not be waiting for his punishment to be carried out.View image in fullscreenThe execution chamber at the Washington state penitentiary, in Walla Walla, Washington, on 20 November 2008.Photograph: Ted S Warren/APThe US supreme courtabolished and then revived the death penalty in the 1970s. As death rows filled up in the 1980s, the few lawyers willing to defend these prisoners were overwhelmed with cases. So they triaged, focusing on people with imminent executions.This led prosecutors and judges to accuse them of fostering a circus-like atmosphere with last-minute appeals. In 1994, the supreme court justice Antonin Scaliaexcoriated the head of the Texas Resource Center, Mandy Welch, for filing petitions to the court in the final hours before executions. She said her office had just 18 lawyers working on 220 cases, and Texas had set 100 execution dates the year before. So they had to prioritize.Scalia’s response? “Try harder.”Around that time, victims’ families were mobilizing as a political force. In 1987, Fulton organized a protest to pressure El Paso police to solve the murders, and convinced county leaders to offer $25,000 in reward money. A Houston mother named Linda Kelley, whose two children had been killed in 1988, testified at the Texas legislature seven years later: “As families of victims, we can never find any closure … The man that murdered my children has not even been given an execution date,” she said.Numerous judgescited the importance of “finality” and “closure”as they rejected appeals from death row. State and federal lawmakers passed new laws to make it more difficult for prisoners to challenge their convictions, mostfamously the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. The law created tighter deadlines and more legal barriers for rounds of appeal after the first, whichraised the risk that an innocent person might be executed.And yet, ironically, the average amount of time from a death sentence to an execution more than tripled – from more than six years in 1984 to 22 years in 2019, according to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.“The law was meant to get rid of frivolous claims, but it ended up creating new litigation over whether claims could be made,” said Corinna Barrett Lain, a University of Richmond law professor and author of the new bookSecrets of the Killing State.At the same time, defense lawyers continued to triage. Wood was sentenced to death in 1992. As multiple lawyers examined his conviction, his case sat in state and federal courts on appeal for as long as four years at a time. Shortly before his original 2009 execution date, Wiercioch agreed to help him argue that he didn’t qualify for execution due to intellectual disability.They ultimately lost that argument, but not before a state court issued a stay to consider it, one day before Wood was scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection. Fulton, who had driven more than 700 miles (1,100km) to Huntsville to witness Wood’s execution, left disappointed. “I was so naive,” she told me. “We had to come home, and we kept waiting.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The state judge Bert Richardson ruled the new results “merely muddy the waters” and halted any further testing.Wiercioch then learned through his litigation that El Paso police had lost or destroyed some evidence. He also asserted that Richardson had a conflict of interest, having used his rulings against Wood in his election campaign. Federal and state courts dismissed this issue. (Richardson declined an interview.)Wiercioch maintains that he met his deadlines and raised issues as he learned about them, sometimes waiting until one legal questionwas resolved because it would shape how he argued the next one. He told me that if state prosecutors had agreed to DNA-test more items back in 2011, the litigation may have been resolved more quickly. But the Texas attorney general’s office – which did not respond to an email for this story – accused Wiercioch in court of raising claims one by one to deliberately slow the process down.View image in fullscreenA prison guard in Huntsville, Texas, on 22 January 2014.Photograph: Richard Carson/ReutersLast May, the Texas court of criminal appeals ruled against Wood’s request for more DNA testing. “The piecemeal litigation of claims in a death-penalty case is a classic sign of purposeful delay,” the presiding judge, Sharon Keller,wrote.In talking about delay, Keller was relying on language added by Texas lawmakers to state law in 2000. They had worried that drawn-out DNA testing might rob victims’ families of closure, according to interviews I conducted formy book on the Texas death penalty.After the denial, “I was suddenly terrified of an execution date set and not having any help at all,” said Wiercioch. So he asked lawyers from the federal public defender for the northern district of Texas to join the case, and a federal judge agreed to appoint them last June.Texas state judges are now considering the new petition from Wiercioch and the federal defenders, which includes some evidence they could not have discovered earlier: last September, a man named George Hall called Wiercioch and gave a detailed account of howtwo key witnesses had lied at Wood’s trial. He had waited more than three decades to come forward, afraid of retribution from the state.None of the lawyers’ discoveries prove Wood’s innocence definitively on their own. But they raise questions that a series of state and federal courts are now considering, with days until his scheduled execution.If a court stays Wood’s execution again, Fulton will have to keep waiting. Some scholars have argued that the death penalty,with its guaranteed appeals, forces victims’ families through emotional ups and downs they would not otherwise confront. But despite Fulton’s frustration with the process, she remains committed to witnessing Wood’s execution.“I think I’ll take a sigh and then my first full breath in 37 years,” she said. “I’m 72, but I’m not going anywhere until he’s gone.”This article was published in partnership with theMarshall Project,a non-profit news organization covering theUS criminal justice system.

Some of those survivors are launching one final push for recognition.‘There wasn’t enough about the horror’: Hiroshima survivors react to OppenheimerRead moreThe night before the air raid, Nishio, now 86, was looking forward to celebrating her sixth birthday the following day and to starting primary school. As she slept, the air raid sirens sounded. “My father told us to flee to the primary school in front of our house,” Nishio said.View image in fullscreenShizuko Nishio, 86, looks at a model of an incendiary bomb, the type used in the air raid on 10 March 1945.Photograph: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty ImagesThe school’s shelter was already packed, so Nishio and her mother moved to another school basement, leaving her cousin and a nurse behind. The following day, the cousin and nurse were among the charred remains of 200 people who had been “cooked alive” inside the first shelter as fires raged outside. Nishio was the only survivor in her kindergarten class of 20 children.The B-29s dumped cluster bombs with napalm specially designed with sticky oil to destroy traditional Japanese-style wood-and-paper homes in the crowdedShitamachidowntown neighbourhoods. The bombs destroyed 41 sq km (16 sq miles) of the Japanese capital, turning buildings into an inferno and leaving 1 million people homeless.Eclipsed by the tragedies visited onHiroshimaand Nagasaki in August the same year, the Tokyo firebombing has been relegated to the darkest recesses of Japan’s collective memory, and virtually ignored by successive governments.No one denies that the atomic bombings dramatically altered the course of the war. But the Tokyo firebombing, too, marked a sinister escalation in America’s attempt to finally break Japan’s resistance.View image in fullscreenJapanese Emperor Hirohito walks through the ruins of Tokyo in the later months of World war two.Photograph: Photo 12/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesAs a result, US Air Force General Curtis LeMay ordered low-altitude attacks using incendiaries that would raze entire cities to the ground.“By burning them down, you would kill workers or de-house them,” said Richard Overy, the author of Rain of Ruin: Tokyo, Hiroshima and the Surrender of Japan. “You would destroy small factories scattered around the domestic residential zones. And that this would contribute in some way to undermining the Japanese war economy.“There is no doubt that civilians were a deliberate target.”‘Our last chance’Yoshiaki Tanaka, a professor of ancient history at Senshu University in Tokyo, said many people who lived through the bombings still suffered flashbacks and survivor’s guilt.“Many still experience severe trauma,” says Tanaka, who has met more than 100 survivors over the past 10 years. “Some of them could not even bring themselves to talk about their experiences, so we suggested that they try drawing pictures, and through that some were able to open up.”There is no national memorial to the firebombing victims, and no official attempt has been made to establish an accurate death toll or to secure testimony from survivors. Those who lived through the bombings are not entitled to compensation from the government.View image in fullscreenBomb blast ruins after US Air Force raids on Asakusa in Tokyo in 1945.Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesSince the end of the war, Japanese governments have provided ¥60tn ($405bn) in financial support for military veterans and bereaved families, as well as medical support for survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But the civilian victims of the US firebombings of Tokyo and other cities have received nothing.Japanese courts rejected compensation demands of ¥11m ($74,300) each, arguing that citizens, having been mobilised as part of the war effort, were supposed to endure their suffering. In 2020, a group of MPs proposed a one-time payment of ¥500,000 but the plan was scuppered amid opposition from members of the ruling party.While Tokyo was home to numerous military installations, the bombing of the city’s eastern neighbourhoods, primarily Sumida ward, was indiscriminate. “The aim was to burn all of Sumida ward to the ground,” Tanaka says.View image in fullscreenA gas mask on display at the Center of the Tokyo Raids and War Damage to mark the 80th anniversary of the firebombings.Photograph: Richard A Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesTanaka believes that compensation and a public monument, along with the creation of archives of survivors’ testimony, would go some way towards healing the wounds inflicted eight decades ago, and serve as a warning about the horrors of war for future generations.“It is absolutely right that we honour the victims and survivors of the atomic bombings,” Tanaka said, “but we should also remember the Tokyo firebombing and look ahead to how we must never let something like that happen again.”Yumi Yoshida, whose parents and sister died in the bombing, is part of a group of survivors demanding that the government recognise their suffering and provide compensation. Given the advanced age of the survivors, and the long wait before the next major anniversary, Yoshida says: “This year will be our last chance.”Nishio went on to study public health and joined the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. But she was unable to talk about her experiences until after she had retired.Now, the war in Ukraine is again forcing her to recall the night of terror she experienced as a young child. “I was watching a television report about the situation in Ukraine, and there was a little girl crying in a shelter ... and I thought, ‘This is me.’”Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed reporting.This article was amended on 10 March 2025 to restore the first name of the author Richard Overy which was removed during the editing process.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificSecond world warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now he’s giving away more of his money to help 900 total strangers. Doesn’t he think he’s done enough?ByEmine SanerMon 10 Mar 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 08.45 EDTShareMichael Sheen walks into a post office in Port Talbot and asks to withdraw £100,000. “That would be nice,” says the young woman behind the till. Then it dawns on her that he’s not joking. “Can I do £100,000?” she asks her colleague. She cannot.“I loved that so much. She was really funny,” says Sheen. Filmed for a new Channel 4 documentary, Michael Sheen’s Secret Million Pound Giveaway, this was part of the actor’s two-year project to use £100,000 of his own money to buy £1m worth of debt, owed by about 900 people in southWales– and immediately cancel it.He doesn’t know who they are (data protection stopped that), but he hopes that the programme will alert those who hadn’t realised their debts had been cancelled (the people who might have been ignoring the scary letters that come through the door), as well as shine a light into the dark corners of high-cost credit, and what happens when debts are sold on to collectors.It feels more timely than ever, in a cost of living crisis where 20 million people are financially vulnerable – but this is an area Sheen, 56, has been working on since 2018, when he set up the End High Cost Credit Alliance. He became interested when he was still living in Los Angeles in 2016, and watchedJohn Oliver’s Last Week Tonight showspend about $60,000 to buy up $15m worth of medical debt and wipe it. Wondering if he could do something similar, he found it was harder in the UK, but by then he was hooked – appalled at the way the poorest people were forced to use high-interest credit that had become impossible to pay off. Or, worse, were turning to loan sharks.View image in fullscreenMichael Sheen talks with members of the community in Port Talbot for the Secret Million Pound Giveaway.Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones/Channel 4It’s not the jazziest of causes, Sheen agrees. There’s a bit in the show where he gathers people in a Port Talbot cafe and reveals the “heist”, as he calls it, trying to inject a bit of drama into a speech that also contains the phrases “the consumer credit industry” and “the Fair Banking Act”. But the issue affected him. “I think it’s like everything that I respond to,” he says when we meet in a studio where he’s doing the final bits of filming. “It’s that there’s just a basic unfairness.”In 2021, Sheendeclared himself a not-for-profit actor– a bit of a throwaway line, but one based on his conviction that he had a responsibility to put as much of his earnings as he could towards causes and projects. Much of that centres around his local community: in Port Talbot, where the last of the steelworks’ blast furnaces recently shut, people are struggling, and in south Wales, 30% of children live in poverty.Sheen traces his change in focus to a decade earlier, when hestaged his version of The Passion, the three-day epic, in Port Talbot. Working with 1,000 local people brought him into contact with many community organisations. “I was learning about what was going on that I was totally unaware of, growing up,” he says. (He was born in Newport but moved to Port Talbot with his family when he was eight.) He realised that it was “partly because you sort of didn’t want to know”.People who get into trouble with debt are maybe working two jobs ... they’re not going on extravagant holidaysIt was painful to learn, for instance, about the town’s young carers – children who were looking after ill or disabled parents – and to see that among the few bits of support available was a small organisation that took them bowling or to the cinema once a week. Another woman who had lost her son, a schoolfriend of Sheen’s, had set up a small grief counselling organisation to fill a gap. “And then, a couple of months later, I come back and the money’s gone, that’s cut. It started making me not only become aware of what people were doing, but also aware of how underfunded it was. And then it made me ask the question, ‘Well, why is that?’”He would like to be able to claim, he says with a smile, that the 1980s miners’ strike in Port Talbot when he was a teenager were his political awakening. But “I can barely remember it, because I was in my full obsession with acting and youth theatre. That’s all I thought about.” His mother was a secretary, and his father worked his way from the factory floor to middle management at the steelworks. “I always felt like we were doing all right, but in retrospect we were barely getting by.” Not that he gave it much thought, but he considered his family middle class – until he got to London, to study at Rada.Sheen’s 20s and 30s were about building his career: huge acclaim in the theatre, then in films such as Frost/Nixon. He became known for inhabiting diverse real-life characters, from Tony Blair, twice (in The Deal, then in the 2006 film The Queen), to Brian Clough (inThe Damned United in 2009). He was in a bit of a Hollywood bubble, living in Los Angeles where his daughter, from his former relationship with the actor Kate Beckinsale, was growing up. Then came The Passion, which brought him back in touch with his roots. Sheen was at a point where his career had brought him respect and a degree of wealth. “I wasn’t just desperately trying to get on and establish myself,” he says. “I was able to look out a bit more.”View image in fullscreenAs Brian Clough in The Damned United.Photograph: Laurie SparhamView image in fullscreenOn Port Talbot beach in The Passion.Photograph: Tim Ireland/PA WireThere were other flashpoints. Visiting a refugee camp with Unicef, he watched a hungry child pick grains of rice out of caked mud; feeling wretched, Sheen asked how soon he could get money from his bank account to that specific child, and was told it didn’t really work like that. It had a profound effect. “I remember making a kind of a deal with myself and saying …” His voice breaks and his eyes well up. “I’m not going to get money to that kid, but I could only not do that if I’m then going to do something else. Going, ‘Right, I can see that there’s a way of walking away from here, going home, back to your life, and no one’s going to blame you. But you’re not going to do that.’”Being wilfully blinkered wouldn’t necessarily have been the easy option. “I suppose that’s how you end up eating yourself from the inside. So no, I would say this is the easier thing.”When he moved back to Port Talbot, one of his projects was the 2019 Homeless World Cup; Sheen led Cardiff’s bid to host the annual tournament, bringing together 500 players from 50 countries, all of whom had experienced homelessness. When the funding fell through, he ended up selling his houses in Los Angeles and Wales to pay for it. “At first, I thought it was the end of everything. I mean, I had nothing left. Not just that, I was in massive debt – I’m still paying it off.” It was frightening he says; his partner, the actor Anna Lundberg, was pregnant with the first of their two daughters. She was on board, he says. “Anyone would have been in their rights to go, ‘Sorry, I didn’t sign up for this.’ It could have gone either way, but I’m very glad that it went the way it did. I just couldn’t have got through that without her.”He realised that, financially, everything he had built up had gone. “But there was something very liberating about that as well, but only because I realised that I had a support, a safety net.” He was in demand as an actor, with good earning power. And how much money did he really need anyway?Still, he would look at other actors who had had similar careers to him, “and I look at what they’ve got, and I haven’t got that. But I made a choice, and I’m very happy with the choice I made.” He survived losing his money. “I learned a lot from it – about myself and about what matters to me – and I learned that that’s not the end of the story. For me, it was sort of the beginning of the story.”There have been unexpected consequences. I wonder if living in Port Talbot rather than Hollywood, and not hoarding astronomical wealth, has helped Sheen’s work. Not to overstate his normality – he’s still feted, does glitzy events, and gets to work on big Amazon Prime shows such as the forthcoming final season of Good Omens – but surely hearing stories of people’s struggles, and seeing the very real effects of poverty in his community, must affect his work? It has, he says, “given me a different kind of emotional connection to what I do. I find myself more emotionally available in my work than I was maybe when I was younger. So, completely selfishly, it’s made me a better actor as well – but that wasn’t something that was conscious.”View image in fullscreenSheen at the Homeless World Cup in Cardiff, 2019.Photograph: Tracey Paddison/Rex/ShutterstockThe other effect, he says, is feeling less powerless. “I think one of the most destructive things about the way we live now is that we’re constantly surrounded by injustice or a sense of things that are not right, and yet feeling like we can’t do anything about it. I’ve learned that by engaging in whatever way it is, it at least allows you to feel like you’re doing something.”It highlighted to Sheen that because he had the potential to earn a lot, his debt came with manageable interest rates – something that wasn’t available to friends and family struggling with high-cost loans and credit. In the documentary, he meets a woman who runs a community gym and had used a credit card to cover basic needs, but the interest meant she could barely make a dent in the repayments. Sheen hopes the film will break down some of the myths, “that somehow, with people who get into trouble with debt, it’s because they’re making extravagant choices that they can’t afford. By talking to people who are working, maybe working two jobs – these are people who are incredibly resourceful, incredibly resilient. They’re not going on extravagant holidays or anything like that. It’s just basic.”“The system doesn’t work any more,” he says. “But people find it easier to imagine the end of the world than something that’s a credible alternative to capitalism. I think people really feel there’s something intrinsically wrong and flawed with the system, and recognise that it needs radical change, but the only people who are offering radical change are people who are dangerous. And there’s no good end to that.”He knows his “heist” is attention-grabbing, “and also hopefully helps the 900 or however many people that we’ve actually been able to get rid of some of the debt. But it’s also about: how do you create change and do something that can help thousands or millions of people?” The Fair Banking Act is one solution, which would essentially encourage banks to offer affordable credit to people previously excluded based on their income, background or where they live.Putting up his own money, Sheen says, is important. “It shows that you’re serious about what you’re doing, but it also encourages other people to take that step.” It’s the same, he says, when it comes to being so public about it. “I’ve heard people say, ‘He can’t be that selfless, because he’s letting everyone know he’s doing it.’ That’s something I had to think about, and I made a conscious choice.” He knows he can offer his profile and cash, bringing attention to issues. “I never feel like it’s about me – mainly it’s about working with other people or highlighting what they do. I’m not doing it because I want people to think I’m great; I want us to be able to imagine an alternative to this, because this doesn’t work.“And in my own little way, I’m trying to create my own alternative. It doesn’t have to be the way it is.”Michael Sheen’s Secret Million Pound Giveaway is available to watch and stream on Channel 4 from 9pm on 10 March.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He hired a company called Imperial after being impressed by the professionalism of the agent, Shan Miah.But, Kinda tellsHelen Pidd, her father became seriously ill with Covid and almost died, and when he came out of hospital it was to find his wife had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, meaning he suddenly needed to pay for her care. He then discovered that during this time the rent for his property had suddenly stopped.The family made phone call after phone call to Imperial asking for his rent. Finally, Hajaj’s son went to the property, to find a steel door had been put on it. He could hear fans whirring – their father’s rented-out home had been turned into a cannabis farm. ‘Every single room in that house had been destroyed with cannabis plants venting,’ says Kinda, ‘and we also found a man living in a very small room in the loft of the property.’The police arrested the man but did not investigate further. So Kinda got in touch with Guardian feature writer Sirin Kale, who soon discovered that Imperial was not a legitimate company and had destroyed the properties of many other landlords.But who was behind it – and how widespread is this kind of scam?Composite: Guardian Design;  Johny87; Creative-Family; Peter Dazeley/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsCannabisToday in FocusRenting propertyLondonEnglandDrugs"

Unless the international community moves rapidly towards developing and implementing a new control regime, we are highly likely to see more examples of the killing of civilians from the use of armed drones,” said Morris.So far, the use of armed drones has been confirmed in at least six conflicts in Africa: Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria, Mali,Burkina Fasoand Ethiopia, where most attacks were seen.Drone strikes by theEthiopian armed forcesagainst adversaries such as the Tigray People’s Liberation Front were found to have killed more than 490 civilians in 26 separate attacks.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Amhara Association protest in London against what they describe as genocide in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, 10 November 2024.Photograph: Zuma Press, Inc./AlamyElsewhere, at least 64 civilians died in nine separate drone strikes conducted by Malian armed forces battling separatist groups in the north of the country. In neighbouring Burkina Faso, researchers found more than 100 civilians have been killed in drone strikes carried out by the country’s military.The Drone Wars UK report said the failure to control the proliferation of armed drones in Africa had led to more than 940 civilians being killed since November 2021, a figure it described as conservative.The world’s most ignored displacement crisis: Burkina Faso – in picturesRead moreMost armed drones in Africa are imported from Turkey, along with China and Iran, with researchers sounding the alarm over the growing popularity of “medium altitude, long endurance”(MALE)drones.These can be flown remotely for many hours over a large distance, conducting surveillance as well as airstrikes.The proliferation – and risks – of armed drones in African conflicts has been witnessed in Sudan’scivil warwith their use in highly populated areassuch as markets in the capital, Khartoum,having “grave” consequences for civilians. Iranian, Chinese and Turkish drones have been deployed by the Sudanese military while its adversary – the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – has used UAE-supplied drones, the report said.View image in fullscreenPeople run after hearing an explosion, reportedly from a crashed drone, in the city of al-Qadarif in east Sudan on 11 July 2024.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesIn Burkina Faso, Bayraktar TB2s have been deployed by Burkinabè military forces in their struggle against a jihadist insurgency. State-sponsored media regularly celebrated “neutralisations” of terrorists using what it described as sophisticated, precise drone technologies.However, accounts from sources on the ground often yield a different narrative, pointing to frequently high civilian deaths. One incident in the country’s Sahel region in August 2023, saw drones strike a market in the village of Bouro,killing at least 28 civilians.The report said: “The Burkinabè government’s wholesale celebration of strikes like that on Bouro’s market rests upon a perception of drone warfare as an efficient, advanced development in the country’s military operations, signifying a technically sophisticated arsenal operated by a vigilant, effective government with a firm grip on its territories.“However, on-the-ground research quickly reveals the falsity of this picture: exposing erratic bombings of innocent communities, which sow only further destruction and insecurity.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentDrones (military)Conflict and armsAfricaEthiopiaMaliSudannewsShareReuse this content"

It later emerged that hundreds of female inmates had been attacked in their wing andraped and burned alive.Bukavu hospital patients tell of being shot in chaos of Congolese withdrawalRead moreMore escapes – in Bukavu, Kabare and Kalemie central prison – took place subsequently, with the most recent, at Kalemie, on 19 February.The inmates had been convicted of crimes including rape, murder, participation in insurrection movements, embezzlement and public order offences.A Bukavu-based security analyst who requested anonymity said the escaped prisoners may try to settle scores with their victims. “Some people who are detained harbour a mortal grudge against those who arrested them or accused them. When they manage to get out of prison, they go off to seek revenge. This is a danger,” he said.An escaper from the Goma prison who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity said disorder at the facility started at midnight and he had to jump out of a window to escape, stepping on corpses as he made his way out.“Even though the police were killing some of the escapers outside the prison, I told myself that human beings only die once. That’s when I threw myself out of the window and fell out of the back of the prison,” said the escaper, who had been serving a 10-year sentence.In Goma and Bukavu, people reported seeing escaped inmates committing crimes. Patient Bisimwa, a resident of Bukavu, said: “I saw a group of prisoners with dirty firearms in my avenue. They had even looted an electronics repair shop close to my house.”He added: “Crime has reached a worrying level in some parts of Bukavu and some escapers are at the root of all this, and that worries us.”Police stations run by Congo’s national police service in Goma and Bukavu stopped operating after the capture of the cities.Alliance Fleuve Congo(Congo River Alliance), a coalition of militias including M23 that is acting in place of the government in Goma and Bukavu, has promised to build and rehabilitate detention facilities. But with an increase in crime, people are taking the law into their own hands, beating up some suspects and setting others on fire.At a security meeting on 24 February, Julien Katembo Ndalieni, the rebel coalition-appointed mayor of Goma, criticised the mob action. “We call on the population to put an end to this practice. Today, some people take advantage of the situation to settle personal scores: false accusations are made against innocent people, who are then lynched by the crowd,” he said, calling on people to take alleged thieves to the authorities.M23’s rapid advance is the worst escalation in years in the decades-long conflict in eastern DRC. It haskilled about 7,000people and displaced hundreds of thousands, exacerbating an already catastrophic humanitarian situation in the region.The group is among more than 100 armed factions fighting against Congolese forces in the mineral-rich eastern DRC. The group says it exists to protect the interests of minorities, including protecting the the Tutsi against Hutu rebel groups who escaped to the DRC after taking part in the 1994 genocide that targeted the Tutsi. The DRC, the UN, the US and other countries say the militia is supported byRwanda, which UN experts say uses the group to extract and export valuable minerals. Rwanda denies the claims.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It would be sold like wine.”Sarabia on Monday insisted that changing the approach from a punitive one towards a more humanitarian one did not imply “normalising or coexisting with drug trafficking”.Colombian authorities have seized more than 1,900 tonnes of cocaine and destroyed 454 clandestine laboratories since Petro took office in August 2022 up to January this year, said the minister.Explore more on these topicsColombiaDrugs tradeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Carney will then swear oaths of office and allegiance and form a cabinet. This is expected to happen in the coming days.After his meeting with Trudeau, Carney said the transition “will be seamless and it will be quick.’Under Canadian law, an election period must be at least 37 days and no more than 51 days, with the vote falling on a Monday. Party insiders have indicated Canadians will probably vote on 28 April or 5 May.Theformer governor of the Bank of England and of Canadatakes the job of prime minister as Ottawa finds itself at odds with its closest ally and largest trading partner. Last week Trump announced a 25% tax on all Canadian goods, with a carve-out for the automotive and energy sectors. The tariffs have the power to push Canada’s fragile economy into a recession.Carney spent much of his acceptance speech on Sunday evening foreshadowing the theme that will probably define his tenure as prime minister: conflict with the volatile and unpredictable president who has threatened repeatedly to annex Canada.“America is notCanada. And Canada never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape or form,” Carney told supporters. “We didn’t ask for this fight. But Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves,” Carney said. “So the Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade as in hockey, Canada will win.While the Liberals trail slightly in the polls, Carney’s ascension within the party, and Trudeau’s exit, has dramatically revived their chances of eking out a victory in the next election – a result that was widely seen as unthinkable just weeks ago.A line graph of Canada opinion poll averages across January 2023 to January 2025 with Conservative hovering around 40%, yet falling in recent months to 38% and Liberals decreasing gradually to 20%, until a sudden increase to 34% after January 2025. NDP is shown currently at 14% and BQ is at 6%Carney, a political novice who has never held elected office, also criticised his main political rival: the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre.“Donald Trump thinks he can weaken us with his plan to divide and conquer. Pierre Poilievre’s plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,” Carney said. “Because a person who worships at the altar ofDonald Trumpwill kneel before him, not stand up to him.”Canada’s Liberal party was left for dead, but Trump might have just given it a second chanceRead moreCarney also suggested Poilievre’s partisan nature was a liability in the existential fight for Canada’s future. “His anger isn’t action. His division isn’t strength. Division won’t win a trade war,” he said.Earlier that evening, Poilievre accused Carney of being “sneaky” at a Sunday evening rally in London, Ontario.“And now our Liberal friends, after they’ve caused all this damage, are going to pull a sneaky trick. They’re going to try to get elected for a fourth term. A fourth term by replacing Justin Trudeau with his economic adviser, Mark Carney,” he said. “Carney’s advice drove up taxes, housing costs and food prices, while he personally profited from moving billions of dollars and thousands of jobs out of Canada to the United States.”Carney’s dominant win outshone most expectations and provides the leader with both a strong mandate and a unified party. He won in all 343 of the Liberal party districts. His closest rival, the former finance minister Chrystia Freeland finished a distant second with only 8% of the vote, and was unable to win the most votes in her own district.Explore more on these topicsCanadaUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationAmericasTrump tariffsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Both Harris and Myran were believed to have been buried in the privately owned Prairie Green landfill, while few details have been released about Mashkode Bizhiki’ikwe.Police initially said that they did not have the resources to search the refuse at the facility, much of which was buried under tonnes of clay.After the victims’ families and Indigenous groups in Winnipeg led marches and road blockades to pressure officials to approve a search, authoritiespledged C$20m ($14.7m)for a search.Harris’s daughter, Cambria, has beena champion of her motherand of the need for a search.The daughter fighting to recover her mother’s remains from a landfillRead moreAfter police confirmed her mother’s remains had been identified, she wrote on Facebook that it was “a very bittersweet moment”.“Please keep our families in your hearts tonight and every day going forward as we trust this process,” the post said. “I believe both our families will bring both of our loved ones home.”At least 4,000 Indigenous women and girls have been murdered or gone missing in recent decades, in whata landmark 2019 reportdescribed as a “genocide”.

The rainfall –400mm (15.7in) recordedin just eight hours – was more than twice the city’s previous record of 175mm (6.8in) set in 1930.The sisters, Delfina and Pilar Hecker, were travelling with their parents when their car became trapped in the rising waters. According to reports, a truck driver, named asRubén Zalazar, attempted to rescue the children before they were swept away. The body of 43-year-0ld Zalazar was found in a lagoon on Sunday.At least 16 people have been declared dead by officials, with authorities saying there are “likely to be more”. In the latest press conference, Carlos Bianco, a minister in the Buenos Aires province, said at least100 peoplewere missing.Authorities also said more than 1,000 people were evacuated over the weekend, while estimates suggest hundreds have been made homeless.Videos posted onlineshowed neonatal nurses wading through knee-deep flood waters to rescue newborn babies.“We looked at the street and saw a river. We saw cars, trucks, containers, everything floating by. You could hear store windows breaking, and see furniture being dragged by the current,” said Soledad Bengochea, 52, a resident. “In one car, we saw two people trapped. It was overwhelming and terrible. There are many people who have suffered.”The national security minister, Patricia Bullrich, said the area had been “destroyed”, while Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, declared three days of national mourning.But the government has also come under fire after it emerged the national emergency directorate – which provides disaster relief – was shuttered three days before the storm, with485 employeesdismissed or placed on leave. The decision comes as Milei’s administration conducts widespread cuts to state spending.The mayor, Federico Susbielles, said that the floods had caused millions in infrastructure damage. Agostina Bitti, a 34-year-old doctor, said there are “still houses under water”. “The entire city needs to be rebuilt,” she said.Argentina’s economy ministry has pledged AR$10bn (US$9.2m at the official exchange rate) to help repair the damage and rebuild the city.The Argentinian footballer Lionel Messi offered his condolences to the victims’ families, saying he wished them strength. Pope Francis, who has been hospitalised in Rome since 14 February, also sent a message to the victims.

They’re making life more expensive for American families and businesses,” Ford said in a statement.“Until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario won’t back down. We’ll stand strong, use every tool in our toolkit and do whatever it takes to protect Ontario.”There’s only one thing in Mark Carney’s in-tray: TrumpRead moreFord said the government had told the province’s Independent Electricity System Operator that any generator selling electricity to the US was now required to add a 25% surcharge valued at $10 per megawatt-hour to the cost of power.At this level, the surcharge will generate revenue of C$300,000 to C$400,000 (US$432,000 to US$576,000) a day, the statement said.Ontario, the country’s most populous province, has deep economic connections with the US that would be hit hard by Trump’s threat of 25% tariffs, which he has repeatedly promised, retracted and promised again.Last month Ford cancelled the province’s $100m contract with Starlink, the satellite service owned byElon Musk, who has been a key adviser to Trump. The move left some remote communitieswithout other optionsfor how to start providing internet access to their residents.Ontario is also among several provinces to havepulled US alcohol, such as Jack Daniel’s whiskey, off its shelves in protest against Trump’s tariffs, which the US president has threatened against Mexico and other fellow traditional allies of the US.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsCanadaDonald TrumpTrump administrationTrump tariffsEconomicsUS politicsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

We have faith in God … that the activity of the volcano will calm down soon,” Manuel Cobox, 46, told AFP after leaving his home with his wife and three daughters.About 125 families, roughly 900 people, were moved to safety from the community of El Porvenir, said Juan Laureano, a spokesperson for Guatemala’s disaster coordination agency, Conred.Residents of another community in Las Lajitas were also evacuated, the official added.Buses brought evacuees carrying belongings to a town hall turned into a temporary shelter.About 30,000 people were potentially “at risk” and should evacuate themselves if necessary, Conred’s head, Claudinne Ogaldes, told a news conference.Guatemala lies on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity.In 2018,215 people were killed and a similar number left missingas an eruption of the Fuego volcano sent rivers of lava pouring down its sides, devastating the village of San Miguel Los Lotes.Guatemala volcano: rescuers battle boiling ash to recover Fuego’s deadRead moreAmanda Santos, a 58-year-old housekeeper, said that memories of that previous eruption came flooding back when she heard the firefighters’ sirens.“That’s why we’re afraid.

However, Copenhagen fears that if voters give strong backing to the largest opposition party, Naleraq, a prominent pro-independence voice and supporter of US collaboration, Greenland could instead strengthen its ties with the US.On Monday the territory’s prime minister and chair of the Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) party, Múte B Egede, accused Trump of being “unpredictable” and said he had failed to treat Greenlanders with respect.View image in fullscreenMúte B Egede says Greeenland ‘deserves to be treated with respect’ after Trump’s recent comments.Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images“It is a fateful choice we have,” Egede told Danish broadcaster DR.“The things that are happening in the world right now worry me quite a lot. That there is a world order that is faltering on many fronts, and perhaps a president in the United States who is very unpredictable in a way that makes people feel insecure,” he said.“We deserve to be treated with respect, and I don’t think the American president has done that lately since he took office.”In his speech to Congress last week, Trump said that he would acquire Greenland“one way or the other”. And on Sunday, he attempted to appeal to Greenlanders directly by reiterating his invitation to join the US and pledging to “invest billions of dollars to create new jobs and make you rich”.However, while many in Nuuk are open to strengthening collaboration with the US, the idea of Greenland being acquired by the Trump administration has been widely rejected.Trump’srecent remarks were not helping, Egede said. “We need to draw a line in the sand and spend more effort on those countries that show us respect for the future we want to draw,” he added.Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland’s minister for natural resources, equality, business and justice and a member of IA, said Trump’s latest comments were seen as “crass and inappropriate”. “It’s the wrong way to do foreign policy if you want to get a closer tie with Greenland,” she added.Of the six parties running, only Naleraq has promised to hold a snap vote on independence and all parties, except for Atassut, support secession – although with varying degrees of urgency.Greenland’s longstanding independence movement has gained significant traction in recent years after a series of scandals highlighting Denmark’s racist treatment of Greenlanders – includingthe IUD scandal, in which 4,500 women and girls were allegedly fitted with contraception without their knowledge, and“parenting competency”tests that have separated many Inuit children from their parents.‘It’s very unpredictable’: divided Greenland prepares to vote amid Trump-inspired existential crisisRead moreWith the US administration expressing interest in Greenland’s “incredible natural resources”, chiefly its mineral wealth, Egede’s IA and another party, Siumut, have said they would set up a national mining company to enable Greenland to profit more from its raw materials.Nathanielsen said that despite the geopolitical drama the issues on voters’ minds were the usual preoccupations such as education and healthcare.“We are getting asked the exact same questions as usual by voters,” she said. “But on top of that there is, of course, a real concern about what is going on the world stage, especially with regards to Greenland.”Trump’s promises of interest and money in Greenland have so far been “very vague”, she said. “Right now it is just talk and very unclear what they [the US] actually think and what he [Trump] means by making Greenlanders rich, that’s still to be seen.”High school student and first-time voter, Aviâja Korneliussen, 18, said: “I am excited but also very nervous because we don’t know how it’s going to affect our communities and we know that the whole world is watching and waiting.”Korneliussen said she had not yet decided whether to vote for Naleraq, IA or the Democrats. She wanted Greenland to become independent and to have more connection with the Arctic region rather than with Denmark or the Nordics orEurope. But she was unsure when it came to the US.“I’m a bit conflicted because we know [what] the US has done to their own Indigenous groups and how they can manipulate things to be their way. But I get the idea they want to work together to be more independent from Denmark, so it’s a bit 50/50 for me.”Trump had been “disrespectful … he looks at us as objects to own” and she did not want Greenland to become the 51st state, she added.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDonald TrumpDenmarkEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It appears to me to be a thinly deniable tit for tat.”In January, theGuardian reportedon how Russian diplomats accessed a private area of parliament in a major security breach shortly before Christmas that alarmed security officials and prompted private warnings from the speakers of both houses.A number of UK politicians and journalists have been barred from entering Russia since the start of Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Dozens of others, including the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and other cabinet members, were also added by Russia to a so-called “stop list”.Explore more on these topicsRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He has denied any wrongdoing.Romania’s central election bureau said on Sunday it had decided to bar Georgescu’s candidacy for the rerun of the first-round vote, scheduled for May, ruling that it was inadmissible after the constitutional court’s annulment of the November vote.The decision drew sharp criticism from Washington, with the US presidential adviser Elon Musk posting on Sunday: “This is crazy!” The billionaire returned to the subject on Monday, asking: “How can a judge end democracy in Romania?”The US vice-president,JD Vance, had previously said the annulment of the first-round vote showed Romania did not share American values. Georgescu, 62, a former government official, is leading in the polls and was projected to win about 40% of votes in May.Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right Lega party, called the bureau’s decision a “Soviet-style Euro-coup”, while Georgescu said it was “just the beginning …Europeis now a dictatorship. Romania is under tyranny!”In a video on Facebook, Georgescu added: “We go all the way for the same values: peace, democracy, freedom.” He urged his supporters, who clashed with police on Sunday night, to refrain from violent protests.Scores of Georgescu voters rallied in Bucharest to express their anger, many waving Romanian flags and chanting “Thieves!” and “the last resort is another revolution!” Some threw broken paving stones at riot police.The constitutional court is expected to rule on Georgescu’s appeal on Wednesday but is thought unlikely to find in his favour. It has previously barred another far-right candidate, arguing that her anti-EU, pro-Russian views made her unfit for office.Georgescu has lauded Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, as “a man who loves his country” and praised Romania’s 1930s fascist leaders. The promotion of fascist leaders and Nazi, racist or xenophobic symbols is banned under Romanian law.If the court upholds the election bureau’s decision, three ultranationalist parties that backed Georgescu’s candidacy and have 35% of the seats in Romania’s parliament risk not being on the ballot for the rerun, opening the way for another candidate.View image in fullscreenSupporters of far-right candidate Cǎlin Georgescu confront riot police outside Romania’s central electoral bureau on Sunday.Photograph: Inquam Photos/George Calin/ReutersGeorge Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), could put his name forward. He described the election bureau’s decision as “a new episode … in a coup d’état ” and a “black page in our fragile democracy”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said he would back Georgescu “to the end” but did not have high hopes.Sergiu Miscoiu, a professor of political science at Babes-Bolyai University, said he believed that even if the US “reacts badly”, it would be riskier to let Georgescu run than to bar him since his victory could derail Romania’s pro-western orientation.Many of Georgescu’s supporters and some politicians from other parties, including Elena Lasconi, the president of the centre-right Save Romania Union (USR) party, who finished second in the cancelled presidential election, cried foul.Lasconi, 52, who has previously called on prosecutors to provide their evidence against Georgescu, said in a statement that the election bureau – which has said only that his candidacy would be “unacceptable” – must provide its reasoning as soon as possible.“Decisions must be explained,” she said, “otherwise people will become furious, suspicious and prone to conspiracies.”Georgescu had been polling in single digits before the election and had declared zero campaign spending. The first round of the rerun is scheduled for 4 May, with the second round run-off on 18 May.Explore more on these topicsRomaniaThe far rightRussiaEuropeJD VancenewsShareReuse this content"

And she wants to sell you a mink coat.Hearst’sParis fashion weekshow included a coat, jacket and stole made from vintage real fur. “We bought all these old mink coats in Italy, and pieced them together,” she said after her show.The collection also included fake fur made from silk schappe, which is spun from fibre left over from silk cocoon processing. Real python was used for clothes and accessories using skins from Inversa, an “ethical exotics” company that sources skins from invasive species. The python skin comes from Florida where, according to Inversa, non-native pythons are causing a severe decline in animal populations in the Greater Everglades.Hearst’s minks are part of arapid rehabilitation of furin the fashion industry. A moral battle that seemed definitively won has had its lines redrawn, between those who object to real fur on animal welfare grounds, and those who object to fake fur on environmental grounds. Mass-produced fake fur is often plastic-based, and its critics argue that even if made from recycled plastic, a fake fur coat is not sustainable – a plastic bottle can be recycled many times, whereas once converted into a coat, the plastic is destined for landfill.View image in fullscreenModel on the runway at the Balenciaga show in Paris on Sunday.Photograph: WWD/Getty ImagesThen there is the vibe-shift. Quiet luxury is out, and “boom boom” is in. Boom boom means gold and greed, visible hierarchy, the return of masculine and feminine as stay-in-your-lane aesthetics. A mink coat is as “boom boom” as it gets. And while real furs have all but disappeared from most shopfloors in the past decade, they are easy to find in vintage stores – which have become aspirational shopping destinations for many younger style consumers.Another through line ofParisfashion week has been an about-turn from stadium-scale catwalk spectaculars to intimate shows in smaller rooms with fewer guests, to emphasise an up-close-and-personal reveal of the clothes.AtBalenciaga, the catwalk was whittled to the width of a pavement flanked with simple black office chairs. There was no seating plan – a mind-bendingly radical twist at the shows, where hierarchy is observed with courtly precision. “I wanted proximity to the clothes, because fashion should feel urgent,” the designer Demna said backstage after the show. This desire for intimacy echoed Friday’s debut at Givenchy by the British designer Sarah Burton, where the designer limited the guest list to 300 and narrowed the catwalk to a width which she said was based on “how close can we get without being caught on a handbag?”Similarly, at Schiaparelli, models were spritzed with fragrance before they stepped on to the runway, to emphasise how close they should be to the audience.At Balenciaga, the first three models were dressed in simple black business trouser suits with no discernible gimmicks. They wore glasses and carried briefcases, and their suits had tiny nicks in the fabric, or creases at the back from being sat on. A man in a cotton polo shirt wore a bike helmet, like a courier just stepped off a bike, a woman in a party dress had her phone in her hand.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fashion is about right now, fashion is about what people wear,” Demna told a scrum of reporters after the show, before his democratic debrief was paused for an interruption by the French actor Isabelle Huppert, the crowd parting for her to give him a post-show kiss. At Paris fashion week, iconoclasm knows its bounds.Intimacy took a different form at Valentino, where the designer Alessandro Michele created a set based on nightclub toilets, complete with strip lighting and stainless steel soap dispensers, with each model making their entrance from behind a cubicle door.“A lot of disclosure and intimacy happens in this place, in the toilets of a club, in front of those mirrors,” Michele said after the show. The look was Chappell Roan goes to Glyndebourne: grand-soiree glamour, but with thrift-store tastes and a wink to kink.Explore more on these topicsSustainable fashionFashion weeksFashion industryParisParis fashion weekFranceBalenciaganewsShareReuse this content"

Even for the smaller and weaker ones,” Tusk wrote in English on X. “Never arrogance. Dear friends, think about it.”Rubio had also said that “no one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink”.“And say thank you because without Starlink Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border withPolandright now,” Rubio added.Sikorski had later replied: “Thank you, Marco, for confirming that the brave soldiers of Ukraine can count on the vital internet service provided jointly by the US and Poland.”Sikorski had been told to “be quiet” and labelled a “small man” by Musk after he suggested that Poland, which says it pays $50m a year for Ukraine’s Starlink services, may need to find another provider if Musk’s service was deemed unreliable.The US government has already revoked some access to satellite imagery for Ukraine andpaused intelligence sharing, piling pressure on Kyiv as Trump seeks a swift end to the war, which is now in its fourth year after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.Shares in the Franco-British satellite operator Eutelsat soared by as much as 650% last week amid speculation the company could replace Starlink in providing internet access to Ukraine.Musk, a high-profile figure in Donald Trump’s administration, said in a post on his X social media platform early on Sunday that Ukraine’s “entire frontline would collapse if I turned it [Starlink] off”.In a series of posts on X on the subject, that lasted through the day, Musk said later he would not turn off Starlink in Ukraine.“To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals … We would never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TuskPolandUkraineMarco RubioElon MuskUS foreign policySatellitesnewsShareReuse this content"

While he said the series of interviews was meant to explain the US position, he also defended the talks by saying that Washington is “not an agent of Israel”.“We weren’t prepared to just sit back for two weeks,” Boehler said, adding: “You’ve got a real chance for some movement and seeing hostages home in the next few weeks.”Those remarks are said to have provoked behind-the-scenes fury from Netanyahu’s strategic affairs adviser Ron Dermer, as well as public anger from rightwingers in the government including the ultranationalist finance minister Bezalel Smotrich.“[Boehler] attempted to negotiate the release of American hostages. We made it clear to him that he cannot speak on our behalf, and if he wishes to negotiate on behalf of the United States, then good luck to him,” Smotrich told Israel’s Army Radio, according to the Times of Israel.The Israeli minister did not specify how this message was conveyed to Boehler. However, on Monday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, further sought to tamp down concerns over the talks between Boehler andHamas.“That was a one-off situation in which our special envoy for hostages, whose job it is to get people released, had an opportunity to talk directly to someone who has control over these people and was given permission and encouraged to do so. He did so,” Rubio told reporters while flying to Saudi Arabia.“As of now, it hasn’t borne fruit. Doesn’t mean he was wrong to try, but our primary vehicle for negotiations on this front will continue to be Mr Witkoff and the work he’s doing through Qatar,” Rubio added, referring to Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff.In Israel,the revelation of direct talks between the US and Hamashas provoked mixed emotions. Official reaction from the Israeli government has been limited to a single terse statement by the office of Netanyahu acknowledging the negotiations and some broadly neutral comments from more junior officials.One key question has been whether Israel knew of the contacts before they were revealed by US-based media. Boehler did not answer questions about when the contacts began during interviews with Israeli media.Kan, the national public radio network, reported “behind-the-scenes tension between Israel and the US over the direct talks between Trump’s envoy Adam Boehler and the terrorist Khalil al-Hayya, talks that Israel only learned about from sources and only later was formally notified”.Others have welcomed the prospect of progress towards a diplomatic agreement that might ensure the return of more hostages.The mass-market newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said: “Israel was stunned to discover that, behind its back, Trump’s envoy had flirted for weeks in Doha” with Hayya, a senior Hamas official.“Hamas got what it could only have dreamt of getting under Biden: legitimacy,” the paper wrote.The newspaper gave details of what it said was “a fraught conversation” between Boehler and Dermer, a close adviser of Netanyahu.“Dermer thought that the Americans had agreed to an excessively large release of terrorists and that this would set the tone for the talks on the second stage. Boehler was stunned by Dermer’s insolence and spoke about that in conversations with other people,” the newspaper said.Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, described the contacts as “quite a big deal”.“Let’s see how it plays out. This kind of contact … can be positive. It can certainly move forward diplomacy.”Lovatt said that Hamas was unlikely to be overawed by dealing with the US.“Hamas negotiators have been quite professional. They’ve been able to make concessions but also to stand their ground. They are quite a robust partner so that will make a difference.”The Trump administration has sought to shut out its allies in negotiations both with Hamas and in Ukraine, where advisers are seen to be negotiating with Russia directly on a “reset” in relations and have increased pressure on Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, by cutting off military aid and intelligence sharing.Trump’s envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Gen Keith Kellogg, has said the US cut off support in order to get the Ukrainians’ attention,comparing the tactic to hitting a mule in the face with a wooden beam.Explore more on these topicsHamasIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said troops would remain “for the coming year”, meaning residents would not be allowed back in that time.Israel says its operations target militant Palestinian groups. The refugee camps are historically home to fighters who consider themselves armed resistance.“Israel’s complete disregard for international law in the war inGazais now being replicated to the West Bank,” said B’Tselem’s executive director, Yuli Novak. “Its activity there, as yet on a smaller scale than in Gaza, is already causing indiscriminate and disproportionate killing and destruction.”The parents of a boy shot when he went to buy bread and the uncle of two children, aged five and eight, who were killed in an airstrike are among relatives of six child victims who told the Guardian about how attacks documented by B’tselem have shattered their lives.Rigd Gasser, father of 14-year-old Ahmad Rashid Jazar, said his son was hit in the chest by a single bullet on 19 January while leaving a shop in his home village of Sebastia, where he had been on an errand to get bread.View image in fullscreenPalestinians stand by a damaged road in the Tulkarm refugee camp as residents evacuate their homes amid an Israeli military operation on 9 March.Photograph: Alaa Badarneh/EPAGasser was in a cafe when he heard the gunshots and rushed out when he heard calls for help. “I got closer and recognised my son. I knew him by his clothes, his body was all covered in blood,” he said. “Since the beginning of the war, they [Israeli forces] have been coming here every day. They launch raids in the morning and evening.”Israel sent a surge of troops, including tanks, to the West Bank after theGaza ceasefire began in January. Military operations in the three refugee camps – Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams – came on top of what had been Israel’s deadliest bombing campaign in the occupied territory. In the 17 months since 7 October 2023, B’tselem documented64 airstrikes that killed 261 Palestinians, including both militant and civilian casualties and at least 41 minors.That is more than three times the total toll from airstrikes during the second intifada, which lasted more than four years, when B’tselem recorded 78 deaths including 10 children between 2000 and the end of 2004.The group’s report described the increased use of airstrikes as part of a “broader conceptual and operational shift” in Israeli military tactics that put civilians at greater risk. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions.Muhammad Khreiwish’s niece and nephew were among the youngest victims. Sham Abu Zahara, eight, and Karam Abu Zahara, five, were killed with both their parents and another uncle on 3 October 2024, when an airstrike targeted a cafe in Tulkarm.The cafe was on the ground floor of an apartment building, and the Abu Zahara family lived next door. Khreiwish was arriving to visit his sister Saja when an explosion threw him off his bike. As people raced away from the site, he ran in to look for the family.Inside he was met by a horrific scene. “I found pieces of bodies that I couldn’t recognise, and then I saw my niece,” he said. He called for help but she had been killed immediately. All he could do was wrap her shattered body and take it to the hospital morgue.The strike killed 18 people and at least six of them, or a third of the total, were civilians, B’tselem investigators found.The Abu Zahara siblings were two of 180 children killed by Israeli forces over the 17 months since the Gaza war began, the deadliest period in the West Bank of Israel’s nearly 60-year-long occupation according to B’tselem.Until 2023 the most dangerous time for Palestinian children in the West Bank was the second intifada, when B’tselem documented 246 children killed in 63 months – a rate of killing half current levels from all Israeli operations.B’tselem said looser rules of engagement were one reason for the rise in child deaths. The Israeli military has expanded its “open fire” rules, with soldiers now allowed to shoot to kill targets including anyone they suspect is “messing with the ground”, Israeli newspaper Haaretzreported.The cousins Reda Basharat, eight, and Hamza Basharat, 10, were killed near home by a drone strike on 8 January. The children could not go school that morning because Israeli forces had launched a raid near their village, Tammun, and so roads were closed, Hamza’s mother, Eman Basharat, said.View image in fullscreenEman Basharat holds a picture of her son Hamza, 10, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on 8 January.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianHamza, born after a years-long IVF struggle, was a cheerful child who normally loved studying and was angry about missing an English test scheduled for that day.The boys were sitting outside with their 23-year-old cousin Adam, who was drinking a morning coffee when they were targeted. Eman raced out to look for her son as soon as she heard the explosion. She found Hamza injured and struggling to breathe. “I held his body. I cleaned the blood from his face and I recited the Shahada [the Muslim profession of faith]. He died in my arms, he didn’t look like he was in pain.”Israeli soldiers arrived soon after and took away all three bodies for several hours, before returning the children to their grieving families without explanation.“When I think about what happened to my son and remember the images of their bodies, and I see what is happening in Gaza on TV, I felt suddenly that they are doing the same thing,” Eman Basharat said.It is a comparison that has also been made by Israeli officials. The West Bank campaign was a based on “a lesson from the activity that took place in Gaza and other places”, Katz told the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. “We need to clean up a place and not allow terrorism to return to it.”Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has said Palestinians in the West Bank should know that “if they continue with terrorism … their fate will be like Gaza”. He said the “Tulkarm and Jenin [refugee camps] will look like Jabaliya and Shujayah [in Gaza]”.An Israel Defense Forces spokespersonhas previously deniedthat soldiers forced Palestinians from their homes, saying camp residents who chose to leave to escape fighting were “allowed” to do so.Dozens of homes have already demolished. Similarities with larger-scale displacement and destruction in Gaza were clear to Palestinian families crowded into mosques, wedding halls and the homes of relatives where they had sought refuge.The Guardian spoke to three families who said they were ordered to leave their homes either directly by Israeli forces or through messages broadcast on loudspeakers.Fatma Shab, 63, is living in the women’s area of wedding hall, separated from her severely ill husband, Yusuf Shab, 68. Permanently connected to oxygen, he cannot walk and had to be evacuated by ambulance.View image in fullscreenFatma Shab in the wedding hall where she is living after being displaced.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianAs Israeli forces advanced the Shabs fled from their home in Nur Shams refugee camp to the house of their son, which has since been demolished. Soldiers broke into the building and told them to leave immediately, with no time to pack.So they moved again to a nearby Kafr al-Labad town where they have found temporary, basic shelter in al-Diah wedding hall. They only have two bathrooms for 14 people, and just drapes separating crowded sleeping areas.Even so, the families sheltering there are terrified they will have to leave after Ramadan, as it will be needed again for weddings once the holy month is finished.View image in fullscreenYusef Shab, 68, is connected to oxygen 24 hours a day and cannot walk.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian“People here are kind, but in my home I am more comfortable,” Fatma Shab said. “Even just being able to go to my closet to choose some clothes to wear. Now I’m just wearing what I have on, there are no choices.”She said she did not know if she would see the house she built with her husband for their retirement again. “It’s just a short distance away, but I can’t go home. In Gaza they were forced out and killed, and here now it’s the same.”Explore more on these topicsWest BankGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, most western countries and election watchdogs are highly unlikely to view the vote as credible.Opposition parties are mostly either banned from contesting or boycott elections, while almost 22,000 political prisoners remain in detention, according to a local monitoring group, including Aung San Suu Kyi, whose government was ousted in 2021. Her party, National League for Democracy (NLD), was dissolved for failing to re-register under an electoral law introduced after the coup.The Guardian view on Myanmar, four years on: the army unleashed terror, but the people are defiant | EditorialRead moreIt is also unclear how the military would implement elections given that it haslost control of large swathes of the countryto a patchwork of opposition groups that are fighting against its rule. Its territorial losses have been so severe that it was only able to conduct a full census, designed to prepare voter lists, in less than half (145) of the country’s 330 townships.Astudy commissioned by the BBC, suggests the military controls only 21% of the country’s territory, though it still holds the key, densely populated cities.“There’s no question an election held under current conditions will be a sham and it’s important that countries denounce the plan to hold elections by the Myanmar military and deny technical support,” said Bryony Lau, the deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch.“It’s clear that holding an election currently is only about the military’s interest. For ordinary people in Myanmar it must be a terrifying prospect.”When the military’s census was conducted last year, people were afraid to answer questions, while those being made to conduct the census also feared being targeted by the opposition.Analysts have warned the military, which has launched bloody crackdowns on dissent since seizing power,is likely to deploy further violenceto ensure polling goes ahead in areas it controls. Opposition groups may also seek to resist violently.Chin Human Rights Organization, a human rights NGO, said on social media that western democratic countries “must send a clear, unequivocal message by pre-emptively denouncing the junta’s polls”.Debbie Stothard, the founder of Altsean-Burma, a network of human rights organisations in south-east Asia, said there was concern that the election would bring even greater bloodshed. “We can see already preparation for the election has involved a sharp spike in violence – 2024 saw more airstrikes than 2021, 2022 and 2023 combined. We’ve seen areas that are not reachable by the junta being bombarded with airstrikes – they are literally trying to kill off the opposition,” she said.A joint statement by election experts, published by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance in February, said they “unequivocally reject” plans by Myanmar’s junta to hold an election.A vote would not bring peace or stability to Myanmar, the statement added, but would “deepen divisions, fuel violence, entrench authoritarian rule and exacerbate the crisis caused by the military coup”.Foreign ministers from the regional bloc of south-east Asian nations also told the junta in January that it should prioritise a ceasefire over fresh elections.The junta’s leader, Min Aung Hlaing, has long promised to hold an election but has repeatedly extended a state of emergency. The junta-controlled Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper quoted the leader as saying during a visit to Belarus: “We are planning to hold the election in December 2025 or … by January 2026.” He added that 53 political parties had registered to participate.The military would also invite teams from Belarus to observe the election, he said during a meeting with the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power for more than three decades, andrecently won a seventh five-year termin a vote that was widely rejected as a sham.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarSouth and central AsiaChinaAlexander LukashenkonewsShareReuse this content"

The Tory plan would introduce an amendment to the government’s borders bill that would remove the current threshold, in which foreign criminals are only removed after being handed a prison sentence of one year.The party hopes this amendment, which would need support from Labour MPs, would also make it easier for the government to deport foreign offenders by ending exceptions that had been granted by the European court of human rights.The policy would apply to foreign nationals, including those seeking asylum, and anyone who has been charged with, or convicted of, immigration offences.While Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, classed the proposals as “simple”, refugee groups described them as “ludicrously unworkable”.Tim Naor Hilton, chief executive of Refugee Action, said: “This amendment is not only terrifying, it is ludicrously unworkable and blatant political grandstanding. It appears to demand the deportation of all people fleeing war and persecution who have no other option than to take irregular routes to reach safety here.“Politicians must stop threatening people with the sort of hostile and extreme policies and rhetoric that only serve to inflame racial hatred and encourage violence on our streets.”Amnesty International UK challenged the government to not only oppose the policy but scrap “unworkable immigration laws from the past few years that undercut international law obligations”, urging Labour to adopt a new course.Steve Valdez-Symonds, the charity’s migrant rights director, said: “These tabled amendments present an unflinchingly dog-whistle commitment to hostility for human rights and the people whose lives are most dependent on them.”The Tories also hope to table an amendment to require the government to stop issuing visas to nationals from countries who do not accept back their own citizens, including criminals, with a change to section 24 of the Immigration Act 1971.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A minister – Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson – says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It’s inconceivable.”Gove said that Dyson’s prototype ultimately “did not get through testing” and that “whenever confronted with brute facts about safety or otherwise, I would always accept them”.The former minister accepted he had more “direct involvement” with Dyson’s proposal than with other applicants, but said he “could not tell the MHRA what to approve and would not”.Elsewhere, the inquiry was shown an extract from an email from Gove’s private office that read: “MHRA and GRW [Gareth Rhys Williams, then the chief commercial officer at the Cabinet Office] to ensure that by the end of Friday, the Dyson product has been tested and approved by MHRA, a small number of products have been provided to hospitals for human testing, and the final product has started to be manufactured. GRW to escalate any blockages to ministers.”Asked about why he had been able to give “clear instruction that not only would the Dyson product have been tested three days later, but also approved by MHRA by that time”, Gove said: “I could not tell the MHRA what to approve and would not. I think that this is the private office’s shorthand for ‘we would hope that it had been tested and if tested satisfactorily approved by the MHRA to that timescale’.“It’s absurd to imagine that I or any other minister would instruct the MHRA, an independent regulatory agency, to approve a product. If I had told the MHRA to approve a product, they would have told me where to get off.”Meanwhile, the inquiry heard that the senior Cabinet Office civil servant John Manzoni had been “concerned” that “indirect pressure was being placed on the MHRA to approve the supplier’s design” after a meeting with Gove, Dyson and Rhys Williams.“I felt I had to, and did, intervene in this meeting to ensure that the MHRA approval system, as the regulatory system, was properly applied and to protect the integrity of the process,” Manzoni said in a statement.In a separate exchange with Manzoni on 25 March that year, Rhys Williams had said he felt Gove was “being unreasonable”.“Even if he was correct that we had delayed anything, which I don’t believe he is at all, his tone is … regrettable. But see below. It would appear that the Dyson sample is not yet ready to be shipped by them.“MHRA could have been testing something else this evening.”Gove also told the inquiry he did not believe that time and effort spent on Dyson’s ventilator proposal meant that the same resources could not be devoted to other bids.The inquiry continues on Tuesday.The inquiry previously heard that Lord Agnew, a Tory Treasury minister, had warned a senior official that ventilators might need to be bought from Dyson“so that he [could] then market [them] internationally”as “being used in UK hospitals” after the businessman spoke to Boris Johnson.A Dyson spokesperson said last week: “Sir James Dyson responded to a personal call from the prime minister … to develop and make a medical-grade ventilator in 30 days during the national emergency.“Dyson had no intention of manufacturing ventilators for profit. Far from receiving any commercial benefit, there was significant commercial cost to Dyson, which diverted 450 engineers away from commercial projects.“Mercifully, treatments changed, and mass use of ventilators was no longer seen as an effective remedy, the UK government cancelled the order it had placed, and none were ever sold overseas.”Explore more on these topicsCovid inquiryMichael GoveJames DysonDyson LtdConservativesHealth policyCoronavirusnewsShareReuse this content"

But the Solong’s owner, shipping firm Ernst Russ, later said a search was under way for a missing crew member, while its 13 other crew were safe.Matthew Atkinson, divisional commander for HM Coastguard, said: “Thirty-six crew members were taken safely to shore, one person was taken to hospital.“One crew member of the Solong remains unaccounted for. After an extensive search for the missing crew member, sadly they have not been found and the search has ended.“The two vessels remain on fire and coastguard aircraft are monitoring the situation.“An assessment of any required counter-pollution response is being carried out by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.”Crowley, the shipping company that manages the MV Stena Immaculate, said there were “multiple explosions onboard” after the oil tanker’s cargo tank was ruptured.TheBBC reportedthat the Solong was carrying toxic sodium cyanide, but it remains unclear if the substance entered the water. The broadcaster said it was understood the Stena Immaculate was transporting jet fuel for the US government.Footage from the scene showed clouds of black smoke billowing into the air.A spokesperson for Greenpeace UK said it was monitoring the situation “very closely” but that it was too early to assess the extent of any environmental damage.Crowley said in a statement: “At approximately 10am on 10 March 2025, while anchored off the North Sea coast near Hull, United Kingdom, the Crowley-managed tanker Stena Immaculate was struck by the container ship Solong.View image in fullscreenAn emergency operation was launched after the collision on Monday morning.Photograph: Getty Images“The Stena Immaculate sustained a ruptured cargo tank containing Jet-A1 fuel due to the allision. A fire occurred as a result of the allision, and fuel was reported released. The Stena Immaculate crew abandoned the vessel following multiple explosions onboard. All Crowley mariners are safe and fully accounted for.”An emergency operation was launched after the collision. A helicopter was scrambled and lifeboats launched from four different bases along the coast.According to the ship tracking tool Vesselfinder, the US-flagged tanker was at anchor at the time of the incident. It had departed from a Greek port in the Aegean Sea and was heading towards Hull, according to the Marine Traffic website. The Solong was destined for Rotterdam.MapFootage of the incident showed both ships on fire, with flames spreading across the water and clouds of black smoke coming from the oil tanker.The UK transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “I am hugely grateful to HM Coastguard, the RNLI and emergency services who have responded to this incident.“They were on the scene swiftly, have helped rescue those in immediate danger and I know they will continue to work tirelessly over the coming days.“My thoughts are with all those involved, especially the family of the missing crew member.“The Maritime Accident Investigation Branch has begun a preliminary assessment, and I am working closely with the MCA (Maritime and Coastguard Agency) as they conduct an assessment of any counter-pollution response which may be required over the coming days.”View image in fullscreenBlack smoke billows into the air after the crash off the coast of East Yorkshire.Photograph: Bartek Smialek/PAThe leader of Hull council, Mike Ross, said: “The scenes across the East Yorkshire coast are deeply shocking. My thoughts are with all those affected. There will now be massive emergency response efforts from people right across the area and beyond.“As Hull’s council leader, I will work with the team here urgently to do everything we can to support the response needed now.”A spokesperson for Greenpeace UK said: “Both the high speed of the collision and the footage of the aftermath are cause for great concern.”They added: “Right now, our thoughts are with all those affected by the incident and the emergency services responding to the situation.”David McFarlane, the director of Marine Risk and Safety Consultants, said several warning systems, including radar and a ship’s horn, were onboard aimed at preventing such collisions. About 200 to 300 collisions happened at sea each year, he said.“They would have sighted each other over radar, called automatic identification system, onboard. The ships would be able to see and identify another vessel via AIS, and can call them up via very high frequency radio, and ask them what they are doing.”A ship was visible on another ship’s radar from as far as 24 miles away, McFarlane said. All vessels should have someone on lookout at all times. “But you wouldn’t get anxious about another ship until it was about four miles away, depending on speed.”If the other ship did not respond on the radio, vessels have a last-minute warning system, the ship’s horn, he said. “The next thing to do would be to blast the horn of a ship, which can be heard from miles away.”If a ship is at anchor, however, it can take up to an hour to hoist it up, he said. “I’ve heard that one of the ships was at anchor. If so, there’s a possibility it would have picked up its anchor, or was in the process of doing so, we don’t know. But it can take up to an hour to pick up anchor.”McFarlane said it was too early to speculate about what happened but human error was often to blame for collisions. He said that while there had been reports of pockets of fog in the North Sea at the time of the collision, that would not have affected the ability of any approaching vessel to warn of an approach, given the AIS.Explore more on these topicsUK newsNorth of EnglandShipping industryYorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

The changes will giveWes Streeting, the health secretary, far more control over the organisation that is responsible for the operational performance of the health service in England.“These changes represent the biggest reshaping of the NHS’s national architecture in more than a decade,” said Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts in England.Amanda Pritchard, NHS England’s outgoing chief executive, broke the news to staff today in an email that made clear Streeting had instigated the organisation’s dramatic downsizing.He has asked Jim Mackey, her successor, and Dr Penny Dash, NHS England’s incoming new chair, to lead on the “radical reform of the size and functions of the centre [how NHS staff refer to NHS England and the DHSC’s respective headquarters in London],” Pritchard said. That will “deliver significant changes in our relationship with DHSC to eradicate duplication”.Pritchard announced two weeks ago, after weeks of talks with Streeting, that she was stepping down at the end of the month.A “formal change programme board” or “transition team” of DHSC and NHS England officials will oversee the slimming down of the two organisations. It will report to Dash and Alan Milburn, the formerLabourhealth secretary Streeting appointed as the DHSC’s lead non-executive director, the board’s co-chairs.“As part of this, they will be looking at ways of radically reducing the size of NHS England that could see the centre decrease by around half,” Pritchard said. The news would be “very unsettling” and involve “uncertainty and worry” for staff, she added.Pritchard also announced that Julian Kelly, NHS England’s deputy chief executive and finance chief, chief operating officer Emily Lawson and chief delivery officer Steve Russell will follow her out the door this month.They “feel it is the right time to move on and allow a new transition team, led by Jim, to reshape how NHS England and DHSC work together,” she said. Prof Sir Stephen Powis, the service’s national medical director,announced last Thursday that he was leaving too.One NHS England staffer said: “People here have been expecting change over the last couple of weeks but not as much change as is now apparent. They feel baffled, unnerved and fearful.“The speed at which Emily Lawson, Julian Kelly and Steve Russell are going is bewildering.”Streeting has made no secret of his ambition to gain more power to direct NHS England, which has been semi-independent of ministerial control as a result of then health secretary Andrew Lansley’s shake-up of the service in 2012, as part of the biggest overhaul of the NHS since it was founded.TheGuardian revealed last monththat thousands of jobs were going to be axed at NHS England anddisclosed last week that Mackey was planning a major cullof NHS England’s senior leadership team. Further departures are expected.Mackey and Pritchard warned NHS leaders last week that the organisation is facing a possible overspend of £6.6bn in the 2025/26 financial year and that “a fundamental reset of the financial regime” will help “get a grip of this situation”.Explore more on these topicsNHSWes StreetingHealthLabournewsShareReuse this content"

I have got children, this is not true.”The 49-year-old actor is suing Guardian News and Media (GNM) in relation to seven articles and a podcast published between April 2021 and March 2022 in which more than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.On his first day in the witness box, Clarke was asked about a series of allegations that had been made against him by a number of women.They included an account by Mila*, an actor who claims he made sexually inappropriate comments during a scene in which she was required to strip, and also obtained inappropriate and intrusive footage of her which he shared.Clarke told the court that Mila’s motivation for complaining about him years later was that, after her career prospered, she regretted doing the film.“She regrets the fact that people can look back and see a film where she was semi-nude … If she regrets that there is nothing I can do about it,” Clarke said. “I’m sorry about that because she’s lying.”He claimed that she had “jumped on the bandwagon”, saying: “You [GNM] flashed my face across the papers and I became a target for people who wanted to air their grievances.”The court heard that in December 2020 Clarke spoke to Mila because he had heard that she was unhappy and she told him she had been “very uncomfortable”.The actor said that he agreed to a conversation because he was panicking. He told the court someone was trying to blackmail him with allegations of sexual assault.But Millar said the real reason Clarke had been panicking was because of the worldwide reckoning against men who had mistreated women.“In 2019, the #MeToo movement began to catch up with you and women began talking about your sexual misconduct,” said the barrister.Another actor, Sophia*, alleges Clarke grabbed her hand and put it on his crotch while undoing his trousers.Denying the allegations, Clarke said: “She is lying, she has filed it [her witness statement] to get attention. She has filed it to be a part of something she thinks is noble.”Asked by Millar how she would get attention, given her witness statement was filed under a pseudonym, Clarke replied: “You [at the Guardian] all know who she is.”He said she would get “comfort” from speaking to Guardian journalists and criticised her for not giving oral evidence.He was also questioned about Thalia Hambi-Fisher, a choreographer and dance teacher, who claims that, during a 2009 lunch with Clarke, he asked her to go to the bathroom and take a photograph of her “pussy” for him.“That doesn’t sound like something I would say,” the writer-director said. But asked by Millar if he liked seeing pictures of women’s vaginas, Clarke replied: “I can’t say no to that completely.”He told the court he could not say Hambi-Fisher was lying as he could not recall going for lunch with her, but added: “I will not have said those words to her regardless of what you have said about my like for certain things.”Asked whether it would constitute sexual harassment, Clarke said: “In today’s lens, if it was said, sure. In 2008 or 2009 it might have been a cheeky comment.”The actor also criticised Millar for “attacking my art” and telling him how to to do his job when quizzed on his conduct during sex scenes in films he was directing.“You expected a dozen rapes [to be alleged in response to the initial Guardian article] and you got Doctor Who allegations from 21 years ago,” he told the court.Another actor, Penelope*, claims Clarke touched her with his erect penis, close to the entry of her vagina, while filming a sex scene, and also exposed it to her in between takes. Footage of the finished scene was shown in court in which Clarke pulls down his trousers.He told the barrister: “There’s no way I can get an erection that quickly … Maybe you can.”After one exchange with Millar, Clarke became visibly emotional, and used a tissue to wipe his eyes.He admitted to being “flawed”, not having a “halo” nor being “a perfect guy”, but stressed: “I am not what they [the Guardian journalists] have branded me.”Clarke is expected to continue giving evidence until Wednesday, with the trial scheduled to conclude next month.*Some names have been changed for legal reasons.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianGuardian Media GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday, the administration announced it has reimagined the app as a platform for “self-deportation”.Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security, announced that the app had been rebranded as “CBP Home” and that anyone with the old CBP One app would be redirected to the new version.“The CBP Home app gives aliens the option to leave now and self-deport, so they may still have the opportunity to return legally in the future and live the American dream,” Noem said. “If they don’t, we will find them, we will deport them, and they will never return.”British tourist detained by US authorities for 10 days over visa issueRead moreThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that the app’s “self-deportation functionality is part of a larger $200m domestic and internationalad campaign” which they said it a way to encourage undocumented immigrants to ‘Stay Out and Leave Now’.”It’s unclear who would actually use the new CBP Home app to “self-deport”. The phrase has long been used to describe the idea that life in the US can be made so unbearable for immigrants that they will choose to leave voluntarily.“Immigrant community members should be wary of any promises made by those encouraging them to ‘self-deport’ and instead carefully examine their legal options with trusted advisers,” said Laura Rivera, senior staff attorney at Just Futures Law. “This move reflects Trump’s cynical strategy to flood the zone with messaging that creates fear among immigrant communities while currying favor with his base.”The app’s relaunch also raises privacy concerns, Rivera said. Experts had long warned that the original CBP One app, which collected biometric data and photos, had allowed for a massive expansion of government databases of noncitizens’ photos and other biographic information.The rebranding of the app “is also a chilling example of how easily tools like CBP One, which collected photos and other sensitive personal information, can be weaponized to surveil and punish”, Rivera said.Illegal aliens can self-deport the easy way.Or they can get deported the hard way.The good news is that the re-branded CPB Home app makes self-deporting simpler than ever. 👇pic.twitter.com/QN11ikB7Ck— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47)March 10, 2025Trump had built his presidential campaign on a promise of “mass deportations” of undocumented immigrants. His administration has already moved to cancel several legal pathways for immigrants to enter the US, categorically banning asylum at the US borders, terminating private sponsorship programs that allowed Americans to financially support certain people seeking to immigrate and suspending the US’s refugee resettlement program.When the administration cancelled the CBP One app, about30,000 peoplewaiting in Mexico with scheduled appointments with US immigration officials lost them, and were left in limbo. The app wasinitiallylaunched by the Trump administration during Trump’s first term, as a way to arrange a number of immigration services.In 2023, Joe Biden’s administration expanded the app’s use. Seeking to limit the arrival of asylum seekers at the border, Biden made it all but mandatory to use the app to schedule appointments to make a claim for asylum – and allowed just 1,450 appointments a day, even though thousands more were arriving at the border daily.Human rights groups and immigration lawyers had criticized the app, pointing to glitches, language issues and racial biases in itsfacial recognitionfeatures. Forcing migrants to use the app and wait in Mexico for appointments with immigration officials had the effect of stranding vulnerable groups in Mexico and enriching organized crime groups,a report from Human Rights Watch(HRW) found. But Trump and his allies had characterized the app as too permissive, conversely – and falsely – claiming it fast-tracked entry into the US, and promised to end the system.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It follows two cousins, one of whom is on a three-day release from prison, as the pair attend a funeral in their childhood town.“I am so grateful to receive this award and join a list of some of my favourite writers whose plays have shaken how I understand the world,” said payne, namechecking past winners Katori Hall, Julia Cho, Lynn Nottage, Sarah Ruhl, Benedict Lombe and Paula Vogel. Those playwrights “have made it possible – through their words transcending space and time and/or their caring and abundant mentorship – for me to write,” payne added.The award comprises $25,000 (£19,000) and a signed print by artist Willem de Kooning.Furlough’s Paradisewas nominated for the prize by the Alliance theatre in Atlanta, Georgia, where the play had its premiere in 2024.The Oscar winner Tarell Alvin McCraney, best known for the play and film versions of Moonlight, said Furlough’s Paradise charts “what it means to try to find a utopia in a world that has a criminal justice system that is far from perfect”. McCraney taught payne at the David Geffen school of drama at Yale Universityin Connecticut and said they are “one of the most powerful writers I’ve encountered in my time as a professor”. Next month, the play will be staged at theGeffen Playhousein Los Angeles, where McCraney is artistic director.The Susan Smith Blackburn prize has also given special commendations to 49 Days by Haruna Lee and An Oxford Man by Else Went. The other finalists this year, chosen from more than 200 submissions, included Chris Bush’s playOtherland, which is running at the Almeida theatre in London. Last year’s winner, the Tudor drama1536by Ava Pickett,opens at the Almeida in May.The judges for the prize were costume designer Linda Cho; actors Indira Varma and Jennifer Ehle; Nancy Medina, artistic director of the Bristol Old Vic; playwright Mark Ravenhill; and George Strus, who founded the new work development and community building hubBreaking the Binary theatrein New York.Explore more on these topicsTheatreAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

Tesla’s shares had their worst day since September 2020, falling 15%.The fall came a day after Trumpskirted aroundquestions about a potential recession on Sunday. Asked if he expected a recession, Trump said: “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big … It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.”Kevin Hassett, the head of the national economic council, told CNBC on Monday that any uncertainty around Trump’s trade policies would be resolved by early April and that the policies were “creating jobs in the US”.“It’s starting to have the intended effect of onshoring in the US,” Hassett said, citing recentjob figuresthat showed an increase of 10,000 manufacturing jobs in February. For context, the increase represents about a 0.08% increase in manufacturing jobs, of which there are about 12.7m in the US.Hassett insisted: “There’s a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish going forward,” saying that theTrump administrationwas still aiming for “the biggest tax cuts in history, massive deregulation and a productivity boom from artificial intelligence”.Trump tariffs policy ‘misguided’ and US economy ‘very wobbly’, ex-adviser saysRead more“Everyone is talking about uncertainty. Surely there’s uncertainty in exactly how the trade policy will work itself out, but the tax policy is almost sure to work,” Hassett said.Over the last week, as the US stock market has slumped, Trump and his administration have been busy working the talkshow circuits trying to allay growing concerns of a recession and continue to push for his trade policies.Since coming into office, Trump has started a trade war with America’s three largest trading partners. Trump has increased tariffs on China, first by 10% and now by 20%. He haspulled backon 25% tariffs against goods from Mexico and Canada, though he is still threatening to impose the tariffs against the two countries next month.Atlanta Federal Reserve’s closely followed GDP Now tracker – which forecasts US economic growth – is suggesting the economy could contract in the first three months of the year, largely due to an outsized drag from net trade.Trump has repeatedly balked at the idea that his trade policies have causeduncertainty.Howard Lutnick, Trump’s commerce secretary, told NBC’s Meet the Press: “There’s going to be no recession in America,” comparing doubts about Trump’s trade policies to previous skepticism over Trump winning the election.“You are going to see over the next two years the greatest set of growth coming from America,” Lutnick said.Explore more on these topicsUS economyTrump tariffsTrump administrationStock marketsnewsShareReuse this content"

Butwe are going to stand up to a bully, we’re not going to back down. We’re united and we will retaliate.”Carney has called the threats posed by Trump “the most serious crisis of our lifetime” and said on Sunday that the US wants “our resources, our water, our land, our country”.Daniel Béland, the director of the Institute for the Study of Canada at McGill University, described Carney as a “technocrat”. “He’s a boring guy who in general doesn’t have a lot of charisma,” Béland said. However, he noted that Carney’s rigorous competence with no flash may be appealing, given Canada is rattled by Trump’s trade chaos and attacks on its sovereignty.Carney presents “the image of a reassuring guy who knows what he is talking about,” Béland added.Carney was born in Fort Smith, a small town in the remote Northwest Territories, where his parents were teachers, but he was raised in Edmonton, Alberta’s capital. He attended Harvard University in the US where he played college-level ice hockey, starring as a goalkeeper, and did a master’s at Oxford in the UK.He made a fortune as an investment banker during 13 years at Goldman Sachs, working in New York, London, Tokyo and Toronto before being named deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003. He left in November 2004 for a top finance ministry job and returned to become governor of the central bank in 2008 at the age of 42.Carney won praise for his handling of that year’s financial crisis, when he created new emergency loan facilities and gave unusually explicit guidance on keeping rates at record low levels for a specific period of time.Even back then, rumours swirled that he would seek a career in politics with the Liberals, prompting him to respond with a prickliness that is still sometimes evident.Carney was headhunted in 2013 by the then UK chancellor, George Osborne, as the first non-British governor of the Bank of England and was known at the time by the unlikely epithet of “rock star central banker”.Carney arrived in London determined to bring change to the stuffy Bank. Heintroduced plastic banknotes, and a new approach to communication known as “forward guidance”, which was meant to give investors a clearer idea of which way interest rates were heading.The former innovation proved more immediately successful than the latter. After the Bank was seen as sending out mixed signals on rates, Carney was memorably accused ofbeing an “unreliable boyfriend”by the Labour MP Pat McFadden – then a member of the Treasury select committee, now a powerful Cabinet Office minister.Carney alsowaded into the fractious debate over Brexit, warning repeatedly about the risks to the economy of leaving the EU – leading to accusations that he had politicised the independent Bank.The Conservative politician Jacob Rees-Mogg called him the “high priest of project fear”, but Carney said it was his duty to talk about such risks.When sterling tumbled in the hours after the Brexit referendum result in 2016, Carney delivered a televised address to reassure markets that the Bank would turn on the liquidity taps if needed.“Mark has a rare ability to combine a central banker’s steady hand, with a political reformer’s eye to the future,” said Ana Botín, Santander’s executive chair, in a written comment to Reuters. She said Carney “steadied the ship” in the UK after Brexit.He left the Bank of England in 2020, and then served as a UN envoy on finance and climate change, continuing to write and work on an area he emphasised as governor: the need for financial markets to catch up with the risks of the climate crisis.In a much-quotedspeech from 2015, he warned that efforts to tackle global heating were compromised by “the tragedy of the horizon” – politicians’ and markets’ inability to look beyond the next few years.In his 2021 book Value(s) – subtitled “An Economist’s Guide to Everything that Matters” – Carney enlarged on the idea, and attacked finance-driven capitalism more broadly, for losing sight of society’s needs.Carney remains an influential figure on the global economic stage, and the UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, hailedhis endorsement at the 2023 Labour conference.When it emerged in January that he wasconsidering a run to replace Trudeau, Carney, who has four daughters, told the Financial Times he would be “considering this decision closely with my family”. He launched his bid for the Liberal leadership on 16 January.Although his path to office appeared unusual, Carney told supporters in Edmonton in January: “Our times are anything but ordinary.” However, Carney may not be prime minister for long, with a general election due to be held by 20 October that the opposition Conservatives are slight favourites to win, according to polls. The Conservatives are led by Pierre Poilievre, a career politician with little international exposure.Lori Turnbull, of Dalhousie University, said Carney may struggle to connect with voters. “He’s not a particularly great communicator when it comes to the public,” she said. “He is unusually well-equipped to deal with economic crises” but “it’s very hard to see how anybody would be successful in politics if you can’t bring people onboard with you,” she told Agence France-Presse.“The Conservatives are trying to cast him as an elite who doesn’t understand what regular people go through. And I think if he can’t communicate well, then he runs the risk of being typecast in that way,” Turnbull said.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseThis article was amended on 10 March 2025. An earlier version saidMark Carneywould be the first person to become Canadian prime minister “without being an MP or having cabinet experience”. Others have become Canadian prime minister without being an MP, or having had cabinet experience, at the time of their appointment; Carney is the only one to have never been an MP at the time of his appointment.Explore more on these topicsMark CarneyCanadaAmericasDonald TrumpprofilesShareReuse this content"

The platform, formerly known as Twitter, had been unresponsive for many users as posts failed to load.“We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources,” the platform’s CEOposted. “Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved.”Downdetector, a website thatmonitors outageson various sites and platforms, showed thousands of reports of outages that initially spiked at about 5.45am before returning to normal for a few hours. A second surge in reported outages carried on throughout midday, with the majority of them occurring on the company’s mobile app.Tweets that failed to appear displayed a message that “something went wrong” and told users to try reloading.The richest man in the world did not provide any evidence for his claims. His post came in response to a cryptocurrency influencer who suggested the outage followed other opposition to Musk’s enterprises. Protests against the so-called “department of government efficiency” initiative Musk leads andvandalism against Tesla dealershipshad taken place throughout the previous week.Musk reiterated his claim of a cyber-attack during an interview on Fox Business later that day, suggesting that the perpetrators may have been from Ukraine.“We’re not sure exactly what happened but there was a massive cyber-attack to try and bring down theXsystem with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area,” Musk said.Musk has been heavily critical of the Ukrainian government as relations between it and the Trump administration have soured. Musk stated over the weekend that the country’s “entire front line” would collapse if he turned off his Starlink satellite communications provider and called the Democratic senator Mark Kelly a “traitor” after the lawmaker posted about a visit he made to the country.The SpaceX chief executive, who acquired Twitter for $44bn in 2022, has also claimed that previous platform outages were the result of cyber-attacks.

How do you appear to look busy enough to appease an ever-present boss?Thirty years ago, Seinfeld’s George Costanza had atheory: “Always look annoyed.” That way, “people think that you’re busy.” Today, performative productivity goes by a new name.“Bosses beware, gen Z are ‘taskmasking’,”reada recent, rather narc-y Fortune story. “They’re going the extra mile to look like they’re working hard while actually hardly working.” One example of taskmasking: moving quickly though the office while carrying a laptop or clipboard – straight out of a West Wing walk-and-talk. Another example: typing loudly, like a DMV employee having a bad day, even if what you’re typing has no relevance to your job.Both a TikTok trend and something managers and HR types are seeing in action, the rise of taskmasking comes as more employers mandate a return to office. In September, Amazonannouncedit would require all workers to come in five days a week, as if it were 2019 all over again. Companies including Goldman Sachs, Dell, Condé Nast and the Washington Post issued similar decrees. (A couple of small hitches: because their offices don’t have enough space for all employees to comfortably work together, Amazon delayed return-to-office and Condé Nast’s editorial union isprotestingthe requirement.)A swath of the US’s young office workers came of age when the pandemic required staying home. This might be the first time they’ve been asked to consistently commute to a job site instead of getting tasks done on their own schedule, in the privacy of their home. Now, physically surrounded by colleagues and higher-ups, they must learn to visually communicate busyness.In 2019, the culture writer Anne Helen Petersen described the similar phenomenon of “Larping your job,” borrowing the acronym forlive action role playing.“You can Larp your job in person (holding lots of meetings, staying late and getting there early as a show of ‘presentism’) and digitally (sending lots of emails, spending a lot of time on Slack, or whatever group chat platform your organization uses),” Petersonwrote.Gabrielle Judge, a 28-year-old content creator and writer known as theAnti Work Girlboss,used to work in tech and remembers the ways she and her coworkers would taskmask or Larp their jobs in the office.“People would look really busy when they were actually just getting lunch, or would wear their AirPods all day so it looked like they were in meetings,” Judge said. “A lot of people would also just stare intensely at their computers.”Coffee breaks or water cooler meetups – that is, if offices still have the antiquated device – count as taskmasking if coworkers talk about their jobs rather than last night’s big game or award show. “You can drum up a conversation with someone to look busy,” Judge said. “There’s a lot of performative work at the office.”While taskmasking might not help get any real work done, it can feel like a full-time job of its own. “It’s exhausting having to mask all the time at work,” Judge said. “We get so tired going into an office, even if you didn’t do anything differently than you would at home. It’s just the tiredness that comes with the social exhaustion of playing a role.”Cierra Gross runs Caged Bird HR, anindependent human resources consulting firmthat workers hire to help with workplace claims of harassment and discrimination. Before leaving corporate life in 2022 after experiencing burnout and depression, Gross spent years in traditional HR departments at Google and ExxonMobil. She calls taskmasking a symptom of the broader issues surrounding hiring, talent management and workforce planning – namely, bosses’ desire to get folks back in the office at all costs, mostly for the show of it.“It is inevitable that there will be people who try to game the system in every company,” Gross said. “Taskmasking might be associated with low performers, but high performers who quickly finish their work can also do it, too.”It’s not uncommon for workers to complete a big project and then have nothing to do in the office. “As far as your manager is concerned, your work is done, so you can just sit at a computer and surf the web,” Gross said.We can expect taskmasking to stay strong as more workers outsource the brunt of busy work toAI, freeing up their days for more loud water cooler conversations and fake typing sessions. Still, bosses may be on to them: a 2021 study found that 80% of companies monitor remote and hybrid workers, with many usingspecialized softwareto track online activity, location and keystrokes. And according to Wired, the surveillancecontinuesinside offices too, where new technology – including motion, light intensity and humidity sensors – is available to bosses who want to spy on specific rooms and desks.For now, taskmasking lives on as a way for employees to take back some control. “Gen Z has graduated high school and college remotely, done so many milestones from home, so the idea that work can only be done in an office is so far off,” Judge said. “Taskmasking is a result of how people feel bitter and frustrated over this. I think it begs the question to employers: how important is being together?”"

He replaces Geno Smith, who was traded to the Las Vegas Raiders last week. Darnold’s deal is reported to include $55m in guaranteed money.Darnold, the No 3 overall pick in the 2018 draft by the New York Jets, thrived under AP Coach of the Year Kevin O’Connell’s guidance in 2024. He threw for 4,319 yards, 35 touchdowns and 12 interceptions with a passer rating of 102.5. Darnold also became the fourth player inNFLhistory to amass 12 games with multiple TD passes and a passer rating of 100 or higher in a season, joining Aaron Rodgers (14) Patrick Mahomes (13) and Matt Ryan (12).NFL roundup: Bills give Allen reported $330m extension as Steelers trade for DK MetcalfRead moreBut Darnold, who was picked for the Pro Bowl, had two of his worst games back to back when Minnesota needed him most. The Vikings had a chance to earn the NFC’s No 1 seed but lost 31-9 to Detroit in Week 18. They ended up as the No 5 seed and were dominated by the Los Angeles Rams in the playoffs, who sacked Darnold nine times, intercepted him once and forced him into a lost fumble.The move means JJ McCarthy, the Vikings’ first-round pick in 2024, is likely to be the team’s starting quarterback this coming season. McCarthy sat out last season through injury.Meanwhile, the Jets appear to have filled their starting quarterback slot. They have reportedly come to terms with Justin Fields on a two-year, $40m deal. Fields was the No 11 overall pick in the 2021 draft when the Jets selected another quarterback, Zach Wilson, at No 2. Wilson has since left the team after a miserable career in New York, and was replaced by Aaron Rodgers, who also stumbled with a team beset by poor ownership and questionable personnel choices.New York now will hope that Fields can revive his career with the Jets, who have a new regime in head coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey. Fields will be reunited with wide receiver Garrett Wilson, his former college teammate. Fields has passed for 7,780 yards and 45 touchdowns with 31 interceptions in 50 games, including 44 starts in four seasons. He has rushed for 19 scores.Elsewhere on Monday, reports emerged that the Los Angeles Chargers will bring back edge rusher Khalil Mack with a one-year deal for a fully guaranteed $18m and part with running back Gus Edwards. Mack, who turned 34 last month, made the Pro Bowl in each of his first three seasons with the Chargers. He has missed only one game in that span while recording 31 sacks and 49 quarterback hits in 50 starts. Edwards was released to save more than $3m against the 2025 salary cap.In Tampa, Pro Bowl edge rusher Haason Reddick reportedly agreed to a one-year deal with the Buccaneers worth $14m. The deal is understood to include $12m guaranteed. Reddick is coming off a season in which he didn’t play until late October amid a contract-related holdout situation with the Jets, who obtained Reddick last March from the Philadelphia Eagles for a conditional 2026 draft pick.The Bucs’ top free agent, Chris Godwin, has also reportedly opted to re-sign with the team rather than depart for more money elsewhere, signing a $66m, three-year contract.The Washington Commanders, meanwhile, made two big splashes, reportedly agreeing to terms with defensive tackle Javon Kinlaw and acquiring standout offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil in a trade with the Houston Texans. Coming off the best season-to-season improvement in franchise history – from 4-13 to 12-5 – and an improbable run to the NFC championship game in quarteeback Jayden Daniels’ spectacular rookie year, Washington had among the most salary cap space in the league, with more than $80m to spend before agreeing to terms with Kinlaw and trading for Tunsil.Teams can’t officially sign free agents until Wednesday, the start of the new league year.Explore more on these topicsNFLMinnesota VikingsSeattle SeahawksUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Ratcliffe is clear that this is the fault of players his football department inheritedwhen taking over last year, the billionaire Ineos owner referencing the transfer fee instalments they will have to pay in the close season.“If you look at the players we are buying this summer, that we didn’t buy, we’re buying Antony, we’re buying Casemiro, we’re buying Onana, we’re buying Højlund, we’re buying Sancho,” Ratcliffe said in an interview with the BBC. “These are all things from the past, whether we like it or not, we’ve inherited those things and have to sort that out.“For Sancho, who now plays for Chelsea [on loan] and we pay half his wages, we’re paying £17m to buy him in the summer. It takes time for us to move away from the past into a new place in the future.”Antony is also on loan at Real Betis, after his £81m transfer from Ajax in 2022 during the same summer Casemiro arrived for £70m from Real Madrid. Højlund, who cost £72m from Atalanta, and Onana (£47m from Inter), joined the following summer. Ratcliffe was asked if he meant this quintet are not of the requisite quality for United.View image in fullscreenAngry Manchester United fans protested about the state of the club before the draw with Arsenal on Sunday.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images“Some are not good enough and some probably are overpaid, but for us to mould the squad that we are fully responsible for, and accountable for, will take time,” the 72-year-old said. “We’ve got this period of transformation where we move from the past to the future. There are some great players in the squad as we know, the captain is a fabulous footballer. We definitely need Bruno [Fernandes] – he’s a fantastic footballer.”After Ten Hag was sacked on 28 October, Amorim was hired on a two-and a-half-year deal. Ratcliffe suggested the Portuguese coach would be in charge for far longer. “If I actually look at the squad which is available to Ruben, I think he is doing a really good job, to be honest,” he said. “I think that Ruben is an outstanding young manager. I really do. He’s an excellent manager and I think he will be there for a long time. You are beginning to see a glimpse of what Ruben can produce. I think you saw a glimpse of it against Arsenal.”Ratcliffe pointed to injuries as mitigation regarding United’s league position and the number of young players named as substitutesin Sunday’s 1-1 drawagainst Arsenal. “How many players against Arsenal on the bench did you recognise? How many have ever worn a Manchester United shirt for [the first team] – there’s no squad left. We are down to the last 10 or 11 men in the squad really, of proper first-team players. Ruben is doing a super job.”United’s finances are severely constricted after losing £300m in the past three years. Yet despitebuying only Patrick Dorgu for €30m(£25.1m), plus up to €5m of add-ons, in the January window, Ratcliffe said Amorim would have money to spend in the summer market. “Obviously that budget changes – but upon who we may choose to sell because that would supplement the budget.”View image in fullscreenJim Ratcliffe revealed United would still be paying for Rasmus Højlund’s transfer fee this summer.Photograph: Getty Images/Sportsphoto/AllstarAs homegrown players, Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho would represent 100% profit under profitability and sustainability rules. But Ratcliffe denied they and other academy players would be sold to generate funds. “No. We won’t be selling players because of the state we are in financially.”Ten Hag came close to losing his job last May when Ratcliffe assessed several alternatives. The Dutchman remained in place and was consulted regarding a summer spend of £200m. Ratcliffe admitted that not removing him then was a mistake, along with the hiring of Dan Ashworth, the sporting directorwho departed in December.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think there were some mitigating circumstances, but ultimately they were errors. I accept that and I apologise for that. If you look at the time we made the decision about Erik – the [new] management team hadn’t been in place for more than five minutes. It became clearer three months later and we got it wrong. We corrected it and we are in a very different place today.”Ratcliffe’s Mission 21 aims to claim United a 21st title by 2028, the club’s 150th anniversary, and he believes this remains realistic. “I don’t think it’s mission impossible. I think it’s good to have goals and objectives,” he told the Times. “Liverpool is quite a good example regarding timing, where Jürgen Klopp came in 2015. The process of rebuilding the squad in Liverpool started in summer 2015, they rebuilt the squad in 2015, ’16, ’17 and ’18, then in the next three years they won everything.”Ratcliffe is to make another 200 redundancies for a total of 450 since he took over last February. Other money-generating decisions includeclosing the club canteen, ending free lunches for staffand the raising of the minimum ticket price for all categories to £66.Ratcliffe emphasised the necessity of these cuts, saying the club would have gone bust by this coming Christmas without them. The Guardian firstrevealed Ratcliffe’s fearsover United running out of money in February.“Manchester United would have run out of cash by the end of this year – by the end of 2025 – after having me put $300m [£232.72m] in and if we buy no new players in the summer,” he said. “We are in the process of change and it’s an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans. The simple answer is the club runs out of money at Christmas if we don’t do those things.“The club had got bloated so we reduced that and will finish it with a lean and efficient organisation. That’s how we will address the costs. The player decisions will all be focused on how we are going to improve performance. That’s all.”Ratcliffe also defended his stated focus on the men’s side over the women’s team. “Of our £650m of income, £640m of that comes from the men’s team and £10m comes from the women’s team,” he said. “With my business background you tend to focus on the bigger issues before you focus on the smaller issues.”An announcement is expected on Tuesday regarding plans for what the club has previously said may be “the most iconic football stadium in the world”. This would be built to replace Old Trafford on the current stadium’s site.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedJim RatcliffeRuben AmorimErik ten HagnewsShareReuse this content"

Curry, who played for the Wildcats from 2006 to 2009 will offer guidance to the men’s and women’s basketball teams. Curry has plenty of experience to draw from: he is a two-time MVP, four-time NBA champion and 11-time All-Star with the Golden State Warriors. The 36-year-old will combine his administrative duties while continuing his playing career with the Warriors, who are in playoff contention this season.“The Davidson experience is top notch,” Curry said in a statement. “My journey from when I got to Davidson in 2006 to now demonstrated that I had the opportunity to play basketball at the highest level, got a great education, an amazing network through the Davidson alumni and continue to wave the Davidson flag. I want very talented, high character student athletes to have that same experience.”Nikola Jokić is putting up record numbers. So why is he unlikely to be NBA MVP?Read moreCurry will work alongside general manager Austin Buntz, with whom he has a longstanding relationship. Buntz is a former executive at Under Armour, one of Curry’s major sponsors. Curry will also be part of an eight-figure fund to support the men’s and women’s basketball teams at Davidson.Curry has retained close ties with Davidson. He has been inducted into the school’s Hall of Fame after breaking the NCAA single-season record for three-pointers in 2008, the same season he led the Wildcats to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. He also returned to Davidson in 2022 to complete his undergraduate career.Davidson have a relatively modest record. The men’s team have reached the NCAA Tournament five times since Curry was drafted No 7 overall by the Warriors in 2009 but have not progressed past the second round during that period. The women’s team have never made the NCAA Tournament.Curry’s path is similar to that of former NFL quarterback Andrew Luck,who returned to his alma mater, Stanford, as an assistant GM in 2024. His return to his alma mater gives the Atlantic 10 conference two high-profile alums in basketball management positions, after former ESPNNBA newsbreaker Adrian Wojnarowskiresigned in order to be general manager of the St Bonaventure men’s basketball team last year.Explore more on these topicsStephen CurryGolden State WarriorsNBABasketballCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

So why is he unlikely to be NBA MVP?The three-time MVP has a strong case to win his fourth award. But that is to ignore the brilliance – and freshness – of Shai Gilgeous-AlexanderJacob UittiMon 10 Mar 2025 07.55 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 14.24 EDTShareOn Sunday afternoon, two of the best teams in the NBA’s Western Conference faced off on national television. When it was over,the Oklahoma City Thunder had routed the Denver Nuggets 127-103, pulling away in the fourth quarter thanks to a barrage from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who had 40 points on the day. But because it was theNBA, the game was less about the teams and more about the stars at the center of the action – who just so happen to be the league’s top two MVP candidates.Denver’sNikola Jokićhas been named NBA MVP three times in the past four years. That’s rarefied air. Only three men – Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and Larry Bird – have won the award three times in a row. And only a small number of guys, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson and LeBron James, have won it three out of four years. The year Jokić didn’t win it during his streak, he lost a close vote to Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid in an especially heated contest that includedaccusations of racism.But more than racially charged conversations, questions of history and voter fatigue are central when it comes toNBAaccolades. Not only do voters take into account the current season but they also consider the bigger picture of league history. And that is exactly what they will be doing again this year when selecting between the league’s top two candidates, Jokić and Gilgeous-Alexander. These things don’t take place in a vacuum.Magic in the air: how the slam dunk evolved alongside basketballRead moreWhen Embiid won the MVP Award for the 2022-23 season, some voters, whether they would admit it or not, didn’t want to make Jokić the fourth player in NBA history to earn three MVP Awards in a row. He was good, butas good asBird, Wilt and Russell? Did the voters want to saythatwith their vote, too? There was even speculation that Jokić played a little below his standard down the stretch that season so as not to invite comparison to thosethree hallowed players. Never mind that Jokić’s team won the NBA title that season.This year, in ESPN reporterTim Bontemps’ popular straw poll,the top two MVP finishers from likely voters were Gilgeous-Alexander and Jokić, with the Canadian earning the top spot. Maybe it’s because Jokić is a three time winner while the 26-year-old Gilgeous-Alexander is the new kid on the block. Not only are the Thunder comfortably in first place in the West, he’s the main reason why. He’s also leading the league in scoring, and he finished second in MVP voting last year (losing out to Jokić in his highest finish so far). And while there have been several perennial MVP winners in the past, the voters often likes to reward the newcomer. It makes for a better narrative.In 2017, triple-double machine Russell Westbrook kept Steph Curry from winning three in a row. A few years prior, Kevin Durant stopped James from doing the same. That wasn’t the first time a player had stopped James getting three is succession: Derrick Rose was the man to do so in 2011. Charles Barkley blocked Michael Jordan from his own personal three-peat in the early 90s – there are plenty more examples throughout NBA history of this happening. In a close race, the fresh face usually gets the nod in the voting over the established incumbent.But that raises the question whether the race should be close this year. As of this writing, as Denver and OKC prepare to meet again on Monday night,Jokić is third in the NBAin rebounding (12.9 per game) and points per game (28.9) and second in assists (10.6). No one in history haseverfinished in the top three in all of those categories for a season. Not Jordan, James or Wilt. On the other hand, Gilgeous-Alexander leads the league in scoring (32.8 per game) and his team are 52-11, coming off their beatdown of Denver on Sunday.Wins matter and Gilgeous-Alexander’s team are second in the entire NBA in that category, just a game behind the 53-10 Cleveland Cavaliers. The Thunder are also a whopping 12 games ahead of Denver in the standings. And if they keep up that pace, their guard will win his first MVP. It’s a lock. Even after Sunday’s game, Stephen A Smith declared the race over after he, and the rest of the country, witnessed Gilgeous-Alexander dominate the fourth quarter and balloon his team’s margin of victory to more than 20 points,capped off by a beautiful hezzy layup.Jokić defenders will point to his performance just a few days ago when the Serbian big man tallied a never-before-seen 31 points, 21 rebounds and 22 assists in a game over thespiraling Phoenix Suns. How can someone who can put up a stat line likethatnot be the world’s best? Well maybe he is the player you’d choose first to face theproverbial alien invaders, but that doesn’t mean he will get the MVPthis year. James has long been considered the face of the NBA but he’s won the MVP only four times in his decades-long career.As of this writing, Gilgeous-Alexander isa huge betting favoriteto win MVP over Jokić in distant second. And unless Gilgeous-Alexander incurs an injury or his team fall off a cliff, he will take home the hardware. Just don’t expect him to stay at the top of the heap for long. That’s just how it goes.Explore more on these topicsNBANikola JokićOklahoma City ThunderDenver NuggetsBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The exciting stuff, they hope, comes when they return to London with hopes of ending their long wait for silverware this weekend. The Carabao Cup final approaches and, for all that this performance will not have sent a shiver down Liverpool’s spine, Eddie Howe was entitled to dwell on the positives after his side boosted their hopes of Champions League qualification with a professional victory over West Ham.It was vital that spirits were lifted after last week’sexit from the FA Cupwas compounded by a handful of key players being ruled out against Liverpool. That made the avoidance of further injuries highly welcome, while a first clean sheet in over a month was satisfying before Newcastle plot how to keep Mohamed Salah quiet. Howe, though, will not get carried away. Liverpool will pose far more questions than a limited, cautious West Ham attack managed here. Newcastle, who were clearly holding back at times, did not have to do much beyond wait for Bruno Guimarães to score the goal that lifted them two points off fourth place.West Ham v Newcastle: Premier League – liveRead more“A massive win,” Howe said. “One of our best games of the season. I thought we dug in, we were disciplined. We defended our goal magnificently. We’ve had a challenging week. It’s a brilliant response. It’s exactly what we needed. We needed the players to empty the tank.”Howe went on to praise Guimarães, who has come under fire in recent weeks. “Bruno’s been brilliant for us,” he said. “He stands up in the big moments.” Guimarães then produced some big talk, saying the final is “like the World Cup” for Newcastle. “We want to make history for this club,” Newcastle’s captain said.A night that began with the home fans paying tribute to Michail Antonio, who made an emotional appearance three monthsafter breaking a legin a horrific car crash, saw West Ham in a deceptively dangerous mood early on. Newcastle, their defence shorn of key personnel, had a scare when Mohammed Kudus exposed Fabian Schär inside the first minute. The Ghanaian’s wicked delivery exposed holes left by Sven Botman’s absence with a knee injury but Tino Livramento atoned for a dozy attempt at a clearance by forcing Tomas Soucek to shoot over.View image in fullscreenMichail Antonio is given a warm welcome by West Ham supporters in a pre-match appearance.Photograph: Dalton Bowden/ShutterstockLivramento was in at left-back for Lewis Hall, sidelined for the rest of the campaign, and West Ham sought opportunities down his flank. Another attack followed, Jarrod Bowen the instigator this time, Dan Burn almost turning the forward’s cross into his own net.Yet West Ham’s aggression subsided. Newcastle asserted themselves, even if thoughts often drifted to Wembley. Harvey Barnes, desperate to prove he can provide solutions on the left with Anthony Gordon suspended, tested Alphonse Areola when he flicked Kieran Trippier’s shot goalwards.The mood was tepid. Newcastle probed patiently, Guimarães and Sandro Tonali clever in midfield, and advanced into decent crossing positions. West Ham responded with flashes from Kudus and Bowen, who shot at Nick Pope after a slip from Livramento. Areola pushed away a header from Barnes.Newcastle, who fretted at Tonali needing treatment after being caught by James Ward-Prowse, laboured. West Ham squeezed the space with a compact back five but they too lacked conviction in attack. Kudus was timid and tackled by Trippier when clean through. “It’s not quite happening for him,” Graham Potter said of a forward who has gone 12 games without a goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is a necessary departure from the disorder of Julen Lopetegui’s reign, a way to protect a team woefully short of speed, but it has come at the expense of attacking ingenuity. With a midfield of Edson Álvarez, Ward-Prowse and Soucek providing zero dynamism or invention, Kudus and Bowen are doing a lot of heavy lifting. For Potter, the challenge for the rest of the season is working out how to strengthen in the summer.West Ham, who are in little danger of going down, meandered. Newcastle stirred, forcing Areola into acrobatics to prevent Max Kilman scoring an own goal. Alexander Isak turned the rebound over but the visitors were playing with more belief. They pushed again and Barnes dinked an inviting cross to the far post for Guimarães, who escaped Ollie Scarles and poked past Areola from close range. Isak, with a little shove on Kilman, had cleared the path for his teammate. “It’s clear,” Potter said. “It’s two hands on the back.”Potter’s complaints fell on deaf ears. He responded by throwing on Lucas Paquetá, Carlos Soler and Evan Ferguson. Paquetá tried to release Bowen, who appealed for a penalty after tangling with Guimarães. West Ham, beaten in three of five home games under Potter, were shut out. They did nothing; Newcastle did enough.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedNewcastle Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Now he wants to get on his bikeSid LoweMon 10 Mar 2025 11.52 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 17.21 EDTShareAt the end of training on Friday, as Real Valladolid’s players left the annex next to the José Zorrilla stadium and headed off under grey skies, rain preparing to roll in, a surprise waited for them. It was the final session before the weekend their coach said would show what hopes they had, an opportunity not so much to save their season as still have one, and there was he was: the Original Ronaldo, in the flesh. He came to encourage them, he said, going round the dressing room reminding them what it means to be committed, always. “Thank you for accompanying the team before the Valencia game!” the club tweeted, exclamation included.The Brazilian, after all, is one of the greatest footballers ever.He is also their owner and president. But still this was unexpected: they hadn’t seen him for months and didn’t think they would see him now either. He had been in the directors’ box for Valladolid’s first game of the season, which they had won, and when they played Real Madrid at the Bernabéu the following week too, which they hadn’t. Since then, as they watched their team slide towards the second division, abandoned to an increasingly inevitable fate, he hadn’t been back. “Where is the president?” supporters had sung. One day in November, while they were playing Getafe, he was playing tennis. They knew that because he had broadcast it on Twitch. So the following week, they set up a game in the stands, giant foam rackets hitting a ball back and forth.View image in fullscreenReal Valladolid owner Ronaldo poses at the Fifa Best awards in 2024.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/ReutersMostly, they have sung for him to “go home”, when he already was. He had been atthe derby in the Champions Leaguein midweek, making that as many Real Madrid matches as Valladolid games he has been to this season, and more at the Bernabéu than at the Zorrilla. He had better things to do. Like joining Kaká on court. And becoming president of his country’s FA, because he had donesucha good job with his club. And, well, just about anything else, because actually being with his team isn’t much fun. But then suddenly on Fridaythere he was, telling them all about commitment and sacrifice, the demands, the pride and honour needed to defend a historic shirt: “The only way to compete in the top flight,” as the club’s communique had it.Bottom of the table, time slipping away and the abyss opening beneath them, they had to try something. Maybe they thought this was like that time Rodrygo touched Ronaldo’s legs, hoping that some of his magicwould rub off on him. The following afternoon Valladolid faced Valencia, the last of the teams in the relegation zone, safety eight points away. They had not won in eight but perhaps here was an opportunity, something to cling to, however precarious. “The situation is critical for both of us; the result will show us what chances we have,” the head coach Álvaro Rubio said. Ronaldo had come to tell them how important it was.And then he hopped in his car and headed home, 150km south.Maybe he watched on telly but the next day Ronaldo – like Peter Lim’s son Kim Liat, Valencia’s new president – wasn’t at Mestalla to see his side lose for the 19th time this season. He wasn’t there to see them concede after seven minutes, to see them handed a lifeline just before half-time, Giorgi Mamardashvili gifting Juanmi Latasa an equaliser, or to see them let go again. Or to console Raúl Moro as he sobbed at full time. He wasn’t on hand to head to the dressing room and remind them of their obligations, not this time, nor to face the yellow flags high in the stands as his team slipped 11 points adrift, as good as gone with 11 games left.Beaten 2-1 thanks to Umar Sadiq’s winner, this was Valladolid’s seventh defeat in eight, a single point secured from the last 24 available. “Their second goal killed us,” Latasa said, but it has been over for weeks. For the first time in 20 games, when the whistle went Valencia had pulled out of the relegation zone; Valladolid had become resigned to the probability that they never will.It wasn’t supposed to be this way. When Ronaldo bought a 50% share in the club for €30m in 2018 – a share he increased to 82% last summer – he said that the “normal” outcome was that they would be “in the Champions League in five seasons”. To begin with there really was a buzz about the place, an energy. And if the players weren’t as good as he was – he tells the story of telling Keko Gontan how to stay cool in front of goal, only for the strikerto shoot back“but you’reIl Fenomeno”– he enjoyed spending time with them, being part of it all. That early enthusiasm, though, has long gone, and so mostly has he.View image in fullscreenRonaldo attends a press conference in September 2018 after taking control of Real Valladolid.Photograph: César Manso/AFP/Getty ImagesThe enthusiasm has given way to crisis, the fracture widening. There have been confrontations with local politicians, protests against the owner, the board and the sporting director, anger directed at players too. “We know it’s hard, we know the situation is screwed up,” defender Luis Pérez said after he was abused a few weeks ago. “The situation off the pitch doesn’t help: when the fans are against their own players it’s even harder. It can’t get worse for me so I can say it loud and clear: I get insulted by them when all I want is the same as them, to survive.”Mostly there has been a feeling of abandonment which made his appearance on Thursday all the more unexpected. Ronaldo’s right-hand men, David Espinar and Matthieu Fenaert, have left; when the new CEO took over in February, he said the task now was “to get our dignity back”. Ronaldo wants to sell, and not just because he can’t stand for the presidency of the Brazilian federation for as long as he is still the owner. But when potential buyers come they too find that he disappears; he, meanwhile, says that no one has matched his valuation.Valladolid made a profit in sales – more than €40m over the last five years – but, fans ask, for what? And where has the money gone? This is a club in crisis, on the verge of a third relegation fromLa Ligain a row. Nineteenth in 2021, 18th in 2023, they are 20th now and few imagine another first division return. In the summer, 11 players departed and five arrived: four on loan, and Latasa for €2.5m, the striker who scored three league goals in his last two seasons. At promotion celebrations, their own coach, Paulo Pezzolano, led chants for his own sacking, echoing what he had heard all season and would hear again soon enough. He lasted until November, when he was axed after a 5-0 defeat by Atlético. That night many home fans had ironically applauded their own team’s errors andolé-d their opponents then walked out, gone before the fifth.Rubio took over then and again when Diego Cocca was sacked in February, Valladolid’s second and fourth manager of the season. Cocca lasted eight games which felt like a long time; swiftly disillusioned, he had been asking to be sacked for a while, almost literally. They would need winter signings, he said, and if not he might not be around much longer: instead the window was marked more by the departures of Kike Pérez, Lucas Rosa and Juma Bah. Cocca won just one league game; he also oversaw Valladolid’s exit from the cup at the hands of third-tier Ourense. Pezzolano had lasted 15, winning two. Rubio had had five so far; there are 11 more to endure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Óscar Puente recently insisted: “In 56 years I haven’t seen a more ineffective Real Valladolid than this, a team with less quality, less confidence and less character, one as lost as this.” The former city mayor and now a government minister with whom Ronaldo has publicly fallen out, perhaps Puentewouldsay that, but that doesn’t necessarily make him wrong.View image in fullscreenValencia’s César Tárrega (left) challenges Anuar Mohamed during the win over Valladolid.Photograph: Maria Jose Segovia/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockSometimes beyond all the analysis, all the context, there’s something simple: Valladolid are just not very good, just not quite the real thing: they have a player called Grillitsch, which feels appropriate somehow. The worst side inprimera, they have lost the most and won the least, conceded the most and scored the least too; they have lost more games away than anyone and more games at home too. They have only even led a game five times. No one has faced more shots. Their top scorer has three goals. Barcelona put seven past them, so did Athletic.

But while this latest defeat was only 2-1, close compared to the 18 goals they had let in during February, and while they sent their president in the day before and goalkeeper up in the last minute, a glimpse of a drama that wasn’t really there, Saturday provided another portrait of their limitations – in fact, Diario de Valladolid called it a “triumph”, not getting battered is as a good as it gets for a team that’s like “a fighter whose only objective is not to see his teeth go flying”. So too did coach’s pre-match comments in which he reduced his tactical changes to “shaking the tree”. Just see what falls.And what falls is Valladolid, as has sadly seemed likely from the start. “We came with all the hope in the world,” Latasa said. But now there is none, the magic gone.PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona2646572Real Madrid2731573Atletico Madrid2726564Athletic Bilbao2721495Villarreal2612446Real Betis272417Mallorca27-7378Rayo Vallecano270369Celta Vigo27-13610Sevilla27-43611Real Sociedad27-53412Getafe2713313Osasuna26-53314Girona26-53215Espanyol25-122716Valencia27-152717Leganes27-162718Alaves27-102619Las Palmas27-152420Valladolid27-4416Explore more on these topicsLa LigaEuropean club footballValladolidfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But despite the high stakes, a 15-point lead in the Premier League and a Carabao Cup final to come against Newcastle on Sunday, Slot claimed he could not dream of potential silverware given PSG’s dominance on home soil last Wednesday.“In a week like this I do not dream at all,” the Liverpool head coach said. “I just know I have to work really, really hard to prepare the team in the best possible way.“If you have a game like we did last week you feel: ‘Can I even go to sleep at all or do I have to watch even more?’ So, no, I do not dream at all about this week. It started very well in terms ofbeating Southampton.

What I mean by complete is, OK, we have faced Arsenal and City and they are not big margins, but the intensity they played at combined with the quality they have and they are one of the richest clubs. Maybe there is one club a bit further ahead.“They have so much quality and a great manager who has the team playing in a way that is not easy to play against. He brings the best out of every player and brings out an incredible work-rate. We have to be at our best. But we didn’t have ball possession at City away – the other richest club in the world together withParis Saint-Germain– and at home we had a completely different performance against City.”Reports from the PSG dressing room have claimed Luis Enrique’s players felt Arsenal and Bayern Munich were tougher opponents in the Champions League group than Liverpool. Slot did not rise to the bait, insisting PSG have changed and improved since the group phase, but he denied the Premier League leaders were poor in Paris.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’d never seen someone coach that way’Suzanne WrackBudding coach talks role models, marathon running and the excellence of Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-SkellyMon 10 Mar 2025 18.30 EDTShareIf there are nerves whenJack Wilsherewalks into the room and sits behind the table emblazoned with the England logo, they are not evident.The 33-year-old has been in press conference rooms many times as a player, but as a head coach it is an alien proposition. He is at St George’s Park and is part of a cohort of 25 on the Uefa Pro Licence course who are briefed on a fictional scenario they might face as a head coach before they take a seat in front of a small group of journalists to be brutally grilled on it. The process is a little extreme and not entirely true to life, but it is designed to put them under pressure and test the media skills they have learned that day.‘I don’t want to say that’: Arteta refuses to give up on title despite United drawRead moreThe fictional scenarios are far from straightforward, but Wilshere is unfazed. There is a humanity, an honesty, and an all-around likability to him that means that when he steps away from the table after his interrogation there is little to fault.When Wilshere, who in real life is a first-team coach at Norwich, sits down with the same journalists afterwards to be interviewed, those humble characteristics are mixed with a burning ambition. It is evident the pursuit of excellence that drove him as a player has been rechannelled into his coaching.“I like to have an end goal in sight and that is to be a head coach,” he says confidently, before admitting that was not always the case. Plenty of players do coaching badges routinely while they are still playing with one eye on a possible future career path, but it was watching theArsenalmanager, Mikel Arteta, that lit the coaching spark. “Mikel was the one,” says Wilshere. “I’d never seen someone coach that way, I’d never seen his passion, I’d never seen how he would try to teach the players, both in meetings and on the pitch. I was invited back to train when I was between clubs, I saw it, I was on my Uefa A Licence at the time and it inspired me.”In July 2022, four daysafter Wilshere had hung up his boots, he was appointed head coach of Arsenal’s under-18s and guided the team to the 2023 FA Youth Cup final in his first season,which they lost to West Ham. After two years and three months with Arsenal’s youngsters a first senior opportunity arose, as a first-team coach under Johannes Hoff Thorup at Norwich.View image in fullscreenJack Wilshere and Mikel Arteta during a training session at London Colney in 2014.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/AFC/Getty Images“I love it,” says Wilshere. “When I first started my coaching journey, I wouldn’t say senior football scared me, but it was the unknown and I wanted to go in at under-18s level.” At the end of his second year in the Arsenal academy he had “the itch to go to a first team”, but he could still see an opportunity for self-development, so he stayed, until the Norwich sporting director, Ben Knapper, called and made a move into senior football feel “like the right step”.Wilshere played at the top level, accruing 34 England caps and demonstrating exceptional skill in midfield, but coaching is like “starting anew”, he says. “It doesn’t matter how good you were as a player, how bad you were as a player, whatever you want. It’s a completely different skillset you need.”View image in fullscreenEthan Nwaneri signs for Arsenal’s under-eights with Jack Wilshere in 2015.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/AFC/Getty ImagesIt can be hard for a player of such prodigious talent to work with people who do not match that level of ability, but important lessons have been learned in that respect. “When I first went in as under-18s head coach, I couldn’t quite understand why they could or couldn’t do certain things,” explains Wilshere. “I thought: ‘Well, you’re at Arsenal, you’re an under-18, you should be able to do this, or you shouldn’t be doing this still.’ My assistant at the time, Adam Birchall, who has now taken the job I left, helped me massively. He came through the Arsenal academy, had a similar journey to me, but I obviously went and played for Arsenal while he went and had to make a career in League One, League Two.“We had a really nice balance of my understanding of what it takes to get there and him understanding the different stages of development there are, because he coached all the way through, and the requirements needed to have a career at the lower levels.“I was lucky as well, though, because when I first started with the team there was Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly who were doing things that none of the other players could do. You could see and measure where they were versus where others were. I understood that those two were probably going to go on and play for Arsenal and that for this other group of players, which was just as important, we needed to find a way of making them have a career in the game.”The fear is that young players are products of their academies to such an extent that there is a uniformity to their play. “I was taught to play the game in a certain way,” says Wilshere. “Arsène [Wenger] gave a lot of responsibility. The academy played the same way as the first team, but it wasn’t: ‘This is how we play, this is what you need to do.’ It was: ‘We’re going to put you in a position and your own understanding of the game, your own insight, will create moments for you.’ Now, everyone plays the same … let’s see if the game changes and players have to take on more responsibility and have more freedom with that, because at the moment it’s very structural.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More importantly, Myles is very team-oriented, he’s more of a natural leader and wants to bring everyone with him. Whereas Ethan is just really driven, he’d come and seek advice, feedback from coaches.”With England light at left-back, it is not implausible that Lewis-Skelly could find himself in the national team squad forthe 2026 World Cup. Wilshere says he would “be able to handle it” and thinks England can be bolder in their selection of young talent.View image in fullscreenJack Wilshere presides over the pre-match warm-up before Norwich’s match against West Brom in November.Photograph: Gareth Evans/News ImagesAlamy“I was in the first team at Arsenal and then I was being called up for the under-19s at England. Don’t get me wrong, at that point I was just happy to represent my country,” says Wilshere. “I wasn’t thinking: ‘Now I’m ready for the first team.’ But I was going from training with Arsenal first team, playing in the Champions League and playing in the Premier League, to going and playing in the under-19s. Of course there was still some developing to do but I think we can be braver as a nation.”There is no topic Wilshere shies away from. He explains, for example, that he is running the London Marathon for the British Heart Foundation, after his daughter Siena had to have open heart surgery to repair a congenital heart defect. He pivots back to his training having a purpose, an end goal.“I never ever thought I’d be doing a marathon,” he says. “Never really wanted to. I was convinced to do it by a friend of mine. The other day I ran 20k, it took me two hours. It’s probably harder mentally [than physically]. Because I’m not going fast enough to make it hard for me in my lungs. But obviously your legs start to feel heavy.”The Arsenal academy has crafted many young talents, Wilshere among them, but it has also seemingly produced an intelligent and hungry young coach. When injuries stall or prematurely end players’ careers, they might be forgiven for thinking their best days in the game are behind them. At 33, Wilshere’s may still lie ahead, on the unknown career path he didn’t see himself taking.Explore more on these topicsJack WilshereArsenalNorwich CityinterviewsShareReuse this content"

So if she hadn’t taken our views on board, we’d like a meeting to explain our perspective so that she could take a more balanced view.“We’ve written to the leader, and we are in touch with a few Tory MPs and quite a few former MPs who were backing the bill at the time. They are making the point that perhaps they’d like to be re-elected one day, that they actually understand why they were backing the bill in the first place and perhaps think it is something the Tories might want to revisit. I think the strength of Tory opposition in the House of Lords has been surprising, remembering it broadly was a Tory bill.”The passage of the Football Governance Bill through the House of Lords has been characterised by interventions from Conservative peers seeking to challenge the regulator through amendments to the bill. In January the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy,accused Tory frontbench peers of being “wreckers”who were “killing off the hopes and dreams and inheritance of supporters”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nick Cushing, whom Taylor succeeded in 2020, will return as interim manager for the remainder of the season.The news comes with City fourth in the Women’s Super League, 12 points behind the leaders Chelsea, and was announced 24 hours after they booked an FA Cup semi‑final place by beating Aston Villa on Sunday.The Guardian understands the club’s decision was based on performances and a feeling that a change would give the team the best chance of achieving their goals for the rest of the season, particularly when it comes to their push to qualify for the Champions League next season, which is seen as a key objective, and their attempts to win silverware, with three cup competitions still to fight for.Women’s FA Cup: talking points from the weekend’s actionRead more“Manchester City prides itself on competing at the top of the WSL and on its outstanding record of qualifying for European competition. Unfortunately, results this season have so far not reached this high standard,” Charlotte O’Neill, Manchester City Women’s managing director, said.“With six games of the WSL campaign remaining, we believe that a change of management will breathe fresh life into our bid to ensure qualification for the 2025-26 Uefa Women’s Champions League.“We would like to place on record our thanks to Gareth for all of his efforts during his many years at City. Our FA Cup and League Cup triumphs will remain special moments in the history of this football club. We wish him all the best for the future.”City next face four consecutive games against Chelsea: first in the League Cup final on Saturday before two Champions League quarter-final legs either side of a WSL meeting.The Manchester City players were informed on Monday of Taylor’s departure and, according to sources, there was a surprised reaction.The 52-year-old former Wales, Burnley and Nottingham Forest forward, who also played for Manchester City as well as a host of other clubs, including Sheffield United, Wrexham and Bristol Rovers, had signed a new three-year contract in March 2024.That deal until 2027 was signed when Nils Nielsen was the club’s women’s director of football and Taylor was understood to have the Dane’s full support, but Nielsen left in the summer of 2024 and is now the head coach of the Japan national team. Speaking to theGuardian in November, Nielsen recalled that he had been convinced the right decision was to renew Taylor’s contract: “Finding somebody that knows the City way of playing as well as him would be almost impossible.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He guided City to the 2016 WSL title – the club’s only one to date – with an unbeaten league campaign that year, as well as the 2017 Women’s FA Cup.The former New York City FC men’s team manager also won the Women’s League Cup with City in both 2014 and 2016 and could now lift that trophy again on Saturday.Of the squad that Cushing handed over to Taylor in 2020, three players remain who were on City’s senior books back then: England’s Lauren Hemp, Jess Park and Laura Coombs.It is understood the club will now undergo a thorough recruitment process to find their new long-term head coach, a search which will be led by O’Neill.Explore more on these topicsManchester City WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballShareReuse this content"

The club have conducted a thorough recruitment process to find a replacement for Edu, whoresigned from the post last November, and they have considered a number of candidates. They included an internal one – Jason Ayto, who has filled the role on an interim basis since Edu’s departure.Berta has emerged as the outstanding choice. The 53-year-old Italian, who leftAtlético Madridin January after 12 years as the sporting director there, has agreed a deal and, once the contracts have been signed, there would appear to be no obstacle to him starting straight away, enabling him to work towards what is sure to be a big summer for Arsenal.‘I don’t want to say that’: Arteta refuses to give up on title despite United drawRead moreBerta had been linked with Milan but he has long considered the Premier League as a potential next destination. He has vast experience of completing complicated and expensive transfers, with Atlético’s moves last summer for Julián Alvarez (£64m from Manchester City) and Conor Gallagher (£34m from Chelsea) the latest examples.Berta’s greatest hits at Atlético included the signings of Jan Oblak (€4m from Benfica in 2014) and Rodri (€25m from Villarreal in 2019). He also oversaw there-signing of Antoine Griezmann in 2021for €20m after Atléticosold him to Barcelona for €120min 2019. The misses have taken in João Felix (€126m from Benfica in 2019), Thomas Lemar (€60m from Monaco in 2018), Álvaro Morata (€58m from Chelsea in 2020) and Diego Costa (€55m also from Chelsea in 2017).Arsenal’s drive to restructure after Edu’s decision to move on has been led by the managing director, Richard Garlick, and the executive vice‑chair, Tim Lewis, with Josh Kroenke involved on behalf of the ownership. The Kroenke family have the ultimate signoff on any appointment. Mikel Arteta has also been consulted.The candidates under consideration included the former Manchester Unitedsporting director Dan Ashworth, the Monaco chief executive, Thiago Scuro, and the Real Sociedad sporting director, Roberto Olabe, who has said he will leave his club at the end of the season.What happens next with Ayto will be interesting because he is extremely well-regarded by the Arsenal hierarchy. It could be that they find a role for him to work with Berta. There is no sense that the club’s dry January, when they failed to make a signing despite the need for a striker after Gabriel Jesus’santerior cruciate ligament rupturemidway through the month, was on Ayto.Arsenal felt there was only one authentic target for them, who would improve the team and might be attainable: Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins. But he provedtoo expensiveand so they made the collective decision to pass. The decision was made to look flawed when Kai Havertz sustained aseason-ending hamstring injuryon the club’s Dubai training break in early February. It came hard on the heels of Gabriel Martinelli’s hamstring strain at Newcastle on 5 February. Bukayo Saka was already a long-term hamstring injury casualty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have heavily scouted RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko while Matheus Cunha of Wolves could be a possibility. Berta brought the Brazilian to Atlético from Hertha Berlin in 2021.With Thomas Partey and Jorginho approaching the end of their contracts, Arsenal have a €60m deal in place for the Real Sociedad midfielder Martín Zubimendi. The club will also look to strengthen at left-back and there are also contracts to extend, principally those of Saka and William Saliba, whose deals expire in 2027.Explore more on these topicsArsenalAtlético MadridnewsShareReuse this content"

To the Blue and Gold family... nothing changes. I’m locked in for this year and we have a job to do. Love,” he wrote.Mark O’Neill, Parramatta’s general manager football, issued a statement confirming Brown’s decision.“Dylan has been offered what I understand to be the biggest deal in NRL history from 2026 onwards,” he said. “Dylan is a class player, we understand his decision to take up the offer and no one could begrudge him for accepting this opportunity for him and his family.”The value of NRL contracts are not made formally public, but Tino Fa’asuamaleaui’s deal with the Gold Coast Titans – signed in 2023 and worth a reported $12m over 10 years – will be trumped by Brown’s deal.There is a 10-day cooling off period for NRL signings, allowing players such as Brown to reverse their decisions, while also providing league officials to ensure any deals comply with the salary cap.The Knights are not able to formally announce the signing until after that period. Newcastle coach Adam O’Brien is scheduled to address the media on Wednesday.The signing is a blow to Parramatta, who lose an Eels pathway player and arguably the best defensive half in the competition.Brown made his NRL debut in 2019 and has played 124 games for the club, including Sunday’s 56-18 defeat to Melbourne.Parramatta finished third last in 2024 and are in a period of transition under new coach Jason Ryles, but extended the contract of halfback Mitchell Moses until 2029 in the off-season.The club hopes Moses – who will miss at least a month with a foot injury – and Brown will keep the side in finals contention in 2025.“Despite agreeing to terms with another NRL club for future seasons, Dylan remains committed to the Eels in 2025 and we look forward to him playing his role in the team for the remainder of the year.” said O’Neill.Brown informed Eels staff and teammates of his decision on Monday.Explore more on these topicsNRLRugby leagueAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Accordingly, Smith sent Sherratt a message of congratulations when he was handed the Welsh reins on a temporary basis afterWarren Gatland’s departure. “I texted him saying all the best,” said Smith, “and he said: ‘Eff off, I’ll see you in a few weeks.’”Sherratt’s reply was entirely in jest – “it was nice to know he’s not changed since he got the big job” – and Smith is only too aware of the threat Wales pose to England’s outside chance of clinching the Six Nations title in Cardiff on Saturday.Defeat by Scotlandwas a 16th in a row but Sherratt has Wales playing a far more eye-catching brand of rugby. In what is due to be his final match in charge they would love nothing more than to end their miserable losing run against England.Marcus Smith provides the spark England need to showcase their talent | Gerard MeagherRead moreIt will be Smith’s first taste of the Principality Stadium and the hostility that comes with it but in Sherratt – contrary to his text message – he will meet a friendly face.

Now that the England No 10 jersey is his for the foreseeable future after another polished performance in the47-24 victory against Italy, Smith evidently paid attention.“He actually sat me down for a really honest conversation that I won’t forget when I was midway through my first year as an 18-year-old,” said Smith. “He was saying Jonny [Wilkinson], Faz [Owen Farrell], Fordy [George Ford] were all playing week in, week out [at that age] and if you want to get to that level, which he said at the time that he thought I could, then I really need to push and not wait to follow the same trajectory that the boys in the academy who were the same age as me were on.“It’s easy to turn up, follow the schedule like everyone else does, and he just said: ‘If you want to take that step you’ve got to be doing things slightly differently to everyone else.’ So he encouraged me to get in and kick on my days off, use my free time to look at video, be practising my skills, my passing. If you really want to jump out ahead of the crowd you’ve got to be putting extra work in, so he gave me a bit of a slap, told me to crack on and do a bit more and I’m super grateful he did that.”England triumphed on their previous Six Nations trip to Cardiff two years ago, but the last time they went to Wales on the final day of the championship and in the hunt for the title they were thumped30-3 by Gatland’s side in 2013. Smith, however, has learned to relish hostile away days. “I can’t say it’s not going to potentially have an effect on the way the game goes but it’s definitely something I’ll handle way better than I would have 18 months, two years ago. It’s something I’ve really tried to look forward to, rather than let crowds put me into my shell, really embrace it.”At 32, Elliot Daly will be the senior figure of the backline assuming he keeps his place after an assured performance against Italy, starting at full-back then shifting to centre afterOllie Lawrence’s achilles injury. Steve Borthwick has called Max Ojomoh into the squad preparing to face Wales but Daly, Henry Slade or Tommy Freeman are the more likely contenders to line up at outside centre after Lawrence confirmed on Monday that his season is over, ending any hopes of touring Australia with the British & Irish Lions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Daly has fond memories of playing in Cardiff after his late try proved decisive in 2017 but warned England against chasing the scoreboard.“It’s always a tough place to go,” said Daly. “They always seem to rev up for our game. We’ve put ourselves in the position to put pressure on France now so hopefully we can do that. You go into the game wanting to win the game. As the game goes on, you start to think ‘do we need a bonus point?’, or that sort of thing. But if you go with the mindset of ‘we need five tries, we need 30 or 40 points’, you won’t achieve that.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025England rugby union teamWales rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The areas in which racegoers can drink alcohol have expanded to include much more of the open standing area in front of the grandstands, while ticket prices were also frozen at last year’s level.However, the admission that crowds are still expected to drop suggests that another initiative – offering a ticket for a second day at the meeting from Tuesday to Thursday at a 20% discount to anyone buying a single ticket – has not caught the imagination of racegoers.“We have heard both anecdotally and directly that the cost of accommodation is impacting attendance,” Lavender said. “It is a situation we are looking to address directly with Room To Race, launched in partnership with a local sports travel company, to provide more affordable hotel, ticket and travel packages for this festival and beyond.”Another key indicator for most punters at the end of festival week is their profit or loss on the week, and Tuesday’s opening day dangles a significant carrot for many backers in the shape of four rock-solid favourites in the card’s Grade One events.Kopek Des Bordes, the market leader for the opening Supreme Novcie Hurdle, drifted to 11-10 from evens on Monday in the face of support for Henry de Bromhead’s Workahead, the mount of Rachael Blackmore. Majborough (4-7), Lossiemouth (8-11) and Constitution Hill (8-13) all remain odds-on however, implying combined odds for the four-timer with most firms of around 8-1.Explore more on these topicsCheltenham festival 2025Cheltenham festivalCheltenhamHorse racingnewsShareReuse this content"

The US will face Turkey on 7 June in East Hartford, Connecticut, and Switzerland three days later in Nashville, Tennessee, the US Soccer Federation announced on Monday.The games will presumably feature the full squad set to compete in the Gold Cup, which will feature many but perhaps not all first-choice stars for the US. Clubs that are participating in the Club World Cup are expected to retain players for the tournament, which takes place at the same time as the Gold Cup. That means that Juventus’ duo of Weston McKennie and Tim Weah, Dortmund’s Gio Reyna, and Seattle Sounders’ Jordan Morris, Cristian Roldan and Jesús Ferreira will all likely be out of contention.The US last playedTurkeyin 2014 in a warmup match for that year’s World Cup.

After knocking LAFC out of the playoffs with a 2-1 win in November, Saturday’s 5-2 result felt like conformation that LAFC no longer have Seattle’s number after they knocked the Sounders out of the Open Cup and Leagues Cup in 2024. Those results were part of a 10-match unbeaten run against Seattle that dated back to May 2021.“Yes it feels really good,” admitted Sounders head coach Brian Schmetzer, “but our record against them is still 4-9-4, so we still have some work to do.”Mexico’s homophobic chant started as an unfunny joke. Now it’s a stubborn problemRead moreDespite the five goals scored, this was hardly the Sounders at their best, with Schmetzer resting some of his top players ahead of a critical Concacaf Champions Cup contest against Cruz Azul on Tuesday. After being unable to build any advantage in last week’s scoreless draw, the Sounders need to score in Mexico and will probably have to do so without Pedro de la Vega.The Argentinian has provided a spark in CCC contests, an encouraging sign after the club’s record signing missed much of 2024 through injury. Unfortunately, that trend continued – de la Vega left the field in the 36th minute Saturday. Luckily, the Sounders got attacking contributions from Paul Rothrock, Jesús Ferreira and Kalani Kossa-Rienzi, a second-team member who may have earned a first-team deal with his performance during an emergency loan spell this month.Getting past La Maquina in Mexico City will be daunting. The Sounders haven’t won in their last seven matches in Mexico and have been eliminated four times when playing the second leg of a series on the road. They did, however, advance with a draw against León during their historic run to the title in 2022. Have the Sounders vanquished a domestic bogeyman only to be cowed by another? Or will Schmetzer’s streak-breakers do it again? That would be real cause for a party in Seattle that even the manager wouldn’t try to tone down.JAMissing CuchoUntil Saturday, the Cucho Hernández-lessColumbus Crewstill looked like the dynamic Columbus Crew we’ve come to know in recent years. Hernández’s replacement, Jacen Russell-Rowe, netted in back-to-back games as Wilfried Nancy’s side started the season with wins over Chicago and New England. Against the Houston Dynamo, though, Cucho’s absence was obvious – this was the sort of game he would have decided in the past.In fact, hehaddecided this sort of game in the past. Cucho was crucial in a Champions Cup meeting between these sides almost exactly 12 months ago, scoring to knock out the Dynamo when the Crew otherwise struggled for attacking ideas. With the Colombian now a Real Betis player, though, there was no knockout blow on Saturday in a goalless draw.Many of the usual Nancy-ball hallmarks were there in the Crew’s performance. Wingbacks Max Arfsten and Mo Farsi pushed into central areas – and frequently into the opposition box. Russell-Rowe and Diego Rossi drifted between the lines as Columbus dominated the ball. And yet from 64% possession came just 0.65 expected goals (xG) and one “big chance,” per Opta. Russell-Rowe failed to muster a single shot.A new designated player will surely arrive to boost the attack at some point in 2025. Palmeiras forward José Manuel “Flaco” López has been linked with the club. For the time being, though, Columbus must find a way to recreate Cucho in the aggregate because Saturday’s draw against Houston proved it’s unrealistic to ask Russell-Rowe to step up in every game.GRView image in fullscreenKelvin Yeboah has been key for Minnesota United this season.Photograph: Brandon Vallance/Getty ImagesMinnesota United: Just chuck itIt’s the second year of a new era for Minnesota United, one marked by new leadership in sporting director Khaled El-Ahmad and head coach Eric Ramsay. With the pair in place, the club have shown impressive commitment to finding every little advantage possible. That’s demonstrated off the field with the recently-announcedpartnership with stats blog American Soccer Analysis, which will aid the team with player recruitment and opposition analysis.On the field, Ramsay has shown a clear commitment to maximizing value on set pieces. Both of Minnesota United’s goals in 2025 have come in solid 1-0 wins, and both have come from long set pieces finished off by star striker Kelvin Yeboah.The first, against CF Montreal, came from an intentional long throw-in routine. It’s not a coincidence that Minnesota are chucking the ball into the box: The Athleticfoundthat throws into the penalty area result in more than twice the amount of xG as short throws in the final quarter of the field in the Premier League. Minnesota United know the value of a free box entry, where they’re one bounce away from a shot on goal:A similar principle led to Minnesota’s second goal of the year against the San Jose Earthquakes on Saturday, where a long free-kick led to a scramble in the box and a finish from Yeboah:Minnesota United haven’t been winning flashy this year. But they’ve been winning smart.JLskip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The MLS original altered their name, built a stadium, drew bigger crowds, and experienced a renaissance on the field led by Peter Vermes, the team’s technical director who added “manager” to his responsibilities in 2009.Today, SKC may stand as a testament to the dangers of staying the course. Vermes is still in charge, with a 15-year-reign that is the fourth-longest active managerial tenure in the world and in the top 40 among all reigns worldwide since World War II (if he remains through the end of the 2025 regular season, he’ll move into the top 30 on that list).With their 2-1 loss at DC United on Saturday, Sporting have lost 10 consecutive competitive matches in all competitions going back to last season. The picture gets worse if you include noncompetitive matches – KC failed to win any of their six preseason games, bringing the grand total winless run to 16 games, with the last victory coming on 18 September 2024.Could Messi do it on an inhumanely cold night in Kansas City? Of course he couldRead moreMaking matters worse: streaks like this are nothing new for SKC. The team suffered a seven-game winless run in 2022, a 10-game winless run to open 2023, andanother10-game winless run earlier in the 2024 season (all in the league). The last of those streaks ended with seven straight losses, and when the team won to end the run, they then lost three more in a row. The Sporting KC team that were once a reliable contender have failed to qualify for the playoffs in two of the last three seasons, and 2025 isn’t looking too promising so far.Vermes has been in charge for all of this, only recently shedding his front office title to focus on coaching. He has said he wants to lead a rebuild, and perhaps all the work he has put into building the club’s current foundations should be rewarded with that chance. At the same time, it’s hard to deny that any other coach who had overseen the exact same record would be on the hot seat, which Vermes does not seem to be. RecentMLShistory indicates that change follows runs like this. In 2021 FC Cincinnati lost 10 straight and cleaned house in the offseason, installing the regime that currently has them in the upper echelon of MLS.In the meantime KC are playing the same uninspiring soccer that got them into this mess. Unlike 15 years ago, if change is coming, it won’t come quickly.AAView image in fullscreenOscar Ustari earned a red card for Inter Miami on Sunday.Photograph: Lynne Sladky/APSeeing red in Miami pinkTherecord-breaking 2024 MLS Supporters’ Shieldwinner Inter Miami have not done things the easy way so far in 2025. Javier Mascherano’s team being without Lionel Messi for three of their six games has gotten headlines, but the teamhave also played 44% of their MLS matches down to 10 men.Tomás Avilés’ sending-off in the first half of February’s opener against New York City FCwas described as“Inter Miami’s first red card of the season,” inadvertently suggesting there were more to come soon; that the tally had merely just begun. Ian Fray was sent off after the final whistle in the subsequent MLS fixture against Houston Dynamo and goalkeeper Oscar Ustari was shown red after felling Wilfried Zaha in the first half against Charlotte FC on Sunday. Of the six sendings-off in all of MLS so far in 2025,halfof them have been Inter Miami players.This has not stopped Mascherano’s mostly Messi-less team from picking up points. They drew that opener against New York City thanks to a late goal from Telasco Segovia, and held on to a 1-0 lead against Charlotte after Tadeo Allende scored less than 20 seconds into the second half.Messi or no Messi, 11 players or 10, Miami are once again finding a way to get results and stack points in 2025.JNExplore more on these topicsMLSUS sportsSeattle SoundersSporting Kansas CityColumbus CrewInter MiamifeaturesShareReuse this content"

A mere 108 of them referred to the Saudi Arabian elephant in the room. Or more specifically, the status of unification talks between thePGA Tour, which Monahan leads, and the Saudi‑fronted LIV circuit.Monahan was very keen to speak about innovation, about corporate partners, about fan engagement. Fluff. A blunt reality is that any excitement created by the announcement of a framework agreement between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund has long since dissipated. No wonder: that shock press releaselanded on 6 June 2023.Trump is using the presidency to seek golf deals – hardly anyone’s paying attention | Mohamad BazziRead moreWhen taking questions, Monahan was only marginally more expansive on the outlook for his sport. He contested the suggestion of low-key mood music after aWhite House meeting in late February. Not for the first time, it was left to Rory McIlroy to articulate what anyone paying even light attention here would have picked up: a peace deal is no closer.Some have privately portrayed the White House discussion as disastrous. Donald Trump is an ally in the sense that he can stage meetings and tell the US Department of Justice to look the other way. Recent days have, however, emphasised Trump has other things with which to occupy himself beyond a sport at odds with itself.Yasir Al-Rumayyan, PIF’s governor, is known to have been less than impressed with what he heard in Washington DC. Rumayyan believes he has not been afforded sufficient respect for the effect – or disruption, depending on your standpoint – created by LIV. For Rumayyan, LIV has immense personal value. The notion he will move it aside into scheduling windows that suit the PGA Tour is fanciful.So, too, is the idea PIF will toss money into the new PGA Tour Enterprises and let American sporting executives decide how to spend it. Every negotiation has a to and fro, good days and bad days, but this is another crossroads. Does Monahan try to placate the Saudis or do his own thing, confident the PGA Tour can ultimately prevail against a rebel organisation that still has little traction in the minds of the public? His choices are largely dependent on the true depth of Rumayyan’s disquiet.This week the schism will be unavoidable. The PGA Tour takes immense pride in the Players Championship, its marquee event. The trouble is, this will again take place minus big names. Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Smith and Brooks Koepka will be in Singapore playing under an LIV banner. Loss of profile is not restricted to the PGA Tour: umpteen players converted to LIV and have vanished in terms of public consciousness. One-time headline names are afterthoughts.View image in fullscreenJay Monahan has a choice to make: placate the Saudis or step away and back the PGA Tour to ultimately prevail against the rebel organisation.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAMonahan was unwilling to stipulate what his response would be should an LIV player previously of PGA Tour status express a desire to return. Monahan clearly regards this as a matter of leverage. It would seem to be a potential win for him, a snatching back of power, if someone were to acknowledge the grass was not greener after all.Yet without Rumayyan’s blessing – or another messy legal affair – such a scenario cannot play out. LIV has its golfers under contract. The options available when those deals run out is a point of intrigue but we are not yet at that juncture. Monahan will also be perfectly aware of the playing cohort within his organisation who would not take kindly to the return of LIV golfers. The greater good does not tend to resonate with golfers; like all individual sportspeople, they are selfish by design.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Speculation that Saudi Arabia would look to conclude a deal in Europe, becoming a partner of the DP World Tour, has never really gone away.

The platform, formerly known as Twitter, had been unresponsive for many users as posts failed to load.“We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources,” the platform’s CEOposted. “Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved.”Downdetector, a website thatmonitors outageson various sites and platforms, showed thousands of reports of outages that initially spiked at about 5.45am before returning to normal for a few hours. A second surge in reported outages carried on throughout midday, with the majority of them occurring on the company’s mobile app.Tweets that failed to appear displayed a message that “something went wrong” and told users to try reloading.The richest man in the world did not provide any evidence for his claims. His post came in response to a cryptocurrency influencer who suggested the outage followed other opposition to Musk’s enterprises. Protests against the so-called “department of government efficiency” initiative Musk leads andvandalism against Tesla dealershipshad taken place throughout the previous week.Musk reiterated his claim of a cyber-attack during an interview on Fox Business later that day, suggesting that the perpetrators may have been from Ukraine.“We’re not sure exactly what happened but there was a massive cyber-attack to try and bring down theXsystem with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area,” Musk said.Musk has been heavily critical of the Ukrainian government as relations between it and the Trump administration have soured. Musk stated over the weekend that the country’s “entire front line” would collapse if he turned off his Starlink satellite communications provider and called the Democratic senator Mark Kelly a “traitor” after the lawmaker posted about a visit he made to the country.The SpaceX chief executive, who acquired Twitter for $44bn in 2022, has also claimed that previous platform outages were the result of cyber-attacks. When his livestreamedinterviewwithDonald Trumpalmost immediately crashed last year, Musk alleged that it was because of a “massive DDOS attack”.

What can they do?Elliot GardnerMon 10 Mar 2025 08.15 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 08.16 EDTShareAnother month, another revolutionary generative AI development that will apparently fundamentally alter how an entire industry operates. This time tech giant Microsoft has created a “gameplay ideation” tool,Muse, which it calls the world’s first Wham, or World and Human Action Model. Microsoft claims that Muse will speed up the lengthy and expensive process of game development by allowing designers to play around with AI-generated gameplay videos to see what works.Muse is trained on gameplay data from UK studio Ninja Theory’s game Bleeding Edge. It has absorbed tens of thousands of hours of people’s real gameplay, both footage and controller inputs. It can now generate accurate-looking mock gameplay clips for that game, which can be edited and adapted with prompts.All well and good, but inan announcement videofor Muse, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer caused confusion when he said that it could be invaluable for the preservation of classic games: AI models, he implied, could “learn” those games and emulate them on modern hardware. It’s not clear how this would be possible. Further muddying the waters, Microsoft’s overall CEO Satya Nadella then implied ina podcast interviewthat Muse was the first step in creating a “catalogue” of AI-generated games.But Muse, as it stands, can’t create a game – it can only create made-upfootageof a game. So just what is this new gaming AI tool? A swish addition to game developers’ tool belts? Or the first step towards an era of AI-generated gaming detritus?The idea is that designers (or indeed players) can try out ideas with Muse without spending hours (or days) in a gameplay engine implementing something that might not feel good or even work. If a designer wants to see what, say, a power-up would look like in-game, they could generate mock video showing what that might look like, with the AI filling in the gaps.“Game engines are complicated, messy things and it takes a lot of time to simulate things – they’re not built for that,” comments Julian Tongelius, associate professor in computer science and engineering at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering. “[Working with] a simulation of the game can be much easier and faster. The opportunities opened up by this kind of study are pretty big, but the limitations are also real.”AI gameplay simulations aren’t totally new – Google’s GameNGen project created a playable version of Doom that ran without a game engine in 2024. But the problem has always been consistency. Google’s Doom simulation worked well at first, but the longer you played, the more the AI would “dream up” game elements that weren’t accurate. This is what Microsoft claims to have solved with Muse, but it comes with a massive caveat.“This particular model is trained on 500,000 game sessions, so likely around 100,000 hours of gameplay. But it only works because you have so much data. If you move far beyond what’s been recorded, simulations generally stop behaving well,” explains Tongelius.Microsoft has stated that it is already using Muse to develop real-time playable AI models trained on its other first-party games. But while Muse is great for live-service games such as Bleeding Edge, with access to thousands of hours of live gameplay, for smaller games and single-player titles, it would be a monumental and probably pointless effort to train a generative AI model in each and every specific game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Game developers won’t be able to use it for rapid production because it doesn’t actually, aside from visualising a particular thing, address any underlying game development issues.”Ultimately, there appears to be a disconnect between Spencer and Nadella’s comments and what Muse actually does at the moment. Unless something significant changes, it doesn’t appear capable of creating playable simulations of classic games, and it certainly doesn’t create entirely “new” AI-generated games. It isn’t even clear how Muse’s generated videos could be translated into actual gameplay.AI-generated video games may yet be on the horizon. Google quietly releasedGenie 2a few months back, which is capable of generating “playable worlds” – but that’s not what Muse does, at least for now. “I will choose to graciously interpret what Satya said as visions of what could be done in the future,” says Tongelius. “It’s entirely possible that we will get to some version of that, but it’s not around the corner. What Microsoft has done in this paper is a foundation stone.”Explore more on these topicsGamesArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She has published 58 novels – but more importantly, she has written 170k tweets. Her targets are broad and plentiful. There are political takes: dozens of tweets a day aboutHarris v Trump, andIsrael’s war on Gaza. She’ll be outspoken on trans rights one day, and writing aboutJD Vance’s tiny eyes on another– but she also isn’t afraid to venture into worlds of whimsy, such asher cat pondering the trolley problem.The point is that she posts frequently, without the agenda to sell something, and seemingly with unabashed sincerity. In interviews, she’s dismissed the medium as“ephemeral and quickly forgotten”. But her relationship to the platform feels pure.

Think of Adam Sandler’s Razzie-sweeping twin turn in Jack and Jill, or Lisa Kudrow as both Phoebe and Ursula Buffay on Friends. Eddie Murphy was always particularly prolific, his most multiplicitous performance as a clutch of Klumps for Nutty Professor II.Mickey 17 review – Robert Pattinson proves expendable in Bong Joon-ho’s eerily cheery cloning dramaRead moreThere are exceptions, of course. But for every Legend or The Prestige there are 10 Austin Powers, Bowfingers and – shudder – Norbits. This year, however, is giving us a more dramatic breed of duplicate. Robert De Niro will pull double Don duty in The Alto Knights,Michael B Jordanwill play twin leads in the supernatural Sinners and a pair of Robert Pattinson clones is currently headlining Bong Joon-ho’s Mickey 17.And there’s more. The Monkey just served up a horror with two bloody scoops of Theo James, Zac Efron recently wrapped A24 thriller Famous, in which he plays both stalker and superstar and, this November, Elle Fanning will play twin sisters in the latest film in the Predator franchise. Recently, at Sundance, Dylan O’Brien played his own twin brother in darkly comic drama Twinless. So, even disregarding the films’ genres, it’s still a notable spike in audiences seeing double. So why now? And how are these seemingly impossible shots realised?“For years, film-makers have used various techniques to show actors multiple times in the same scene,” says Daniel Harrington, a London-based VFX artist and compositor. “In The Parent Trap, split-screen allowed the same actor to occupy both sides of the frame, whereas The Social Network used motion control to portray the Winklevoss twins by repeating precise camera movements.”Before we tackle the technicalities, however, here’s a brief history of dual roles – for the concept is almost as old as cinema itself. In 1898, the trailblazing director Georges Méliès was already double-exposing film to twice capture his likeness within the same frame. His method made the jump to feature-length films in 1917 when the actor William Farnum played opposite himself in an adaptation of Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities.The following year, Mary Pickford took dual roles in Stella Maris using a new split-screen technique that would continue to be used for decades, in films such as Dead Ringers, Adaptation and Jean-Claude Van Damme’s as-good-as-it-sounds Double Impact. The Alto Knights, over a century later, even uses a similar technique to double up De Niro in select scenes.But today, split-screening is just one of many tools in the dual role toy box. The most notable advancement in the field came about in 1989, with the release of Back to the Future Part II and the director Robert Zemeckis’s commissioning of Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) to create the VistaGlide, a robotic, motion-controlled camera dolly system that would allow film-makers to capture multiple split-screen performances while also moving their cameras.This remains the most popular dual role method, says Harrington. Several mattes (the individual shots that make up a final frame) are filmed with the same actor playing their separate parts. This footage is then delivered to rotoscope and paint artists, who tidy up the edges of the raw mattes before tasking compositors with piecing them together into one seamless whole.“Ultimately, the success of the illusion depends on the synergy between on-set preparation and post-production artistry,” says Harrington. “Digital effects may be increasingly sophisticated, but they’re still most effective when built on a strong practical foundation. So, on set, consistent lighting, precise framing and stand-ins are crucial for ensuring seamless compositing later. Without these elements, even the most advanced digital tools would struggle to create a convincing result. It’s teamwork, exemplified not only by film, but by TV series such as Orphan Black.”The small screen has indeed reaped the rewards of these technical advancements – 2025 will also see Netflix debut twin Jamie Dornans in The Undertow and twin Anna Camps in the final season of You. Malachi Kirby will double up for Anansi Boys on Prime Video, andCynthia Erivowill play identical sextuplets when Rian Johnson’s Poker Face returns to Peacock. “And, while no breakthrough is solely responsible [for this increase in dual roles],” says Harrington, “recent developments in AI-driven deepfakes and performance cloning have significantly lowered costs and sped up production times”.This deepfake method of replacing faces (Robert Pattinson’s visage was digitally transplanted on to a stand-in for Mickey 17) was another ILM contrivance, originally developed for 1993’s Jurassic Park. The Oscar-nominated VFX supervisor Theo Jones works at Framestore, the studio which worked on much of Joon-ho’s latest offering. And, while Jones doesn’t believe there’s a single catalyst for the current spate of dual role projects – “it’s likely some sort of happy accident,” he says, “the same way you might get two films about an asteroid hurtling towards Earth landing at the box office at the same time” – he also brings up the rise in deepfake technology.View image in fullscreenCynthia Erivo and Natasha Lyonne in Poker Face.Photograph: PEACOCK“It wasn’t an option 10, maybe even five years ago,” says Jones. “But even this isn’t perfect for a dual role – you still need to find someone with similar features and proportions, and the baseline performance would be coming from the stand-in rather than your actor. Plus, ‘off-the-peg’ deepfake technology certainly isn’t up to Imax quality at the moment, so you’d still need plenty of VFX work to make it look believable.”Framestore, Jones reveals, has developed its own “neural face rendering tech” – called Facade – which he believes will set a new standard in the industry. “But, for purely dramatic moments,” he adds, “something like Lupita Nyong’o’s incredible performance in Us, you’d be far better placed using practical techniques for the shoot, and post-production fixes to make the finished picture seamless. Sometimes, this will involve rewriting the VFX rulebook – other times, it will mean using techniques that existed before computers were ever a part of film-making.”It’s the perfect way to approach the art of the dual role. For, whether it’s actors attracted by the creative challenge or film-makers hoping to advance the technical side of their craft, these twin turns have always been collaborative efforts. By continuing to blend techniques new and old, audiences are not only guaranteed evermore envelope-pushing performances, but the entire concept of the dual role will stay true to its innately patchwork nature.Explore more on these topicsFilmBong Joon-hoRobert PattinsonRobert De NiroCynthia ErivoMichael B JordanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Today that is no longer the case. Just 19% of Americans expect their children’s livesto be better than their own, while two-thirdsbelieve their country will be economically weaker by 2050.So our zeitgeist is increasingly one of pessimism, from anxiety about the climate crisis to concern over rising inequality. According to the historian Adam Tooze, we are living through a “polycrisis” – where such challenges are not only simultaneous but mutually reinforcing.Yet there is one sliver of society where optimism still reigns supreme:Silicon Valley.For a long time technological utopianism was a leftwing idea. Its patron saint was Edward Bellamy whose 19th-century novel, Looking Backward, was more influential among the American left than Marx and Engels. In Britain this perspective was best represented by Fabian socialism. Its rationale was alluringly simple: human progress was a corollary of technological development, with both needing scientific management. Over time, more complex technologies would require a larger state. And a larger state would require socialism.Today such thinking has been inverted, with supporters of market capitalism, and a minimal state, most optimistic about the future. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the venture capital fund Andreessen Horowitz, even penned a “techno-optimist manifesto” last year – in part to counter the prevailing winds of despair. If nothing else it reveals how Silicon Valley thinks, with Andreesen expressing this with particular clarity when he writes how “there is no material problem   … that cannot be solved with more technology”.As the magazine Current Affairsobserved, no evidence is forthcoming alongside such bombastic claims. For instance, when Andreessen writes how “central planning is a doom loop”, he conveniently omits how the development of the internet, solar cells, lithium batteries, the jet engine and nuclear power all relied on state-backed R&D. But while his screed is bizarre, uninformed and in parts even dangerous, he is right about one thing: our instinctive miserabilism, increasingly pervasive on the left, is unwarranted.Take recurrent arguments against having children. Choosing to have kids is a personal matter. Yet in recent years I’ve repeatedly encountered the claim that having descendants is immoralbecause of climate change. Even if you agree that ours is an age of polycrisis, this is absurd.After all, 100 years ago the average person, in one of the the world’s wealthiest societies, could expect to live until 40. Today global life expectancy is 73. In 19th-century England, between 40 and 60 women died in childbirth for every thousand births. Today that figure is seven for every100,000. As Ezra Kleinhas noted, no serious climate models suggest a return to the world of 1950, let alone 1150. Taking this argument to its logical conclusion, nobody should have had children before our grandparents – in which case humanity should have long been extinct.Such irrational pessimism inflects how we view technology too. Yes, there are moral questions surrounding innovations like gene-editing and Crispr, but these same tools could eliminate thousands of inherited conditions – from sickle cell to Huntington’s disease. The 2030s may well be a decade of inflationary shocks and extreme weather events, but it could also herald the arrival of real-time language translation and cancer vaccines used by billions.View image in fullscreenIn their defence many pessimists acknowledge such developments – they are simply aware that any benefits will be unequally shared. This is particularly relevant for machine learning and the world of work.AI could add as much as $13tn to the global economy between 2017 and 2030. Given recent technological changes have, according to the World Bank, meant that “advanced economies face increasingly polarized labour markets and rising inequality”, concerns around who benefits from an innovation as potentially disruptive as the steam engine make sense. While some will get rich from its commercial applications, many more will lose jobs or see their wages squeezed. Ignoring that, and maintaining technology as somehow neutral, is a covert form of class war.The philosopher Alfred Whitehead once declared that the greatest invention of the Victorian age was the idea of invention itself. Yet as humanity masteredhowto innovate, we progressively lost touch withwhy we should. This now seems to have reached its apogee with “effective accelerationists”, whose answer to every challenge is simply more technology. I can think of no idea more ill-suited for a world of polycrisis.So what is the alternative from the left if mindless tech optimism will only deepen problems heading our way?As with the right it should be a project of individual freedom. But such freedom should be understood as meaningless, or even destructive, if it generates unfreedom elsewhere. The economist Amartya Sen defined unfreedom as constraints beyond our control which undermine our ability to pursue lives of meaning. Inadequate access to food is a source of unfreedom, as is being homeless or not having an education. Franklin Roosevelt put it best when he said that “necessitous men are not free men”.If eliminating unfreedom is the end, then the creation ofUniversal Basic Services(UBS), is the means. These UBS comprise housing, healthcare, transport and education, should be free at the point of use, and funded by progressive taxation. Accessing them should be viewed as necessary for any citizen to fully participate in economic life. Indeed they are just as fundamental to a life of freedom as legal and political rights.Markets would still exist for things like cars, or silk ties, but the logic of profit wouldn’t apply to UBS. So rather than machine learning creating the conditions for the world’s first trillionaire,as gleefully predicted by Mark Cuban, it could provide the basis for a post-carbon, autonomous transport infrastructure, or free adult education throughout one’s life.Alongside UBS, the dividend of technological progress would also make possible a four-day week. After all, countries with a shorter working week enjoy higher levels of social capital, more volunteering and greater gender equality. What is more, those who work less report greater feelings of personal satisfaction. To be clear: this isn’t a post-work society, not least because, in our lifetimes at least, there will be enough work to go around with an ageing population and climate adaptation. But a four-day week should be to the 2030s what the eight-hour day was to the late 19th century.For all the extraordinary inventiveness of recent decades, perhaps our greatest technology remains the state – that unique vehicle for collective action. To create UBS, and expand leisure time for all, means believing in it once again. Indeedmeaningfuloptimism about technology requires political demands and a specific vision for our collective future. Without that we are always at the whim of the 0.01%.Aaron Bastani is the co-founder of Novara Media. He is also the author of Fully Automated Luxury Communism"

In 1984, black townships across the country revolted. By 1986, the white minority government had imposed a state of emergency. But in the segregated white enclaves, life was affluent and peaceful.“While the country as a whole was very much in flames and in turmoil, we were blissfully very safe in our little leafy suburbs, going about our very normal life,” said Jonathan Stewart, who was a year above Musk at Pretoria boys, which also counts the Labour politician Peter Hain, the Booker prize-winning novelist Damon Galgut and the murderer and Paralympian Oscar Pistorius among its former pupils.“You had this wealthy set, in relative terms, and everybody else was excluded.”View image in fullscreenMusk (middle row, 2nd from the left) at Pretoria boys high school in 1988.Photograph: Pretoria boys high schoolMusk, who was born in Pretoria in 1971, railed on his social media platform X last month against the “openly racist laws” of the country of his birth and responded “yes” to the statement: “White South Africans are being persecuted for their race in their home country.”After the posts by the man now at the helm of Donald Trump’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge), a special group Trump has created, the US president signed an executive order accusing South Africa’s government of“unjust racial discrimination”against white Afrikaners, citing a law allowing land to be expropriated in certain circumstances. The order cut aid to South Africa, which receives 17% of its HIV/Aids budget from the US, and offered asylum to Afrikaners.It was not clear the extent to which Musk, who left South Africa in 1989 for his mother’s country, Canada, and then went to the US, had a direct hand in encouraging Trump to issue the order.Trump has taken an interest in the alleged persecution of white South Africans since his first presidency, when an Afrikaner rights grouptravelled to the USto claim, falsely, that white farmers were being murdered for their land with the complicity of the government. Trump saw one of the group’s leaders interviewed on Fox News and tweeted his support.Trump has also been influenced by other interests, including US groups critical ofSouth Africa’s case against Israelat the international court of justice (ICJ) over the war in Gaza, which he referred to in his executive order.View image in fullscreenPupils at Pretoria boys high school, where Musk was a day pupil.Photograph: Moeletsi Mabe/The GuardianBut with Musk now among Trump’s closest advisers, it is unlikely he has not made his views known to the president, given they are also tied up with his business interests in South Africa.Musk has claimed that land reform laws, in a country where the white minority, who make up just 7% of South Africa’s population, still ownmore than 70%of agricultural land, are racist and amount to theft. He has endorsed claims that the killings of white farmers amount to genocide;researchsuggests the crimes are financially motivated.Musk’s attacks have ratcheted up at a time when he is in a dispute with the South African government about affirmative action laws, as he tries to sell his Starlink satellite network in the country. The world’s richest man objects to a law requiring that foreign investors in the telecoms sector provide 30% of the equity in the South African part of the enterprise to Black-owned businesses.Trump’s executive order will add to the pressure on South Africa’s government to exempt Musk from the Black empowerment laws.X’s press team and Musk’s lawyer did not respond to interview requests or emailed questions.To what extent Musk’s years growing up under the collapsing apartheid regime influenced his positions today, frommaking what looked like a Nazi salute– a characterisation he rejects – at Trump’s inauguration celebrations last month to his embrace of far-right political parties such as Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland, remains an open debate.View image in fullscreenMusk’s name on the donor list in the new auditorium at Pretoria boys high school.Photograph: Moeletsi Mabe/The GuardianWhite, English-speaking South Africans such as Musk’s family benefited from apartheid’s racial hierarchy but lived mostly separate lives from the ruling Afrikaners.Musk spent the first two years of South Africa’s five high school years at the all-white Bryanston high school in Johannesburg’s leafy northern suburbs. Founded in 1968, it is a mixed-sex, English-language, fee-paying state school, made up of rectangular mid-century buildings.Like South Africa then and now, Bryanston high was sports mad. “It was a little bit like when you think of American society,” said Lesley Burns, who finished at the school in 1984, Musk’s first year. “There were all the jocks and the popular guys in the football team.”Musk, who was on the school’s chess team in 1985, was viciously bullied. The hounding culminated with him being thrown down a set of stairs, beaten so badly that he was hospitalised. The school declined an interview.View image in fullscreenMusk (front left) in the chess team from the school’s 1985 yearbook.Photograph: Bryanston high schoolMusk’s father moved him and his brother, Kimbal, to Pretoria boys, where he was well liked, according to Gideon Fourie, who had computer science classes with Musk.“He was a very average personality,” Fourie said. “He wasn’t in any way like a super jock, or a super nerd, or a super punk … He had a group of friends.”South African media were subjected to strict government censorship. Newspapers would appear with censored sections blacked out, particularly reports of the growing unrest in the townships and mass arrests, until those were also banned.In contrast, the fee-paying Pretoria boys was liberal, for its time. In 1981 it became the first government school to admit a Black pupil. The then headteacher, Malcolm Armstrong, used a loophole that allowed it to let in the sons of diplomats from the “homelands” within South Africa that the apartheid system claimed were independent states.“Armstrong even defied the authorities by meeting with the ANC [African National Congress] in Dakar while it was still banned,” said Patrick Conroy, who was in Kimbal’s year, two years below Musk. “He frequently addressed our school assemblies, emphasising the importance of democracy, human rights and social justice.”The school’s current headteacher, Gregary Hassenkamp, was also in Kimbal’s year and has similar memories of his predecessor, although he noted that not all teachers shared Armstrong’s liberal views.View image in fullscreenGregary Hassenkamp, Pretoria boys school’s current headteacher.Photograph: Moeletsi Mabe/The Guardian“I remember him forcing boys to think about the country in which we lived and the attitudes we had,” Hassenkamp said in an interview in his wood-panelled office, wearing a flowing black gown and a tie and socks in the school’s red, white and green colours.Musk has previously described himself as “not a conservative” and backed the Democratic candidate in every presidential election going back to Barack Obama’s victory in 2008, until he moved to the right. But Musk is clearly suspicious of democracy and the leaders it produces.In the 1930s, his grandfather headed an anti-democratic fringe political movement in Canada with fascist overtones, which campaigned for government by elite technocrats. He then moved to apartheid South Africa because the racist system appealed to him.Musk now appears happy to embrace the US version of the “strongman” ruler by backing Trump’s claim that the will of the president is paramount.Some of Musk’s school peers speculated that his current views of South Africa may be influenced by his missing out on the ups and downs of the negotiations to end apartheid and the “miracle” of Nelson Mandela becoming the country’s first Black president in 1994.Since then, the governments led by Mandela’s ANC party have failed to address the world’s worst economic inequality. While itsBlack economic empowerment policiesoffer tax breaks and state contracts to Black-owned companies, Black people are five times likelier than white people to be unemployed. South Africa also has one of the world’s highest murder rates.It is not uncommon to hear white South Africans say they arebeing discriminated against, often citing affirmative action laws. In mid-February,hundreds gathered outside the US embassyin Pretoria carrying signs with slogans such as “Thank God for President Trump” and “Make South Africa Great Again”.View image in fullscreenHallways in the Pretoria school’s main building.Photograph: Moeletsi Mabe/The GuardianWhile it is rare to hear white South Africans say they want a return to apartheid, it is also not uncommon to hear older people express nostalgia for that time.“It was a good time, because we had no crime. There were no problems. People, Blacks and whites, got on very well with each other,” Errol Musk said in a video interview from his spacious Cape Town home, when asked about his son Elon’s childhood. “Everything worked. That’s the reality. Of course people don’t want to hear that, but that’s the truth.”Musk and his two younger full siblings, Kimbal and Tosca, have had a tumultuous relationship with their father. Kimbal told Musk’s biographer Walter Isaacson that their father would scream at them for two to three hours, calling them worthless and pathetic. Their mother, Maye, has accused him of physical abuse.“It’s rubbish,” Errol said when asked about the allegations, which he has repeatedly denied.The brothers became estranged from their father in 2017, not for the first time, when he had a child with his 30-year-old stepdaughter, Jana Bezuidenhout, according to Isaacson. In Errol’s telling, they got angry with him when he expressed his support for Trump in 2016, at a party in Cape Town they threw for his 70th and Musk’s 45th birthdays.“Things changed when Biden came in and Elon realised they’re trying to destroy America,” Errol said. “Now we exchange messages about every day. Of course, he’s not always able to answer, so his PA will answer me.”Additional reporting by Chris McGrealExplore more on these topicsElon MuskSouth AfricaTrump administrationRaceSchoolsAfricaUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Having built a political career on railing against the establishment – while, paradoxically, embedding himself within it – Mr Farage finds himself embroiled in yet another melodrama. This time, however, the threat comes not from the usual suspects – remainers, the BBC or “woke” elites – but from hisown side.The affair revolves aroundRupert Lowe, a little‑known businessman, elected as one of Reform UK’s five MPs in 2024 under Mr Farage’s leadership. That should have been the beginning of a forgettable contribution to British public life. Yet, thanks to theinterventionof Elon Musk – the world’s richest man and Donald Trump’s “government efficiency” tsar – Mr Lowe has a starring role in Mr Farage’s latest soap opera.Earlier this year the tech billionaire was so annoyed by Mr Farage’s decision todistancehimself from the imprisoned far-right agitator Tommy Robinson that he touted Mr Lowe as a possible replacement. Relations between Mr Farage and Mr Lowe have deteriorated since. Their feud burst out into the open this month, culminating this weekend with Reform UK alleging misconduct by Mr Lowe, which he denies. Mr Lowe, who has been suspended from the party and lost its whip in parliament, derides it as a vanity project driven by one man’s ego. He hasthreatenedto sue Reform UK for libel.Mr Farage’s reaction, however, is telling. For all his bravado aboutfree speech, the moment a rival emerges – however minor – his instinct seems to be to cut them down. This is not the first time. His political parties –Ukip, theBrexit party, Reform UK – have operated more like personality cults than democratic organs, and loyalty to the leader has eclipsed ideological purity. Challenging Mr Farage doesn’t end well for those who dare. The difference this time is that Mr Musk’s intervention gives the affair an absurdly transatlantic flavour.This illuminates a larger problem. If Mr Farage’s goal is to broaden his electoral appeal, association with Trumpism is ahindrance, not a help. While Mr Trump retains a firm grip on the Republican party, the US president remains deeplyunpopularin Britain, where even Tories see him as aliability. The perception that Mr Farage is toocloseto Mr Trump and too sympathetic to Vladimir Putin is hurting him in the polls. The opportunist in Mr Farage knows this. His strategy has been to present himself as the plebeian face of rightwing populism – foregrounding his love of pints over his attendance atMar-a-Lagobanquets. Yet the contradictions are piling up.Mr Farage seeks to appear an insurgent, yet he operates like an autocrat. He wants to court the support of Trumpianfigures, yet he knows their influence is more likely to repel than to attract British voters. He wants Reform UK to grow – but only under him. For all the bluster, this latest episode only highlights that Mr Farage, like Mr Trump, has always been far better at breaking things than building them. That ought to be a warning to mainstream parties seeking to emulate Trumpian talking points around cuttingforeign aidor sackingbureaucrats– especially with an upcoming byelection in a Labour stronghold. If Reform UK eventually ends up on the scrapheap of history, it won’t be because of Mr Lowe or Mr Musk, or even Mr Trump. It will be because, in the end, Mr Farage is his own biggest problem.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Going forward, she should channel the spirit of Jacques DelorsMon 10 Mar 2025 14.25 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 16.07 EDTShareIn apress conferenceon Sunday to mark 100 days since the beginning of her second term as European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen erred on the side of understatement when asked whether she still considered the US to be an ally. The answer was yes, she replied, before adding that “we have our discussion points without question”.Hard to argue with that. Regarding the war in Ukraine, internationaltradeand existential questions concerning the future of European defence and security, the geopolitical landscape bears no resemblance to the one that Ms von der Leyen looked out upon on 1 December. As Mr Trump and his “America first” outriders have confounded cherished assumptions about thetransatlantic alliance, they have also sought toencourageauthoritarian nationalism in EU member states.In France and Germany, the fabled engine of European integration, this has been uncomfortably akin to knocking at an open door. In Paris, days after Ms von der Leyen reassumed office, Michel Barnier’s shortlived governmentcollapsedwhen Marine Le Pen pulled the rug from under it. In Germany, well before Elon Musk and JD Vance championed its cause, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party had reached historically high levels of support that would see it finish comfortablysecondin February’s snap German election.As Ms von der Leyen put it on Sunday: “Our European values, democracy, freedom, the rule of law are under threat.” The response, from Brussels and in national capitals, needs to be both robust and more expeditious than is often the case in the labyrinthine world of EU policymaking. Happily, the initial signs are positive.The move last week by EU leaders to disapply the bloc’s fiscal rules to military spending, potentially freeing up £670bn, is a significant step towards achieving greater strategic autonomy from Washington. It followed the unveiling of extraordinarily radical proposals in the same week by Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz. Bypassing a constitutionalrestrictionon state borrowing, these are designed to facilitate not only far greater spending on defence, but also on the modernisation of a stagnating economy.After decades in which EU economic policy has been skewed by Berlin’s traditional debt aversion – shared with other“frugal”member states such as the Netherlands and Denmark – this is a verydifferentdirection of travel. As Europe exits an era defined by an uncritical commitment to free trade and dependency on the US security umbrella, it is also the right one. Recognising the desire of many member states to formalise common borrowing arrangements introduced following Covid, Ms von der Leyen said “nothing is off the table” in relation to defence. But, as theDraghi reportargued last autumn, the same kind of fiscal firepower is required to meet the challenge of the green transition and compete with the US and China for the jobs and future industries of the 21st century.Last month in Brussels, a different kind of centenary was marked when abustof a former commission president, Jacques Delors, was unveiled. Born in 1925, Mr Delors became the preeminentchampionof a “social” vision, in which common EU institutions would deploy pooled resources in order to build a Europe where solidarity and growth were intertwined. That perspective faded from view following the neoliberal turn in the 1980s. As Ms von der Leyen navigates the rest of her five-year term, its time has come again.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Will technology push us over the edge or help us exit our many crises?Mon 10 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 13.44 EDTShareToday we live in an era defined by crisis. Indeed, we are facing multiple overlapping threats at once: from acceleratingclimate breakdownto the rise ofauthoritarianismacross the world, we are in a situation that the historian Adam Tooze calls “polycrisis”. It is no wonder that hope is scarce, pessimism is high and despair is pervasive. As one meme that captures the grim, morbid mood of our age reads: “My retirement plan is civilisational collapse.”But not everyone shares this gloomy outlook. On the extreme other end of public sentiment sit Silicon Valley billionaires: they are some of the most optimistic people on earth. Of course, it’s easy to be optimistic when you are sitting on enough money to sway national politics. And yet, the source of their optimism isn’t simply money. It is also a deep-seated faith in unfettered technological advances.The left is rightly skeptical of the rosy “techno-optimism” advanced by the likes ofElon Musk, far-right mega-donorPeter Thieland hedge fund billionaire Marc Andreessen. To tech oligarchs, technological advancement is best delivered by unfettered free market capitalism. The democratic state is a hindrance to be opposed, dismantled anddestroyed– a set of goals that they now enjoy the power to achieve. Their ideology ignores inequality and glosses over the material harms their companies wreak on workers and the environment. Silicon Valley’s billionaire techno-optimism is clearly incompatible with leftwing values and should be rejected.Donald Trump is turning America into a mafia state | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreBut can and should the left advance its own techno-optimism? Can it put forward a vision of a brighter future that can compete with the grand visions of space exploration presented by Musk? Can it make the case that science and technology ought to be harnessed to deliver breakthroughs, abundance, sustainability and flourishing of human potential? And what would a progressive, leftwing techno-optimism look like? A techno-optimism that the 99% could get on board with, especially communities of color, and Black people who have historically been excluded, or even harmed, by scientific and technological breakthroughs? These are some of the questions that this new series, Breakthrough, launched by the Guardian examines.The left used to embrace technology. Indeed, the most leftwing prophet of all, Karl Marx, was so pro-technology that he is oftendescribed as “Promethean”,a reference to the Greek god who stole fire to give to humans. And it was feminist Shulamith Firestone who in the 1970s envisioned a day where we might have artificial wombs and be liberated from housework, thanks to automation: a feminist utopia delivered by technology.Some of the most groundbreaking sci-fi imagery that we encounter in books and movies like the Matrix, such as people living virtual lives entirely untethered from their bodies, were first popularized by JD Bernal, the Marxist scientist and futurist who designed the so-called Bernal spheres, for permanent space settlement, in 1929. Writing of Bernal’s influential book, The World, the Flesh and the Devil: An Enquiry into the Future of the Three Enemies of the Rational Soul, Arthur C Clarke, considered one of the fathers of sci-fi, wrote that it was “perhaps the most remarkable attempt to predict the future of scientific possibility ever made, and certainly the most stimulating”. And it was all rooted in a firmly leftwing – and specifically, socialist – world view. And, of course, Star Trek, one of the most successful sci-fi series of all time, is widely considered to be depicting asocialist post-scarcity utopia.Today, however, the left is either fearful, agnostic or hostile towards technology. The green“degrowth” movement, for example, views industry and technology as the root of our climate crisis. For them, the solution to the climate crisis is not more technological growth and innovation, but less. As Kohei Saito, the author of the bestseller Slow Down: The Degrowth Manifesto, said in an interview: “I was initially more optimistic about the development of technology” but, after reading degrowth theories, “[I] abandoned the possibility of green growth.”Degrowth has an image problem it desperately needs to overcome | Larry ElliottRead moreSaito goes on to say: “If we want to have more, in today’s sense, it will simply bring about ecological catastrophe.” Reducing consumption and production – austerity and retreat, in other words – is the only path forward for the degrowth movement. But this ignores the fact that technology can help us replace fossil fuels with other sources of clean, affordable and scalable energy that would allow for continued growth and advancement, without harming the environment.Meanwhile, leftwing leaders such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are very good at the necessary and essential task of confronting tech monopolies and billionaires, who concentrate economic and political power in their hands. But what is often lacking is a positive, bold vision for what a science and technology agenda for the 99% would look like – how technology in the right hands might help provide abundance for all.This is a lost opportunity. For all the pessimism and decline that we are witnessing – declining rates of graduation, declining birth rates, declining rates of homeownership and a rise in deaths of despair and skyrocketing rents – we also may well be on the brink of unprecedented breakthroughs and advances that could create record levels of wealth to be enjoyed by all, if these breakthroughs are accompanied by a political system that favors the wellbeing of all over billionaires. It may be hard to imagine such a system at the moment, given that corporate interests have seized nearly all levers of power, but it is nonetheless critical to do so. Do we have a political vision of how tech and science might work for us all?In 2024,artificial intelligence(AI) was recognised with not one, but two,Nobel prizes.Google’s DeepMinddiscovered 2.2m entirely new materials – 800 years worth of science in a few months. Last year saw the first time that sickle cell disease, a disease that was hitherto incurable and predominantly affects people of African descent, was reversed in a novel Crispr gene-editing therapy. Cancer and heart disease vaccines could beready within the next five years. And now, for the first time, AI issolving the intractable protein-folding problem– one ofbiology’s greatest challenges– and designing new proteins, which is essential for discovering new drugs and understanding why certain diseases occur.View image in fullscreenSo why is it that technology is almost never invoked by the left as a solution to polycrisis in general, or the climate crisis in particular? Why is it that the only people who offer bold, inspiring visions for the transformative role of technology are the likes of reactionaries like Musk?There are, of course, reasons for this. Technology alone is no panacea. Nor does technology guarantee progress. In fact, periods of technological advancement have almost always been accompanied by violence, dispossession and war. Many leftwing philosophers in the post-war period, having witnessed the ravages of fascism and Nazism, equated technology – and even the very idea of progress itself, with violence.As the Frankfurt school philosophers Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer – both of whom were Jewish intellectuals forced to flee Nazi Germany – argued in Dialectic of Enlightenment: “Technology … aims to produce neither concepts nor images, nor the joy of understanding, but method, exploitation of the labor of others, capital.”And Black artists such as Gil Scott-Heron, witnessing the advances of the space age, asked what benefit the Apollo mission might have for those struggling to make ends meet back on Earth. In Whitey on the Moon, Scott-Heron writes:“A rat done bit my sister Nell.(with Whitey on the Moon)Her face and arms began to swell.(and Whitey’s on the Moon)I can’t pay no doctor bill.(but Whitey’s on the Moon)Ten years from now I’ll be paying still.(while Whitey’s on the Moon)”Those critiques continue to resonate with many today. Especially as we witness one billionaire after another fly into space, as life on Earth grows more perilous by the day. And as billionaires push not simply the frontiers of space, but of the human body itself, it is right to remind ourselves of the legacy and history of eugenics. We can only benefit from warnings – such as those made byTimnit Gebru and Émile Torres– that the pursuit of longevity and eternal life, as well as transhumanist projects such as Neuralink, risk perpetuating eugenicist ideals in the 21st century.Perhaps, though, we would do well to adopt the position of the Frankfurt school philosopher, Herbert Marcuse, who accepted many of the critiques that his colleagues made of the Enlightenment, but who also left space for the possibility that it could go either way. In a 1941essay on technology, he wrote: “[Technology] can promote authoritarianism as well as liberty, scarcity as well as abundance, the extension as well as the abolition of toil.”He envisioned a world in which technological progress might allow human flourishing and self-realization. In a world that is technologically advanced enough, “everyone could think and act by himself, speak his own language, have his own emotions and follow his own passions” once we are “no longer chained to competitive efficiency”.Perhaps the most important condition for us to flourish is to address our climate crisis. Today, to warm our homes and cook our meals, we still set fire to things. Those who cook on gas stoves heat their food over literal flames, as cavemen once did. If we are to move out of the fossil fuel era into a new, cleaner and sustainable era – while still maintaining our freedom to travel and fly and enjoy the material comforts that we do today – this will require a combination of political will and technology. Whether fusion energy, fission or a host of renewables, the path to a new era of energy production requires new technologies and breakthroughs. Right now, for example, Silicon Valley billionaires areinvesting billionsin chasing theholy grail of limitless, clean fusion energyto power AI. Can and will the state match those efforts? And should the left make the case that it should?There is no inherent value in technology. It is neither good nor bad. It is up to us how machines are used. And indeed, who makes those machines, how, and to what ends are all political questions. While we push to change our political system and direct it towards a more equitable, inclusive and liberatory path, let us also, at the same time, push for technology to move in that direction, too.AI is ‘beating’ humans at empathy and creativity. But these games are rigged | MJ CrockettRead moreWe live in dark, depressing and – frankly – terrifying times. Our planet’s fragile ecosystem is fast spiraling out of control. Our democracies are fracturing. And billionaires are seizing for themselves all of the spoils of the digital era. Technology might well be the thing that pushes us over the edge. But it could also, if we play our cards right, allow us to exit our era of polycrisis. But that won’t happen on its own. The path towards better technology – tech for the 99% – can only be achieved through a politics of the 99%. And it must start with a vision.It is time that the left deploy all of our energies and powers towards a political vision of abundance. Abundance that is delivered by a movement for the 99% that pushes for technological growth and development for the benefit of all.We hope this series might be a place for that political vision to be discussed, debated and laid out so that optimism about the future – in particular, techno-optimism – is no longer just something that the very rich in this world can have.Amana Fontanella-Khan is the Guardian US opinion editorExplore more on these topicsTechnologyBreakthroughUS political lobbyingUS politicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Elon MuskClimate crisisHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

DuPont – a chemical manufacturing plant – contaminated the local water supply, killing cows and wildlife, making its workers sick and exposing local residents to toxic chemicals. It was an environmental horror story.It’s still happening across the country.Pfas, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, aren’t just lingering in that community – they’re everywhere. In our air, soil, water and bodies. They’re called “forever chemicals” for a reason: they don’t break down, and once they’re in our bodies, they’re almost impossible to get rid of.We now know thatrepeated ingestionof and exposure to Pfas have been linked to cancer, birth defects, developmental and reproductive disorders and weakened immune systems. Studies show they can cause kidney and testicular cancer in adults and interfere with childhood growth and behavior.Sludge seeps into the soil, contaminates groundwater and ends up in our foodYet, despite knowing the risks, the federal government – through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) – has actually encouraged farmers to spread sewage sludgecontaminated withPfasacross cropland and pastures (as the New York Times hasreportedinmultiplestories). This sludge, a byproduct of wastewater treatment, seeps into the soil, contaminates groundwater and ends up in our food. And from there? It ends up in us.Once that sewage sludge exists, it exists forever – “disposal” methods such as sending sludge to a landfill or burning it release even more dangerous chemicals into the air. We’re either poisoning our soil or polluting our lungs – there is no winning.The problem is so severe that even the EPA, which once promoted these disposal methods, isnow sounding the alarm. But sounding the alarm isn’t enough. We need action. We need regulations that put people’s health above corporate convenience. And we need them now, before forever chemicals cause even more damage – damage that can never be undone.A national problem with local consequencesThe year Dark Waters was released, 2019, many of us testified before Congress, urging lawmakers to take action on Pfas contamination. At the time, my testimony focused on what had happened in West Virginia. But this isn’t just West Virginia’s story. It’s happening all over the country, and it’s affecting all of us. Every single person in America has elevated Pfas in their body. They accumulate there. There are explosions of Pfas-related diseases happening in our communities.One example is Manchester, New Hampshire, where a wastewater treatment plant burns sewage sludge just steps from homes, an elementary school, a baseball field and the Merrimack River. It’s the only facility in the state with a sludge incinerator, and in 2018 alone, it burnedmore than 4,000 dry metric tonsof it. That’s happening just two miles from neighborhoods already struggling with high levels of toxic air pollution.View image in fullscreen‘Dark Waters [seen here in a still image] was meant to be a cautionary tale. Instead, it has become the future we keep choosing.’Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyManchester isn’t an outlier. As of May 2023, there were 86 sewage sludge incineration facilities operating across the country, with 170 incineration units spread across 24 states and Puerto Rico. Most of them are concentrated in the eastern US, particularly in New York, Ohio and New Jersey.This is our reality: we are burning toxic waste near where people live, work and go to school. And with every ton of sludge that goes up in smoke, we’re making the problem worse.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDetox Your KitchenFree weekly newsletterA seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that’s a false choice – and a dangerous one. In our interconnected world, you can’t just burn harmful chemicals and expect them to disappear. They don’t. They resurface elsewhere, often with even worse consequences.Produce in home gardens near PFAS plant in US contain dangerous levels of chemicalsRead moreThe only real solution is to stop creating these chemicals in the first place. We need to reduce the manufacturing and use of Pfas entirely. This is the most economical way of dealing with this “forever chemical” class. That means ending industrial releases of Pfas into our air and water, eliminating their unnecessary presence in everyday products like food packaging, filtering them out of drinking water and cleaning up the contamination they’ve already left behind. If we stop Pfas at the source, fewer of these toxic substances will end up in wastewater treatment plants, where they currently pile up in sludge that gets spread on farmlands, burned in incinerators or dumped in landfills.Despite overwhelming evidence of the health risks, the EPA has been slow to act. Right now, it has a critical opportunity.Through a proposed Clean Water Act permit for Manchester, New Hampshire, the EPA can take meaningful steps to curb industrial Pfas pollution at its source – steps that could be replicated nationwide. The EPA’s own report confirms that reducing Pfas from industrial wastewater means less contamination in sludge. It has even recommended that Clean Water Act permits include best management practices, like phasing out Pfas products. Yet the current draft permit for Manchester, remarkably, contains no such requirement.Clean Water Act permits protect our nation’s waters from toxic pollution. Renewing Manchester’s permit with stronger protections will curb Pfas entering the facility and their eventual release into the air we breathe and water we drink.Dark Waters was meant to be a cautionary tale; instead, it has become the future we keep choosing, at the cost of our health, our environment, and the lives of our loved ones. The EPA has a chance to send a clear message: we can no longer allow industries to pump toxic chemicals into our communities. We need the agency to lead on Pfas reduction. And we need it to act now.Mark Ruffalo is an award-winning actor and environmental activist, known for his roles in Spotlight and the Avengers films, as well as his advocacy for clean water and renewable energy through organizations including The Solutions ProjectExplore more on these topicsPFASOpinionMark RuffaloPollutionHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

Today that is no longer the case. Just 19% of Americans expect their children’s livesto be better than their own, while two-thirdsbelieve their country will be economically weaker by 2050.So our zeitgeist is increasingly one of pessimism, from anxiety about the climate crisis to concern over rising inequality. According to the historian Adam Tooze, we are living through a “polycrisis” – where such challenges are not only simultaneous but mutually reinforcing.Yet there is one sliver of society where optimism still reigns supreme:Silicon Valley.For a long time technological utopianism was a leftwing idea. Its patron saint was Edward Bellamy whose 19th-century novel, Looking Backward, was more influential among the American left than Marx and Engels. In Britain this perspective was best represented by Fabian socialism. Its rationale was alluringly simple: human progress was a corollary of technological development, with both needing scientific management. Over time, more complex technologies would require a larger state. And a larger state would require socialism.Today such thinking has been inverted, with supporters of market capitalism, and a minimal state, most optimistic about the future. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the venture capital fund Andreessen Horowitz, even penned a “techno-optimist manifesto” last year – in part to counter the prevailing winds of despair. If nothing else it reveals how Silicon Valley thinks, with Andreesen expressing this with particular clarity when he writes how “there is no material problem   … that cannot be solved with more technology”.As the magazine Current Affairsobserved, no evidence is forthcoming alongside such bombastic claims. For instance, when Andreessen writes how “central planning is a doom loop”, he conveniently omits how the development of the internet, solar cells, lithium batteries, the jet engine and nuclear power all relied on state-backed R&D. But while his screed is bizarre, uninformed and in parts even dangerous, he is right about one thing: our instinctive miserabilism, increasingly pervasive on the left, is unwarranted.Take recurrent arguments against having children. Choosing to have kids is a personal matter. Yet in recent years I’ve repeatedly encountered the claim that having descendants is immoralbecause of climate change. Even if you agree that ours is an age of polycrisis, this is absurd.After all, 100 years ago the average person, in one of the the world’s wealthiest societies, could expect to live until 40. Today global life expectancy is 73. In 19th-century England, between 40 and 60 women died in childbirth for every thousand births. Today that figure is seven for every100,000. As Ezra Kleinhas noted, no serious climate models suggest a return to the world of 1950, let alone 1150. Taking this argument to its logical conclusion, nobody should have had children before our grandparents – in which case humanity should have long been extinct.Such irrational pessimism inflects how we view technology too. Yes, there are moral questions surrounding innovations like gene-editing and Crispr, but these same tools could eliminate thousands of inherited conditions – from sickle cell to Huntington’s disease. The 2030s may well be a decade of inflationary shocks and extreme weather events, but it could also herald the arrival of real-time language translation and cancer vaccines used by billions.View image in fullscreenIn their defence many pessimists acknowledge such developments – they are simply aware that any benefits will be unequally shared. This is particularly relevant for machine learning and the world of work.AI could add as much as $13tn to the global economy between 2017 and 2030. Given recent technological changes have, according to the World Bank, meant that “advanced economies face increasingly polarized labour markets and rising inequality”, concerns around who benefits from an innovation as potentially disruptive as the steam engine make sense. While some will get rich from its commercial applications, many more will lose jobs or see their wages squeezed. Ignoring that, and maintaining technology as somehow neutral, is a covert form of class war.The philosopher Alfred Whitehead once declared that the greatest invention of the Victorian age was the idea of invention itself. Yet as humanity masteredhowto innovate, we progressively lost touch withwhy we should. This now seems to have reached its apogee with “effective accelerationists”, whose answer to every challenge is simply more technology. I can think of no idea more ill-suited for a world of polycrisis.So what is the alternative from the left if mindless tech optimism will only deepen problems heading our way?As with the right it should be a project of individual freedom. But such freedom should be understood as meaningless, or even destructive, if it generates unfreedom elsewhere. The economist Amartya Sen defined unfreedom as constraints beyond our control which undermine our ability to pursue lives of meaning. Inadequate access to food is a source of unfreedom, as is being homeless or not having an education. Franklin Roosevelt put it best when he said that “necessitous men are not free men”.If eliminating unfreedom is the end, then the creation ofUniversal Basic Services(UBS), is the means. These UBS comprise housing, healthcare, transport and education, should be free at the point of use, and funded by progressive taxation. Accessing them should be viewed as necessary for any citizen to fully participate in economic life. Indeed they are just as fundamental to a life of freedom as legal and political rights.Markets would still exist for things like cars, or silk ties, but the logic of profit wouldn’t apply to UBS. So rather than machine learning creating the conditions for the world’s first trillionaire,as gleefully predicted by Mark Cuban, it could provide the basis for a post-carbon, autonomous transport infrastructure, or free adult education throughout one’s life.Alongside UBS, the dividend of technological progress would also make possible a four-day week. After all, countries with a shorter working week enjoy higher levels of social capital, more volunteering and greater gender equality. What is more, those who work less report greater feelings of personal satisfaction. To be clear: this isn’t a post-work society, not least because, in our lifetimes at least, there will be enough work to go around with an ageing population and climate adaptation. But a four-day week should be to the 2030s what the eight-hour day was to the late 19th century.For all the extraordinary inventiveness of recent decades, perhaps our greatest technology remains the state – that unique vehicle for collective action. To create UBS, and expand leisure time for all, means believing in it once again. Indeedmeaningfuloptimism about technology requires political demands and a specific vision for our collective future. Without that we are always at the whim of the 0.01%.Aaron Bastani is the co-founder of Novara Media. He is also the author of Fully Automated Luxury Communism"

In many respects, this shouldn’t come as a surprise – President Trump has been clear in his belief in tariffs as an effective policy tool. Indeed, the new US administration views tariffs as not only a means of raising tax revenue but also as a negotiating tool and a lever to ameliorate so-called trade imbalances. So far, we have seen both the threat of tariffs and the use of tariffs to achieve all these objectives.Despite all the headlines, Australia hasn’t really been subject to large changes in tariffs on its exports to the US. The US has, however, announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports. If Australia is not successful in obtaining an exemption, Australian steel and aluminium exports to the US will be subject to new tariffs from 12 March. At an aggregate level, this won’t make much difference to Australia’s trade balance because the value of our exports of steel and aluminium to the US is only a very small proportion of our total exports. This is not to ignore the fact that, at a firm or industry level, a 25% tariff is significant.Beyond the tariff on steel and aluminium, Australia is unlikely to suffer a large direct impact from changes in US tariff policy. For a start, Australia runs a trade deficit with the US; that is, the value of our exports to the US is lower than the value of our imports from the US. In contrast to some countries who run large trade surpluses with the US, such as Canada, Mexico, Vietnam and China, this means that we are unlikely to be in the firing line for large tariffs. Andrecent researchby the Reserve Bank of Australia shows that even if the US levied an additional 10% tariff on all Australian exports to the US, the direct impact would be about 0.1% of GDP; that is, very minimal.Liberals ‘cheering against Australia’s interest’ over Trump tariffs, Albanese saysRead moreBut we know that the world is more complex than a simple bilateral trade relationship. And so it is right to consider the fact that Australia is very integrated into the global economy when we are trying to assess the impact of changes to US tariff policy. Australia’s economic history tells us that our economy generally prospers in an environment of free trade, reflecting our status as a small, open trading economy. So a more difficult environment for global trade is unlikely to be positive for Australia, all else being equal.At an economy-wide level, a global trade war based on higher tariff rates will be detrimental to Australian economic growth. Working out by how much is difficult, and requires a large number of assumptions across a range of variables. The impact on inflation is unclear and could be either positive or negative.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailOne framework that might help us to think about changes to US trade policy is that of regime change. The world that many of us grew up in – the three decades from the 1980s – was generally characterised by a belief in free markets and free trade. Capital and labour moved with ease across borders, China entered the World Trade Organization and companies chose to locate manufacturing capability in cheaper locations offshore.Trump’s trade adviser says Australia is waging a ‘frontal assault’ on US aluminium markets. What’s really going on?Read moreThe world has looked quite different in the last few years. Tariffs and export controls are now part of economic statecraft and are working to impede free trade. Countries are turning inward in the interests of national and economic security. Labour is no longer so free to move across borders as some countries shift their attitudes towards immigration. In addition, the so-called peace dividend – where countries could spend more on social programs because they were spending less on defence – is clearly no longer. National interest and economic security now subordinate conventional foreign policy and diplomacy.So when viewed in the context of a multi-decade regime change, the use of tariffs should be thought of as part of the new normal. This is a very different environment to that which has defined most of our lived experience, and so it is not surprising that businesses and consumers are feeling unsettled. And herein lies the main risk – if consumers and businesses feel like the outlook is too uncertain, then they may elect to postpone spending, hiring or investment spend. One consumer or business acting in this way won’t matter too much, but if everyone does it, then the aggregate impact will be sizeable.Regardless, we should take comfort in the fact that Australia has a floating exchange rate and ample scope to ease both fiscal and monetary policy. All these factors will help to support the economy in the wake of weaker domestic and global economic growth in the event US tariff policy proves disruptive.Sally Auld was previously chief investment officer for NAB Private Wealth and JBWere and is the incoming chief economist for NABExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyOpinionEconomicsDonald TrumpInternational tradecommentShareReuse this content"

They have made that shameful choiceMon 10 Mar 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 15.07 EDTShareWhether it’s the front pages or your Uncle Frank’s Facebook posts, you’ll have done well lately to avoid news about upcoming disability benefits cuts. After months of speculation, the government is reportedlyset to pull £6bnfrom the “welfare budget” ahead of its spring statement, with some Labour MPs already threatening revolt.Read much of the commentary and you’d believe this was all about the public purse – see talk about“savings”and changing“global factors”such as trade tariffs and the war in Ukraine. And yet, dig a little deeper and Labour’s proposed reforms appear to be based not just on budgeting, but a belief: paid work is a virtue (and people who don’t perform it deserve a worse life than everyone else). As Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary,said last week: “There is a moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work.”Since taking office last summer, Keir Starmer has made work a central tenet of the new government. At a time when the number of people off sick long-term isat a record high, the prime minister’s repeated use of the phrase “working people” has not exactly been subtle.This has never just been about arguing work is the best way to pay the bills – it is about painting it as a virtue in the pursuit of economic growth. Just look at how a recent PR video for the government’sKeep Britain Workingreview refers to disabilities as“work-limiting conditions”. It is a rebranding of distress, where, say, Parkinson’s is not a painful illness that affects human beings but an obstacle that prevents arms from stacking shelves for shareholders.Even Labour’s NHS reforms and health policies have been framed in terms of getting people back into the labour market, with ministerspondering weight-loss jabsfor unemployed people andwork coachesvisiting patients on mental health wards. It is reminiscent of a “your country needs you” recruitment poster, where the long-term sick are expected to battle through the pain for the sake of the taxpayer. Under Labour, health is a prerequisite – not for a good life for yourself, but to be a good worker for the nation.This is hardly a new narrative. Back in 1834, thepoor lawssaw the “deserving poor” sent to the workhouses to be housed and fed in exchange for gruelling labour. More than 150 years later, New Labourcut single mothers’ benefitsto nudge them into work under the principle that the state should start“demanding more of individuals”. And who could forget the coalition government thatpegged £10bn of cutsto the “welfare bill” on the moral mission to target so-called scroungers who – as the then chancellorGeorge Osborne notoriously put it– have their “blinds down” in the morning while strivers go to work.Fast forward a decade and it is clear these ideas are taking hold again, from institutions and the press to social media. When the rightwing thinktank Policy Exchangepublished a report last week– backed by former Labour work and pensions secretary Lord Blunkett – calling for a regressive overhaul of disability benefits, it notably did so on the basis that the system wasn’t working fiscally, technically “or morally”. Even the seemingly neutral term “economically inactive”, which has entered the lexicon in recent years, is morally loaded, defining human beings by whether they add value to the economy or are – literally – inactive.Of course, all of this speaks to the nature of work under capitalism. It exploits workers for profit while claiming only those who labour – not the unemployed – will get improved material conditions. It ignores the reality that much work is unfulfilling and hard, and in 2025 increasingly fails to meet basic living costs. Instead, this moral case for work creates a vision of a benevolent boss class gifting the joy of a 9-to-5 to the masses. As the current work and pensions chief, Liz Kendall,said in January, getting disabled people into employment gives them “purpose”.‘Don’t punish the vulnerable’: Labour MPs uneasy over planned welfare cutsRead moreBut it also evokes – and fuels – specific prejudices about disabled people that go far beyond the Labour party. The same arguments that equate “productivity” with a person’s value have long been used to portray those who can’t earn a wage due to disability as a burden on the working population. Every time you see a headline on “the cost of the benefits bill”, what you are really reading is “the cost of disabled people”. That Labour’s reforms reportedly include raising the universal credit basic rate for those looking for or in work,while cutting itfor those judged as unfit to work, is a particularly blatant message. Such policy casts individuals who “overcome” their condition to work as worthy, and those who fail to as just not trying hard enough.It is why any drives to get disabled people into work always go hand in hand with a punitive benefits system, despite all evidence showingsuch measures are counterproductive. As Nick Ferraritold LBC listenerslast week (while making mock crying sounds, no less): people on benefits who are deemed not to be looking for work should get more “hassle” from job coaches and their money docked – as long as they’ve “got use of [their] arms”. If work brings moral reward, unemployment comes with punishment.In this context, Labour’srefusal to introducea wealth tax to meet costs is less a temporary outrage and more a natural extension of the status quo. We should all know the rules of the game by now: in a culture that equates wealth with respect, and productivity with value, rich and healthy people are applauded as hard-working and deserving, while poor and sick people are demonised as idle and unworthy. Before you know it, a Labour government is choosing – and it is a choice – to take money from disabled benefit claimants rather than tax high earners. You might ask, is that the moral thing to do?Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist. Her latest book,Who Wants Normal?

They can close valves in their nostrils and ears and a special membraneover their eyes; their epiglottis, the flap that stops water entering the lungs, is inside their nose instead of their throat; they use their tongue to shield their throats from water; and their lips to shield their mouths – their lips can closebehindtheir front teeth. Their teeth are rust-orange, because they are strengthened with iron.Their back feet are webbed like a duck’s; on land, their front feet act like hands, digging, grasping and carrying things from the riverbed to the surface – rocks, for example, tucked under their chins and cradled by their arms. When they swim, they do so while holding their front paws to their chests, like a severe governess in a Victorian novel, or a child pretending to be a rabbit. They prefer to carry branches in their teeth, like dogs. The biggest beavers weigh 50kg.View image in fullscreenA beaver shortly after emerging from its den, looking for food on a river in Devon.Photograph: Josh Huxham/Getty Images/iStockphotoBeavers are monogamous. The males have a bone in their penis. Beaver kits are born with their coats, and mew, squeak and cry to get attention. Adults, to get attention – mainly to warn other beavers of danger – will slap water with their tails.Their tails – which they tend to sit on like a saddle, between their legs – were once a European delicacy. The Catholic church, believing that beavers were half animal, half fish, designated that half as an appropriate food for lent. The naturalist Pierre Belon described the taste as like a “nicely dressed eel”.In the Divine Comedy, the pilgrim Dante is in the seventh circle of hell (Violence) and compares the presence of a Geryon – a dragon-like monster with hairy arms and the “face of a just and honest man” sitting at the edge of the abyss that will carry him down to the eighth circle (Fraud) – to a beaver (il bevero), which moves between water and land:As boats will sometimes lie along the shore,with part of them on land and part in water,and just as there [...]the beaver sets himself when he means war,so did that squalid beast lie on the marginof stone that serves as border for the sand.Beavers have, in fact, played an important, if unwilling, role in several violent wars. The beaver fur trade was at the centre of the Beaver or Iroquois wars, King William’s war, and the French and Indian war. Beavers themselves are fairly comfortable with conflict, once the terms have been established. They behave in a way described as the “Dear enemy” phenomenon, where they will stop fighting with neighbouring territorial animals once their boundaries are set.In some ways, they have established this relationship with us. Beavers have, several times, ignored humans and simply got on with it, in a way that has benefited us hugely. Recently, on a river south of Prague in Czech Republic, where government negotiations to build a dam had been delayed, a group of beavers went ahead and built several dams themselves,saving the government more than a million euros in construction. The wetland the beavers created was twice the size of what the government had planned.View image in fullscreenA female Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) grooming on the River Otter as one of its kits gnaws a willow sapling she’s cut.Photograph: Nick Upton/AlamyBeavers build dams because creating deeper bodies of water allows them to build homes – called lodges – that can be accessed by swimming underneath the entrance.This stops predators who can’t swim from being able to chase and eat them. They start with layers of mud and stone plugged with grass and other softish green things. Then they put sticks and branches on this layer, facing upstream. These are held in place with more mud and stone, and any remaining holes are plugged with more vegetation. They carry mud in their paws, or bring water weeds up to the surface by scooping them up with their heads and noses. They look so proud, adding materials to the wall.Beavers build such good dams that they are now being intentionally introduced to areas where these would otherwise be built by people. They change the way water moves through a landscape, preventing flood and drought, creating ponds where certain species thrive.They do all this while eating only plants. In summer, water lilies, rushes, sedges and grasses. In winter, bark and wood from only the prettiest trees: aspen, dogwood, willow, alder and birch. They shit sawdust.Helen Sullivan is a Guardian journalist. She is writing a book for Scribner AustraliaDo you have an animal, insect or other subject you’d like to see profiled by this columnist?

It has to learn from its mistakes, and fastMon 10 Mar 2025 09.41 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 13.33 EDTShareTwo days after he met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, at his Sandringham estate, King Charles was photographed on the bridge of HMS Prince of Wales. It was a clever move by the navy’s top brass to invite him. They know that the aircraft carrier, and her sister, HMS Queen Elizabeth, are being questioned as luxuries Britain can ill afford. They are completely unsuited to modern warfare. As if to acknowledge the point, while defence chiefs struggle to find weapons desperately needed by Ukraine, including basic ammunition, they are sending the Prince of Wales to “fly the flag” in south-east Asia.The carriers, the largest warships built for the navy, cost more than £6bn, well above the original estimate of under £4bn. Maintaining and repairing the ships, hit by serious mechanical problems over their short lifespan, has already cost nearly £1bn.Soon after he retired as chief of the defence staff, Gen (now Lord) David Richards described the carriers to me as “unaffordable, vulnerable metal cans”. They were “behemoths”, he said. The carriers were considered to be so vulnerable to attack that the navy last year advised they should not be deployed to the Red Sea toprotect merchant ships from Houthi missiles.The navy does not have enough sailors to crew the ships needed to protect and supply the carriers. The number of F-35 fighters available to fly from the carriers is also well below the ships’ capacity. We now face the extraordinary situation where the navy’s most expensive ships, designed to carry the world’s most expensive warplanes, will soon become a base for drones: drones that can cost as little as a few thousand, even a few hundred, pounds, and are proving to be the most deadly weapons in Ukraine.For too long, Britain’s defence establishment has been allowed to get away with procuring military equipment that is more relevant to past wars, turning a blind eye to the mounting evidence of fundamental changes in the nature of military conflict. Years ago, I asked a top official what mistakes theMinistry of Defencewas making, what it was ignoring. He gave me a one-word answer: “Cyber.” To the frustration of the intelligence agencies, the MoD was slow to recognise the growing threat of cyberwarfare. Russian defence chiefs were already acknowledging that their country could not beat the west by force alone, despite Vladimir Putin’s rhetoric, suggesting that “non-military” tactics – arson, subversion and sabotage, including attacks on undersea communications cables – could be more effective than traditional warfare.0:40UK’s largest warship enters Portsmouth – videoYear after year, the National Audit Office, backed by the Commons public accounts committee, castigates the MoD for failing to learn from past mistakes. British taxpayers are spending more than £5bn on the army’s Ajax armoured vehicle, now finally beingdelivered eight years late, after tests revealed serious design faults, with soldiers getting ill from vibration and noise. Serious problems have also hit plans for the army’s new communications system, the navy’s nuclear-powered Astute attack submarine fleet, and the fleet of Type 45 destroyers.Meanwhile, Britain spends a larger portion of its military budget on nuclear weapons than any other state,researchby the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons shows. Annual spending on Britain’s nuclear weapons has more than doubled since 2012, the website Defence Eye hasreported. The MoD has singled out uncertainties about the cost of Britain’s nuclear weapons programme as one of the reasons it failed to publish its spending plans.In 2023, the NAO pointed to a £16.9bn black hole in Britain’s defence equipment programme. Now, for the second successive year, the MoD has failed to publish an annual report on the state of its equipment programme. The NAO has not been able to produce an independent assessment of the government’s arms procurement plans.Earlier this year, the chairs of the Commons defence and public accounts committeeswroteto the MoD’s most senior official expressing their “deep frustration” at an “unacceptable loss of transparency … severely undermining the ability of both committees to scrutinise the estimated £300bn of taxpayers’ money to be spent on defence equipment over the next decade”.In a recent and timely book, The Retreat from Strategy, co-authored with the defence academic Julian Lindley-French, Lord Richards warns against “wallowing in nostalgia”, with British defence policy “incoherent and purposeless, with little relation between defence strategic ends, ways and means”. The final recommendations of the strategic defence review by George Robertson, the former Labour defence secretary, are being studied by the government. Promised by the end of June, it will be the most important test yet of how, or indeed whether, the government has learned from its past mistakes. Recent history tells us it is not so much the amount of money devoted to the armed forces, as how it is spent: the waste must end.Richard Norton-Taylor writes for the Guardian on defence and security and is a contributor to a forthcoming alternative defence reviewExplore more on these topicsMinistry of DefenceOpinionDefence policyMilitaryRoyal NavycommentShareReuse this content"

Fifteen thousand years ago, most of the country was buried a kilometre deep in ice – not ideal conditions for life. That all changed as we moved out of the lastice ageinto the current, milder climate phase. The ice sheets retreated, leaving an empty landscape for anything with the wherewithal to seize the opportunity and move in. Tens of thousands of species did, mainly heading north from the European continent to which Britain was then joined. The result was a native biota where almost every species is an immigrant. Our ancestors were among them.Immigration is a natural process, but it’s one that has been fundamentally changed thanks to humanity’s wanderlust. As we’ve moved around the world we have taken many other species along with us – some deliberately, some accidentally – to areas they couldn’t have reached without our assistance. These include many of the most familiar denizens of the British countryside. Grey squirrel, ring-necked parakeet, horse chestnut, rhododendron– none of these would be in Britain if they hadn’t been brought by people. They are what ecologists call aliens. Anywhere people live you’ll also find aliens.Invasive alien species (IAS) are immigrants, but of a sort never before experienced in nature. Most natural colonists come from nearby. Now, pretty much anything can get anywhere from anywhere. Japanese knotweed,giant rhubarb(Gunnera), Himalayan balsam and Canadian pondweed are aliens living in Britain. Natural colonists need to have the traits necessary to make the journey to a new environment, but aliens don’t. Rats didn’t have the strokes to reach the Isles of Scilly, but humans lent a hand. Likewise, stoats to Orkney. ThemidgeEretmoptera murphyimade it from South Georgia to the Antarctic peninsula, 500 miles away, despite being flightless.Humans have been moving species for thousands of years, but the rate at which aliens are arriving is speeding up. For most of the last 500-odd years, a new alien species has appeared somewhere roughly every other month or so, or around seven new aliens per year worldwide. The rate of arrival started to climb in the middle of the 18th century, as trade routes between the European colonial powers and their possessions were regularised. It has continued to climb ever since. By the end of the 20th century, more than one new alien species was appearing somewhereevery day, on average. More alien bird species arrived in the 17 years between 1983 to 2000 than there had beenin the 400 yearsbetween 1500 and 1900.The rate at which aliens are arriving is accelerating, and so is the rate at which the arrivals spread. Take the1,000-plus alien insect speciesexpanding across Europe. For most of the last two centuries, they spread at an average of 3.3km a year – not especially fast, but moving. That speed has slowly picked up though – to 12.1km/yr for insects first seen between 1970 and 1989, and a speedy 37km/yr for insects appearing after 1989.The reasons for the great alien acceleration are pretty obvious. Humans have always travelled, but in just a few centuries we’ve gone from wind-driven carracks to diesel-powered container ships, and now planes. We’re moving further, faster and with greater capacity to carry cargo with us. Trade deals eliminate borders and reduce the opportunities to intercept aliens, but that trade also supplies a demand for novel species. At least 1,000 species of alien mammal, 2,600 species of bird and 2,200 species of reptile weretraded on the international marketbetween 1975 and 2021, most probably as exotic pets. The internet facilitates this. It’s easy to find websites where you can buy 60 different species of spider, 50 of scorpion and dozens of other types of invertebrate. The Royal Horticultural Society’s Plant Finderlistsmore than 70,000 plant varieties available for sale in Britain, the vast majority of which will be alien given our native flora isonly around 1,750 species. Any plant that comes with soil is probably bringing in invertebrates and microbes too. Even a Colombian tree frog, in one well-publicisedrecent case.You’ve probably been told that biodiversity is good, so why not just welcome all these aliens? The short answer is that aliens have impacts. Aliens drive extinctions of naive natives – they’ve been fully or partly responsible for moreextinctions in the last 500 yearsthan any other cause, even habitat destruction. Aliens affect human health – think malaria or yellow fever in the Americas – and are estimated to wipe at least$423bnoff global economies. That might not sound like a lot, but it is nearly half of what developing countries have beenarguing they needannually by 2030 to combat the devastating effects of climate breakdown. It’s true that most aliens don’t have (or have not yet had) impacts, but we often don’t know which ones will until it is too late.‘Substantial’ increase in grey squirrels in England is concerning, campaigners sayRead moreWe have a moral duty to address the environmental problems we’ve caused, and there is plenty we can do to stem the tide of alien species. Strict biosecurity regulationsreducedthe rate of alien plant arrivals in New Zealand to almost zero, and havegreatly reducedthe arrival of new aliens in the North American Great Lakes. Public awareness of threats helps – the earlier a problem species is noticed, the easier it is to deal with. Vigilance by beekeepers and the wider public have (so far)prevented the establishmentof the bee-killing Asian hornet in the UK. While some might balk at the implications – lethal control of alien species will often be required – looking the other way is simply making a choice about where deaths fall. Asian hornets or honeybees. Scilly’s rats or the seabird chicks and eggs they consume.Tim Blackburn is professor of invasion biology at University College London and author of The Jewel Box: How Moths Illuminate Nature’s Hidden RulesExplore more on these topicsInvasive speciesOpinionWildlifeConservationcommentShareReuse this content"

The sense was that he was eager to get back to Canada to run for office in the next federal election. But that election came and went in 2019, and Carney instead extended his tenure at the Bank, ultimately leaving it in 2020. A year later, the Guardianasked himwhether he’d be prime minister of Canada some day. Carney was deliberately coy. “Er, look at the time!” he laughed, with a raised eyebrow.No need to be cute any more. On Sunday evening, Carneywon the Liberal leadership racein a landslide, capturing 85.9% of the overall riding points on the first count. The party allocates 100 possible points to each constituency (or ridings, as they’re known), and those points are distributed based on the ratio won by each candidate in each riding (the ballots are ranked). Carney’s commanding win outdoes even that of his predecessor, Justin Trudeau, who won the leadership in 2013 with a little over 80% of the points.Carney is now not only Liberal party leader, but in the coming days will be sworn in as prime minister. His grip on the latter will be tested quickly. The expectation in Ottawa is that Carney will quickly call a federal election, both because he otherwise would be open to accusations of illegitimacy – as a prime minister without a seat in the House – and because, for the first time in two years, the Liberals arebeginning to close the gapon the opposition Conservatives in the polls.View image in fullscreenJustin Trudeau leaves a news conference after announcing his resignation as Liberal leader outside Rideau Cottage, Ottawa, 6 January 2025.Photograph: Canadian Press/REX/ShutterstockIt has been a stunning turnaround. Just two months ago, when Trudeau announcedhis resignation, the Liberals were barely scraping 20% support among Canadians. Now, the party is pushing 30%. Donald Trump is partly the catalyst for this. He has quickly refocused Canadians’ attention externally, and forced them to rethink their priorities, including whom they trust to deal with the US president. Since early February, the answer to that for Canadians broadly has increasingly been the Liberals –with Carney at the helm. “Everything in my life has helped prepare me for this moment,” Carney told the Liberal crowd on Sunday. At the moment, it seems a lot of Canadians agree.No doubt this has frustrated Carney’s main rival in the leadership race, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland. On Sunday, Freeland finished second in the party voting, but with just 8% of the points. Carney even handily beat Freeland in her own riding, by 1,322 votes to 188. It was, frankly, a terrible outcome for her – and one that few would have predicted a few months ago.Freeland’s own resignation from cabinet on 16 December – on the morning she was due to present the government’s economic statement, no less – was what finally pushed Trudeau to step aside in early January. It also immediately positioned Freeland as the assumed frontrunner. But her campaign was bad. As abrupt as her break with the Trudeau government was, it was impossible for her to separate herself entirely. And at times, particularly when it came to Trump, she didn’t want to. Freeland told everyone she knew from experience how to deal with a Trump administration.Few believed her.Freeland finished her campaign on a lacklustre note, by promising to appoint Carney as her finance minister, should she win – an obvious acknowledgment of the trending mood. Carney has not yet made a reciprocal offer.Still, on Sunday night, Carney thanked Freeland and the others for running, and praised Trudeau’s “strength and compassion as a fighter for Canada”. It was perhaps a nod to Trudeau’s last few weeks as much as the preceding nine years. Trump helped make Canadians nationalists again, no question. But it’s Trudeau, in his final act, who has helped Canadians feel like they still belong together. He has always been good in a moment of crisis, and his responses to Trump’s tariff imposition(s) are proof. Trudeau’s frank language, his direct appeals to Americans, and his framing of Trump – or “Donald” – as a buffoonish tool, have matched the national mood perfectly. He has also, finally, wrongfooted the Conservatives. Party leader Pierre Poilievre’s years of negativity and snark have undermined his credibility as a force for unity. That’s clearer now than ever.Back in 2021, Carney explained: “If I had stayed in private finance, the opportunity cost of me being in public service for 20 years is enormous. Do I care about money? Obviously, I have a family to provide for and stuff, but I am in bloody Ottawa. I am back in Ottawa.” That is truer now than ever. An election looms soon for Canada, and we’ll see whether everything in Carney’s life has prepared him for one more win. In the meantime, it seems like Carney is right where he wants to be.Colin Horgan is a Toronto-based writer and a former speechwriter for Justin TrudeauExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionMark CarneyAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

I’m not proud, but I was young, and this to me then looked like something I wanted a piece of.Cut to now and, several years of anti-fur campaigning later, you might have thought that the outlook would be different, that fur would be an archaism at best and an ethical abomination at worst; the embodiment of a bygone era when we were still using the planet and its creatures like they weren’t going anywhere.There had been concrete progress: many of the big-name fashion houses over the years banned it. In 2019, Kim Kardashian announced that she had “remade” all ofher favourite fur coats in fake furand then Queen Elizabethrenounced furin “any new outfits”. On it went: in 2021, Kering, the luxury conglomerate that owns many luxury brands, banned the use of fur, as the British Fashion Council had earlier done at London fashion week.The debate around fur was over and won, right? Wrong. At the recent Milan fashion week,fur was furring. Of course it was the main character at the Fendi centenary show – the brand started as a fur workshop in 1925. (In a full-circle moment, Sarah Jessica Parker was sitting on the front row.)It was there, whether faux or otherwise, at other shows too, and other fashion weeks. At one of the buzziest shows of London, Simone Rocha, models including Alexa Chung walked in faux fur (yes, no animals have been killed, but the optics are the same). At sustainably minded brand Ganni, in Paris, the fur was recycled polyester. While in New York, fromthe catwalks to the streets, the city looked like the inside of a Narnian wardrobe. Real or not, seeing fur in the ether makes people more likely to want it, to wear it; it makes it aspirational but, more crucially, it normalises it. The ripple effect is real.Perhaps more surprising than the fact that the fashion industry is still a sucker for fur, is that young people are newly embracing it. In London, New York and Berlin, people not old enough to watch SATC first time around are draping themselves in it. It seems to be limited to vintage. On TikTok, views of videos about vintage coats have increased by 243% over the past year. Google searches for “vintage fur coats” have reportedly gone up 688% since January 2023. The consensus seems to be that it isgen Z who are driving the trend.Why this is happening has already been the subject of fascination and consternation. There’s a lot to unpack. At the time real fur was being banned en masse, faux fur was offered as an ethical alternative. People could have their cake and eat it. But now, many consumers – perhaps particularly younger ones – are educated enough to know that the fake stuff is, in the main, made from plastic. So vintage furs haveregained some of the moral high ground, somewhat dissipating the stigma.Then of course there is the role of influence. A comprehensive catalogue of fur can be traced back to the Kardashian/Jenners, whose collective Instagram following outpaces that of most countries.Kendall Jenner, a 29-year-old model, has been wearing an embarrassment of vintage fur looks of late. This is the family that shifted the dial on what was considered the female body ideal of the first half of the 21st century. When they champion a certain hip to waist ratio, people hit the gymor doctor’s surgery. When they wear fur, people reach for the pelts.Then there was last year’s“mob wife” aestheticthat saw young people vying to dress like Carmela Soprano in her stolen sable. Her more recent heir might be Ani in theOscar-winning film Anora, whosesable coatwas that rags-to-riches story’s glass slipper.Add to that a lesser-known but equally furry aesthetic: boom boom. In December, trend forecaster Sean Monahan, the man responsible for the portmanteau “normcore”, announced the trend as a cultural expression of the new Trump era. It is over-the-top and unashamed about its own greed and lack of wokeness.The vintage fur debate: does it honour an animal or normalise cruelty?Read moreSome young people seem to feel about fur – judging by the kind of content several make about it on TikTok – the way I felt about seeing Carrie at the ballgame. There seems to be a thirst for a certain kind of swagger – whatever that means to you – that wearing a fur can give you; an impenetrability. On TikTok, creatorsmake videos of themselvesin fur coats backdropped by Future’s Low Life, a song about unapologetic hedonism. “How thrift furs got me feeling”, writes one user. People are commenting on theconfidence boost they feelwhen wearing fur.But we can’t lay this all at the feet of gen Z. I have a hunch that many people never stopped liking the aesthetic of fur, and would still have worn it – even in the knowledge of the cruelty involved – had it not been for the shame factor. Forces have now converged to shake off that stigma. Trends cycle – and so, it seems, do our consciences.Ellie Violet Bramley is the Guardian’s acting fashion and lifestyle editorExplore more on these topicsFashionOpinionFashion industrycommentShareReuse this content"

When mine was taken away, I found outAlexander HurstAs a Paris film extra, I surrendered my device and discovered the extraordinary connections I miss while staring at my screenMon 10 Mar 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 12.18 EDTShareAfew Thursdays ago was a wrap. For my brief acting career, that is. One of the benefits of having a writer’s schedule in a city like Paris is the ability to say yes to the flurry of random opportunities that pop up. When an announcement flashed across a WhatsApp group that a Hollywood comedy-thrillerwith an all-star cast and a wacky plot was lookingfor extras, I thought why not – and sent in a few headshots. (I wish I could reveal more details, but I am, alas, bound by a non-disclosure clause that the production company declined to release me from.)I had little idea of exactly what to expect. But I certainly wasn’t thinking that one of the biggest takeaways would be spending hours with other people without access to our phones.The part of flying that I used to relish was that it was one of the last spaces on Earth away from the distraction of always being connected. But now free wifi abounds, meaning it’s not the refuge it used to be. A movie set, on the other hand, is largely still a phone-free space. In our case, we placed them into a locked box after HMC (hair, makeup, costume) and before arriving on the actual set itself, inside a cavernous studio at Paris’sCité du Cinéma.Being an extra often involves a lot of waiting: you’re technically on set, but not in every scene. And even when you are in a scene, it’s rehearsed with body-doubles before the main actors arrive, then shot perhaps a dozen times, and then maybe even reshot from a different angle.‘I was told not to make eye contact with Tom Cruise’: meet the world’s most prolific film extraRead moreWhen we weren’t actively in scenes, but still on set without our phones, what else was there to do but … talk to each other? It was gloriously old school. A glimpse into what life must have been like before everyone’s head was inclined forward and averting their gaze – on the Métro, on the street, in cafes while people wait for whoever they’re waiting for. Instead, there was an intense awareness of the heat thrown off from enormous lights, the deep colour palette of dozens of costumes, many meetings of many eyes.Among the people I met because I had no distraction from the potential awkwardness of not having met them yet: an art student from Quebec, who offered to sketch out an idea for a tattoo that I’ve been waffling on about; an early career Parisian actor who wrote fantasy fiction in her free time and shared my love for Vietnamese pho; a Haitian who had moved toFrancewhen he was 12, and hasn’t been back since; a fellow journalist who started out covering sports, but then moved into covering cinema; a Franco-Dutch programme coordinator at an academic institute.We chatted, we read, we played charades, we gossiped. At one point, upon hearing that I was a journalist in real life, someone (none of the above) tried to convince me that the lunar landing had been staged “in an American studio”, and to investigate more deeply. (I’m obliged, at this moment, to point out that this particular conspiracy theory has beendebunked,debunked, anddebunked.)In between takes, personalities seemed to pop out – of the surprisingly heavy hitting cast, as well as from fellow extras. During one scene, the programme coordinator and I were milling around in the background, having an (inaudible) conversation. As the scene was shot, and reshot, and shot again, we leant into the chance for an improv session, increasingly levelling up the absurdness of our questions to each other and our responses back. It couldn’t help but result in a quick friendship.Somewhere around the time I graduated from college, technology seemed to stop bringing us together. Instead, it grabbed and then destroyed our attention spans and left so many of us with smartphone addiction; social media grabbed and destroyed our ability to share an informational environment. And now AI threatens to grab and atrophy our mental muscles entirely.I think we’re just at the beginning stages of a quite significant backlash to that. Teenagers are purposely turning back to“dumb” flip phones; millennials pay money fordigital detox retreats; thosestupid QR-code menusare swiftly disappearing; dating apps are ceding way tosingles meet-upsanddinner with strangers. In a world that has sped up, there are surprising examples of how people are willing to actually take their time: three-and-a-half-hour long podcasts get millions of listens, and Lebanese-Canadian playwright Wajdi Mouawad’s six-hourRacine carrée du verbe êtrewas the best live anything I’ve seen in the past decade.Nearly 10 years ago, I went to the German artistTino Sehgal’s Carte blancheat the Palais de Tokyo contemporary arts centre in Paris. A few minutes into the exhibit – traipsing through empty, white-walled rooms, guided first by an incessantly question-posing child, then teenager, then adult – it dawned on me that thiswasthe exhibit: the conversation we were having along the way. Art, like life, takes time to make and experience. Point.The process of bringing the world to life on screen brought us to life in a way that we normally avoid. There’s an irony here – that playing roles in a faked representation of the world brought us, for a time, back to what is most real. And whether I make it into the final cuts or not, for that alone, the early morning wake-ups and the sometimes interminable waiting were far more than worth it.Alexander Hurst is a GuardianEuropecolumnistExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesOpinionMobile phonesFranceEuropeAppscommentShareReuse this content"

Scores of people are still being killed; enough, in any other scenario, to be deemed both alarming and newsworthy.More than 100 peoplehave died since 19 January, Gaza’s civil defence service spokesperson says. Those killings constitute, alongside other breaches, a grim record ofhundreds of reported ceasefire violationsby the Israeli government.The latest among them is Israeli authorities’ decision tohalt humanitarian aidinto Gaza, in order to put pressure on Hamas to accept new ceasefire terms: mere hours after the first phase of the ceasefire expired, Israelcut off all supplies. In doing so, Israel is using food and civilian relief as a political tool to achieve its objectives, a move that the Qatari foreign ministry, the midwife of hostage releases and ceasefire agreements over the past few months,called “a clear violation”of the terms of the truce and of international humanitarian law.This is a blockade that won’t affect just a few Palestinians: it encompasses every single person living in Gaza. The entire population is held hostage.According to Amjad al-Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGO Network in Gaza, “the whole of Gaza’s population relies fully on aid, of all kinds, as a result of the demolition of the economic and social infrastructure”. The ceasefire as it stands now is no impediment to the death, starvation and besiegement of an entire population whose homes have been destroyed, and whose babies are stillfreezing to deathin the chill of torn tents.In the West Bank, the pattern of slow but grinding assault has been unfolding for months, and escalating for weeks. The overall death toll in the West Bank since 7 October due to intensifying settler violence and Israel Defense Forces attacks stands atalmost 1,000, according to the Palestinian health ministry. The ceasefire has only exacerbated the situation. As Gaza draws less of its resources and active military engagement, Israel has shifted its attention to the occupied territories in the West Bank in a process that has been described as “Gaza-ification”. The war in Gaza, and what was allowed to pass there in terms of civilian killings, mass displacement and targeting of medical facilities, has become a stress-tested model that is now being applied in the West Bank. Safe in the knowledge that western allies will continue to support it and provide weapons and political cover, the Israeli government is repeating its tactics elsewhere.The moment a ceasefire was agreed, Israel launched Operation Iron Wall, a military campaign in the West Bank, as if signalling with its timing that this is now a forever war of permanent vengeance. In the past year alone,more than 224 childrenhave been killed in the West Bank by Israeli forces and settlers, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. To give an idea of how sharp the inflection point is, this number constitutes nearly half the total number of children killed in the West Bank since records began 20 years ago. Among them areAyman al-Hammouni,his shooting caught on camera, adding to the archives of video and audio records of the chilling, panicked last moments and deaths of children across Palestinian territories. Among them also is two-year-oldLayla al-Khatib, shot in her own home. And the unborn child ofSundos Jamal Mohammed Shalabi, eight months pregnant, who died along with the child when she was shot. And on it goes: relentless, unthinkable, unstoppable.5:56How a 12-year-old boy was killed in the West Bank – video analysisThe playbook and justifications are eerily similar to those used in Gaza. Targeting militants becomes the explanation for a whole range of ruinous activities, including but not limited to: destroying infrastructure, driving people out of their homes with no right of return (40,000 so far, in less than two months, according to Unrwa, the UN aid agency),targeting medical facilities and personnel, flattening entire neighbourhoods and that most lethal policy, loosening military rules of engagement to allow soldiers more leeway and mandate to open fire.According to Unrwa, “the use of airstrikes, armoured bulldozers, controlled detonations, and advanced weaponry by the Israeli forces has become commonplace” in the West Bank, and is “a spillover of the war in Gaza”. The result is an assault in the West Bank that is as historic as it was and is in Gaza.The Guardian view on Israel’s aid blockade: pushing Palestinians toward catastrophe | EditorialRead moreAlready, Operation Iron Wall is the longest in the West Bank since the second intifada. Tanks have rolled in and IDF soldiers aresettling in for the long haulin refugee camps in areas such as Jenin and Tulkarm, for the first time in 20 years. These actions mark a material change in how Israel is choosing to engage with Palestinian populations in Gaza and the West Bank. A transition has been made from brutal attrition through settler violence, siege, legal overreach and detention without trial to a more lethal and oppressive mode of authority that seems to have no strategic purpose or long-term plan for stability. The aim seems to be the expansion of settlements, military presence and the kettling in and control of millions of Palestinian people’s lives, dictating everything from whether it is time for them to eat, to whether they have a right to live. The result is a diminishment of what little the Palestinians already have – even less land, even less autonomy and even fewer human rights.In such an asymmetrical power balance, and with such impunity,Israelis not incentivised to act in a way that winds things down. Israel’s blockade of Gaza reveals a cavalier attitude to the importance of maintaining the negotiations. If the ceasefire collapses in Gaza, the conflict will return to resulting in disproportionately high casualties on the Palestinian side. If more people die in the West Bank, that only nourishes the settlements that expand into the territories of those driven away.Such a bloody and suffocating state of ceasefire should not mislead anyone that Israel-Palestine is on a path of return to the status quo before the war, or that there is any promise of a stable future after it. Donald Trump, Arab leaders and the Israeli government can go back and forth as much as they like on what is the best “Gaza plan”. The reality is that the war in Gaza may be over for now; but something else, across allPalestinian territories, has begun.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

To ascend to it, up the 80 steps to bring you level with the pediment of the British Museum opposite, is to enter a different world. The main room contains little but a lumpy and ancient chaise longue and a metal-framed bed. One wall is stacked with freshly stretched empty canvases. Next door a mountain range of old sheets, stiff and stained with paint, obscure what might be a sofa. There is a huge, dusty mirror in which we both appear, spectrally: she a slight figure in a brown floor-length skirt, her slippers paint-encrusted. I ask her if she sleeps in the metal-framed bed. Sometimes, she says, but she shows me her bedroom. It is equally spartan, but for the immense piles of books. “You didn’t get round to building many bookshelves,” I observe weakly, in the face of this almost unimaginably austere existence.Paul – likeEdmund de Waal, a contributor to thevast monographabout her work that is about to be published – is now as much respected for her writing as for her art. In 2019 herSelf-Portraitcame out, a memoir that, among other things, described her relationship with Freud, who seduced her when she was 18 and he in his 50s. In 2022 cameLetters to Gwen John, a one-sided correspondence with one of her favourite artistic forebears. These books were published in her 60s. On her shift to writing, she says, “It is a way of articulating thoughts that otherwise justbrew. That can work evocatively in painting. But with words, you need to have order of a different kind. One sentence does have to follow another. And that’s what I needed to do.”Lucian put a tap in the background of one painting – as if to say: Turn the faucet offGetting things down in prose – “the hurt mixed with love in my relationship with Lucian” – stirred up much that she is now working through in paint, she says, the fruits of which will be seen inan exhibition at the Victoria Miro galleryin London. Paul met Freud when he came into theSlade, where she was a student and he a visiting professor. Reading about his seduction of the teenager in Self-Portrait is painful. It is clear that she was emotionally in thrall to him. The reaction to the book was powerful, too. One especially pungent responsewas from novelist Rachel Cusk, who implied that Paul was still trapped by the older painter, long after his death. Paul did not agree, and has made many paintings in order to prove the point – works that enact her memories and changing feelings about not just Freud, but the circle of men in which he moved.View image in fullscreenAn appraising gaze … Reclining Painter, 2023.Photograph: © Celia Paul Courtesy the artist and Victoria MiroShe shows me a painting in the studio. It’s called Weeping Muse and Running Tap. It is based on Freud’sLarge Interior W11 (After Watteau), which is an enormous early 1980s painting of Paul along with one of Freud’s previous lovers, her child, and one of his children. Paul’s version retains just her own figure, her feet seemingly submerged in water. “I really, really didn’t like sitting,” she says. “I felt trapped, and I didn’t want to chat. I was always crying. And he found that incredibly exasperating. I think men are very perplexed and often exasperated by women crying.”There is a tap in the background of Freud’s original painting – “a sort of signal to me,” she says, to “switch off the faucet”. Her riposte in her new work is to double down on the waterworks – that pool of tears under her feet. “I think men find crying exasperating because it’s quite a strong thing to do, isn’t it? I mean, it’s so ‘not done’. But it’s quite a subversive thing.”Near it is a portrait of her mother. It is back in the studio so she can adjust a detail before it goes on show again. She made it when her mother was about her own age now – 65 – and she was 30. “I can’t be detached enough to see it as a painting,” she says. “It just seems to me to be her.” The older woman, a devout Christian, used the time as her daughter’s sitter for reflection and prayer. Freud, by contrast, liked his sitters to focus on him and chat, and hated it when Paul would disappear into her own world. I observe that her paintings are spiritual and inward-gazing, where his are about surface, skin and flesh. “I think that’s what Lucian found very unsettling about my paintings. It’s where our paths really divided. When he saw me going in that different direction, it was disturbing to him that he couldn’t control me,” she says. “Because his way of painting is actually about control.”View image in fullscreen‘I feel quite haunted’ … Colony of Ghosts, 2023.Photograph: © Celia Paul Courtesy the artist and Victoria MiroChat was always torture to the shy young Paul when Freud took her out to dine with his grand painter friends:Frank Auerbach(whom Paul did adore, naming her and Freud’s son after him);Francis Bacon; andMichael Andrews. “Francis knew how to be incredibly polite, but devastatingly cutting,” she says. “I didn’t say anything throughout those dinners, but one time Lucian said, ‘I wish you would say something,’ and so I resolved next time to actually pipe up. We were talking about a Michael Andrews exhibition and I expressed some opinion. Francis just looked at me with this very condescending air, and turned back to Lucian. Afterwards Lucian said it was because my voice sounded too hysterical.”She says this matter-of-factly, leaving it to me to editorialise on the cruelty and sexism of this exchange. Her own response comes in paint. There is awell-known photographby John Deakin of the men – confident, animated, handsome, boozy – dining at Wheeler’s restaurant. Paul has used it as the basis of a new painting, Colony of Ghosts. In her work they stare forth greyly, no longer animated, as if from another dimension.She has also painted a companion piece of herself, lying on the uncomfortable chaise longue on which I have been perching. It is meant to hang opposite Colony of Ghosts. She is very self-possessed in this painting, and offers an appraising gaze to those men who once intimidated her. There is something of Jacques-Louis David’sPortrait of Madame Récamierabout it. The works, she says, “refer to my experience of being at the table, but being shut out and not welcomed in. But there’s also a feeling that now they’re really not approachable at all, because they’re all dead.” She adds, “Here I am in this studio space which Lucian bought for me, with all these memories very alive. I feel quite haunted by all of them.”View image in fullscreen‘I thought: “I really need to change my life.”’Photograph: © Gautier Deblonde Courtesy the artist and Victoria MiroPaul may have dined silently at the table of the men, but she is only five or so years older than the Young British Artists, who rose to prominence in the 1990s and with whose work her own could not be less in harmony. “I found those years very, very difficult, because people really were saying ‘Painting is dead,’” she says. “That was devastating, because painting was my life. There seemed to be this party going on that I was definitely excluded from.”She had had great early success but by 1991, when she had her first solo exhibition with the Marlborough Gallery, the tide had already turned. There was barely any response. By this time she and Freud had split up. She had the flat, and Marlborough gave her a stipend of £14,000 a year as an advance against sales. Her son was mostly brought up by her mother in the country, while she continued to work during the week in Bloomsbury, painting despite everything. “It was an incredible struggle for a long, long time.”The cultural climate eventually shifted. Painting crept back into the conversation. In 2012, Pallant House Gallery in Chichester showed her work alongside that of her beloved Gwen John. Victoria Miro Gallery took her on. But there was also a shift inside her. “Lucian died in 2011. I hadn’tfeltinhibited by him. But I think I must have been, because it was at that point I thought, ‘I really need to change my life.’”The works that converse directly with Freud’s paintings are only one way she has been grappling with the past. She has also made many self-portraits – herself as she is now, herself as she once was, and even herself as she imagines she was once seen by men. There is a core of newfound strength and self-assurance in these works. But she is also planning to retreat again, into the world of the interior and of the spirit. Once the new exhibition is out of the way, there is a stack of blank canvases in her flat, waiting to be painted.Celia Paul: Colony of Ghosts is at Victoria Miro, London, from 14 March to 17 April.

Whenever I would meet people, I’d tell them, “I’m a waiter but I play music,” and they’d go, “Yeah, so does my cousin.” The prospect of playing somewhere like the [iconic New York venue] Mercury Lounge felt about as likely as playing a stadium.I wrote Ho Hey about these experiences. I had the beginnings of another song that was going to be called Everyone Requires a Plan, but it had no words or melody. Once I started strumming it again, Ho Hey just poured out of me. Looking back, I was writing about two heartbreaks at the same time. A person had recently broken up with me and I was also leaving New York and moving to Denver – breaking up with the city that I thought held all my dreams. I felt steamrollered by both events.The opening lines are me trying to convince myself that striving to become a successful musician was a noble pursuit: I had been “trying to do it right” and “living a lonely life”. The hook is pure defiance: you might have broken up with me but “I belong with you, you belong with me”.It’s an unconventional song in that it doesn’t have a chorus. We made numerous attempts to record it. We even tried recording it in the bathroom to get natural reverb. The song needed a kind of looseness. When producer Kevin Augunas stepped in to finish it, he pointed out that a lot of our favourite records had been recorded without using a click track, or metronome, so suggested we try that. Suddenly it worked. The bit where it goes “one, two, three” is a cue for us to slightly speed up.I came up with the “ho hey” chant after listening to the Felice Brothers cover the old railroad songTake This Hammerand wanting something similar. We were moving away from bar band covers to doing our own songs, so shouting “Ho hey!” from the stage got people’s attention. We were shouting to be heard. Then suddenly everyone started listening.Jeremiah Fraites, songwriter, percussion, backing vocalsA little bar in New York used to pay us $100 and give us cheeseburgers and beers to play. Whenever we’d do a Bob Dylan or Coldplay song, all ears were on us. But when Wes would say, “Here’s an original,” everyone would flee for a cigarette break or to play billiards.View image in fullscreen‘It’s an unconventional song’ … the Lumineers perform at the Grammys in 2013.Photograph: Kevin Winter/WireImageAfter we moved to Denver, we would do 14-hour drives to play in New Mexico or Nebraska. The journeys were killing us and we were losing money on gas, so we needed songs that could really grab people. Because Ho Hey was acoustic, we could unplug our instruments, physically leave the stage and go out into the audience.Initially, Wes created a fragment of it, then we worked on the song in my parents’ attic like crazy. At one point it was heavier, like a White Stripes version with driving guitar. At the same time, I was learning about home recording, so we burned a raw version of Ho Hey and six other songs on to 200 CDs. Our friends would say stuff like: “You should rerecord it. It sounds like shit, but I listen to it 30 times a day.” So we knew it had something.After we got management, we recorded a studio version in some woods north of Seattle, trying to recreate the sound of my boots stomping on a wooden stage, which we had liked at an open mic. There’s no bass on Ho Hey: it’s a cello pizzicato which we made much louder. The song is like Italian cooking – there are so few elements that every ingredient needs to be perfect. When Kevin remixed the entire album, he pared everything back: the version of Ho Hey that became a hit is very similar to the one on that first burned CD.Initially, it charted at No 90. Then a TV show called Hart of Dixie played the whole song at the end of an episode and immediately people were asking: “Who are the Lumineers?” A DJ in Seattle started playing it back-to-back and then it just took off.The Lumineers’ new album, Automatic, is out now.

We were supposed to be working on a book together, and we did; but our time became so much more than that. There were lunches in the house or the restaurant round the corner; walks in the woods; a braai that went on past midnight.Over coffee in the mornings I’d sit with Athol and we’d use an app on his phone to identify the calls of all the birds in the garden. Then he might tell me a story from his life – the awe he felt when he asked Yvonne Bryceland to smash a chair to bits during rehearsals for Antigone and she proceeded to do so for a full 30 minutes; the journey he made by sea at 18 from Cairo to Japan, when an illiterate Somalian sailor used to watch him every night as he wrote a novel by hand, sitting on a deck hatch; and the way that sailor never spoke to him again when he finished the novel, decided it was terrible, and threw it in the sea.Just once, he told me the story of a play he was planning. He spoke elegantly, carefully, slightly formally; I hardly dared breathe for fear he’d stop. He and I had shared certain extreme experiences, albeit more than half a century apart, which had been formative for both of us, and I think as a result we bonded quite strongly; over the course of my time with him we both cried together, taking one another’s hands. And all the time he treated me like I was enough. To receive that from someone whose life had been so vast radically altered my perspective.Athol Fugard caught the impact of apartheid’s full-on attack on humanity | David LanRead moreHis partner in creation and fun was Paula, perhaps the most formidably intelligent person I know. The project we were all working on together was, in part, an examination of Athol’s flaws. They were relentlessly clear-eyed and analytical in all they did. But they were also two extremely romantic people, to the point where they’d decided to start a family together. Athol remained a dreamer, full of plans to the end. His most striking quality, though, was his endless gratitude, which I think was nurtured by his many years as a practising Buddhist. He felt very lucky to have lived an extraordinary life.I think that life contains an urgent lesson for us. His work is a model for how to resist a regime one detests while remaining committed to the country one loves – a pressing question for a great many people today. In his final public appearance, speaking to an online audience convened by the Society of Authors last year, he shared what I thought might be the key tenet of that project: “Anger is a withering emotion. It is better to write out of love.”Barney Norris is a playwright and novelistExplore more on these topicsAthol FugardTheatreSouth AfricaAfricaPolitical theatrecommentShareReuse this content"

Pete Tong and Gilles Peterson remember a pivotal figureAlexis PetridisMon 10 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 17.22 EDTShareNorman Cook can remember the first time he met James Hamilton very clearly. “He wasenormous,” he laughs. “Enormous and very well-spoken, called everyone ‘dear boy’, quite camp. He looked so …unlikely. Not a party animal, not into anything apart from dance music and the vibe and the culture of it all. Not interested in being cool, he was like, ‘it’s OK to be nerdy as long as you really know your music’, but I think he really enjoyed the fact that every club he went to, everyone would know who he was and they were all going to tell him some gossip or give him a record.”Moreover, Cook remembers their meeting because James Hamilton had caused him a whole world of trouble. It was the 80s, a decade before Cook became Fatboy Slim, superstar DJ and multi-platinum producer of countless dancefloor hits: he was still the bass player in indie band the Housemartins, who had quietly put out his first solo single – “a kind of cut-up rap record calledThe Finest Ingredients” – under a pseudonym, DJ Megamix, further masking his identity by trying to make the 12in look like an American import.“And James Hamilton found out who I was, and when he wrote about it in Record Mirror, he put ‘Norman from the Housemartins’. And all hell broke loose: the rest of the band were going ‘What are you doing? You have to stop this! We’ll lose fans if they think that you’re into hip-hop!’ It was that era of ‘hang the DJ’ – you couldn’t be in an indie band and like dance music. So the first thing I said to him was ‘oh, thanks for outing me – how did you know?’”It’s a very James Hamilton story: it makes reference to his imposing physical stature, his fabled public school poshness (he was 6ft 8in, and variously described as resembling “a country squire”, “an eccentric aristocrat”, “a headmaster that had turned up in the middle of a nightclub” and compared to James Robertson Justice, the fearsome star of theDoctor at Largefilms). It notes the sheer improbability that someone like that would be a pivotal figure in the world of dance music, however encyclopedic his knowledge.View image in fullscreenDJ Norman Cook (AKA Fatboy Slim).Photograph: Mick Hutson/RedfernsBut a pivotal and pioneering figure in dance music history is exactly what James Hamilton was: so important that Pete Tong describes him as “the oracle”. At a time when Black music tended to go ignored by the mainstream music press, he wrote a column in Record Mirror that began in the mid-70s, reviewing every new release that might conceivably be of interest to club DJs, in a deeply idiosyncratic, adjective heavy style: tracks could be “jittery” or “jogging” , a “jiggly smacker”, a “solid clomper” or – a personal favourite – “gallopingly exerting”.The first of two collections of Hamilton’s writing,James Hamilton’s Disco Pages 1975-1982, has just been published: it’s edited by Mike Atkinson, a writer and podcaster whose stepmother married Hamilton in 1994. His writing “was like an actual different lexicon, that you’d eventually understand,” says broadcaster and DJGilles Peterson, who describes seeing his name mentioned in print by Hamilton for the first time as “the highlight of my life up to that point”.Hamilton also dished out news, gossip and tips from across Britain, encouraging DJs to send in lists of their biggest records that he compiled into the first ever UK dance chart: in an era when, as Cook puts it, DJs “very rarely played outside their own local catchment area”, it was as if he was trying to singlehandedly forge a country-wide dance scene. “I mean, it’s impossible for kids with the internet to believe, but there were all these little scenes going on in different places, and unless you went to visit a mate for a weekend, you’d never know what was going on in the next town, there was no cross-pollination between different cities – if you lived in Brighton, you would have no idea whatthe Wild Bunchwere playing in Bristol,” says Cook. “James Hamilton was the conduit for everything.”Perhaps most importantly of all, after a visit to New York where he visited the Paradise Garage and heard the legendary DJLarry Levan, Hamilton relentlessly promoted the idea of matching the tempos of different records and seamlessly mixing them together: a hitherto-unknown concept in late 70s Britain, where club DJs tended to get on the microphone and talk between records.View image in fullscreenTop disco in Ilford, Essex, in 1978.Photograph: Paul Fievez/ANL/ShutterstockIt’s hard to imagine in a world where mixing records is what club DJs do as a matter of course, but Hamilton’s idea met with a combination of indifference and outright hostility. Pete Tong believes it was “down to resistance of the unknown, like ‘I don’t really understand how to do this’,” but DJ and producer Greg Wilson – an early adopter of mixing, who ended updemonstrating his turntable skills to a visibly baffled Jools Holland on The Tube in early 1983, and who is publishing the new collection – thinks it had more to do with the possibility that it might frustrate their aspirations to become broadcasters. “DJs didn’t travel all over the country, they weren’t stars in the same way they are now, so their ambition was usually to get on the radio. So the idea of putting the microphone down in order to mix records … they were absolutely dead set against that.”But Hamilton persisted, taking British DJs with him when he returned to the Paradise Garage. Most of them seem to have been distinctly nonplussed, but one,Steven “Froggy” Howletthad what Wilson calls “a Damascene conversion” and apparently imported the UK’s first set of Technics decks on his return. He started peppering his writing with suggestions about other tracks you could mix into the one he was reviewing, and started counting records’ speeds – their beats per minute – with the aid of a stopwatch and adding that information to reviews too: whenever you see a BPM measurement attached to a dance track, that’s basically down to James Hamilton.Hamilton was a fascinating figure. Quite aside from his writing career and the various innovations it spawned, he’d spent the 60s alternately working with the Beatles in America, and DJing at legendary London mod nightclub the Scene under the name Doctor Soul; he then built Britain’s first custom-made mobile DJ console, and took to playing at aristocratic country house balls, where requests tended more to the Blue Danube and Scottish jigs and reels than the latest US imports.View image in fullscreenDiscos column by James Hamilton, 1982.Photograph: Record MirrorAnd yet, 29 years after his death from cancer, Hamilton remains an almost entirely forgotten figure. “No one under the age of 50 knows who he is,” laments Wilson.The new collection offers an endlessly intriguing glimpse into a forgotten world of 70s and 80s nightlife, filled with unexpected details – the sudden surge of interest in 40s swing music among soul fans in the mid-70s, which led to not one, but two versions of Glen Miller’s In the Mood making the Top 40; the fact that the first mixed DJ set in Britain was played not in a hip nightclub, but at a roller-skating event at glamorous-sounding Pickett’s Lock Sports Centre in Edmonton – the writing testament to Hamilton’s surprisingly catholic tastes.He was quick to pick up on the importance of gay clubs in the development of dance music, running charts from their DJs from the mid-70s onwards and was, a little surprisingly, a huge fan of punk, approvingly – and characteristically – referring to the Sex Pistols’ Anarchy in the UK as a “noisy bubblegum chugger”. “In the mod days he saw the Who as a rock band followed by mods who spent most of their time dancing to soul music at the Scene,” says Atkinson. “Then he saw people at the Lacy Lady in Ilford dressing in punk gear” – “festooned with chains, safety pins dancing to soul, funk and disco, and made the connection between the Sex Pistols and the Who.”View image in fullscreenAfrika Bambaataa and GrandMixer DST at Camden Palace, London, in 1983.Photograph: David Corio/RedfernsHe was also impressed by the burgeoning new romantic movement, talking up the Blitz club’s DJRusty Eganand coining a weirdly familiar term for the music he played: electronic dance music or EDM. This, however, proved a step too far for the purists. “There was a record shop and label that really took umbrage at him covering this white, electronic music, and threatened to withdraw their advertising from Record Mirror, so he had to stop,” says Wilson. “The irony is that in the US, Gary Numan and the Human League were being played at Black block parties in the Bronx, and that’s how you ended up with records like Planet Rock by Afrika Bambaataa.”‘Blokes who would normally fight would get off their boxes and dance’: Sanctuary, the club that made Milton Keynes massiveRead moreHis influence finally began to wane with the arrival of acid house in the UK. Hamilton liked the music, but was wary of the accompanying drug culture (invited by Paul Oakenfold to his acid house nightSpectrum, Hamilton famously surveyed the club, then turned to Oakenfold and said “I’ve heard the crunch of amphetamines on the dancefloor before, you know”). And, as Peterson points out, acid house was “sort of creating a new movement that didn’t want to be associated with the past”. “It was our punk rock moment, it was year zero,” agrees Tong. “It was almost like everything that came before was forbidden. Things like the Boy’s Own fanzine were really influential and they were a bit ‘fuck off, soul boys’. It’s how the phrase ‘it’s all gone Pete Tong’ came about – I was accepted, but in print, they took the piss out of me because I was connected to the past.”Moreover, acid house was too big a scene for one writer to oversee (Record Mirror folded in 1991 and specialist dance titles including Mixmag and DJ sprang up, although Hamilton kept reviewing for the latter until his death). And its impact on British culture was so vast it tends to overshadow everything that came before, no matter how impactful and influential it was.“People forgot about the world before the rave scene,” says Wilson. “So these very important characters like James got forgotten. We’re in a weird position today, where people in Britain can tell you all sorts about what was happening in New York clubs in the 70s, they know aboutthe Loftor everything Larry Levan was playing, but they’re at a loss when it comes to the UK. That’s one of the important aspects of doing a book, to bring history into play, so that people understand that there was a scene here, with a different approach, its own character, its own background, and James was a part of that – he pushed things forward.”James Hamilton’s Disco Pages 1975-1982, edited by Mike Atkinson, is out now, published by Super Weird Substance, £30Explore more on these topicsDance musicClubbingDiscoFatboy SlimfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What can they do?Elliot GardnerMon 10 Mar 2025 08.15 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 08.16 EDTShareAnother month, another revolutionary generative AI development that will apparently fundamentally alter how an entire industry operates. This time tech giant Microsoft has created a “gameplay ideation” tool,Muse, which it calls the world’s first Wham, or World and Human Action Model. Microsoft claims that Muse will speed up the lengthy and expensive process of game development by allowing designers to play around with AI-generated gameplay videos to see what works.Muse is trained on gameplay data from UK studio Ninja Theory’s game Bleeding Edge. It has absorbed tens of thousands of hours of people’s real gameplay, both footage and controller inputs. It can now generate accurate-looking mock gameplay clips for that game, which can be edited and adapted with prompts.All well and good, but inan announcement videofor Muse, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer caused confusion when he said that it could be invaluable for the preservation of classic games: AI models, he implied, could “learn” those games and emulate them on modern hardware. It’s not clear how this would be possible. Further muddying the waters, Microsoft’s overall CEO Satya Nadella then implied ina podcast interviewthat Muse was the first step in creating a “catalogue” of AI-generated games.But Muse, as it stands, can’t create a game – it can only create made-upfootageof a game. So just what is this new gaming AI tool? A swish addition to game developers’ tool belts? Or the first step towards an era of AI-generated gaming detritus?The idea is that designers (or indeed players) can try out ideas with Muse without spending hours (or days) in a gameplay engine implementing something that might not feel good or even work. If a designer wants to see what, say, a power-up would look like in-game, they could generate mock video showing what that might look like, with the AI filling in the gaps.“Game engines are complicated, messy things and it takes a lot of time to simulate things – they’re not built for that,” comments Julian Tongelius, associate professor in computer science and engineering at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering. “[Working with] a simulation of the game can be much easier and faster. The opportunities opened up by this kind of study are pretty big, but the limitations are also real.”AI gameplay simulations aren’t totally new – Google’s GameNGen project created a playable version of Doom that ran without a game engine in 2024. But the problem has always been consistency. Google’s Doom simulation worked well at first, but the longer you played, the more the AI would “dream up” game elements that weren’t accurate. This is what Microsoft claims to have solved with Muse, but it comes with a massive caveat.“This particular model is trained on 500,000 game sessions, so likely around 100,000 hours of gameplay. But it only works because you have so much data. If you move far beyond what’s been recorded, simulations generally stop behaving well,” explains Tongelius.Microsoft has stated that it is already using Muse to develop real-time playable AI models trained on its other first-party games. But while Muse is great for live-service games such as Bleeding Edge, with access to thousands of hours of live gameplay, for smaller games and single-player titles, it would be a monumental and probably pointless effort to train a generative AI model in each and every specific game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Game developers won’t be able to use it for rapid production because it doesn’t actually, aside from visualising a particular thing, address any underlying game development issues.”Ultimately, there appears to be a disconnect between Spencer and Nadella’s comments and what Muse actually does at the moment. Unless something significant changes, it doesn’t appear capable of creating playable simulations of classic games, and it certainly doesn’t create entirely “new” AI-generated games. It isn’t even clear how Muse’s generated videos could be translated into actual gameplay.AI-generated video games may yet be on the horizon. Google quietly releasedGenie 2a few months back, which is capable of generating “playable worlds” – but that’s not what Muse does, at least for now. “I will choose to graciously interpret what Satya said as visions of what could be done in the future,” says Tongelius. “It’s entirely possible that we will get to some version of that, but it’s not around the corner. What Microsoft has done in this paper is a foundation stone.”Explore more on these topicsGamesArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The leading Swiss artist Sylvie Fleury came of age with the latter, but when she was invited to select drawings and cutouts from the Matisse estate for an exhibition, she was struck by the enduring immediacy of his vision. “My feeling with modernist artists is that, a lot of the time, they were trying to define what was happening within the history of art,” she says preparing for Drawing on Matisse, her showwhich situating 16 of his works within and alongside her impishly feminist and fashion-focused sculpture. “With Matisse, it was more like: ‘Just do it, be radical.’”Fleury well understands the power of disruption. Her first work was a clutch of designer store bags full of high-end merch, which she dropped in the middle of a group exhibition in 1991. Fashion, that frivolous and feminine pursuit, was a luxury commodity but, she seemed to ask, was the art that surrounded it so different? Her work since has included canvases coated in pink fake fur, glittered rockets and a video of female bikers shooting guns at Chanel handbags. In previous projects laying bare art’s tacitly gendered aesthetics, she has feminised the macho minimalist visions of Carl Andre and Donald Judd, imagining an Andre-esque floor sculpture as a runway for women parading in stilettos, or riffing on Judd’s unadorned wall-mounted boxes by adding what look like blobs of shiny metallic melted flesh.“Usually I pick work that has a hardness, play with that and balance its energy,” she says. Matisse, she concedes, is a rather different prospect. Although he emerged in an era dominated by great white men, it’s easy to imagine the modernist giant and Fleury getting along. For one thing, they share a love of what is typically dismissed as unserious: luxury textiles in clothes and furnishings, drawing out how we infuse them with human desires. Matisse’s impenetrable black-eyed odalisques have a readymade echo in some of the sculptures Fleury is showing alongside his drawings, which use female mannequin limbs as stand-ins for women. Sprayed with seductively glossy car paint and draped with designer clothes, these body parts protrude from floors and walls, literally interrupting the space with a female presence.The drawings Fleury has selected span four decades of creative experimentation, but almost all of them depict women. “Maybe it’s my twisted vision,” she says, “but it struck me that he wasn’t just using models as models, but was inspired by them.” Many are strikingly timeless, casually posed and unselfconscious, captured in a few swift lines. Of course, as she points out, the women in Matisse’s orbit were more likely to be models and/or muses than artists. To bring Matisse into her world, Fleury has designed a series of frames for the drawings, using fronts fashioned from clear Venetian Murano glass created with the glass sculptor Françoise Bolli, bolted to mirrored backs. “You can really see with Matisse’s cutouts how he wanted to get away from frames and this is very poignant. It’s a little bit funny that in the end I’ve made frames,” she says.Although Fleury says she wasn’t interested in deflating the art historical bombast that surrounds the work of a titan such as Matisse, her mirrors will, quite literally, put live women on an equal plane with the drawings. “As a matter of fact,” she says, “you could disregard the Matisse drawing if you wanted to check your lipstick.”Drawing on Matisse, An Exhibition By Sylvie Fleury is at Luxembourg & Co, London,to 2 May.Can you fille it: works by Fleury and MatisseView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Richard Ivey/Luxembourg + CoHenri Matisse, Algues 1947Matisse began creating his cutouts – painted paper scissored and then pinned into arrangements – following illness that made painting itself too difficult.

The poet laureate of social media. I’m not being snarky here; I genuinely love her tweets, and they are one of the only things that bring me joy in a rapidly Nazi-infested platform.

She has published 58 novels – but more importantly, she has written 170k tweets. Her targets are broad and plentiful. There are political takes: dozens of tweets a day aboutHarris v Trump, andIsrael’s war on Gaza. She’ll be outspoken on trans rights one day, and writing aboutJD Vance’s tiny eyes on another– but she also isn’t afraid to venture into worlds of whimsy, such asher cat pondering the trolley problem.The point is that she posts frequently, without the agenda to sell something, and seemingly with unabashed sincerity. In interviews, she’s dismissed the medium as“ephemeral and quickly forgotten”. But her relationship to the platform feels pure. It’s the way Twitter should be used.the unexamined premise of the \"trolley problem\" is that individuals are free of subjective inclinations of all kinds including catnip inebriation when, as we know, not one philosopher who ever lived was/is free of subjective predilections/ unconscious motives. you kill the poor…https://t.co/GZe1kcjzyw— Joyce Carol Oates (@JoyceCarolOates)May 27, 2024Every thought comes directly from her huge creative brain directly to the internet, the online farm-to-table. “All we hear of ISIS is puritanical & punitive; is there nothing celebratory & joyous?”she questioned back in 2015. “Are there instances of women becoming obsessed with historic events?”she mused in 2023.

Hollywood is doubling down on dual rolesRobert Pattinson, Robert De Niro and Michael B Jordan are all pulling double duty in their new films and that’s just the startJonathan WellsMon 10 Mar 2025 03.23 EDTLast modified on Mon 10 Mar 2025 18.50 EDTShareFor years, dual roles have been played largely for laughs. Think of Adam Sandler’s Razzie-sweeping twin turn in Jack and Jill, or Lisa Kudrow as both Phoebe and Ursula Buffay on Friends. Eddie Murphy was always particularly prolific, his most multiplicitous performance as a clutch of Klumps for Nutty Professor II.Mickey 17 review – Robert Pattinson proves expendable in Bong Joon-ho’s eerily cheery cloning dramaRead moreThere are exceptions, of course. But for every Legend or The Prestige there are 10 Austin Powers, Bowfingers and – shudder – Norbits. This year, however, is giving us a more dramatic breed of duplicate. Robert De Niro will pull double Don duty in The Alto Knights,Michael B Jordanwill play twin leads in the supernatural Sinners and a pair of Robert Pattinson clones is currently headlining Bong Joon-ho’s Mickey 17.And there’s more. The Monkey just served up a horror with two bloody scoops of Theo James, Zac Efron recently wrapped A24 thriller Famous, in which he plays both stalker and superstar and, this November, Elle Fanning will play twin sisters in the latest film in the Predator franchise. Recently, at Sundance, Dylan O’Brien played his own twin brother in darkly comic drama Twinless. So, even disregarding the films’ genres, it’s still a notable spike in audiences seeing double. So why now? And how are these seemingly impossible shots realised?“For years, film-makers have used various techniques to show actors multiple times in the same scene,” says Daniel Harrington, a London-based VFX artist and compositor. “In The Parent Trap, split-screen allowed the same actor to occupy both sides of the frame, whereas The Social Network used motion control to portray the Winklevoss twins by repeating precise camera movements.”Before we tackle the technicalities, however, here’s a brief history of dual roles – for the concept is almost as old as cinema itself. In 1898, the trailblazing director Georges Méliès was already double-exposing film to twice capture his likeness within the same frame. His method made the jump to feature-length films in 1917 when the actor William Farnum played opposite himself in an adaptation of Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities.The following year, Mary Pickford took dual roles in Stella Maris using a new split-screen technique that would continue to be used for decades, in films such as Dead Ringers, Adaptation and Jean-Claude Van Damme’s as-good-as-it-sounds Double Impact. The Alto Knights, over a century later, even uses a similar technique to double up De Niro in select scenes.But today, split-screening is just one of many tools in the dual role toy box. The most notable advancement in the field came about in 1989, with the release of Back to the Future Part II and the director Robert Zemeckis’s commissioning of Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) to create the VistaGlide, a robotic, motion-controlled camera dolly system that would allow film-makers to capture multiple split-screen performances while also moving their cameras.This remains the most popular dual role method, says Harrington. Several mattes (the individual shots that make up a final frame) are filmed with the same actor playing their separate parts. This footage is then delivered to rotoscope and paint artists, who tidy up the edges of the raw mattes before tasking compositors with piecing them together into one seamless whole.“Ultimately, the success of the illusion depends on the synergy between on-set preparation and post-production artistry,” says Harrington. “Digital effects may be increasingly sophisticated, but they’re still most effective when built on a strong practical foundation. So, on set, consistent lighting, precise framing and stand-ins are crucial for ensuring seamless compositing later. Without these elements, even the most advanced digital tools would struggle to create a convincing result. It’s teamwork, exemplified not only by film, but by TV series such as Orphan Black.”The small screen has indeed reaped the rewards of these technical advancements – 2025 will also see Netflix debut twin Jamie Dornans in The Undertow and twin Anna Camps in the final season of You. Malachi Kirby will double up for Anansi Boys on Prime Video, andCynthia Erivowill play identical sextuplets when Rian Johnson’s Poker Face returns to Peacock. “And, while no breakthrough is solely responsible [for this increase in dual roles],” says Harrington, “recent developments in AI-driven deepfakes and performance cloning have significantly lowered costs and sped up production times”.This deepfake method of replacing faces (Robert Pattinson’s visage was digitally transplanted on to a stand-in for Mickey 17) was another ILM contrivance, originally developed for 1993’s Jurassic Park. The Oscar-nominated VFX supervisor Theo Jones works at Framestore, the studio which worked on much of Joon-ho’s latest offering. And, while Jones doesn’t believe there’s a single catalyst for the current spate of dual role projects – “it’s likely some sort of happy accident,” he says, “the same way you might get two films about an asteroid hurtling towards Earth landing at the box office at the same time” – he also brings up the rise in deepfake technology.View image in fullscreenCynthia Erivo and Natasha Lyonne in Poker Face.Photograph: PEACOCK“It wasn’t an option 10, maybe even five years ago,” says Jones. “But even this isn’t perfect for a dual role – you still need to find someone with similar features and proportions, and the baseline performance would be coming from the stand-in rather than your actor. Plus, ‘off-the-peg’ deepfake technology certainly isn’t up to Imax quality at the moment, so you’d still need plenty of VFX work to make it look believable.”Framestore, Jones reveals, has developed its own “neural face rendering tech” – called Facade – which he believes will set a new standard in the industry. “But, for purely dramatic moments,” he adds, “something like Lupita Nyong’o’s incredible performance in Us, you’d be far better placed using practical techniques for the shoot, and post-production fixes to make the finished picture seamless. Sometimes, this will involve rewriting the VFX rulebook – other times, it will mean using techniques that existed before computers were ever a part of film-making.”It’s the perfect way to approach the art of the dual role. For, whether it’s actors attracted by the creative challenge or film-makers hoping to advance the technical side of their craft, these twin turns have always been collaborative efforts. By continuing to blend techniques new and old, audiences are not only guaranteed evermore envelope-pushing performances, but the entire concept of the dual role will stay true to its innately patchwork nature.Explore more on these topicsFilmBong Joon-hoRobert PattinsonRobert De NiroCynthia ErivoMichael B JordanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It follows two cousins, one of whom is on a three-day release from prison, as the pair attend a funeral in their childhood town.“I am so grateful to receive this award and join a list of some of my favourite writers whose plays have shaken how I understand the world,” said payne, namechecking past winners Katori Hall, Julia Cho, Lynn Nottage, Sarah Ruhl, Benedict Lombe and Paula Vogel. Those playwrights “have made it possible – through their words transcending space and time and/or their caring and abundant mentorship – for me to write,” payne added.The award comprises $25,000 (£19,000) and a signed print by artist Willem de Kooning.Furlough’s Paradisewas nominated for the prize by the Alliance theatre in Atlanta, Georgia, where the play had its premiere in 2024.The Oscar winner Tarell Alvin McCraney, best known for the play and film versions of Moonlight, said Furlough’s Paradise charts “what it means to try to find a utopia in a world that has a criminal justice system that is far from perfect”. McCraney taught payne at the David Geffen school of drama at Yale Universityin Connecticut and said they are “one of the most powerful writers I’ve encountered in my time as a professor”. Next month, the play will be staged at theGeffen Playhousein Los Angeles, where McCraney is artistic director.The Susan Smith Blackburn prize has also given special commendations to 49 Days by Haruna Lee and An Oxford Man by Else Went. The other finalists this year, chosen from more than 200 submissions, included Chris Bush’s playOtherland, which is running at the Almeida theatre in London. Last year’s winner, the Tudor drama1536by Ava Pickett,opens at the Almeida in May.The judges for the prize were costume designer Linda Cho; actors Indira Varma and Jennifer Ehle; Nancy Medina, artistic director of the Bristol Old Vic; playwright Mark Ravenhill; and George Strus, who founded the new work development and community building hubBreaking the Binary theatrein New York.Explore more on these topicsTheatreAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Madonna and Child ended up in the possession of Barbara de Dozsa, who now believes that it belongs to her, partly because her deceased former husband, Baron de Dozsa, bought it in good faith in 1973. Until their divorce, they kept it at their 16th-century Norfolk home,East Barsham Manorin Fakenham, which Henry VIII is said to have described as his “small country palace”.In 2017, De Dosza tried to sell the painting through a regional auction house, but it was spotted by someone linked to the Belluno museum, who confirmed that it is on the “most wanted” lists of police forces, including Interpol and the Italian Carabinieri.Due to delays caused by the Covid lockdown, the Italian authorities were unable to supply relevant documents requested by the British police, and so the painting was simply handed back to De Dozsa in 2020.Christopher Marinello, a specialist art lawyer, has tried repeatedly to persuade her to return it to its rightful owner. “It’s the right thing to do,” he said.But she has cited the Limitation Act 1980, which states that someone who buys stolen goods can be recognised as the legal owner if the purchase was “unconnected to the theft” after more than six years.Marinello said: “Her first argument was that when the British police gave her the painting back, they gave her good title. So I wrote to the police, and they sent her a formal letter saying ‘by no means do we convey title to the painting’.”Asked why the police did not just hand it back to Italy if it was stolen, he said: “It’s a good question. It just shows the failure of law enforcement to help the Italians out. The UK police said that this woman didn’t commit a crime, so we’re not going to treat it as a criminal matter. It’s a civil case.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hisprevious recoveriesinclude a Matisse painting that was stolen in 1987 from Stockholm’s Museum of Modern Art and whose whereabouts had been shrouded in mystery for 25 years until it surfaced in London.He believes there is a moral argument for De Dozsa to return the painting – particularly as he has understood from her that she does not even like it enough to hang it on her walls. He is not working for a fee and is driven only by a belief that it belongs to the people of Belluno, from where his own family originated.De Dozsa had argued that, as well as the cost of storage and insurance, she had to pay £6,000 in legal fees to resolve this problem.Marinello claimed he understood from her that if he could reimburse those fees she would return the painting.After securing permission from the Italian police, he found an insurance company that would donate the £6,000 – only for her to allegedly change her mind.He said: “Her husband could not have paid more than a couple of hundred back in 1973. It’s only worth maybe £60,000 to £80,000 now. She refuses to cooperate unless she gets paid the full value, but she can never sell the painting. No legitimate auction house will ever touch it … the Carabinieri have it on their database and will never take it off. As soon as that painting goes to Italy, it’s going to be seized.”Norfolk constabulary said: “Norfolk police have been advised by the UKCA [UK Central Authority] to release the painting to Mrs De Dozsa given several years have passed and there has been no response from Italian authorities in relation to the investigation. We have returned the painting but would not, as the police, return this in a judicial capacity in terms of awarding legal title to the painting.”De Dozsa declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsNorfolkArt theftArtItalyEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

She faced widespread criticism for her tweets, and despite repeated apologies, was cold-shouldered by the cast and crew of Emilia Pérez, while studio Netflix dropped her from campaigns and cut off funds allowing her to travel to ceremonies. A contract with her Spanish publisherwas cancelled, and senior politicians in her home country spoke of their disappointment in her.“Absurd and even delirious accusations were thrown at me, which deeply hurt my spirit. Things escalated to a point, and so quickly, that I couldn’t even breathe.“Amid this unexpected, devastating storm, there have been moments when the pain has been so overwhelming that I contemplated the unthinkable,” Gascón continues.“I harboured darker thoughts than those I considered in some of my previous, no less intimate and personal struggles. And I asked myself: if I, with all my strength and preparedness to deal with rage and rejection, am on the edge, what would have become of someone with fewer emotional resources to resist this onslaught? Somehow, I made it. Others would not have survived this brutal winter I am about to wrap up.”A fortnight before the Oscars ceremony, Netflix and the director ofEmilia Pérez, Jacques Audiard, appeared to rethink their previous strategy. The studio offered to fund Gascón’s expenses to attend the César awards in Paris while Audiard – who had previously said that he hadn’t spoken to his star and “didn’t want to” – shouted out affectionately to the absent Gascón in a Bafta acceptance speech.‘They chucked her under the bus – then reversed it back over her’: has the Emilia Pérez backlash gone too far?Read moreSome have speculated that this U-turn may have been prompted by concerns over Gascón’s mental health. A number of senior publicists who spoke to the Guardian expressed anxiety over whether the studio and Gascón’s publicists had performed due diligence over their client’s social media history, as well as fulfilling a duty of care towards a newcomer to international fame.Emilia Pérez went into theOscarswith a record-breaking 13 nominations but ended up with just two awards: supporting actress for Zoe Saldaña and best song, for El Mal.At the ceremony, host Conan O’Brien made reference to the controversy in a joke saying that: “Anora uses the F-word 479 times. That’s more than the record set by Karla Sofía Gascón’s publicist.” He also asked the actor to refer to him as Jimmy Kimmel.After the ceremony, Gascón told the Hollywood Reporter that she “loved the ceremony, honestly, I found it very enjoyable”.“I would have liked to experience it more normally, from the happiness of being nominated, of celebrating, as I am now, full of love, a person who puts her soul and her being into her work and who gives herself to others,” she added. “I am very grateful to return and for how my colleagues and the professionals of the Hollywood industry received me. I am grateful to the academy, to Netflix and to the production.”In her lengthy statement, Gascón said she had learned a lot from the experience, including that “hatred, like fire, cannot be put down with more hatred”.“Offences cannot be erased with more offences, and mistakes cannot clean up other mistakes, especially when lies and falseness proliferate all around and when all they send back to me is pure rage, blatant bullying, vexation, scorn and even death threats.”She concludes by saying that she will continue to fight the corner for oppressed minorities, as “a trans woman trapped in the worst possible place: the body of a criminal immersed in an extreme patriarchy”.“You will always find me on the opposite side of fanaticism, imposition, patriarchy, fascism, dictatorships, terror, abuse and irrationality,” she says. “I do not bind myself to any political flag; I only try to be a human being in constant evolution, with successes and failures, but with an unbreakable will to learn, listen, admit mistakes, apologise and forgive others as I forgive myself for the unnecessary pain I have caused.”Gascón’s full statementSometimes, we put on a shield to protect ourselves, so that harm does not reach our hearts, our skin, or our souls. I have my own armour too, like anyone else. It’s not pretty, but it has saved my life a couple of times. The problem is, precisely, that shields can be cold and hard on the outside and can also hurt those around you. That is what happened to me, to those who love me, and to those who believed in me.Lately, as I have been the target of harmful words, I have also said hurtful things throughout my life that have caused others to feel offended– things done and said from fear, from my own ignorance, from my own pain, from the outside of that cold, upsetting shield.With no excuse, and without any intention to justify any of my past actions, I apologise to all I have offended at any point in my life and throughout my journey. I humbly ask for their forgiveness and, to honour their kindness and understanding, I promise I will commit to continuing to learn and listen, so as not to make the same mistakes in the future.For the last few years of my life, I went out into the world and gave my best to bring visibility to a historically overlooked group– a group that is part of my identity and my own reality. I have been defending and reflecting the life of a trans woman trapped in the worst possible place: the body of a criminal immersed in an extreme patriarchy. While doing so, my purpose was always to do it with as much dignity as possible, showing a story of struggle and resistance that deserved to be told. I poured my soul, my life, and my essence into this project, working side by side with great Mexican friends who helped me convey a message of hope: we can all be better people, no matter our starting point or our beginnings in this quest called life.Mexico holds an indelible place in my heart. In this magnetic and amazing country, I was allowed to establish my career as an actor, and I have received friendship, affection, and human warmth I will never forget. Since the day my dearJulián Pastor, a legendary film director, opened his doors to me, my love for this land and its people became eternal.My commitment to stand for Mexico, all Mexicans, and for the rights of the most disadvantaged remains strong. You will always find me on the opposite side of fanaticism, imposition, patriarchy, fascism, dictatorships, terror, abuse, and irrationality. I do not bind myself to any political flag; I only try to be a human being in constant evolution, with successes and failures, but with an unbreakable will to learn, listen, admit mistakes, apologise, and forgive others as I forgive myself for the unnecessary pain I have caused.Because of my daughter, and for future generations, I want to open an honest discussion and reflection on mental health. Throughout different stages of my life, I have gone through dark moments– episodes in which despair led me to unexpected places. In this last episode, the most talked about and most exposed of my life, several fake accounts were created in my name to add to the pain and confusion. Absurd and even delirious accusations were thrown at me, which deeply hurt my spirit. Things escalated to a point, and so quickly, that I couldn’t even breathe.Amid this unexpected, devastating storm, there have been moments when the pain has been so overwhelming that I contemplated the unthinkable. I harboured darker thoughts than those I considered in some of my previous, no less intimate and personal struggles. And I asked myself: if I, with all my strength and preparedness to deal with rage and rejection, am on the edge, what would have become of someone with fewer emotional resources to resist this onslaught? Somehow, I made it. Others would not have survived this brutal winter I am about to wrap up.Now that the storm is calming down a bit, and the worst has passed (or so I hope), I start seeing clearly what I have learned. I’ve learned that hatred, like fire, cannot be put down with more hatred. Offences cannot be erased with more offences, and mistakes cannot clean up other mistakes, especially when lies and falseness proliferate all around and when all they send back to me is pure rage, blatant bullying, vexation, scorn, and even death threats.Fortunately, I have kept my one inch of sanity to see the light at the end of this tunnel of hate and understand that I must be and do better, and correct my past faults, without engaging in more darkness. Otherwise, if I play their game, and reciprocate and amplify all that hate others project on me, I will get lost; I will never move forward, and I won’t be able to keep helping others still stuck in the storm.The responsibility to care for ourselves as a society lies with each one of us. As Martin Luther King Jr said,“Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.”Therefore, if there is something that must guide us in these difficult days, it is empathy with those, like me, who have walked on the edge most of our lives, who believed we were a mistake, and then, we made mistakes. As Albert Camus stated, “there is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide,” because it confronts us with the very meaning of existence. I am not quoting these words to insinuate anything or point at myself, but for those others who would not have been able to endure what I just have endured.Only through understanding, compassion, forgivenessand empathy can we build a world where difference is not synonymous with condemnation, but with richness. A world where we can learn and grow as we go. A world where we can all put our shields aside and be ourselves.Thank you from the bottom of my heart.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

She’s been working consistently with female directors –19 in the last eight years– while also attempting to rescue the tight domestic thrillers of yore and consistently probing the gap between women’s placid public facades and private turmoil. The quality of Kidman’s performances – and she is almost always delivering something a little weird, a little off and very magnetic – does not indicate the quality of the project, which can range from theprovocative (if underwhelming)Babygirlto her personalbeach-read cinematic universeof mediocre TV roles.Holland, Kidman’s latest film as a star and producer (under her Blossom Films banner), finds Kidman in a familiar groove: a suburban housewife with secrets and suspicions, beset by paranoia and straining to keep up appearances. Like many a Kidman character before her, Nancy Vandergroot projects perfection – china-doll smile, coiffed hair, nuclear family dinners – and nurses big feelings about the small stakes of her fishbowl environ. The trailer, released ahead of theSXSW film festivalby distributorAmazon Prime Video, promises a Kidman performance in the lane of The Stepford Wives – eerie, brittle and unnerving, with the added weirdness of the Dutch iconography of Holland, Michigan, an idyllic lakeside town locally famous for its annual tulip festival. In practice, it squanders the talents of its star, especially for this particular brand of unsettling, on a bizarrely paced script that adds up to nothing.Death of a Unicorn review – goofy eat-the-rich satire isn’t fun enoughRead moreA thriller more in intention than execution, Holland certainly looks stylish, owing to sharp direction by Mimi Cave, whose 2022 debut featureFreshdeftly weaved the travails of modern dating into sly and gnarly horror. Working this time with a script from Andrew Sodroski – one that bounced around Hollywood for nearly a decade, seemingly for good reason – Cave, a longtime director of music videos, once again demonstrates a keen eye for the portent in the mundane, but struggles to wring suspense out of a story that flounders about for a full 80 minutes before quickly accelerating and then stalling out.Those first 80 minutes center Nancy’s suspicion that her husband, Fred (Matthew Macfadyen), an optometrist who is either at work or chipping away at an elaborate model train set with their son, Harry (Jude Hill), is having an affair, based on seemingly nothing but vibes and possible manic paranoia. In the effort to prove her husband is unfaithful, Nancy, a home economics teacher at the local high school, becomes entangled with her colleague Dave (an underused Gael García Bernal), a Mexican immigrant who experiences racism when it is necessary to the plot. The deeper Nancy and Dave go into their amateur investigation – and, as more than half of a movie that feels longer than its 108 minutes, it’s a remarkably shallow deep – the more Nancy’s manicured world crumbles around her, most provocatively in a handful of nightmare sequences where Cave flexes her capabilities for the surreal.Though the script was initially set in the present, Cave decided to set the film in the year 2000, if for no other reason than some gentle nostalgia pull and the convenient location of Nancy’s sleuthing somewhere between the analog (breaking into his office, old receipts) and the nascent digital (texting on Nokia phones, Ask Jeeves). Sodroski chose to set the story in Holland, seemingly because people smiling in wooden clogs and pointy hats makes for a particularly creepy facade of normalcy. Cave, who grew up outside Chicago, makes better work of standard midwestern kitsch – Little Caesars pizza and ceramic figurines in glass containers, floral wallpapers and ketchup designs on meatloaf – than the town traditions, filmed as if straining for unease.Still, there’s a discernible gap between the quality of the visuals, the chilling atmosphere of destabilizing suspicion that Cave conjures, and the actual material, which is as flimsy as one of Nancy’s Dutch hats. Kidman is predictably effective in “honest to gosh” housewife mode, diving into Nancy’s fixations with typical full commitment. But both women are underserved by this story that goes fully off the rails in the second half. No spoilers, but suffice to say some twists and heel-turns feel unearned to the point of audience annoyance, all blanketed with a vague question of what’s real and what’s not that’s more of a cop-out than a complication.Which is a shame – Holland has all the parts of a classic domestic thriller, the type that made Kidman’s career and which movie fans still miss. In the final sum of the Kidman oeuvre, I suspect this will be but a footnote. If nothing else, though, it’s more evidence of a larger, worthwhile project.Holland is screening at the SXSW film festival and will be available on Amazon Prime on 27 MarchExplore more on these topicsSXSW FilmFirst look reviewNicole KidmanMatthew MacfadyenGael Garcia BernalThrillersAmazon Prime VideoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Wash your face, she demands. Don’t swear, she says with a tut. When Agatha hurts herself, Bernadette applies the plaster.It’s an innocuous scenario except Agatha – newly promoted at work, boyfriend in tow – is old enough to have her own children (she’s about to start trying) and has only returned home because her dad is in hospital. She falls back into familiar routines with her mum but from the start Ruth D’Silva’s play explores complicated acts of parental control as well as kindness, the tables frequently turning. Bernadette’s cruelty comes in flashes, her withering tone towards Agatha at odds with how she talks to her framed Jesus. After the interval, the daughter is warning her mother that she’ll be putting her down for a nap.View image in fullscreenHome discomforts … Lydia Bakelmun in Bungalow.Photograph: Harry ElletsonThe walls of this bungalow don’t quite talk – José Guillermo Puello’s sound design has them groaning instead – but there is a palpable sense of what the building has witnessed, as D’Silva unfurls a tale of inherited trauma and cycles of abuse. Caitlin Mawhinney’s jagged set design suggests a sickness that has seeped into the bricks; Cheng Keng’s lighting makes even the lumpy wallpaper menacing. Shadows spread like damp.The air quickly becomes fetid with resentment in Beth Kapila’s production. “It’s this place, you know what it does to me,” apologises Agatha’s brother Luke after an outburst. But the play’s attempt to make the building a character in its own right, and the production’s increasingly schlocky horror effects, can distract from the messy relationships.Amid the tension, D’Silva proves a humorous writer, even if the comic timing in the performances is sometimes off. Despair and desire curdle together in a scene where Agatha and her partner Steven get the ick about having sex in her parents’ bed. That night ends with a disturbing melding of memory and fantasy – just one more can of worms Agatha has opened up, observes Steven.It is the mother-daughter relationship that is most compelling, with Fisun Burgess and Lydia Bakelmun respectively giving nuanced performances, not least in the tender scenes where Agatha savours Bernadette’s singing. Mikhael DeVille as Luke and Jack Bence as Steven have less to play with, as their various relationships are sketched without enough detail, yet each establishes a sense of unease. Agatha’s absent father makes his presence felt through other characters’ impersonations and in the use of a portrait with a Francis Bacon-style swiped blur across the face.The stagecraft can become overwrought – a simple struck match, by contrast, is done powerfully – and the script could afford to leave more unsaid. The lasting impression is of characters on different frequencies, yet sharing a need to be loved, including by themselves, and a need for release. The father’s love of TV sleuth Columbo, and the very character name of Agatha, leave you wondering what the effect would have been if D’Silva had withheld some clues from this mystery and kept her audience in the dark for longer about the house’s past horrors. But this is a playwright refreshingly willing to plumb the depths – or rather, like her heroine, crack open a can of worms.AtTheatre503, London, until 15 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

You’ve probably heard it all before: a clique of supremely annoying twentysomethings convene for party girl Olivia’s (Crystal Lake Evans) birthday, and head to music festival Blue Light. With the posse packed into her boyfriend Michael’s (Jarrett Austin Brown) RV, Sarah (Amber Janea) and Gaby (Ana Zambrana) – Black and Latina respectively – wind up a couple of bigoted rednecks en route. And that’s before the more cautious Carrie (Bella DeLong) and former marine Jason (John Bucy) ask for directions in the proverbial Backwoods Bar Where Everyone Stops and Stares.Delivered in an overcranked performance style reminiscent of Sam Raimi’s Evil Dead, there’s something moreish at first about this trope box-ticking. Despite the parodic tang, it never goes full Scream self-referential – though it’s clear what’s coming when the RV breaks down on a country road where there is no cellphone coverage. Under siege from bestial, possibly supernatural forces, latent divisions in the group open up. But apart from straight arrow Jason, Fickman – who also scripted – doesn’t layer in enough contrasting personalities in this mobile bitchfest. Nominal audience-sympathy-anchor Carrie, especially, is badly underdrawn.These limitations finally snowball with budgetary ones. Fickman works hard to wring fear out of copycat voices in the darkness, haunting disappearances into fog banks, and hallucinations of pals banging on the RV door. But none of these lo-fi scares are meaningfully supported by anything in the way of a coherent story. By the time overlooked occultist tomes are tumbling out of a locker, it’s clear Fickman is getting desperate for our attention.There are a few lines suggesting that he can cloak the massacre more convincingly in strong characterisation: “Now let all that bad-friend woke guilt bullshit wash over you,” says resident stoner Chris (Daryl Tofa-Soriano), when his so-called friends learn he’s actually an MIT engineering student. But otherwise Fickman ends up buried by the cliches he’s invited over the threshold.Don’t Turn Out the Lights is available on digital platforms on 17 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

I have a hunch that her book’s bracingly truthful tone will indeed make new (and new-ish) mothers feel very seen, just as some of the quotes on its jacket promise: no subject is for her off limits, from leaking breasts to dubious stains. But the more important thing by far is that it’s very funny and even sardonic. At her best, Barnicoat reminds me ofClaire Bretécher(1940-2020), the great French cartoonist and one of the geniuses of the form.This is a very analogue book and all the better and more uplifting for it. Mothers, log off!When I was growing up, my mother hung one of Brétécher’s strips on the kitchen wall. In it, a woman with a baby is visited by a friend who drones on obliviously about her marvellous life. In the last frame, the friend has gone, and the woman, who now looks vaguely despairing, is holding her baby over the bin. (Honestly, I’m notverytraumatised.) InCry Whenthe Baby Cries, Barnicoat is often on similar territory, her attention as much on the isolation that comes with having a baby as on the practicalities (though she’s good on the buggies and bottles, too). She’s lucky: she’s in love with her tiny son, who arrives thanks to IVF. But she’s lonely as well, and scratchy with exhaustion. My favourite page in the book is the one in which she turns the newborn days into modern art. It’s perfect!Why is he crying?is after Edvard Munch.Why am I crying?is after Picasso.Night Feedsis after Francis Bacon. Need … to … Sleep … is after Bridget Riley.View image in fullscreenA page from Cry When the Baby Cries by Becky BarnicoatBarnicoat mixes it up, avoiding relentlessness (a constant danger, I fear, with baby books) by varying the pace with all kinds of pastiches and games, checklists and charts. She sends herself up wildly, and without vanity, her hairy legs and newfound animal instincts bringing to mind Quentin Blake’sillustrationsfor one of Roald Dahl’s darker books. However, if you’re older than her, as I am, the most interesting – and worrying – things she has to say all connect to social media. If WhatsApps groups can be a blessing for new mothers, they’re also a curse; motherhood as it’s depicted on Instagram is just another standard of female perfection that can never be achieved by any regular mortal.When she draws herself staggering from the house with her baby kit like a dromedary about to cross the Sahara, I thought back to the birth of one of my younger sisters: however fed up or tired my mother was, at least she wasn’t under constant pressure to compare herself to beautiful strangers; to buy endless stuff that she couldn’t really afford, and didn’t really need. All of which makes Barnicoat’s decision to draw in black and white beautifully apposite for me. This is a very analogue book, somehow, and all the better and more uplifting for it. Mothers, log off! Here’s the antidote to all that striving; here is the muddle that will set your minds at rest, even if it won’t actually rock your baby to sleep.Cry When the Baby Criesby Becky Barnicoat is published by Jonathan Cape (£25).

It’s a cube, separated from the outside world; a refuge, an escape, or perhaps a trap. It effectively sucks your attention, just as it sucks in David, the protagonist in James Baldwin’s 1956 novel Giovanni’s Room, and what happens in here explodes his life.Literary adaptations in dance are fraught with pitfalls, predominantly how to express the intricacy and specificity of thousands of words through movement only. “There are no mothers-in-law in ballet,” George Balanchine famously said. Here it is aunts: there’s no way you’d know the woman in red is David’s aunt (unless you read the synopsis, which is recommended) but perhaps it doesn’t matter. What dance can do is express Aunt Ellen’s disapproval though her superior gait and dismissive flick of the wrists.There is a lot that is said through bodies alone in this new retelling by PhoenixDanceTheatre and the company’s artistic director Marcus Jarrell Willis. The way in the opening scene, David (Aaron Chaplin) moves as if his body’s not entirely under his control, almost tripping himself up, a shorthand for the physical urges that will drive him off course when he meets handsome bartender Giovanni (Tony Polo). There’s the dance between the two men, skirting each other, with nerves and reticence and then the dawning certainty of a connection; with hunger and tenderness. There’s an urgency pushing at the movement throughout, the pulse of a city’s nightlife, the club scenes cleverly threaded with slivers of styles that look at times like the 1920s, at others the 2020s – Willis brings a currency and vernacular groove to his choreography.View image in fullscreenLife outside the room encroaches … Inside Giovanni’s Room.Photograph: Drew ForsythThere’s some nice craft: the opening of Act II – snapshots of David and Giovanni’s relationship between blackouts, the tension stretched, especially when life outside Giovanni’s room encroaches – is very effective. But it feels as if there are depths and details of Baldwin’s text unilluminated, sometimes plot, sometimes the different textures of fear and anxiety, hatred and self-hatred. And there’s a claustrophobia in Marc Strobel’s layered score that becomes grating, the volume ramped up to create “atmosphere”, as if they don’t trust that the dance could speak for itself.AtDundee Rep,12 March;Northern Stage, Newcastle, 19-20 March;Birmingham REP, 28 May;Liverpool Playhouse, 5 June; andSadler’s Wells East, London, 11-14 JuneExplore more on these topicsDanceLeeds PlayhouseJames BaldwinreviewsShareReuse this content"

But Brown wisely leaves us to draw our own parallels, bucking a trend for overly didactic historical drama that lurches into the modern day. Instead, the story remains rooted in the local landscape and the writing wears its research lightly as Brown bears witness to how fractured societies seek scapegoats and subordinates, especially under the influence of a small man longing for supremacy.Such is its portrayal of Matthew Hopkins (Emily Hindle, from an all-female cast of six), who made a small fortune as the self-styled Witchfinder General – “like he’s a soldier, except he’s not,” observes gimlet-eyed Anne Alderman (Claire Storey). Anne tends to the townspeople like she does her garden, and Brown supplies a virtual index of medicinal herbs – a reminder of the lost knowledge of such female healers targeted as witches.Women rely on Anne for abortions as well as midwifery: promptly after her entrance, she dives headfirst under the covers to inspect Mary (Shaniya Hira), about to deliver her baby, and urges the young woman to keep a poppet close for comfort. That’s precisely the kind of paraphernalia hunted out by Hopkins and his accomplice John Stearne (Hira, doubling roles like most of the cast) who close in on the community’s women while, Brown stresses, so many of the men are away fighting.Lean scenes exposing the political, religious and class schisms of the civil war are interlinked by songs from Brown’s bandTrills, composed by Seraphina D’Arby and sung by the cast. Refrains lap like waves (“I will rock you, I will raise you”), combining elements of folk and protest music, lullabies and hymns. These are compositions that provide not just mood but also momentum as the tale begins to grip.View image in fullscreenEmily Hindle as Rose in A Tryal of Witches. She also plays Matthew Hopkins in the production.Photograph: Tom SoperOwen Calvert-Lyons’ production opens with the women singing in the aisles, and the notion of a wider community is further enhanced by the canny use of sphere-headed clothing stands resembling iron figures, looming on either side of the stage, where we watch the cast switch between costumes. Under Sally Ferguson’s honeyed lighting, the rest of Jessica Curtis’s set has an austere elegance, its timber frame evoking tavern, households and courtroom, and finally put to devastatingly stark use.Brown’s dialogue for women living in the deadly shadow of misogyny has a similar resonance to Charley Miles’s superb Yorkshire dramaThere Are No Beginnings, about the terror wrought by Peter Sutcliffe, in which the killer is refused a role. It’s arguable that this play’s impact would also be heightened by omitting or reducing the part of Hopkins, given fluttering fingers and an airy obsessiveness by Hindle in an eerie performance. This Hopkins is a callous and feeble opportunist – but it means there is little spark to the series of clashes in the second half.The supporting roles, in a roundly well acted production, find Lucy Tuck veering from comedy to menace and Rachel Heaton establishing a febrile atmosphere of fear and suspicion. Brown explores the link between control of the land and of women’s bodies, depicting a world where a holy man’s prayers and not a woman’s tinctures are the approved form of female pain relief.Brown’s compelling theatrical remembrance to the women – and men – who died is also a brilliant bit of programming. This local story was heard around the world (Suffolk’s trials were later referenced at Salem); the play will surely reach audiences further afield too.AtTheatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds, 11-22 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreSuffolkWitchcraftreviewsShareReuse this content"

From this, Antille builds out an ambition to explore a number of outdoor spaces framed by extraordinary imaginations.Several of these are professional artists, well established names such as Charles Ross who builds monumental observatory-like concrete and earthwork structures to engage with the cosmos. A division or two down in renown come collaborative artists Anne Marie Jugnet and Alain Clairet, also known as Jugnet + Clairet, who work in various media that engage with landscapes, from paintings that reproduce regular Ordnance Survey maps but with key bits of information left off, or marble sculptures of clouds. Elsewhere, we’re introduced to the very intriguing legacy of the now deceased Noah S Purifoy, more of a classic outsider artist who worked with found materials and scrap, building himself an outdoor museum in the California desert.Antille somehow manages to connect this all together via a sinuous way with the editing suite, the disparate sections and musings shellacked together with airy quotes from Michel Foucault, archive clips of Marcel Duchamp, and yet more footage of her gran’s prodigious production. Does it all hang together? Not quite, especially when we veer away from all the art production to watch some typically out-there Christian fundamentalists rant and dance with snakes in a deeply sad-looking church. The pine cladding on the walls and fluorescent lights are enough to induce a sense of despair.And then Antille is off again, back to watching her grandmère’s Super 8 films, making noises to match the silent footage of her mother with wire brushes. Later Antille sets up the camera to record herself cavorting naked in the forest, waving a plate about for no obvious reason. The cinematography is beautiful throughout, and the subjects often compelling, but it doesn’t always cohere.The Wonder Way is on True Story from 14 March.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsGardensArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

How is this possible? In a documentary that follows his mission, Sheen explains the secondary debt market and how high-cost credit is ruining so many lives. But this is no millionaire’s vanity project; it exposes the evils of the current credit system in the UK (the banks made £44.3bn profit in 2023, he says). He speaks to the people trapped in debt, as well as an illegal loan shark, while also calling for a fairer system and having a conversation with Gordon Brown about how he can get the government to listen and bring about change.Hollie RichardsonChess Masters: The Endgame8pm, BBC TwoView image in fullscreenSlay queen! … Chess Masters: The Endgame on BBC Two.Photograph: Curve Media/BBCFrom Netflix’s hit drama, The Queen’s Gambit, to the real-life scandal of Magnus Carlsen accusing his opponent of cheating with anal beads, chess has rebranded itself as the most exciting game over recent years.

For two weeks in April, the whole of this mountain plateau blazes purple with flowering crocuses. If the snow has lingered, it’s a striking symbol of the Earth’s annual renewal.This plateau is the closest you can get to Narnia on Earth. For a CS Lewis fan like me, it recalls the sacrifice of Aslan to bring Narnia back from its perpetual winter under the despotic rule of the White Witch. There it was “always winter, but never Christmas”. Here in the Slovenian Alps, the crocuses hail the arrival of a different holiday: Easter.It’s no random reference, either, because parts of the Chronicles of Narnia film serieswere shotin Slovenia, as were some episodes of the fantasy television series The Witcher, based on the books by the Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski.This high-altitude plateau is a vast undulating meadow that has served as a summer pastureland for herders since the bronze age, as there were fewer bears and wolves around to threaten their cattle at such a height.For two weeks in April the whole of this mountain plateau blazes purple with flowering crocusesIn the intervening years, a unique Alpine culture has developed. The herdsmen wear ponchos made from strips of resinous pine that repel water and make them look like Cousin Itt from The Addams Family, and live in low-slung cottages that recall the Hobbit houses of Middle-earth. They make a particular type of dried cow’s-milk cheese calledtrničthat is shaped like a breast; and play a game in which carved sticks are thrown to catch on to the branches of the dwarf pine trees.Velika Planina is an 80-minute drive north from Ljubljana and its summit can be reached by car or cable car. It’s an easy day trip from the capital, but my family and I like to spend a few nights there every spring. We stay in one of the typical pine-clad cottages, which look ancient from the outside – many blackened by the use of cooking oil to preserve the wood – but inside they are fully kitted out, some with saunas (I Feel Alpsrents cottages from €160 a night for two people; andFairytale on Velika Planinahas cottages from €100 a night for two).View image in fullscreenA shepherd in traditional clothing in the Kamnik-Savinja Alps.Photograph: Imago/AlamyThere’s a magic to sleeping surrounded by the Alpine peaks, nestled up against the stars, the absolute silence only broken by the occasional cowbell.Slovenian Easter begins on the Saturday, when families bring their Easter meal to church in baskets covered with a special decorative cloth to be blessed. On Easter Sunday, morning mass is held early, and afterwards the food forms part of an elaborate breakfast, each component of which has a symbolic value linked to the Passion.Potica, a national dessert which is usually prepared like a round bundt cake filled with walnuts, is meant to recall the crown of thorns. Horseradish roots resemble the holy nails. Smoked ham is linked to the body of Christ. Red wine represents blood, as do hardboiled eggs that are dyed umber using red onion skin and are meant to represent Christ’s wounds.As an American expat looking for hybrid dishes, I put all the ingredients between slices ofpoticaand make a toastie, which I have dubbed the Easter Feaster. Slovenians are so welcoming that you’ll find a warm greeting regardless of your background – and even if you insist on making irreligious sandwiches.Noah CharneyFormentera, Spain‘Walk until the dunes narrow to a sliver of sand fringed by the gleaming turquoise sea’View image in fullscreenPlatja de Ses Illetes on Formentera.Photograph: Alexandre Rosa/AlamySpring on the smallest of Spain’s Balearic Islands is the sweet spot: the superyachts and summer day trippers from Ibiza are yet to arrive, the beaches are practically empty and there are blankets of wildflowers.With its petite proportions and flat geography, Formentera lends itself to biking or hiking. There’s a network of more than 60 miles of well-signed “green routes”, mainly using old rural roads, which means most of the island can be explored car-free. At just 12 miles long and little more than a mile wide at its narrowest, Formentera can easily be traversed on a bike in one day, especially if it’s an electric one. You can also walk the coastline beach to beach, or zigzag across the interior which, from the start of March until the end of May, is transformed into a patchwork of bright red, vivid violet and golden yellow as poppies, marigolds and mallow bindweed bloom between orchards of fig trees, lines of vines and farmers’ fields.Spending a few days cycling or walking between beaches, with stops for a quick swim, makes for a lovely breakReached via a green route to the north of the island is the spectacular saltwater lagoon of Estany Pudent, where bird spotting is particularly good in spring, when migratory species, such as osprey, flamingos and Eurasian teal stop by on the journey north after their winter breaks. Beyond Estany Pudent, another green route can be picked up, running farther north through the island’s rolling sand dunes, which are dotted with molinet, a plant that has small pink flowers at this time of year and is rarely seen outside Formentera. Keep going and the dunes narrow to a sliver of sand at Platja de Ses Illetes, and from there it’s possible to walk along the white sands all the way until the island dissolves into the sea.The water gleams turquoise, partly thanks to the cleaning action of thePosidonia oceanicaseagrass that grows here, and in spring it’s just warm enough for a dip. Spending a few days cycling or walking between beaches such as Calo des Mort, a crescent-shaped cove carved into the rocks, or at Es Migjorn, the five-mile stretch of sand that runs along the south of the island, with stops for a quick swim, makes for a lovely break.View image in fullscreenCalo des Mort.Photograph: Lunamarina/Getty ImagesFuelling these adventures will be necessary and in spring there are two food festivals on the island. During the last weekend of April, restaurants compete to make the bestpintxos– small bites of deliciousness often served on sticks – while for the last two weeks in May, restaurants showcase the best of local food with special fixed-price menus. Expect dishes such asfrit de polp(fried octopus),bullit de peix(fish stew with potatoes) andflaó(a fresh cheesecake dessert with mint).For easy exploring, stay in the centre of the island atEs Pas Formentera Agroturismo, a family-run eight-bed hotel in a 200-year-old whitewashed farmhouse on an olive oil estate with an outdoor pool (doubles from €130 B&B). Hourly ferries run from Ibiza to Formentera, taking about 30 minutes.Elizabeth BennettIstanbul‘There are endless options for rambling, enjoying ancient culture and delicious food’View image in fullscreenThe Maiden’s Tower on the Bosphorus, Istanbul.Photograph: Givaga/Getty ImagesStrolling through Istanbul in spring is a joy, just as tulips are coming into bloom and before the energy-sapping summer heat starts to build. There are endless options for urban rambling in this megacity, with days spent in scenic neighbourhoods, absorbing ancient culture and enjoying delicious food, but here are two favourites – one on the European side and one on the Anatolian side. Wear trainers for comfort, dress appropriately for the mosques and start early.Walk the Bosphorus riviera. Begin at the little ferry dock at Ortaköy, by the serene waterside mosque, and walk for an hour or so in the direction of Bebek, 2½ miles (4km) away. By following the water, mainly on paths, you’ll see anglers assembling to cast their lines, small boats, ferries and military ships, joggers on the esplanade and ornate, photogenicyalis(Ottoman-era mansions) with their wooden latticed balconies.On entering the mosque, your eyes are drawn immediately upwards to stained-glass windows as bright as fireworksBebek is a wealthy neighbourhood where luxury yachts are moored, but once it was home to small skiffs and fish farms with huts on stilts. Stop for lunch at the swishDivan Brasserie Bebek, where you can have a glass of local wine or Turkish coffee, or a bowl of richsütlaç(rice pudding) while sitting on a jetty over the water. Afterwards, cross the road forMeşhur Bebek Badem Ezmesi, which has been known for selling the finest marzipan in the city since 1904. It’s best to do this walk on a weekday as weekends in Bebek get crowded.Explore Istanbul’s grand mosques, away from tourist-heavy Sultanahmet. Take an afternoon ferry to Üsküdar (from Beşiktaş, Karaköy or Eminönü) and first visit the Mihrimah Sultan mosque built in the 1560s for the 17-year-old Princess Mihrimah, favourite daughter of Süleyman the Magnificent. Because of its location by the docks, it often goes by the unassuming name ofiskele(jetty) mosque, and its stone exterior gives few hints of the vibrancy inside. But upon entering, your eyes are drawn upwards to stained-glass windows as bright as fireworks and the simple elegance of mosque lamps hanging from a giant circular metal frame.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you’re hungry, nearbyKanaat Lokantasi, a characterful place that opened in 1933, serves excellent rice dishes: order the chicken liver pilav or chestnut tekke pilav – made with pine nuts and currants, and based on an old Sufi recipe. Lastly, walk for 20 minutes up to the Atik Valide mosque (Old Queen Mother mosque), surrounded by plane trees, and marvel at the panel of floral Iznik tiles, the sort you find yourself staring at until your eyes begin to swim. Time your ferry ride back for the sunset.The small, family-runAuthentic Turkish Home Suitein Ortaköy is a lovely place to stay. It’s a wooden home converted into a guesthouse next to a charming tea cafe. It’s an easy walk to the ferry and there is a nearby bus stop. A three-night minimum stay starts from £169.Caroline EdenLefkada, Greece‘Expect paths that are a delightful assault on all senses: a riot of colour and fragrance’View image in fullscreenKathisma beach.Photograph: Malija/Getty ImagesIt’s the colours that hit you on Lefkada, especially in spring, when it is lush from winter rainfall, with glossy green hills and electric blue seas shifting over white sand. Up on the mountains, seas of crimson poppies carpet the plains. As showy as it gets. Technically, Lefkada is an island, but it’s connected by a bridge to the mainland on Greece’s west coast.We head up to the picturesque village of Eglouvi for a hike. All across the island, in recent years, locals have been clearing ancientmonopati– old paths and mule tracks. However, summer is too oppressive for anything other than walking straight into the sea. Spring is when the land really sings. Expect paths that are a delightful assault on all senses, a riot of colour and fragrance, the clanking of goat bells, seaview trails fringed with almond blossoms. Judas trees, dense with purple flowers, elderflowers resplendent in white. Heady sage and rosemary. And wildflowers – tiny violets and pansies,ornithogalum, daisies and chamomile, iris, anemones, the occasional wild orchid and red peony.The tiny whitewashed church at the summit has stunning 360-degree views – the churches in Greece always bag the best spotsThe Eglouvi-Karya loop is a moderately difficult six miles, according to the excellentLefkadatrails.com, which provides free GPS hiking routes (its lively Facebook community organises everything from strolls to the whole 50-mile multi-day Lefkada trail). The full loop takes a few hours and gets steep, so take atiropita(cheese pie) along or cut the walk shorter and make time for lunch. Greek tavernas can be a gamble in spring (many remain closed until Easter), but in Eglouvi you’ll find Lithanofli taverna under the shady plane trees. Here, you’re in lentil country; locals are proud of a special variety, grown and harvested by hand. Before the walk, try their delicious lentil soup (garlic, oregano, good olive oil). And don’t forget water – even in spring it gets hot.After scrambling rocky outcrops and a fine-looking gorge, we found shade in a damp pine forest and then stumbled, agog, through a lunar-like quarry before the final push up to the summit. It was so beautiful that I forgot to moan about my feet. Profitis Ilias, the tiny whitewashed church at the top, has stunning 360-degree views (the churches in Greece always bag the best spots). I’m moderately unfit, it turns out, so I enjoyed the heavenly views while massaging my calves.View image in fullscreenWildflowers in Lefkada.Photograph: CasarsaGuru/Getty ImagesMaybe I should have started with something easier, I decide later, in Sivros, to the south. This pretty village sits on the mountain slopes, overlooking a valley to Vasiliki bay. As well as its rural charm, good (open) tavernas, olive museum and proximity to stunning beaches (a joy off-season), it’s a great base for walking.Start local – Sivros is famed for beautiful clear springs, streams and waterfalls – or arrange transport to hikes elsewhere with Vasilis Deftereos, in whose lovingly restored stone cottage I’m staying (gardens with seaview, starting at €60 a night for a minimum three nights until May,sivroscottages.gr). With other locals, Deftereos revived the idyllic Sivros Springs trail. His is the ideal place to stay, not least because it’s on that trail. What’s more, this path can be completed in a couple of hours. Easy even for children, I’m told. Bliss. The full 50-mile trail across Lefkada can wait.Susan SmillieCopenhagen‘Galleries give you a chance to combine art with beaches and blooming sculpture gardens’View image in fullscreenCherry blossom trees in Bispebjerg Cemetery, Copenhagen.Photograph: Roberto Rizzi/AlamyThere’s a curious day in the Danish calendar calledØkodag“Dancing Cow Day”. On a Sunday of April, farmers let their organic dairy cows out of the winter barns and into the fields. The cows are so happy that they buck and hop, giddy for the fresh air and sunlight.We don’t have many cows in Copenhagen, but we do know that feeling. After the long, dark winter, spring feels like hope. The dominant colour is bright yellow: pharmacy windows fill up with yellow adverts for birch pollen allergy medicines, and daffodils start to nod their heads beside cycle paths. There’s a bright energy in the air: we’re like the cows, dancing our way into the sunlight, finding new things to do beyond our apartments. It’s a great time to visit.Fashion brings the fun at this time of year: the city casts off its black uniform for colour, florals and laceIn mid to late April, the cherry blossom trees atBispebjerg Cemeteryare in full bloom. It’s lovely to walk under them, and it’s worth stopping in atGrundtvig’s church, just across the road, for a glimpse inside one of the city’s most impressive buildings. Or wrap up for a walk, skateboard or rollerblade along the smooth paths atAmager Strand, the city’s beach park and playground, where you can stroll beside the sea and catch a view of Sweden. It’s easy to reach by metro from the centre of the city.Springtime also sees a rebirth of ideas in the city’s art galleries and museums. Modern art galleriesArkenandthe Louisianagive you a chance to combine beaches and blooming sculpture gardens with exhibitions, making them great day trip options.Harbour seals return to the Baltic, fat with the fish they’ve fed on all winter, and plying the waters in their place areGoBoats(solar-powered pleasure craft), paddleboards andtømmerflåder, strange floating platforms powered by outboard motors. The latter are like rafts; some come with sofas, others carry live bands, and all spread a little anarchic and creative chaos on the waters.

Find your favourites at the flea markets that appear on street corners on Sundays, selling anything from secondhand Ganni and Rotate to blue-and-white Royal Copenhagen porcelain. The best isLoppemarked på Bryggen, 150-stalls spread along the harbour in Islands Brygge, which opens in April under a froth of white blossom.Keep an eye out for rhubarb tarts and cakes that start to appear in bakeries in the gap between Mardi Gras, when they’re full of cream buns, and the strawberry cake favoured in summer. Also try the special malty Easter beer – I like the bar and breweryBrus, which has a ridiculously wide selection of craft beers.For a dose of spring optimism and a nod to summer, stay at25 Hours Paper Island(doubles from £157, room only), one of the city’s newest hotels, whose rooms have a Danish summerhouse feel, all shiplap walls and maritime memorabilia. It’s steps from the city’s newest tiny garden,Opera Park, which has winding paths amid the blossoms and bulbs, and a central cafe with views to the harbour.Laura HallExplore more on these topicsEurope holidaysSpring breaksShort breaksWeekend breaksSlovenia holidaysBalearic Islands holidaysSpain holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, for a 10-minute weeknight meal, where the sauce cooks in the time it takes to cook your carb, I suggest that you use tagliatelle instead. When cooked al dente, it has that chewy texture that works beautifully with the garlic, ginger and chilli-spiked miso sauce, and with the slight crunch of the pak choi. It’s a lovely spin on a quick stir-fry.Miso mushroom noodles with pak choi and chilliPrep10 minCook10 minServes2180g dried tagliatelle3tbsp sesame oil2garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated1-inch piece ginger, peeled and finely grated2 red chillies,1 finely chopped, 1 finely sliced250g chestnut mushrooms, sliced2 large pak choi, cut lengthways into eighths40g red or white miso paste1 tbsp rice-wine vinegar2tsp white sesame seeds2tsp black sesame seedsCook the tagliatelle in a pan of boiling water (I wouldn’t salt it, because the dressing is salty enough) for nine minutes, or according to the packet instructions, until al dente.Meanwhile, put two tablespoons of the sesame oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat, then add the garlic, ginger and chopped chilli, and stir-fry for 30 seconds.Add the mushrooms, cook on a high heat for four to five minutes, until just cooked through and starting to brown, then add the wedges of pak choi, lower the heat to medium, cover the pan and leave them to steam on top of the mushrooms for two minutes.Meanwhile, whisk the miso in a bowl with the remaining tablespoon of sesame oil and the rice-wine vinegar. Pour this into the mushroom pan and stir for 30 seconds.By now, the pasta-masquerading-as-noodles should be ready, so drain, then add to the miso mushroom pan with half the white and black sesame seeds, and stir and toss until they are completely coated in the sauce.Serve in bowls topped with the remaining sesame seeds and the sliced red chilli.Explore more on these topicsNoodlesQuick and easyFoodPastaChinese food and drinkVegetablesMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

Thanks to the olive oil and yoghurt, it is a dough that comes together easily and behaves in a way that reminds me of warm putty, coming away from the sides of the bowl, hardly sticking to the hands and almost bringing itself into a neat ball. Unlike so many things at the moment, it is a helpful, thoughtful and stretchy dough that can be rolled or pulled into sort-of circles that can accommodate just about any filling, although mine is inspired by the cheese and greens mixture that filled the Azerbaijaniqu’tabmy colleagues Alice and Deruba made me a few weeks ago.The best way to eat these flatbreads is, I think, two minutes and 23 seconds after they come out of the hot pan, so they have cooled just enough to handle and so that the puff of hot air that accompanies the first bite is funny rather than scalding; but they need to be still warm enough that the pastry is fried and the filling tender with melted cheese. While they want for nothing, these friendly, crowdpleasing flatbreads are great with a spoonful of mango chutney, preserved lemon or green bean pickle, or with seasoned yoghurt and a salad (of grated carrot and shredded green cabbage, maybe). Wrapped in a tea towel after cooking, which also keeps them supple, the flatbreads will retain their heat for a surprisingly long time, but if you want to keep them for longer than an hour or so, or to take them on a long journey or out for a picnic, let them cool completely before wrapping them, ideally in pairs, so they keep their shape when all else is losing theirs.Flatbreads stuffed with spinach and cheeseMakes8For the dough350g plain flour45g olive oil1 heaped tbsp thick yoghurt(20g)10g saltFor the filling1 onion, peeled and finely slicedOlive oil400g baby spinach200g ricotta50g parmesan, gratedSalt and pepper, to tasteA pinch of fresh marjoram leaves, chopped, to tasteGrated lemon zest, to tasteMake the pastry by mixing the flour, oil, yoghurt, salt and 125g water in a bowl, knead into a soft, pliable dough, then shape into a ball. Cover with an upturned bowl while you make the filling.Working in a frying pan, soften the onion in a couple of tablespoons of oil, then add the spinach, which will at first be unruly until it wilts down, so keep stirring. Tilt the pan and pour off any liquid. In a bowl, mix the softened onion and spinach with the cheeses, then stir in salt, pepper, marjoram and lemon zest to taste.Divide the dough into eight pieces and, working with them one at a time (keep the rest under the bowl to prevent them drying out), roll into a 20cm circle. Put a spoonful of the filling on one half of the dough circle, then spread out to cover that half, leaving a 1cm border at the edge. Run a wet finger along this edge, then fold the empty half of the dough up and over the filling to make a half moon. Press all around the edges to seal.Working in a nonstick or cast-iron frying pan rubbed with olive oil, cook the flatbreads over a medium heat for about five minutes in total, turning every minute and occasionally pressing down with a spatula so the sides of the breads make good contact with the hot metal. Lift out once they are lightly golden and leopard-spotted on both sides.Explore more on these topicsSnacksA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkBreadBakingVegetablesCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"
