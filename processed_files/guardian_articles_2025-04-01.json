The UK has not so far threatened to hit back, though Starmer has said he is “keeping all options on the table”.Downing Street sources confirmed the UK had reached broad agreement with US counterparts on a trade deal, focusing on technology, which it hopes will help the UK secure a carve-out from tariffs. Talks between officials will continue.The UK’s trade deal offer is understood to include a proposal to broaden the DST to bring smaller companies within scope, meaning they would contribute to a tax take which is forecast to increase to £1.2bn a year by the end of the decade.As a result the 2% levy on the UK revenues of the big US tech companies could fall. Five have publicly said they pay the tax – Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, eBay and Apple – and some have lobbied the government to pay less, arguing that it discriminates against larger firms and should apply to profits rather than revenues.Tax experts say that Elon Musk’s X is also likely to have paid the tax in recent years but the company has not said so publicly. Tech businesses that generate more than £500m in worldwide revenues and more than £25m from UK users are liable.Government sources suggested that broadening the scope of the tax would mean some tech firms from other countries would now be expected to pay, helping to address the fairness argument made by the White House.Trump has complained about the impact that DSTs around the world are having on US firms. In February he issued an executive order – entitled “Defending American Companies and Innovators From Overseas Extortion and Unfair Fines and Penalties” – threatening tariffs in retaliation.No 10 remains confident it can secure exemptions once a trade deal is signed, but believes that Trump’s focus on a “big bang” of announcements means the UK should initially brace itself for 20% tariffs on all goods entering the US.The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said the UK was in “the best possible position of any country to reach an agreement” on duties getting lifted, while officials cited the US president’s pledge to “be nice” to countries that had balanced trade with the US.But with Trump’s car tariffs due to come into force tomorrow, 3 Aprilthinktank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) warned that 25,000 jobs at UK-based auto-manufacturers are heavily dependent on exporting to the US, and could be under threat.One in eight cars built in the UK is sold to US buyers. The IPPR’s research fellow Pranesh Narayanan said: “Trump’s tariffs have huge potential to completely destabilise the UK car manufacturing industry, affecting tens of thousands of jobs and putting the government’s growth plans at jeopardy.”The UK is also understood to have made concessions on agriculture, with tariffs on imports of US beef, chicken and other meat to the UK to be lowered. The move is likely to further infuriate farmers, who have already attacked the government over its changes to inheritance tax rules for agriculture.However, sources said that animal welfare and hygiene standards were “an absolute red line”, meaning the ban on importing hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken will remain in place.As ministers braced themselves for the impact of Trump’s trade war, however, economists warned that the UK economy is likely to be hit, even if it dodges direct tariffs.John Springford, of the Centre for European Reform, said: “At a minimum, Trump’s trade wars make it even more likely that further spending cuts or tax rises are coming in the autumn budget – we just don’t know how much at this stage.”He added that even if the UK is not hit with tariffs, “the far bigger costs would arise from an escalating global trade war, even if a deal is done or the UK does not retaliate. Higher trade barriers would hurt demand in the EU and the US, with knock-on effects for British exports.”Analysts at Goldman Sachs revised down their forecast for the UK economy this year from 0.9% to 0.8% on Tuesday, warning of the spillovers from wider trade tensions, even if Reynolds succeeds in having direct tariffs lifted.Emily Fry, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Even if the UK’s sensible strategy of avoiding tit-for-tat tariffs pays off, as a small, open economy it won’t be immune to the impacts of supply chain disruptions and global growth headwinds as a result of US tariffs and possible retaliation.”When the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) deliveredits forecasts alongside Rachel Reeves’s spring statementlast week, it warned that a tit-for-tat trade war could upend its projections.The OBR committee member David Miles underscored that prediction on Tuesday, stressing that 20-25% tariffs on the UK, maintained for five years, would eliminate the £10bn of headroom the chancellor left herself against her self-imposed fiscal rules – though he stressed that this would be “in some ways a very extreme assumption”.Government insiders rejected suggestions that any economic deal would be contingent on the UK’s approach to free speech, saying they were “completely unlinked”. Reynolds said the issue had “not been a material factor” in the trade negotiations.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrade policyInternational tradeLabourDonald TrumpForeign policyGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

When he was convicted,most of the victims were still to be identified by police.On Zou’s conviction, the Met appealed for women to contact them and said 23 had come forward in little more than four weeks describing the same method of attack by Zou.One is believed to be a woman Zou has already been convicted of attacking, with 22 of the women believed to be previously unknown to police.Some of the attacks outlined to police in initial accounts were not caught on video and were unknown to the force. This is increasing police fears that Zou, who outwardly appeared to be a charming man and who was from a wealthy Chinese family, could have attacked more than 60 women.Just over half of the women who have come forward in the past month allege attacks in London; Zou was a master’s and then PhD student in engineering at University College London.A Met commander, Kevin Southworth, said police fears about the scale of Zou’s offending are being borne out by the number of women who contacted them in the month since he was found guilty.Detectives fear he may be one of the worst attackers of women in British criminal history.Southworth said: “This particular one seems to be stacking up in exactly the way we were concerned that it would. It tells you something that 23 victims have come forward in a month since we did the appeal. That’s quite a strike rate.”Further charges and a long jail term when Zou is sentenced on 19 June may further encourage other victims to contact the Met, Southworth said.He said police were in the “middle” of establishing the extent of the engineering student’s offending, with months, perhaps years of work to come. He said the case was being transferred to the Met’s complex case work unit: “The potential for a second or even third trial is there. We’re still now working to build a case.”The most recent female complainants are believed, like Zou’s other victims, to be of Chinese heritage and allege attacks in London orChina. They live all over the world, with some in North and South America and Europe.Most of Zou’s victims in the videos played at his trial were unconscious or stupefied because of the drugs he had given them. He ignored their pleas to stop his attacks as they lost consciousness after being drugged, with videos played in court leaving some jurors in tears.In court Zou claimed to be sleeping with five women a month.He came to Britain to study in 2017 at Queen’s University Belfast. He began his studies at UCL two years later, which continued until his arrest in January 2024.He stayed in London in the vicinity of Woburn Place and later had a flat in the Elephant and Castle area.He would invite women for drinks at his home, which he would spike.Reportsby victims or witnesses about Zou can be madeonline. Police can also be contacted viasurvivors@met.police.ukor by phoning 101within the UK and quoting reference 2904/04FEB25.Explore more on these topicsMetropolitan policeViolence against women and girlsUK criminal justiceCrimeEnglandChinaLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Having begun at 7pm on Monday night, was not a filibuster but instead an effort to warn of what he called the “grave and urgent” danger thatDonald Trump’s presidential administration poses to democracy and the American people.“I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able,” Booker said near the start of his speech. “I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our nation is in crisis.”Booker said that he has heard endless stories of “pain and fear” from constituents who are both Democrats and Republicans due to theTrump administration’s policies.“Institutions that are special in America, that are unique in our country, are being recklessly – and I would say unconstitutionally – affected, attacked and even shattered,” Booker said.“In just 71 days, the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans’ safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy and even our aspirations as a people for, from our highest offices, a sense of common decency.“These are not normal times in America and they should not be treated as such. I can’t allow this body to continue without doing something. The threats to America’s democracy are grave and urgent.”Emphasizing the roll Congress should play to hold the executive branch accountable, Booker decried his fellow congressmembers for failing to vote against the president’s cabinet nominees and other policies.“The most powerful man in the world and the richest man in the world have taken a battle axe to the Veterans’ Association, a battle axe to the Department of Education, a battle axe to the only agency solely focused on protecting consumers against big banks and other factors that might abuse them,” he said. “What will we do in this body? What will we do in the House of Representatives? Right now the answer is nothing.”As he approached a full day of speaking, Booker began to stumble slightly in his speech, but was still on his feet, making sweeping gestures as he spoke.Booker evoked the Founding Fathers, Civil Rights leaders and lawmakers who stood up against McCarthyism in his calls for congressmembers to more assertively hold theTrump administrationaccountable.Yielding to a question from Connecticut senator Chris Murphy, while retaining the floor, Booker rested a moment while Murphy recounted the longest speech in Senate history, given in 1957 by Republican senator Strom Thurmond to filibuster the Civil Rights Act.“What you have done here today Senator Booker couldn’t be more different than what occurred on this floor in 1957,” he said. “Strom Thurmond was standing in the way of inevitable progress.” He added: “Today, you are standing in the way not of progress but of retreat.”Booker’s speech is not technically a filibuster as he is not trying to run down the Senate’s time to prevent a piece of legislation from passing.Instead, he has used his speaking slot to decry the Trump administration’s spending cuts, its attempt to abolish the Department of Education, the president’s attempts to bypass the judicial system and the removal of people from the US who speak out against the administration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cruz is no stranger to marathon speeches, having spoken for more than 21 hours in 2013 in an attempt to filibuster an expansion of Medicaid eligibility. At one point, Cruz read from Green Eggs and Ham, the Dr Seuss children’s book.Around his 20th hour of speaking, Booker offered an apology to his fellow Democrats for the current political climate, saying: “I confess that I’ve been inadequate. That the Democrats have been responsible for allowing the rise of this demagogue.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsCory BookerUS SenateTrump administrationDemocratsDonald TrumpUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

One body was recovered on Saturday. Fourteen more were found in a sandy grave at the site on Sunday and were brought back for autopsies in the nearby city of Khan Younis.Dr Ahmed al-Farra, a senior doctor at the Nasser medical complex in Khan Younis, witnessed the arrival of some of the remains.“I was able to see three bodies when they were transferred to the Nasser hospital. They had bullets in their chest and head. They were executed. They had their hands tied,’’ Farra said. “They tied them so they were unable to move and then they killed them.”He provided photographs he said he had taken of one of the dead on arrival at the hospital. The pictures show a hand at the end of a long-sleeved black shirt with a black cord knotted around the wrist.Another witness, an official from an international aid agency who took part in the recovery of remains from Rafah on Sunday, also said they saw evidence of one of the dead having been shot after being detained.“I saw the bodies with my own eyes when we found them in the mass grave,” the witness, who did not want his name used for his own safety, told the Guardian in a telephone interview. “They had signs of multiple shots in the chest. One of them had legs tied. One was shot in the head. They were executed.”1:23Bodies of Palestinian rescue workers recovered from mass grave – videoThe accounts add to allegations made by a senior Palestinian Red Crescent official, the Palestinian Civil Defence and the Gaza health ministry that some of the victims had been shot after they were detained and put in restraints by Israeli troops.The incident came after the Israeli government ended a two-month-old ceasefire and resumed its military campaign against Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza on 17 March, with heavy aerial bombing and ground operations. The people of Rafah were ordered to leave the town on Monday, before Israeli ground operations there.The international criminal court issued arrest warrants for war crimes in November against the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and the ICC prosecutor has said he is still investigating Israeli forces and Hamas for suspected atrocities.The victims are believed to have been killed on 23 March, two of them in the early hours when their ambulance came under Israeli fire while on the way to collect injured people from an earlier airstrike. The remaining 13 of the dead were in a convoy of ambulances and civil defence vehicles dispatched to retrieve the bodies of their two colleagues. One of the dead was a UN employee. A Red Crescent paramedic, named as Assad al-Nassasra, is still missing.The UN said the ambulances and other vehicles were buried in sand by bulldozers alongside the bodies of the dead, in what appears to have been an attempt to cover up the killings. UN video footage taken by the recovery team showed a crushed UN vehicle, ambulances and a fire truck that had been flattened and buried in the sand by the Israeli military.“This is a huge blow to us … These people were shot,” Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN aid coordination office,said on Tuesday. “Normally we are not at a loss for words and we are spokespeople, but sometimes we have difficulty finding them. This is one of those cases.”Israel’s military has said its “initial assessment” of the incident had found that its troops had opened fire on several vehicles “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”, and has claimed, so far without evidence, that Hamas fighters and other militants had been using the ambulances for cover.The Israel Defense Forces have so far not responded to questions, first posed on Monday, about the reports that the bodies and their vehicles had been buried or to the allegations that some had been shot after being detained.mapDr Bashar Murad, the Red Crescent’s director of health programmes in Gaza, said at least one of the recovered bodies of the paramedics had had his hands tied, and that one of the paramedics had been on a call to the ambulance dispatcher when the attack took place.On that call, Murad said, gunshots fired at close range could be heard as well as the voices of Israeli soldiers on the scene speaking in Hebrew, ordering the detention of at least some of the paramedics.“The gunshots were fired from a close distance. They could be heard on the call between signal officer and of the medical crews that survived and phoned the ambulance centre for help. The soldiers’ voices were clearly audible in Hebrew and very close, as well as the sound of the gunfire.”“Gather them at the wall and bring some restraints to tie them,” was one of the lines that Murad said could be heard by the dispatcher. He said the call had not been recorded.Mahmoud Basal, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defence in Gaza, said the bodies had been found with at least about 20 gunshots in each of them and confirmed that “at least one of them had their legs bound”.In a statement released on Monday, Gaza’s health ministry said: “They were executed, some of them handcuffed and had sustained head and chest injuries. They were buried in a deep hole to prevent their identities from being identified.”On Monday the IDF issued evacuation orders covering most of Rafah, indicating it could soon launch another major ground operation, eight days after the paramedics and rescue workers were killed.According to the Red Crescent, an ambulance was dispatched to pick up the casualties from the airstrike in the early hours of 23 March and called for a support ambulance. The first ambulance arrived at hospital safely but contact was lost with the support ambulance at 3.30am. An initial report from the scene said it had been shot at and the two paramedics inside killed.The Palestinian Red Crescent president, Dr Younis al-Khatib, said the IDF had impeded the collection of the bodies for several days. The IDF said it had facilitated the evacuation of bodies as soon as “operational circumstances” allowed.“The bodies were recovered with difficulty as they were buried in the sand, with some showing signs of decomposition,” the Red Crescent said.Their burial had been put off pending autopsies at the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. The autopsies have now been carried out, according to hospital sources, and a full report is due to be delivered to the Gaza health ministry within 10 days.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

They can learn about credit and debit cards, the tactics advertisers use, and how to keep money safe from scammers.Resources for secondary schools are designed to help pupils understand inflation, personal risk, cryptocurrency and investing. There are also lessons on how to understand bank statements and payslips, and how to scrutinise data and claims made by campaigners, advertisers and online influencers.Parents and financial experts have campaigned for years for better financial education for children to prepare them for the everyday challenges of adult life.The recent interim report on the government’s independent curriculum and assessment reviewnoted that parents and children want an increased focus on applied knowledge and skills in the curriculum, including finance and budgeting.John Roberts, Oak’s interim CEO, said: “By giving teachers the tools to provide well-sequenced, engaging financial learning, we can make sure it resonates with children to support them through adulthood.”Pepe Di’Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “There’s a strong case for more financial education on the curriculum in general but we must be mindful of not further overloading an already packed school day.”Sarah Hannafin, head of policy at the National Association of Head Teachers, added: “Online platforms also need to step up to the plate, however, by strengthening age verification procedures, improving monitoring, providing clearer functions for reporting concerns and introducing more transparent codes of conduct setting out the implications of misuse.”Explore more on these topicsSchoolsConsumer affairsEnglandiPhoneOnline shoppingYouTubeApplenewsShareReuse this content"

Led by Dan Corry, a No 10 adviser under Gordon Brown, it sets out 29 recommendations, nine of which are being immediately adopted.The most radical is that major projects should only have to deal with a single “lead regulator”, which would be responsible for ensuring environmental decisions happen at speed. This would not be a new body but one of the existing quangos developers already deal with such as theEnvironment Agency, Natural England and the Forestry Commission.UK housebuilders ‘very bad’ at building houses, says wildlife charity CEORead moreOther recommendations being adopted include a streamlining of environmental permits and guidance, intended to assist “sensible and risk-based” decisions; a single digital portal for such permissions; and a new “infrastructure board” in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), intended to help projects clear barriers.Reed said the intention was to “boost economic growth and unleash an era of building, while also supporting nature to recover”. However, some nature groups expressed concern that the former would overshadow the latter, with ministers visibly pushing against protection that could hold up new housing or big projects.Joan Edwards, the head of policy at the Wildlife Trusts, said: “Slashing red tape won’t work for this government any more than it worked for the last because protecting wildlife and wild places is essential to achieving truly sustainable growth.“We don’t need more short-term sugar-rush economics – we need housebuilding which supports healthy communities and which is built on a foundation of nature’s recovery.”Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the RSBP, said the bird charity would support changes that could help natural recovery and would “thoroughly review” Corry’s proposals.She added: “However, any changes must prioritise nature, ensuring that protected areas are shielded from harmful development that could cause irreversible damage. Reassurances alone are not enough.”Kit Stoner, the chief executive of the BatConservationTrust, said: “The secretary of state talks about a commonsense approach to better regulation; we would urge him to work with us to take an evidence-based approach. Without this, the cutting of corners is likely to accelerate nature and economic decline.”The 64-page review by Corry aims to end what one official called the current “merry-go-round” of regulators, replacing it with a streamlined approach based on outcomes, rather than one that was “too risk-averse and focused on process”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Our approach must also make ample space for innovation, development and growth.”Corry wrote that he would expect environmental groups to be “nervous” about whether the new focus and parallel plans to give regulators more discretion, could mean nature suffered.He added: “But everything I have heard and learned during this review suggests that the current system does not work as well as it could for nature and the environment, let alone for growth.”Officials acknowledge that this is very likely to mean a less stringent policy for specific protection, particularly around distinct major projects, with this “focus on proportionality” meaning something such as the bat tunnel would be unlikely to happen again.There are, however, no plans to amend or scrap wider habitats regulations, introduced under EU laws and blamedby previous governmentsfor creating unnecessary red tape.Reed said: “Nature and the economy have both been in decline for too long. That changes today. I am rewiring Defra and its arms-length bodies to boost economic growth and unleash an era of building while also supporting nature to recover.”Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsWildlifeEnvironment AgencyNatural EnglandConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

To enforce a strict licensing model, the UK would also need to restrict access to models that have been trained on such content, which could include US-owned AI systems.In a report published on Wednesday, TBI said it backed government proposals to let AI firms train their models on copyright-protected material without permission, unless creatives have signalled they want to opt out of the process. With the Trump administration signalling it will not pursue strict AI regulations and China pursuing AI growth at “breakneck speed”, the UK could weaken its economic and national security interests by lagging in the AI race, said TBI.“If the UK imposes laws that are too strict, it risks falling behind in the AI-driven economy and weakening its capacity to protect national security interests,” said TBI.The report said arguing that commercial AI models cannot be trained on content from the open web was close to saying knowledge workers – a broad category of professionals ranging from lawyers to researchers – cannot profit from insights they get when reading the same content.Rather than fighting to uphold outdated regulations, said TBI, rights holders and policymakers should help build a future where creativity is valued alongside AI innovation.A more restrictive approach to copyright than the one taken by the EU, Singapore or Japan risked pushing AI developers out of the UK, said TBI.Fernando Garibay, a record producer who has worked with artists including Lady Gaga and U2, said history has been dotted with “end-of-time claims” related to technological breakthroughs, from the printing press to music streaming. Those fears were unfounded, said Garibay in an introduction to the report, and the creative community should not “cling” to a legal status quo.“The progressive solution is not about clinging to copyright laws designed for an earlier era but allowing them to co-evolve with technological change, to remain effective in fulfilling their regulatory and protective aims in the age of AI,” said Garibay.The report, called Rebooting copyright: How the UK can be a global leader in the Arts and AI, also calls for the creation of a Centre for AI and Creative Industries that will encourage collaboration between the tech and creative sectors.Beeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer andprominent campaigner against the government proposals, said the report was effectively telling artists to “put up or shut up” because AI’s advance is inevitable.“It cannot be that the sum total of the government’s imagination is that the UK become an AI hub for Silicon Valley,” she said. “That has got to be the most depressing vision of the UK imaginable.”Kidron added that TBI’s acceptance of donations from the US tech billionaire Larry Ellison, which reached $270m (£210m) last year, were “the very definition of conflict of interest”. According to documents filed in the US last year, Ellison’s foundation donated more than $52m (£40m) to TBI in 2024, with a further $218m (£169m) committed. TBI said the $270m commitment was for helping governments around the world, particularly in Africa, with “reform and change programmes”.“We maintain intellectual independence over our policy work,” said TBI.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingThinktanksTony BlairnewsShareReuse this content"

Satisfaction fell from 31% in 2023 to just 19% last year – the lowest proportion in the 41 years the British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey of the views of patients in England,Scotlandand Wales has been carried out.Satisfaction with NHS dentistry has collapsed, too, from 60% as recently as 2019 to just 20% last year. More people (55%) are dissatisfied with dental care than with any other service.Starmer unlikely to fulfil pledge on hospital waiting times, says IFSRead moreSimilarly, fewer than a third (31%) of adults are satisfied with GP services.“The latest results lay bare the extent of the problems faced by the NHS and the size of the challenge for the government”, said Dan Wellings, a senior fellow at the King’s Fund. “For too many people, the NHS has become too difficult to access. How can you be satisfied with a service you can’t get into?”The collapse in satisfaction from 70% to 21% in 14 years had been “extraordinary”, he said, adding that people should not be scared about going to A&E, or that an ambulance will not come quickly after dialling 999 or that they may have to get themselves to hospital some other way. “People are sad and angry at the place we’ve got to.”A generational divide is also emerging. Over-65s are more likely to be satisfied, though the figure is still only 27%. But satisfaction among under-65s has fallen from 24% to just 19%.More positively, a narrow majority (51%) are satisfied with the quality of the NHS care they receive when they manage to access services. And there remains overwhelming support for its founding principle that it should be available to everyone free at the point of use and funded through taxation.Wes Streeting, the health and social care secretary, said: “We inherited a broken NHS and this survey shows patients agree. Ever-longer waiting lists, widespread corridor treatment and a regular struggle to see your GP have led to these record levels of dissatisfaction with the health service.”Since the survey was undertaken in September and October, the government had “taken the NHS off life support”, pledged an extra £26bn in investment over the next two years and was drawing up a 10-year plan to make the service once again “fit for the future”, he added.Meanwhile, a separate study has found that almost one in 10 (9.7%) people in Britain have been harmed by either NHS treatment or a delay in obtaining help in the past three years.In 45% of cases, the harm the person suffered had a severe impact and in 38% of cases a moderate impact.But those from disadvantaged groups – such as people with a disability, from poorer backgrounds or with a long-term health condition – were more likely to be harmed and suffer serious harm.Researchers, whose findings are published on Wednesday in the journal BMJ Quality and Safety, surveyed more than 10,000 people in Britain between November 2021 and May 2022.They were asked about their experience of NHS adverse events, which included the medical or physical consequences of treatment, and also the psychological damage involved and harm caused by lack of access to care.“Our study confirms that disparities in rates of NHS harm for socially disadvantaged groups exist and impacts are more severe,” said Dr Michele Peters, an associate professor at Oxford PopulationHealthand an author of the study.“These groups may find it harder to have their needs met within a difficult-to-navigate system with a culture that is less able to hear more vulnerable people.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthHospitalsDentistsGPsEnglandScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Though he shunned the spotlight, his legacy continues to inspire officers across the nation.“Our thoughts are with his loved ones. His service and sacrifice will always be remembered.”Lock was a member of the diplomatic protection squad guarding the embassy in west London when it was stormed by six men armed with automatic weapons and grenades on 30 April 1980.The PC was drinking coffee with the embassy concierge, Abbas Fallahi, when he saw a face through the glass panel of the door.He thought it was a student and moved to let him in. The man pulled out a machine pistol which he fired and Lock was hit by flying glass.In 2002,he told the Guardian: “I remember a curtain of red coming down and immense pain in my eyes and face. I thought I’d been shot.”The gunmen belonged to a dissident Iranian group opposed to Ayatollah Khomeini, the religious leader who came to power in Iran in 1979, and they demanded the release of 91 political prisoners held in Iran as well as an aircraft to take them and the hostages out of the UK.View image in fullscreenLock with his wife Doreen outside Buckingham Palace after being presented with the George Medal.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyOn the sixth day of the standoff, Margaret Thatcher’s government ordered the SAS to raid the embassy after the gunmen shot dead the Iranian press attache, Abbas Lavasani, and dumped his body outside the building.More than 30 masked troops abseiled from the roof and entered the embassy, throwing grenades through the windows. About 15 minutes later, the hostages emerged and were escorted by the Met to ambulances in dramatic scenes filmed by television news crews.One hostage was killed and two were wounded in the crossfire.

However, until recently, the relationship between LDL-C levels and dementia has been less clear.Last year,a Lancet report found7% of cases of dementia were linked to high levels of bad cholesterol in midlife. Now a new study suggests having low levels of LDL-C could reduce the risk of dementia by a quarter.Researchers collected dataon 571,000 people in South Korea who had not been diagnosed with dementia – 192,213 people with LDL-C levels less than 1.8 mmol/L and 379,006 patients with LDL-C levels higher than 3.4 mmol/L (>130mg/dL).Analysis of subsequent diagnoses of dementia showed that LDL-C levels below 1.8 mmol/L were associated with a 26% reduction in the risk of dementia and a 28% cut in the risk of Alzheimer’s disease specifically, compared with LDL-C levels above 3.4 mmol/L.Statins appeared to offer additional protection against dementia in the presence of low LDL-C levels. Among people with LDL-C levels below 1.8 mmol/L, statin use was linked with a 13% reduction in dementia risk and a 12% cut in risk of Alzheimer’s disease, compared with non-users.This was an observational study, and no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. The authors also acknowledged several limitations, including the focus on baseline LDL-C levels when lipid profiles could change over time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The results give a convincing argument for researchers to consider LDL cholesterol in addition to the classic approaches.”Dr Julia Dudley, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “The use of statins seemed to offer a protective effect – even in those who already had cholesterol levels within a lower range.“However, dementia risk is complex and influenced by many factors. Without a detailed picture of what’s going on in the brain, we do not know if there is a direct link between lower cholesterol and reduced dementia risk.“Clinical trials will be key to understand what effects statins might be having on disease processes in the brain.”Explore more on these topicsDementiaAlzheimer'sNeuroscienceHealthMedical researchGlobal healthnewsShareReuse this content"

Later in life, he tattooed two crowns on his wrists to memorialise those carnival-like Epiphany commemorations and his Catholic roots.‘Deported because of his tattoos’: has the US targeted Venezuelans for their body art?Read more“MostCapacherosget crown tattoos, often adding the name of their father or mother. We’ve lots of people with these tattoos – it’s a tradition that began in 1917,” said Miguel Chacón, the president of Capacho’s Three Kings Day foundation.The Latin American tradition appears to have been lost on theUS immigrationofficers who detained Hernández, a 31-year-old makeup artist, hairdresser and theatre lover, after he crossed the southern border last August to attend a prearranged asylum appointment in San Diego.Hernández, who is gay, told agents he was fleeing persecution stemming from his sexual orientation and political views. Just weeks earlier, Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, had unleasheda ferocious crackdownafter being accused of stealing the presidential election to extend his 12-year rule.But Hernández’s tattoos were deemed proof he was a member of Venezuela’s most notorious gang, the Tren de Aragua, and a “security threat” to the US.View image in fullscreenThe crown tattoo tradition stems from the Three Kings Epiphany commemorations.Photograph: US DoJ immigration court“Detainee Hernandez ports [sic] tattoos ‘crowns’ that are consistent with those of a Tren de Aragua member,” an agent at California’s Otay Mesa detention centre claimed, according to court documents published this week.Those 16 words appear to have sealed the fate of the young Venezuelan stylist, who friends, family and lawyers say has never committed a crime.On 15 March, after more than six months in custody in the US, Hernández was one of scores of Venezuelans flown from Texas to a maximum security prison inEl Salvadoras part of Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign. To the horror of their relatives, some detainees were paraded before the cameras and filmed being manhandled by guards and having their heads shaved before being bundled into cells.“Let my son go. Review his case file. He is not a gang member,” Hernández’s mother, Alexis Dolores Romero de Hernández, pleaded as she came to terms with her son’s disappearance into the notorious Central American “terrorism confinement centre”, known by the Spanish acronym Cecot.“Everyone has these crowns, many people. But that doesn’t mean they’re involved in the Tren de Aragua … He’s never had problems with the law,” said Hernández, 65, who has not heard from her son since he called on the eve of his transfer to let her know – incorrectly – that he was being deported to Venezuela.View image in fullscreenAndry José Hernández Romero participating in Capacho’s Three Kings celebration“We know nothing. They say nothing. They give no information. That’s the trauma – not knowing anything about these young men, especially mine,” Alexis Hernández complained.Her son’s plight has caused outrage in Táchira, the western state where he grew up, with people packing Capacho’s picturesque 19th-century church, San Pedro de la Independencia, to demand his freedom.“We’re talking about someone who has been part of Capacho’s Three Kings Day celebrations for 23 years,” said Chacón, who is leading the campaign. “That’s why I’m doing everything I can to get this young man released. He is completely innocent.”Krisbel Vásquez, 29, a manicurist, denied her “calm, kind and humble” childhood friend was a villain. “I’ve known him all my life. He doesn’t bother anyone,” Vásquez said, urging Trump and El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, to backtrack.Xiomara Ramírez, 57, said her son had grown up with Hernández, with the pair doing homework together at her house. “I wonder why so much injustice. Why doesn’t the US give good people like Andry opportunities?” Ramírez asked.Melissa Shepard, an attorney from theCalifornia-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center, representing Andry, was perplexed that her “very sweet, kind and thoughtful” client had been incarcerated in “one of the worst places in the world.“The fact that this administration has taken somebody who is so vulnerable and put them into such a terrifying situation has just been horrific. We fear that if it can happen to him, it can happen to anyone,” she said.View image in fullscreenAndry José Hernández Romero.Growing indignation over Hernández’s plight, and that of other apparently innocent Venezuelans deported to El Salvadoron the basis of their tattoos, is spreading to unexpected places.“It’s horrific,”Joe Rogan, a Trump-endorsing podcaster, said on his latest show. Rogan supported Trump’s offensive against Venezuelan “criminals” the president claimed terrorised the US. “But let’s not [let] innocent gay hairdressers get lumped up with the gangs,” he said, asking: “How long before that guy can get out? Can we figure out how to get them out? Is there any plan in place to alert the authorities that they’ve made a horrible mistake and correct it?”But theTrump administrationhas shown no sign of reconsidering its decision to send so many Venezuelans to El Salvador on the basis of such flimsy evidence.On Monday, Trump thanked Bukele for receiving another group of alleged Latin American criminals “and giving them such a wonderful place to live!”Bukele said the deportations were “another step in the fight against terrorism and organised crime”, claiming the 17 detainees were all “confirmed murderers and high-profile offenders”.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, bristled whenquestionedabout agents’ use of a “points system” to classify detainees as gang members based on their tattoos or attire. “Shame on you and shame on the mainstream media for trying to cover for these [criminal] individuals,” she replied, claiming “a litany of criteria” was used to correctly identify “foreign terrorists” or “illegal criminal aliens” for removal.View image in fullscreenAndry José Hernández Romero among the crowds at one of the many Epiphany parades he took part in in the town of Capacho.Shepard questioned the administration’s assertion that detainees such as Hernández were being “removed”. “He has been disappeared,” she said. “I know the government tries to use the language that he was ‘removed’ [but] … he has absolutely been disappeared.”Thousands of miles away in Capacho, Hernández’s mother spoke sorrowfully of how her son had decided, against his family’s wishes, to abandon their economically damaged country last May and make the perilous journey north through the Darién jungles between Colombia and Panama. “He left because he wanted to help us … and to fulfil his dream,” Hernández said, adding: “Now the reality is different.”On a recent evening, she and hundreds of protesters filled the San Pedro church for their latest vigil in support of Hernández. The crowd included three men dressed as the Three Kings, who wore theatrical beards and diadems dotted with fake jewels and carried plaques bearing the words: Conscience, Justice and Freedom.“We, his family, and the entire town vouch for [Hernández’s] innocence. It’s not possible that in Capacho having a crown tattoo is a symbol of pride, but for him, it makes him a criminal,” Chacón said, appealing directly to the presidents of the US and El Salvador.“I know Trump is a good man and Bukele is a good man,” Chacón said. “But it cannot be that they have sent this young man to prison.

But experts say it’s not all badKatie CameroTue 1 Apr 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 17.53 EDTShareWe’re hiding behind a dining table, waiting for the birthday girl to arrive.The door creaks open. “Surprise!” we shout.When her shock fades, my friend yells, “I thought the party was tomorrow!”My heart sinks as I realize she’d planned her own, separate party – and hadn’t invited me.After a decade of knowing her, I had become her fringe friend – a non-essential pal, the person who’s “always welcome but never invited”, as fellow fringe friends say online.I shouldn’t have been so surprised. We had grown apart after living in different cities, and our conversations had been feeling awkward and forced. But I still considered her one of my closest friends, so it stung when I realized she no longer prioritized our relationship like I did.‘When a friend is struggling, they need an ally, not an opinion’: 11 surprising habits that can ruin friendshipsRead moreBeing a fringe friend is a universal experience, according to friendship experts. A study of college students found that the majority of people thinktheir friendships are reciprocal, but only about half of them actually are. In a similar vein, people crave quality over quantity. Surveys from the American Friendship Project found that over 75% of adults were satisfied with the number of friends they had, but more than 40% felt theyweren’t as close to them as they’d like.Dr Miriam Kirmayer, a clinical psychologist and friendship expert, says negative thought patterns are common when you’re a fringe friend: Did I do something wrong? Am I worthy of friendship?“It’s important to normalize and validate those feelings,” says Kirmayer. “But on the other end, I find a lot of them stem from misconceptions we have about what’s necessary in order to feel connected.”In other words, there may be some benefits to being a fringe friend.Research shows that companionship helps us feel moresatisfied with lifeand protects us againstmental and physical health problems, such as depression, anxiety and heart disease.At the same time, social relationships impose norms and expectations that can have the opposite effect, says Kirmayer. For example, you might think you need to attend every group hang – or risk not getting another invite. Or you may agree to all your pal’s inconvenient requests so they know you have their back.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’But these “shoulds, musts and have-tos” aren’t always accurate, says Kirmayer. Instead, they “increase pressure and feelings of guilt or shame when we feel as though we aren’t measuring up or behaving in the way that’s expected”.Cue the first benefit of being a fringe friend: you aren’t beholden to anyone’s expectations.“You don’t have to be at someone’s beck and call because you know you’re not their go-to person,” saysDr Irene Levine, a psychologist, friendship expert and author of Best Friends Forever: Surviving a Breakup with Your Best Friend. “It’s nice to not have somebody depend on you. It doesn’t feel like you’re rejecting anyone.”‘She is my soulmate. I’d do anything for her’: readers on their best friendsRead moreEmbracing your fringe friend era also gives you the space and time to invest in other areas of your life, says Levine, including new hobbies, self-care routines or family relationships.Meg Foster, a 22-year-old theology graduate student from Austin, Texas, had her own epiphany about three years ago when someone she was close to in high school “forgot” to invite her to their mutual bestie’s surprise engagement party. (They were both bridesmaids at the wedding … awkward.)The experience gave her the time and confidence to try new things – pottery, crochet, cycling, making bread from scratch – that she wouldn’t have otherwise had. She also had zero fear of being judged for any of it. “There’s a lot of freedom in anonymity,” she says.As long as you’re not being mistreated, it’s perfectly fine, necessary even, to be a fringe friend, saysDanielle Bayard Jackson, a relational health educator and the author of Fighting for Our Friendships. But be wary of using your fringe friend status to retreat into yourself, she says. Alone time can be healthy, but too much can make you feel worse.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Are you spending time in spaces that feel nourishing and meaningful? What do you feel comfortable telling others about yourself? Are you craving emotional intimacy or shared experiences?This information can help you diversify your social relationships, says Kirmayer, which is a relatively easy way to meet different people who could potentially turn into close friends.Studies suggest that people who have more fringe friends – sociologists call them “weak ties” –feel happier and more connectedthan those who have fewer of them.It’s nice to not have somebody depend on you. It doesn’t feel like you’re rejecting anyoneDr Irene Levine, psychologist and friendship expert“Very often one of the things I hear is the deep desire and the deeply held belief that we either need a best friend or that we need a friend group. That can be a source of motivation, but it can also be a source of shame and disappointment. The truth is that we can benefit from having all sorts of different connections and friendships in our life and that no one person can or will meet every connection need that we have,” says Kirmayer.“Finding micro-communities will allow you to not only tap into specific connection needs you have, but also specific experiences you might share,” says Kirmayer. For instance, support groups can be helpful for people dealing with chronic disease or the death of a loved one – you can relate to others who truly get it without the fear of judgment, she says.This means it’s worth the extra effort (and potential awkwardness) to ask your barista about their weekend plans or finally get to know your neighbor over freshly baked cookies. In fact, research shows thatconversations with strangerstend to be more enjoyablethan people expect.“These weak ties help us address a different type of loneliness,” Kirmayer says. “It might not be of the intimate, relational variety, but may be the communal type of loneliness: the feeling as though we are part of a larger community.”That said, balance is key. Finding and fostering deeper, reciprocal connections is important for your wellbeing, Kirmayer says. These more intimate relationships offer stronger emotional support, satisfy our innate need to feel capable and included, and are a major source of ouroverall happiness, research suggests.I want community – but am I prepared to put the work in?Read moreThat’s easier said than done. But when you embrace the vulnerability that comes with getting closer to others, you’ll find that most people are open to it, says Kirmayer.That doesn’t mean you have to dump fringe friendships along the way, says Jackson: “It’s about supplementing, not replacing.” Someone who is not your best friend can still bring value and joy to your life.It can be tough if you realize a particular bond is no longer mutual. But that doesn’t have to be the case forever.“Very often we think about the fringe experience as being the end point in our friendship and we believe the misconception that that’s where we’ll stay,” says Kirmayer. “But maybe it’s really the next step in building closeness. So instead of seeing this as the end, can you see it as the beginning?”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyFriendshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They chewed through the cables in my son’s car, costing him god knows how much.“There’s one street I can’t walk my dog because they come running out of the grass and the piles of rubbish. One time I screamed.”She’s referring to rats, which have multiplied rapidly as the rubbish has piled up in anongoing bin strikein Birmingham.On Tuesday, it was four weeks since bin workers walked out indefinitely, after striking intermittently since January, and a day since thecouncil declared a major incidentwith more than 17,000 tonnes of uncollected rubbish on the streets.View image in fullscreenStriking bin workers in Birmingham have been walking slowly in front of refuse lorries to stop them from driving away from the depot in Tyseley.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianAcross the road from Dore’s house, two huge mounds of bin bags have accumulated and, as the weather warms up, it is starting to smell.“It’s the smell and the germs. There’s loads of rats. And the bags are piled up outside a pharmacy, where people are going to get their medication. It’s not right,” said Dore, 61. “It has been there for weeks and it’s getting higher and higher.“What worries me most is the sickness from the rubbish. My daughter doesn’t want to bring her children here, she doesn’t want them to catch the germs.”Tuesday also marked the day that council tax in the city rose by 7.5%, a year after it rose by 10% in the aftermath of the city councildeclaring itself effectively bankruptin 2023.It’s a point of ire for many residents as bin collections decrease and it becomes increasingly difficult to get a slot at the local tip.“My council tax is like £1,900, I got the shock of my life when I saw. I don’t know how I’m going to pay it. Everything has gone up,” said Asma Jabeen in Bordesley Green. “I have taken my rubbish to the tip but a lot of people aren’t doing that. I have never seen rats in my life before, but now you can see them on the ground. It’s horrible.”View image in fullscreenAhmed Alsaab, 46, worries that the buildup of waste will ruin Birmingham’s reputation.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Guardian“It’s a rip-off because we’re paying council tax but they’re not collecting the rubbish. They should knock some money off during the strikes,” said Ali Khan, 27, whose street now features three large piles of rubbish, which keep obstructing the road.“It’s going to be a disaster if it goes on into the summer. People could catch a disease or something at this rate. I do feel for the workers though, sometimes it has to be done or you don’t get the results you want.”Negotiations between the city council and the bin workers’ union,Unite, are ongoing but relations have deteriorated in recent weeks – striking workers have been told they face compulsory redundancy if they don’t accept the council’s offer of retraining or a different role on the same pay grade.But workers say the council’s decision to scrap the role of waste recycling and collection officer will reduce health and safety, and lead to pay cuts for those affected.View image in fullscreenRefuse piles up in the Balsall Heath area of the city.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Guardian“It’s an important role. People don’t realise how dangerous the job is, the abuse we get,” said Richard Mitchell, a striking bin worker. “We’re not asking for any more money, we just want what we were already getting.”The council said the strikers were blocking bin lorries, staffed by agency workers drafted in to help maintain the service, and this had caused the rubbish to build up across the city.In a one-hour stint on Tuesday morning, three lorries were able to leave a depot in Tyseley, but none were able to make it to the end of the street due to striking workers walking very slowly in front of them in protest.At least eight staffed lorries were backed up behind the depot gates, while strikers paced back and forth in front of the entrance to prevent them from leaving.“We’re slowing them down, moving as slow as we possibly can, but we’re not stopping them,” said Mitchell. “It’s horrible to say, but the more disruption we cause, the more we can push the council and the union to get round the table and get this resolved.“We’re sorry. It’s not fair on the residents. I’m aBirminghamresident and I’ve not had my bins collected either.”Back in Balsall Heath, Ahmed Alsaab, 46, said it was time community representatives were given a seat around the table.View image in fullscreenStriking bin workers walking back and forth in front of the depot exit.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Guardian“It’s affecting our health, so if they can’t solve the problem, we should get involved – we’re the ones who are suffering,” he said, adding that it would not be forgotten that a Labour-led council had presided over the crisis. “Next election we will punish them,” he said.He also expressed concern about the long-term damage to a city that has worked hard to improve its image in recent years.The Birmingham Chambers of Commerce issued a statement on Tuesday warning that the strike was “undoubtedly harming the image of the city and making it less attractive for residents, visitors and businesses”.“It’s really affecting our city’s reputation. What about the investors, what about the tourists?” said Alsaab. “It’s all over social media, the world can see it. I have friends abroad, they ask me are you living in that ‘rubbish’ city?

She was banned from running for office for five years with immediate effect, which could prevent her making a fourth bid for the French presidency in 2027.She has said she will appeal against the verdict and sentence, which also included a four-year prison term – with two years suspended and two to be served outside jail with an electronic bracelet – and €100,000 (£84,000) fine.What was Marine Le Pen found guilty of?Le Pen was “at the heart” of a carefully organised “system” of embezzlement of European parliamentary funds, according to the ruling by Bénédicte de Perthuis, a judge specialising in financial crimes.French ministers condemn threats to judges in Marine Le Pen caseRead moreFrom 2004 to 2016, taxpayer money allocated to members of the European parliament to pay their assistants based in Strasbourg or Brussels was instead siphoned off by the far-right National Rally (RN) party, then called Front National, in order to pay its own party workers in France.The staff in France had no connection to work undertaken at the European parliament.The court found there was “no doubt” about the existence of the scheme which “under cover of fictitious contracts” served to “remunerate people who actually worked for the party or the party leaders” in France. This was estimated to have caused a loss to European funds of €4.8m (£4m).Le Pen, who was a member of the European parliament from 2004, as well as head of the party from 2011, was found guilty of directly organising eight fictitious contracts worth about €474,000. But the court said she was also at the centre of “instigating” the wider fake jobs scheme which she undertook with “authority” and “determination”.1:03Marine Le Pen calls embezzlement conviction a 'nuclear bomb' – videoWho else was convicted?Eight other European parliament members for RN were found guilty of being part of the scheme, alongside 12 people found to have had fictitious contracts as parliamentary assistants. Two accountants and the party treasurer were also convicted.Those found to have been paid for party work under fictitious European parliament assistant contracts included the full-time bodyguard of Le Pen’s late father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, as well as his personal secretary. Also convicted was Marine Le Pen’s sister, Yann Le Pen, who in fact worked on events for the party’s central office in France.What did they do with the money?Le Pen and those convicted did not gain any personal financial benefit. The judge ruled “there was no personal enrichment”, but rather “enrichment of the party”.The embezzlement scheme channelled money to fund Front National, which was in financial “difficulty”, the judges found. The party made “large savings” by paying its centralised staff in France with European funds. Among documents cited in evidence by the judges was an email sent in June 2014 from the party treasurer to Le Pen outlining the party’s financial troubles, saying: “We’ll only get through if we make big savings thanks to the European parliament …”The court said the salaries paid from European parliamentary funds to party workers were “comfortable” amounts which the party could otherwise not have paid. The system had allowed a comfortable working life for party leaders, such as the party founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who had a secretary and bodyguard. He had been accused of being part of the scheme but did not stand trial due to ill health. Hedied, aged 96, in January.On what evidence did the court reach its verdict?The judges said a broad range of evidence showed the contracts were fictitious and work was not carried out for the European parliament, but instead for the party.The judges cited a 2014 email from one member of the European parliament, who had previously been a lawyer, to the party treasurer: “What Marine is asking is equivalent to us signing for fictitious jobs …” He warned this was likely to be spotted. “I think Marine knows all that …” the treasurer replied.During the trial, the court heard that one party worker wrote in an email: “I’d like to see the European parliament and that would also allow me to meet the member of the European parliament I’m attached to.” He had apparently never been to the European parliament where he was supposed to have been working for four months.Did Le Pen admit guilt?No. During the trial Le Pen, like the others accused, told the court she was innocent. She said: “I have absolutely no sense of having committed the slightest irregularity, or the slightest illegal act.” After the verdict she repeated she was innocent and said she would appeal.The judges noted in their verdict that the accused “had not expressed any conscience of their violation of the law nor the importance of integrity”.Explore more on these topicsMarine Le PenThe far rightNational RallyFranceEuropeEuropean UnionexplainersShareReuse this content"

But This City Is Ours was different, not least because of the number of Scousers on set, theDerry Girlsstar explains. “It wasn’t, like, so serious,” she says. “We had craic off-camera.” However, while it was fun to make the buzzy new BBC crime drama (the female cast members named themselves the Muffia) the end result isn’t fun – although it is gripping. Featuring betrayals, love and a lot of violence, the show stars Sean Bean as a Liverpool drugs boss, while Jackson plays Cheryl Crawford, the wife of one of his underlings.Cheryl is on the periphery, though her voice-of-experience warnings ring loud. “There’s nothing good about our men,” she tells Diana, the partner of a senior gang member. Jackson has lived in Liverpool for a couple of years now – which helped with the accent – and it was a treat to be back in her own bed at the end of a day’s filming. A lot of hair extensions helped with the look. “It was so heavy, so hot, to be under it every day,” she says with a laugh. “Our amazing hair and makeup designer, Adele Firth, really wanted to get the picture across of some girls in Liverpool – they take such pride in themselves. Every occasion is an occasion to really get dolled up.” Jackson found herself intrigued by Cheryl. “I think if, like her, you grow up around these types of people, or they’re adjacent to your family, that can blur the danger for you.”The Irish have a lot of sympathy for other places in the world that have oppressionJackson is speaking from New York, where for the last two weeks she has been rehearsing the off-Broadway comedyIrishtown. After so much TV work, and a small part on the DC superhero filmThe Flash, it feels good to be in the theatre. With film and TV, she says: “You sort of show up ready to go. You’re not working it through together.” The idea of theatre is scary but rewarding: “Being on stage with your cast-mates and being extremely present for cues, because there’s a live audience.”The job that changed Jackson’s life was Derry Girls, the Channel 4 comedy about teenagers in Northern Ireland in the last years of the Troubles. She played the lead, Erin Quinn. The night after it first aired in 2018 – in the days, just about, before streamers and on-demand viewing dominated – Jackson was walking through London on her way to the theatre in which she was appearing in Jez Butterworth’sThe Ferryman, and she was stopped around 10 times by people who recognised her. “I was naive at the time. I just thought that that’s what it was like for everybody after their first TV job. I didn’t realise the gravitas of it.”Was it hard to stay grounded with such early success? “Where I’m from, I don’t think I would ever have the opportunity to be up my own arse, as they say in Derry. I’m aware that being an actor is such a privilege, and also I’m speaking somebody else’s words. I love working with other actors, but I do wholly believe we are like a secondary vehicle to the writers.”Jackson always wanted to be an actor. “I loved hearing adults around me telling stories when I was a kid. A part of Irish culture is storytelling and I knew I really wanted to do it.” The whole family loved films, her grandmother loved theatre, and Jackson was in drama clubs. She describes acting as like an out-of-body experience, which she got hooked on as a child, although it happens less frequently now as an adult. “I loved that feeling of escapism,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘The hair extensions were so heavy, so hot’ … in This City Is Ours.Photograph: James Stack/BBC/Left Bank PicturesJackson is the eldest of three with two younger brothers. The conflict, and British troops, had been like a “backdrop”, she says, “a presence that was always there. We had a barracks at the bottom of our street, an army checkpoint, so it just became day-to-day life.” That was her experience as a child, she points out. “I know it wasn’t like that for the adults around us, but I think everybody did a great job of helping protect us and shield us from the tensions. We would be out playing on the streets and there would be soldiers there. I think my mum always found that really hard. She’s from the south, but we didn’t know any different.”Jackson thinks her generation learned a lot from growing up with it. A child when theGood Friday agreementwas signed, she talks of “the downfalls of division and violence. I definitely think Irish people have a lot of sympathy for other places in the world that have that sort of oppression.”Her parents, who at one time ran a hotel, were always supportive of Jackson’s ambition to become an actor, which fuelled her. “I had this blind faith, and I was always confident, as a child, in myself and what I could do. I think that was bred into me by my parents. It’s sort of crazy looking back on it, but I never thought it wasn’t going to work out.” Even when she was slogging around auditions, it felt “real, even if I was getting a ‘No’ from all those auditions, I still felt like I was getting the opportunity and that it was in reach. I was grateful for it.”View image in fullscreenExaggerated facial expressions … Jackson in Derry Girls.Photograph: Peter Marley/RichesIf there were struggles, they were more internal. Growing up in the 1990s and 2000s, Jackson remembers being bombarded with “diet culture. It was constantly in magazines, calling out celebrities for what size they were, and that definitely had an impact on me and all my friends. It’s something I’ve struggled with. And more so when I did start working in TV – being so aware of yourself and feeling like the world is more responsive to you the thinner you are.”She remembers being on diets “from a really young age. I’m sad for my younger self, and I hope that we’re all moving to a place now where television is more reflective of actual people, so young girls and boys don’t have these hang-ups.” Although she is more concerned with being healthy now, and not getting run down while working, it can still be a struggle. “It’s definitely an inner monologue. I’m trying to learn tools to change that narrative in my head. I do feel like the world’s changing, and I’m just not prepared to be like that any more.”It’s hard to have too much vanity when you’re as gifted in comedy as Jackson is, from her exaggerated facial expressions in Derry Girls, to the hilarious wig (part Joan of Arc, part Shrek’s Lord Farquaad) she wears inThe Decameron, the Netflix comedy in which she plays a medieval servant. “Growing up,” she says, “I never felt like I was the prettiest girl in the room, and I think that’s character-building. If you don’t take yourself seriously, it’s good for you in all aspects of life. You get to play roles where you look glamorous, and those are fun, but there’s something liberating in the parts that are less glamorous.”View image in fullscreen‘I had a wobble going into this play’ … Jackson.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianHer partner, the DJ Denis Sulta, is coming out to New York in a couple of weeks, she says, and surely her mother will be there too – they are often photographed out and about together. “I’m very grateful that we have the relationship that we have. She’s like my accomplice and I just want to spend as much time with her as possible, share all these exciting moments together. I’m sort of amazed at what’s happening around me and amazed at the opportunities I’m getting – and so is my mum.”Jackson’s mum builds her up when she’s nervous, she says, which surprises me because she seems so self-assured. Does she have self-doubt? “Yeah, of course. I think that shows you care and want to learn. I had a lot of doubt going into this play. I had a real wobble of, ‘I’m not as equipped with theatre skills as the rest of the cast.’ It’s humbling to have those moments. I have an amazing cast around me. I’m going to learn a lot from them and I’m going to work as hard as I can.” She still has moments when she thinks she can’t do something. “But,” she says, “it’s such a rewarding feeling when you get to the end of it. I’ve done it.”This City Is Ours is on BBC One and iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV crime dramaDramaDerry GirlsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

An April fool? Either way, big thanks to Mel and KemiJohn CraceA press conference at Tory HQ at least had some entertainment value even if there was nothing of importance to sayTue 1 Apr 2025 12.23 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 13.46 EDTShareThere was a time when you knew where you were with a press conference. You would go along on the assumption that the person or organisation who had called it had something important to say. Something that might approximate to news.But we live in ever more confusing days. So now we’ve reached the point whereKemi Badenochand Mel Stride will do almost anything for attention. Where a press conference is just another excuse for a therapy session where they can unload their familiar grievances on to journalists. It’s the only way they can get anyone to listen.Mind you, a Kemi press conference – even a meta one – is never without its entertainment value. It’s not beyond the realms of possibility that Tuesday’s invitation to Conservative campaign headquarters in Westminster was devised purely for the benefit of sketch writers. Or maybe it was one of the Tory party’s better April fool gags. In either case, a big thank you.“The cost of living has become unbearable,” Kemi began. The inference was that everything had been tickety-boo up until the election last year. Back in the halcyon days of the Tory government, everyone was awash with money. Or maybe not. Badenoch did not seem in any hurry to examine her party’s legacy. The past is a foreign country.Then to the details. Such as they were. Labour’s increase in national insurance contributions for businesses – “Labour’s job tax” – was going to make every family £3,500 worse off.Stride would be telling us how this figure was arrived at later, she added. At which point you knew the £3.5k was entirely fictitious. Something that an intern had come up with on the back of an envelope. Mel is a decent man, but he can barely operate a contactless debit card. Quite how he’s ended up as shadow chancellor is a mystery to him as well as us.Kemi hadn’t quite finished though. She raced through all the price increases coming into effect on Tuesday. Council tax. Water bills. TV licences. As if these were increases that would never have happened under a Tory government. As if these had come as a surprise. She also forgot to elaborate on how she would pay for Labour’s NI increase that she would presumably reverse. We were only left to assume this was the plan. She never spelled it out.The closest we got to a cost analysis was a mumbled reference to cutting the welfare bill. Unlikely. There was outrage at Labour cutting the bill by £5bn. Cutting by £20bn would cause untold hardship. And remember the Tories’ outrage when Labour went for the low hanging fruit of the winter fuel allowance.Come the end, Kemi seemed to be engaged in a battle with the teleprompter. Speaking quicker and quicker to see if she could get ahead of it. You couldn’t blame her. Even she seemed to be wondering what on earth she was doing here. How had she allowed herself to be talked into this?Her heart just wasn’t in it. There was no glory in telling people stuff they either don’t believe or already know. Especially when no one was listening. She’d have been much happier talking about her latest Elon Musk X conspiracy theory thatAdolescencewas based on a true story and the writers had switched the race of the boy.Then it was over to a rather desperate looking Mel, who sounded hopelessly confused as he tried to explain the origins of the fantasy £3.5k. If you took some numbers from the Office for Budget Responsibility and then made a whole load of bogus assumptions on the basis that the economy continued to tank for the next five years then you arrived at about £1.5k. And if you then doubled that, for the sake of convenience, and then rounded up your final figure by £500 you were just about there. Would that do?, he asked.The Melster was no more forthcoming than Kemi on how he would have raised money to fill the black hole and pay for the NHS. “We would have taken a different approach,” he said carefully. A bead of sweat forming on his brow. What would he have done differently? Things. He would have done things differently. Thing things.Why did people want to know this stuff? He proudly showed us his party’s new economic policies. A blank page. You could imagine what you wanted to see. It works for Mel. He is genuinely proud of having no policies. It makes him feel better about himself.Predictably, no one from the media had any questions to ask about the £3.5k or the cost of living. All anyone wanted to know about was the US. Here we were in for a surprise. Because Kemi was a model of diplomacy. She didn’t want to stir up abortion wars in the UK. Nor did she want to promote a trade war. In short, she was supportive of what Keir Starmer was doing. The handful of Tories in the press conference looked amazed.There was just time for one more contribution from Stride. Or Shaman Mel. Rachel Reeves was talking down the animal spirits. No one knew what he was talking about. Kemi appeared astonished. She was just beginning to ask herself what on earth she had been thinking when she appointed him chancellor. There again, she hadn’t had that many people to choose from.Not that everything was that hunky dory over in Labour land. Jonathan Reynolds and Angela Rayner had both been sent out on to the airwaves to try to persuade people that they had given everyone a massive pay rise.Try not to be negative. Stop talking down the country by talking about the contraction of the jobs market from the NI increase. Forget about your bills going up faster than inflation. Just focus on the minimum wage. And when you’re feeling better off, go and spend £17.50 at the Labour party shop on some leaflets boasting how many illegals have been deported. Labour. The new nasty party.It made you think. What if our politicians really aren’t that incompetent? What if they are the brightest and the best the country has to offer? How bad must things be then? Time to run for the hills.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchConservativesLabourKemi BadenochMel StrideEconomic policyWelfarenewsShareReuse this content"

I spent a week trying everything from chocolate milk with rum to apple cider vinegar with prosecco to find outElle HuntTue 1 Apr 2025 10.27 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 13.11 EDTShareIn the little we know ofMaterialists, the forthcoming film fromPast Livesdirector Celine Song, Dakota Johnson plays Lucy, a successful matchmaker who is herself perennially single and jaded about love. When an as-yet-unnamed suitor (Pedro Pascal) approaches her at a wedding and asks to buy her a drink, Lucy’s response is not so much a request as a challenge.“Sure,” sighs Johnson, with that hypnotically flat delivery that saw her namedworst actress at this year’s Razzies. “Coke and beer.”Coke and beer. Coke – andbeer? Cokeandbeer! Who is she, this Lucy? And why is she not like other girls? I have rarely been so taken by a trailer. Is this where I’ve been going wrong, I wonder, in dating and in life?I’ve always liked the idea of having a signature drink order. It seems to mark you out as a person of taste and distinction – someone with a history, who knows things. Medium house red says basic, cheap, vaguely health-conscious. Coke and beer, on the other hand, feels provocative, intriguing and a bit peevish, maybe in a sexy way. “Yeah, so what??” it says, and “Of course I really like it. Why would I order a drink I don’t like?”, and “I picked it up in Chile/Belize/Adelaide.”As drink orders go, it’s quirky to the point of abrasiveness, skirting the line between making yourself memorable to bar staff and really pissing them off. Lucy is clearly daring Pascal’s character to question her taste, or prove himself bold enough to order this strange brew.The Materialists trailerBut Coke and beer isn’t just a neat bit of characterisation. These days, social media is always coming up with bananas new beverage blends. OnTikTok, if a drink has more than one ingredient, it’s a cocktail. And on online forums, recipes for preposterous and often highly potent drinks are traded like urban legends, at once universal and hyperlocal.In the name of finding my own distinctive signature drink,I set out to try as many as I could stomach in a week.Coke and beerWhile the Materialists trailer does not show Johnson actually mixing her Coke with beer, her plans to combine them are made clear from the half-pint of lager that arrives served in a pint glass.My first question is about logistics. How do you actually order a Coke and beer, without making it a whole “thing”?On my way to the pub on Monday night, I plan to play it cool. “Half-pint of lager, pint glass, topped up with Coke,” I repeat under my breath. But as soon as I walk in, though the pub is mercifully empty, my nerve fails me.“What can I get you?” says the bartender. After some back and forth, she puts aside her misgivings and gamely pours a half pint of Krombacher, then points the Coke gun.A head of foam instantly balloons like a mushroom cloud, the clear gold of the beer darkening into a roiling, opaque mess. “I feel bad charging you for this,” she says.And yet, it isn’t that bad.It’s even weirdly familiar, like a stout with a sugary kick. I finish the whole thing.That said, I can’t imagine ever ordering it again. It doesn’t actually afford any of the cool points implied by Dakota Johnson. The hospitality industry exists to serve, and my bartender was very accommodating. But it is a fallacy that the customer is always right; there are rules, customs and conventions, many unspoken, that we are well advised not to break. Far from making me distinctive and desirable, merely ordering this drink put me on the wrong side of polite society.Coke and red wineUnlike Coke and beer, Coke and red wine is considereda legitimate drink, at leastin Europe. In Spain it’s known askalimotxo(orrioja libre); in Germany,RoterColaschoppen;and in Slovenia,bambus.This makes it easier to order one. My bartender seems to brighten, too, figuring that we are back on solid ground.The first sip goes down like sangria: refreshing and sort of novel. However, it lands increasingly heavily as you go on. I can see that a Coke mixer might make a bad red wine drinkable. But it certainly does not make a decent wine better.Even the benefits of halving my alcohol consumption are very obviously offset. I’m not a regular soda drinker and the caffeine and sugar hits me harder than the booze; I am awake until 1am with a churning stomach.It may be a more socially acceptable order, but if you are keen to try Coke and red wine, my No 1 tip is: don’t have it directly after Coke and beer.White wine and SpriteView image in fullscreen‘Sprine’, anyone? … Elle Hunt tries white wine and Sprite.Photograph: Courtesy of Elle HuntMy insides are no more stable the next day. Even after twice brushing my teeth, my mouth feels like I’ve been sucking on cotton towel.I head to a different pub to try my next combo: white wine and Sprite. I assume that it will be more palatable than red wine and Coke, but when I request it the bartender unmistakably wrinkles her nose.I was right, though: the sugary citrus of the mixer softens the house white’s harsh edge, and, in a tall glass with ice, it passes for a legitimate, even classy drink. I could see this combination being an easy way to slow your roll at a boozy summer barbecue, or an alternative to a lager top or shandy as a hair of the dog.Chocolate milk and white rumView image in fullscreenGrim combo … chocolate milk and white rum.Photograph: Courtesy of Elle HuntMilk forms the basis of a vast and ever-changing category of viral drinks, assumedly because it is readily available and also a good source of protein. On The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, the titular women enjoy “dirty sodas”, mixing caffeinated and carbonated beverages with creamy and/or syrupy ones.Themost popular combination, which has spread to TikTok, is Dr Pepper and milk; I am reliably informed that it is “meant to curdle”. If I am going to drink this, however, I want some booze to take the edge off. Teenagers apparently favour Malibu mixed with milk (flavoured and not), asfeaturedin the Paramount+ showYellowjackets.I decide to go home to make this one. The bartender hadn’t been able to hide her disgust at Sprite and wine (Sprine?); I can’t bear to ask her for chocolate milk. I pick up a bottle on my way, and make do with what I have in my kitchen: cheap white rum.The word that comes to mind is “grim”. The rum seems to dirty the chocolate milk, like dragging a mink blanket along a gravel path. Malibu may have worked better here, with the coconutty flavour tying things together. But this combo reminds me of the adolescent determination to get drunk at any cost.After two sips, I pour away what remains of my glassand retire for a fitful sleep.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2018, the magazine Bon Appétitendorsedwhat it called “the spritzy americano” as a “straightforward, refreshing, lively way” to start your day.How bad can it be, I reason, if people are charging five quid for it?Quite bad, as it turns out. I usually find OJ too sweet, but the shot of espresso doesn’t help here; it only muddies it. Sometimes it’s served with soda water (or tonic), which does make it more palatable, if you can look past the foamy head – but it’s no more enjoyable. It might be on the cutting edge of coffee trends, but it still tastes like dishwater.Apple cider vinegar and proseccoView image in fullscreenGet that ratio right … apple cider vinegar and prosecco.Photograph: Courtesy of Elle HuntMy next drink, at lunchtime, seems similarly credible,spun by the website Delishas an “autumnal” alternative to a mimosa: champagne and apple cider vinegar.Whether two ingredients make a cocktail is debatable. Delish suggests dressing it up with a cinnamon-sugar rim, caramel syrup and/or apple wedges. Alone at home, on my third consecutive day of drinking, I skip these steps.On my first go, the ratio is off; the cider vinegar burns my throat, reminding me why it is widely used as a cleaning product.The second time, I am heavier handed with the prosecco, and it’s not bad. The shot of vinegar successfully shaves off some of the screeching sweetness and deepens the flavour. I wouldn’t rule out having this again, as a low-sugar substitute for orange juice or to temper some cheap bubbles.Scotchwhiskyand coconut waterMy friend Richard Godwin, a cocktail writer and author ofthe Spirits newsletter, suggests I try this Caribbean staple –reportedlyas ubiquitous and defining in Puerto Rico as the piña colada. He says it isbest served“from an actual coconut, in the actual Caribbean”.I have to make do with a central London pub and, when I wind up in a Soho boozer on Wednesday night, I’m not surprised that they don’t have coconut water among the available softies.But I’ve come prepared. I order a whisky on the rocks, then subtly top it up from a meal-deal carton of Vita Coco I’d stashed in my bag. My friends politely pretend not to notice.This turns out to be the most elegant of my drinking forays so far: simple, refreshing and distinctly tropical. Should coconut water catch on as a standard mixer (and why not?), I’d definitely order this again.Corona SunriseView image in fullscreenCorona Sunrise with ingredients.Photograph: Courtesy of Elle HuntThe Corona Sunrise, whichwent viral on TikTokin the summer of 2021, is similarly festive. You drink a mouthful of Corona, then top up the bottle with a shot of tequila, a splash of orange juice and a dash of grenadine syrup.With viral beverages, looks can be more important than taste; the chief appeal of this one is clearly its pretty peach colour, but when I try this at home on Thursday night I am charmed, despite myself.The recipe requires only minimal effort, yet it transforms the humble Corona into a proper sundowner. I can’t imagine ordering it out – maybe from a gen Z, seemingly TikTok-savvy bartender? – but it is surprisingly cheering as an elevated after-work beer.Of course, it is very sweet, and deceptively high in alcohol. But if I was looking to prioritise (visual or alcoholic) impact, I’d certainly opt for this over a Cheeky Vimto.View image in fullscreenJust peachy … Elle’s Corona Sunrise.Photograph: Courtesy of Elle HuntHealthy CokeOrdinarily, I try not to drink alcohol more than twice a week. By Friday, day five, there’s a persistent pulsing in my abdomen; my mind keeps going to Dumbledore quaffing the Drink of Despair.I opt for something lighter: sparkling water and balsamic vinegar, also known as “healthy Coke”.This went viral in 2022aftera TikTokker claimedit “tastes just like a Coke”. I cannot emphasise this enough: it does not. It looks like Coke, kind of – but it tastes like fizzy salad dressing. It does tell you something about my week, though, that it goes down relatively smoothly.It dawns on me that many of these viral drinks were born of necessity, devised for novelty, or both.Social mediaisn’t a test kitchen, labouring to find the next best beverage. It’s mostly young people looking for attention online.So, too, with Materialists’ Coke and beer. I realise, too late, that it may not have been a serving suggestion – or even necessarily serving the narrative – so much as a bid for virality, to create a “social media moment”.A signature drink order may lend intrigue – but you do have to actually drink it. After a week of experimentation, my takeaway is that the dubious distinction isn’t worth the social violation, laboured explanation or, often, stomach-churning aftermath. In conclusion, I’ll stick with the medium house red, thanks – hold the Coke.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleAlcoholSocial mediaPubsTikTokWineBeerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Do you long to celebrate the delightfully monstrous, to give the spiny stuff of shadows their day in the sun? Then consider the mighty wētāpunga – an endemicNew Zealandinsect so revered for its unconventional beauty its name means “god of ugly things”.This forest behemoth is thought to be the heaviest adult insect in the world, with a female weighing as much as a mouse or a sparrow. Its body can grow up to 10cm long (nearly 4in) and its leg span can be as wide as 20cm. Once found across parts of the North Island, thevulnerable wētāpunga– the largest of 70 wētā species – now resides entirely on a smattering of predator-free islands near Auckland.Its Latin genus nameDeinacridamay translate to “terrible grasshopper”, but the wētāpunga’s bark is bigger than its bite. In fact, it does not bite to deter predators, nor can it fly, jump or kick. Instead, this docile giant uses its abdomen and legs to produce a stridulating hiss when disturbed – a technique that has helped ensure its survival, almost unchanged, for more than 190m years.If you have a soft spot for the shy and elusive among us, you will find a friend in the wētāpunga. This solitary creature with big, kind eyes tiptoes through the forest at night in search of leaves to eat, using its impressive spiny legs and dainty hooked feet to grip on to bark and leaves.Not one to make a show of itself, the wētāpunga’s mottled tan and green exoskeleton blends into the muted browns of its habitat. By day it hides itself away in fallen leaves and trees.It can also be a diplomat: despite kiore (pacific rats) having a taste for baby wētāpunga, or nymphs, adult wētāpunga have been known to share lodgings with their furry adversaries. Perhaps this is a nod to its former ecological role: prior to the introduction of rodents to New Zealand, wētāpunga were considered the “mice of the invertebrates”.It may be adept at living in the shadows but there is one way to know if you are in the presence of greatness: look for wētāpunga poo at the bottom of trees. Adults have faeces as big as rat droppings – the biggest of any invertebrate, and one of the largest in relation to body size in the animal kingdom. This is nothing to sniff at: the nutrient-rich wētāpunga poo does wonders for the forest-floor ecosystem.The wētāpunga may prefer a solo life, but it is not immune to the forces of love. Once it reaches adulthood, just before two years of age, it spends the rest of its life (another four to seven months) mating repeatedly throughout the day. Females lay eggs in the soft soil, which upon hatching go through 11 instars (moults) before reaching adulthood.These gentle giants are presumed extinct on the mainland of New Zealand, after predation from introduced species and habitat loss.Captive breeding and release programmesare helping to boost populations on offshore islands.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The contrast between a vintage-style silhouette and modern fabric is very cool, and the construction feels elevated, with a neat bodice, elegant skirt length and adjustable straps. Carrie would have paired it with Manolos and a gold name necklace, which would still totally work. Equally good with flat pumps, silver hoops and a sweater around the shoulders.A pilates pump updateView image in fullscreenMary Jane ballet shoes£12.50 at AsdaI make no apologies for featuring my favourite flat-shoe style two months in a row. I am obsessed. To recap: a pilates pump is a cross between a ballerina flat and a Mary Jane, with a simple low profile and a strap across the front. I came across this bargain version, which is perfect in its simplicity. The black is sold out in most sizes, but silver is a great summer option.A spring sweaterView image in fullscreenEnid embroidered jumper£112 at John Lewis£112 at BodenI have so much love for a sexy jumper. Not easy to find, which is why “sexy jumper” sounds a bit like an oxymoron. It is extremely useful to have dressy tops that are special enough for the evening but don’t give you goose bumps, so I am very much here for any sweater that has a slightly more interesting vibe than “sensible and warm”. There’s a cream version of this with lemons and strawberries on it, but I like the way the cherries vamp it up a bit. I’d wear this out for dinner with a black cami underneath.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

I won’t get into my longstanding obsession with Being More Paltrow here, suffice to say I firmly believe her to be an overlooked cultural oracle. Anyway, these shorts are cool and wholesome and so much more elegant than walking around in a T-shirt and knickers. In pure cotton seersucker, these will double up as holiday shorts, too.A reason to take a look at Reiss AtelierView image in fullscreenBerkeley top£125 at Reiss£125 at NextReiss is a bit misunderstood. I think we tend to see it as a high-street store that seems expensive, when in fact it’s more like a designer label that’s surprisingly affordable. The Atelier range is named after the in-house design atelier at Reiss, which is chock-full of designers poached from luxury labels. The fabrics are high-end and the tailoring is incredible. And not all of it is super-pricey. I love the rope-tie detailing on this cotton jersey top with drop shoulders, which will look great with wide-leg trousers.All the bows at ZaraView image in fullscreenBlack cardigan with black beaded bows£35.99 at ZaraView image in fullscreenCream cardigan with black ribbon bows£35.99 at ZaraThe Chanel show at the most recent Paris fashion week was a love letter to the bow. There were silk hair bows, crystal earring bows, bows on socks and on belts and on shoulders. It was pure fashion fantasy – but there are bows in the real world, too. Especially at Zara! Two bow-trimmed cardigans here, with concealed press studs below fancy bows for buttons. Which one is your favourite?The bead necklace is backView image in fullscreenPebble necklace£24 at Accessorize£24 at DebenhamsI haven’t worn a colourful, string-of-beads necklace for years. And suddenly I want to wear one again. Just saying. This one from Accessorize, on a gold-plated chain, is rather lovely. I’m bookmarking it while I have a dig around in my jewellery box as I’m pretty sure I bought something very similar from a beach market in Ibiza years ago.A chore jacket that flattersView image in fullscreenYarrel chore jacket£135 at FinisterreThe classic chore jacket, or shacket, is a modern style classic. The menswear shape doesn’t always suit women’s bodies, though. On me, to be honest, it gives my silhouette all the elegance of a loaf of bread. Finisterre is sort of a small, British version of Patagonia – outdoor clothes, made sustainably. This Yarrel chore jacket is made from organic cotton with metal rivet buttons, internal and external pockets, and a female-friendly hip-length hem.Explore more on these topicsFashionJess Cartner-Morley‘s editDressesWomen's topsWomen's shoesAccessoriesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hear, hear, as the Windsors might sayTue 1 Apr 2025 08.11 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 15.25 EDTShareStraight faces, please, as we try to look charitably at the toxic row engulfing Prince Harry’s charity. Are you up to speed with this everyday story of giving folk? I’m in such a muddle with it all that I can’t remember if I’m allowed to say that purely from my observations of her telly interviews, Sentebalechair Sophie Chandaukadoes seem like a right old loose cannon.But I’m getting ahead of myself, so let’s do a quick recap. Sentebale is a charity to help children and young people with HIV and Aids in Lesotho and Botswana, and wasset up almost two decadesago by Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, in honour of their mothers. Its current chair isChandauka, a Zimbabwean lawyer, and something about her stewardship of the charity has provoked its entire board of trustees to judge that their relationship has broken down irretrievably. Accordingly, they have all resigned. Chandauka in turn has said that the charity was riddled with “poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny [and] misogynoir”, and accused Prince Harry of “harassment and bullying at scale”.Oh dear. As I say, she does seem like quite hard work. Poor Prince Harry. It must be difficult having something you’ve served as a custodian of for a long time, only for some publicity-incontinent member of it to go on a full-spectrum media rampage, airing a load of dirty linen, but leaving you feeling like you have to bite your tongue because you can’t really win against the specific typesof identity-based accusationsthey’re making against you. In fact, saying anything at all will probably just make it all worse and ensure it goes on for much longer. At present, Prince Harry has kept a stiff upper lip and declined to complain or explain, but it’s possible that at some point he’s going to have to offer a concisely delphic statement in an attempt to draw a line under the whole business. Impossible to pluck the perfect phrase out of the air, of course, but I’d go with something like “recollections may vary”.And in case that wasn’t clear, in the interests not of balance, but of accuracy, we do have to state that Prince Harry seems like quite hard work, too.Likewise, his wife.Meanwhile, it goes without saying that despite its brevity, the above paragraph will serve as the twat-signal to the so-called “Sussex Squad”, a hilarious cavalcade of single-issue human beings who patrol the internet round the clock, policing any and all criticism of theMontecito millionaire couplewho ironically need expensive security in part to deal with nutjob fans like them. I mean, I’m paraphrasing, but only vaguely. The Squad also does a lot of other valuable work, like explaining that laughing at Meghan’s ridiculousNetflix lifestyle show is racist.Donors quit Prince Harry’s charity when he left UK, says Sentebale chairRead moreAnyway, because of all this, I did wonder how they would readjust themselves to the Sentebale blow-up, given that at its heart is a black woman making accusations of bullying and racism. Inevitably – and indeed amusingly – there has been a new bending of reality. Humans, particularly single-issue ones, really are so incredibly resourceful, and I’m hugely enjoying the Sussex Squad’s latest mad conspiracy theory: that Sentabale’snewest trustee, Iain Rawlinson, is someone who, between 10 and 20 years ago, served as chair of Prince William’s conservation charity, and consequently CAN ONLY BE a formal plant by Harry’s brother.The theory suggests that Rawlinson is deliberately sabotaging Sentebale and the Sussexes on the orders of the Prince of Wales. (Do I have to even run the denial here? To be clear: I imagine both Iain and the Prince of Wales would rubbish these claims.) Still, it’s some more yarn to pin up across the Squad’s investigation wall, which already resembles one of those webs spun by a spider which has ingested considerable quantities of LSD. (Again, in the interests of running comprehensive denials, I imagine the spider would rubbish that claim, and insist it had taken nothing stronger than a fly.)As for the allegations buzzingaround between the Chandauka and Sussex camps, they are becoming more gothically petty by the day, and you’d expect we haven’t heard the last of them yet. They include, but are by no means limited to: Harry writes high-handed emails; Sophie has done a predictable publicity stunt; Meghan made Sentabale lose agood price on a venue for a polo game; Meghan spent too much timetalking to her friend Serena Williamsat the polo game; Sophie wouldn’t publicly defend Meghan after some impenetrable hokey-cokey about where people were standing on a stage when the trophy for the polo game was handed out.And on it goes. It does seem absolutely mad that there is a charity to help some of the world’s poorest children living with the blight of life-threatening disease, when the true victims in all of this seem to be very senior professional or royal people who simply can’t work with each other without explosive fallouts and worldwide publicity tours. Could there not be a much more worthwhile charity set up to help all these people in positions of power and influence when things go wrong at work, instead of children who – let’s face it – aren’t subject to anything like the same pressures? Call it Sentanexplosiveinterview, and I’m sure the donations would flood right on in.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This is devastating news for people whose lives would have been changed by the guideline, such aspregnant women and mothers.The Sentencing Council’s updated “imposition of community and custodial sentences” guideline signalled a change in sentencing. It would have required magistrates and judges to consult a pre-sentence report before deciding whether to imprison someone of an ethnic or religious minority, alongside other groups including young adults, abuse survivors and mothers. It would have taken into account structural disparities in sentencing outcomes, such as thehigh risk of stillbirththat pregnant women face in prison and the damage caused by separating mothers from children. It would also have introduced measures to combat racism in courts. The UN has described our justice system assystemically racist, and a 2017 review conducted by the now minister David Lammy acknowledged its “racial bias”.The guideline was commonsense, evidence-led policy that the Sentencing Council had developed in careful consultation with criminal justice experts. England and Wales are in the grip of a prisons overcrowding crisis, overseen by a prisons minister, James Timpson, who has called for the need to “take politics out of sentencing”. In this context, you would think the government would champion these new changes, which could serve to reduce the women’s prison population in particular.Instead, the lord chancellor, Shabana Mahmood, chose to perform a populist pantomime instigated by the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick. When the Sentencing Council announced the guideline last month, Jenrick labelled it “two-tier justice”. This echoed Tommy Robinson’s “two-tier policing” slogan from last summer’s riots, which claimed that white far-right protesters were treated more harshly than ethnic minorities.View image in fullscreenProtesters outside the Royal Courts of Justice, London, 18 March 2023.Photograph: Elizabeth DalzielJenrick’s ploy to hijack the guideline is not surprising: this is the same man who resigned as immigration minister in 2023 because the Rwanda deportation scheme didn’t “go far enough”. What is truly appalling is that Mahmood decided to play along in an attempt to win over Conservative and Reform UK voters.The number one rule of political communications is that you don’t repeat your opposition’s framing, even to refute it. Repeating the right’s slogans only reinforces its power. Mahmood’s response that “there will never be a two-tier sentencing approach under my watch” was foolish and dangerous. Instead of challenging the dog-whistle slogan, she legitimised it, which then triggered its repetition across the press. When the Sentencing Council stuck to its guns, Mahmood threatened to pass emergency legislation to overrule it. The council, browbeaten, suspended the implementation of the guideline.It is infuriating to see another Labour government seek to appease a rightwing voter base by reinforcing the “tough on crime” doom loop that has gridlocked our justice system for the past 30 years. It was New Labour’s punitive posturing that drove up the prison population by 40% between 1997 and 2010. Feverishly trumpeting law and order, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown collectively introduced more than 3,500 new criminal offences, and courts began to hand down increasingly longer – and indefinite in the case of theIPP scandal– sentences that have directly contributed to the prisons overcrowding crisis we see today. England and Wales have thehighest incarceration ratein western Europe. The statistics are clear: prison creates more problems than it solves.Yet political debates on criminal justice issues are never about the facts; they are opportunities for political parties to score points against each other. This is a trend known as “penal populism”, which the government’s own independent sentencing review has cited as the main driver of our dangerously overcrowded prisons. Political grandstanding on criminal justice is one of Labour’s trademarks, but Mahmood’s readiness to perform on the populist stage is a new low.Janey Starling is the co-director of gender justice campaign group Level UpDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

How realistic is the prospect of Trump 3.0?Tue 1 Apr 2025 08.41 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 13.58 EDTShareHell is empty and all the devils are in Washington DC. And, what with devils being immortal and all, it looks as if they might stay there indefinitely. Now, before I seamlessly segue from fun devil facts into talking about Donald Trumpthreatening to run for a third term, the current political climate compels me to make a few things clear. I recently had to submit my US green card for renewal (impeccable timing!) so I’d like to explain to any United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers reviewing my file that the first line of this piece was justriffing on Shakespeare. I’m absolutely not comparing Trump, the greatest man to walk this Earth, to Satan. Nor am I suggesting evil people seem to live long lives.On the contrary, I am thrilled that our 78-year-old president has suggested he is looking into “methods” that will allow him to serve this wonderful country longer. And it’s a shame my enthusiasm isn’t universally shared. I mean, to quote JD Vance (who is up there next to Shakespeare in the words department), have any Trump detractors SAID THANK YOU ONCE? Trump could be relaxing with his billions; he could be playing golf every day. Instead, the poor man only gets to play golf every few days –costing taxpayers millions of dollars– and has to spend most of his time sorting out the US. The economy doesn’t just crash itself, you know? So thank you, Mr President. Thank you, thank you, thank you.But, look, while I’m obviously overjoyed by the idea that our esteemed leader might stick around far longer than norms, conventions and the constitution allow, just how realistic a prospect is Trump 3.0? The president has insisted he is “not joking” about seeking a third term in office, but is all this talk just a tactic to distract us from what he is getting up to in his current term?Obviously, I can’t tell you what goes on in the murky depths of Trump’s mind. But I can tell you this: Trump has no regard for norms or laws, and will do whatever he wants if he thinks he can get away with it.Perhaps the better question to ask isn’t whether Trump is serious about extending his rule, but – should he seek a third term – who might stop him? Unless they all get spine transplants, the Democrats aren’t going to put up a fight. Want to know what Kamala Harris is doing now? Getting ready to speak at areal estate conference in Australia. It’s obviously not Harris’s job to safeguard US democracy but, after raising enormous amounts of money from regular people who believed in her campaign promises, you would think she might care a little more about the optics.As for Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader – the person whose job it actually is to represent the opposition – his strategy for dealing with Trump appears to be to give Republicanswhatever they wantand hope that, somehow, this turns out badly for them. It’s not surprising then, that arecent surveyshowed 70% of Democratic voters gave the party’s response to Trump a “C” grade or below.It is not just the Democrats who appear to have capitulated to Trump: a number of big legal firms have also bowed down to the president’s efforts to get them to comply with hisinterpretation of the law. Elite universities such as Columbia Universityhave also caved in to Trump’s demands. Even the White House Correspondents’ Associationjust cancelledan appearance by an anti-Trump comedian in an attempt to stay on the president’s good side. And, as we all know, Silicon Valley has beenbending the knee toTrump for months.Meanwhile, as any opposition to Trump seems to evaporate, Elon Musk is running around handing out checks to voters in Wisconsin in what many critics have characterised as an attempt to influence thestate’s supreme court election. Even if Trump doesn’t go for a third term, even if the Democrats win the next election, the US’s descent into techno-authoritarianism isn’t going to be easily reversed. Not, to be clear to any USCIS officers reading this, that I’m complaining. Not little old me! I’m renaming my daughter Donalda, getting a Tesla tattoo, and cheering as all my rights are systematically taken away.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsJD VanceRepublicansTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Different iterations of the fabled spring – which is said to give anyone who drinks or bathes in its waters the power to defy ageing – have echoed across cultures for thousands of years.In the modern age, this quest for youthfulness is known as “biohacking” – where individuals take a do-it-yourself approach to enhance their biology, often through supplements – and the latest trend is NAD boosters.Ever since Kendall Jenner and Hailey Biebertook IV drips with NAD in an episode of The Kardashians, influencers on TikTok and Instagram have followed suit, telling their followers NAD boosters will“literally give you the fountain of youth … you will stop ageing in its tracks”, in addition to other claimed benefits such as boosting energy and improving hair, skin and metabolic function.But do any of these claims stack up or are we still in the realm of myth?What is NAD?NAD (also referred to as NAD+ and short for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a naturally occurring molecule involved in more than 500 different reactions in the body, including energy generation, explains Prof Nigel Turner, the head of the Cellular Bioenergetics Laboratory at the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute.Anti-ageing jabs – they can rejuvenate mice, but will they work on humans?Read moreMore recently – in the last 25 years – it has become apparent the molecule also has really critical functions in ageing, Turner says.“The whole hype around the NAD boosting therapies is the fact that there’s pretty good scientific evidence that as we age … the levels of NAD decline, and so the efficiency of all these pathways and reactions within the body declines, because the levels naturally drop with ageing,” Turner says.What does the evidence say?NAD boosting therapies have been marketed in the form of pills, shots and IV infusions. They are selling manufactured supplements of the nicotinamide precursor compounds that can be converted into NAD. The two primary versions marketed are nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide riboside (NR).Prof David Vaux, a molecular biologist and honorary fellow of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, said while a number of labs are promoting them as treatments for ageing, “in my opinion, it’s way too early. I haven’t seen convincing evidence that they prolong life span in animal models, and I certainly wouldn’t take any myself until they’d been proven to work, be safe and efficacious in a properly run, double-blind placebo-controlled human trial.”Turner says while studies in mice and pre-clinical models have shown the replenishment of NAD is associated with changes in the way cells function, better metabolic health and some anti-ageing effects, the evidence of the translation of that research into humans is in its infancy.“What comes through in the limited amount of studies that have been done in humans, is that it appears that giving these supplements to already healthy or relatively healthy people is not going to do too much because your body’s already got enough.”However, of the already limited studies, those that have shown some benefits tend to be in overweight and older populations, where the NAD levels may be compromised a bit more, he says.Quick GuideWhat is your age mindset?ShowScientists have developed various measures to assess people’s perceptions of ageing – which may be evident in many different beliefs. Here are a few examples:1Do things get better, worse or stay the same as you get older?2In each pair of the following words, which one do you associate with retirement and beyond: uninvolved or involved; unable or able; dependent or independent; idle or busy?3When does middle age end and old age begin?If you answered “better” or “the same” on (1) and “involved”, “able”, “independent” and “busy” on (2), you are more likely to experience better health as you age.On question (3), people who believe old age starts at a later point – over 70 years – live longer than people who believe that old age starts at 60 or younger.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.What’s Vegemite got to do with it?The body already has a series of pathways that allow for the constant maintenance or replenishment of the NAD that’s being broken down all the time, including through our diets, Turner says.Vitamin B, specifically vitamin B3 (which is found in Vegemite, among other food sources) is also a precursor, one of these pathways that eventually lead to the formation of NAD, he says.What do the experts think?Vaux stresses that the Therapeutic Goods Administration has two kinds of approval: medicines are either registered (when a drug is proved to be effective for treating certain conditions) or they are listed (which means it is safe but there is no evidence it works). Only the second kind of TGA approval has been given for any NAD boosters, he says, “but the people marketing them don’t make that distinction. They just say ‘approved by the TGA’ and trick people into thinking that they actually work.”‘It’s not ethical and it’s not medical’: how UK rehab clinics are cashing in on NAD+Read moreA/Prof Lindsay Wu runs the Laboratory forAgeingResearch at the University of New South Wales. Wu is also the founder of a company developing NAD precursors and trying to establish efficacy for specific conditions and diseases, as well as safety.“We don’t yet have that data, whether there is truly these massive effects,” Wu says. However, “a lot of the people who are taking these NAD precursors are in fact young, healthy people [or] middle-aged people. The whole concept of doing this is to replace NAD levels when they get low – but fit healthy people don’t need this … Their NAD levels are already going to be very high.”Eating a healthy diet and doing exercise have been associated with boosting NAD levels, Turner says. However, he stresses that the best evidence for promoting longevity comes back to a healthy lifestyle, including not smoking or drinking excessively.“People seem to want to be able to do all of those things and then just take a pill that will overcome it,” he says.“I still hold great hope that [NAD is] going to be a pathway that will have some benefit, but it’s not going to meet the claims that you see online. It’s not going to take a person who’s got grey hair and turns them back into a 20-year-old.”Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporterAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsAsk AntiviralWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Doubling council tax on holiday homes in England is a sensible, revenue-raising policy for communities in serious needTue 1 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 08.07 EDTShareShould you have the world’s tiniest violin to hand, prepare to play it. This week, English councils gain the power todouble council tax on second homes, and the holiday-cottage-owning classes are fuming. “Nothing but a racket,” thundered the Daily Telegraph, dismissing a supposedly “vindictive” raid on weekenders that was (gasp) “socialist” to boot.Its Sunday sister paper further tugged on readers’ heartstrings with tales of homeowners who hadinherited a second placesomewhere lovely from their parents, and bridled at being asked to pay a few thousand pounds more a year to keep it in the family. In the Times, a retired barrister who felt forced togive up the seaside padshe had bought in her mother’s native St Davids complained of the tax “destroying generations of community-building”, as though houses sitting empty all winter were the one thing really guaranteed to bring a thriving community together. To which one can only say: people, learn to read a room(s). You’ve certainly got enough of them.A little weekend bolthole by the sea is, of course, the dream for many, but therein lies the clue. It’s a luxury, a nice-to-have, a signifier of good fortune and plenty in a world of such scarcity that millions of people can’t see how they are ever going to own one measly home, never mind two. Shrieking in horror when asked to pay a bit morefor the privilege, at a time when benefits for disabled people are apparently considered a reckless national extravagance, wins roughly as many friends “in the village” as did second-homers stealthily decamping there from Covid-riddled London on the eve of lockdown with a cough.Places where grockles have long rubbed along more or less tolerably for generations with locals who are well aware that they rely on tourism for a living – from the Cotswolds to the Lakes to those Cornish villages where every house seems to have a telltale key safe by the front door – are visibly tipping over into something much more dystopian. One recent survey in Devon found seaside hotspots where more thanthree-quarters of propertieswere holiday homes. That’s no longer really a village in anything but name: more a giant deconstructed hotel complex, offering tourists the chance to scroll through a bewildering choice of holiday rentals every August while working people are forced further and further from where they grew up.View image in fullscreenSince April 2023, local authorities in Wales have had the powers to introduce higher discretionary council tax premiums on second homes and long-term empty properties – up to 300%.Photograph: Phil Rees/Athena PicturesIt is not just buying that has become impossible. Renters live in fear of having to move, because what were once long-term permanent landlords have long switched to more lucrative short lets via Airbnb, leaving precious little on the market. In coastal north Norfolk, whereone in 10 propertiesis a holiday home, thecouncil’s spendingon temporary bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless families has more than quadrupled in five years. Despite all this, nobody is saying peoplecan’thave a second home if they really want one – just that it’s going to cost more, which doesn’t seem enormously outrageous in the circumstances.It is true that the exact purpose of the second-homes tax – whether it’s really about cooling overheated markets and freeing up houses for locals, or more about freeing up some useful money for councils on theverge of going bust– has become suspiciously blurry. In Wales, where the idea was pioneered and billed as an answer to the chronic housing shortage in tourist traps such as Tenby in Pembrokeshire or around the national park in Eryri, thejury is still outon how many first-time buyers it is actively helping on to the ladder. Local estate agents complain of a glut of holiday homes languishing on the market because they are not what locals want: a miniature fisherman’s cottage on the harbour might be charming for a week, but real-life families would rather have a garden and a bus route than a sea view.In Cannes, I saw English councils pander to gilet-wearing property developers – at the cost of their residents | Phineas HarperRead moreBut straight house swaps from out-of-towner to local aren’t the only measure of success, if the money raised from second-homers who decide not to sell up is earmarked for good use. In Gwynedd in Wales, the council has pledged to spend the proceeds raised from its 150% hike in council tax on second homes directly ontackling homelessness. And if taxing weekenders does look to some councils like an easy way of bumping up revenue without actively outraging their own residents, given most of those paying it by definition won’t be local … well, frankly there’s nothing wrong with the idea that putting something back into the community – as second-homers often genuinely say they want to do – should mean more than occasionally popping into the pub.Hampshire has both7,000-odd second-homersin the New Forest and a£312mdeficitin its budget for the education of children with special needs. Dorset council, which is a magnet not only for weekenders but for retirees drawn to its sleepy rural and coastal towns, is struggling with a hefty social care bill and could very much do with the£8m it hopes to raisefrom owners of second homes. It’s only a drop in the ocean of need, but across local government right now every drop counts. This isn’t the politics of envy, but the politics of common sense: one of those rare times when taxes are both the price of living in a civilised society and a small step to a fairer one. That’s enough violins now.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSecond homesOpinionCouncil taxEnglandWalesPropertyLocal governmentHousingcommentShareReuse this content"

And would anyone who cared about workers hire this staff?Tue 1 Apr 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 13.31 EDTShareIf any workers are still holding on to the notion thatDonald Trumpis pro-worker or pro-union, his move last week to terminate union bargaining rights for 1 million federal workers should disabuse them of that notion. As a candidate Trump often wooed workers by promising to fight for them, but ever since he returned to the White House, he has taken dozens of anti-worker and anti-union actions.In an unprecedented anti-union action last Thursday, the president moved toend collective bargainingfor a million federal employees and scrap union contracts nearly that number, while attackingtheir unions as “hostile”merely because they were doing what unions are supposed to do: battling to save the jobs of tens of thousands of union members whom Trump and Elon Musk had summarily fired.In an era when many workers are demanding respect, Trump keeps showing disrespect toward the country’s 2.3 million federal workers. He and Musk have cavalierly fired more than 50,000 federal employees, ignoring contractual protections saying they could only be terminated for poor performance. Then Trump blamed the victims, saying, without evidence: “Many of them don’t work at all. Many of them never showed up to work.” Trump views federal employees not as dedicated workers who serve the nation’s 340 million people, but as deplorables who work for the detested deep state.Not stopping there, Trump has named several vehemently anti-union figures to be his right-hand men.Russell Vought, head of Trump’s office of management and budget, has shown true sadism toward workers. “We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,” Voughtsaid in a video disclosedby ProPublica and the research group Documented. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains … We want to put them in trauma.”Would anyone who cared an iota about workers name such a callous, anti-worker person to a top position?Then there’s the aggressively anti-union Mr Musk. Trumppraised Muskover the idea of firing striking workers, an action that is illegal and would go far to cripple labor’s most powerful weapon: the strike. Musk has become a pariah in Scandinavia for his extreme anti-union animus: Tesla hasrefused to recognize a union there– something that virtually all Scandinavian corporations do. Like Trump, Musk has a penchant for disrespecting workers, repeatedly tarring federal employees as being guilty of “waste, fraud and abuse”. Last week on Fox News, Musk insulted the intelligence of federal workers by falselysaying: “Basically almost no one [no federal employee] has gotten fired.”Again, would anyone who cared a whit about workers and unions tap Musk for such a powerful position?One has to strain to think of even one or two pro-worker or pro-union moves that Trump has takenTrump’s first two months back in office have been filled with anti-worker and anti-union actions. In an unseemly move, the Trump administrationcalled on federal workersto snitch on each other, to report on co-workers who promote diversity and inclusion. Trump fired Gwynne Wilcox, the acting chair of the National Labor Relations Board –a move she says is illegal– leaving the board without a quorum to penalize employers that break the law when fighting against unionization. Trumpalso firedthe NLRB’s vigorously pro-union general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, and wants to replace her with a management-side lawyer whose firm represents many anti-union companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.Trump, the supposed champion of workers, has done little to raise workers’ wages. As in his first term, he’s done zilch to increase the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at a shockingly low $7.25 an hour for 15 years. He also rescinded Joe Biden’s order securing a$17.75-an-hour minimum wagefor federal contractors. As a candidate Trump wooed tipped workers by vowing to end the income tax on employee tips, but he has failed to get the House budget bill to end that tax, although that bill tentatively includes Trump’sidea not to tax overtime pay.Labor leaders have denounced Trump’s order to gut union bargaining for 1 million workers. Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, called Trump’s actions “the biggest assault on collective bargaining rightswe have ever seen in this country”. Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said Trump’s order was “a disgraceful and retaliatory attackon the rights of hundreds of thousands of patriotic American civil servants – nearly one-third of whom are veterans – simply because they are members of a union that stands up to his harmful policies”.Anti-union CEOs and ideologues will no doubt applaud Trump’s order. By targeting unionization among 1 million workers, Trump aims to weaken the nation’s 14-million-member labor movement. If successful, his move would end bargaining for those 1 million workers, holding down employee pay and thereby making more money available for Trump’s tax cuts for the rich.Want to defeat Trump? Support unions | Eric BlancRead moreRepublican lawmakers will love Trump’s move because it undermines a key financial pillar for the Democrats. Half of US union members are government employees, and their unions are often major funders of Democratic candidates. Trump certainly knows that – 10 minutes after the supreme court issued itsJanus decisionin 2018, ruling that no federal, state or local government employee can be required to pay union dues, Trump tweeted“big loss for the coffersof the Democrats!” Trump’s new executive order will further skew a huge imbalance: Open Secrets, a research group that tracks political contributions, found that in the 2024 election cycle, businessout-donated unions by 16 to one. Corporations donated $6.1bn to unions’ $264m, which is less than the gazillionaire Musk gave all by himself.Trump also won over many workers by vowing to cut prices. Not only did he vow to cut egg prices, he boldly said he’dcut auto insurance pricesandenergy pricesin half. But Trump has totally failed to do any of that. Moreover, his 25% auto tariff will cause auto prices to soar.One has to strain to think of even one or two pro-worker or pro-union moves that Trump has taken. The White House says his tariffs are pro-worker and pro-union, insisting they will bring back manufacturing jobs. But many economists say Trump’s tariffs will hurt myriad industries and workers. His auto tariffs, for instance, will increase car prices and as a result, auto sales, auto production and auto jobswill decline, at least short-term. Not only that, other countries’ retaliation will pummel various US industries and trigger additional layoffs. Moreover, Trump’s tariffs will undermine GDP growth and perhaps push the US into recession. Bottom line: Trump remains obsessed with tariffs, even though they’re likely to result inmore pain than gainfor US workers.When it comes to worker issues, Trump resembles the emperor in the famous fairytale: he sees himself wearing magnificent union-made clothes covered with buttons containing pro-worker slogans. But more and more Americans realize that when it comes to helping workers, Trump is like Hans Christian Andersen’s emperor: his nakedness is showing.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS unionsUS politicsElon MuskTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

But as a fellow Scot, I know the answer isn’t to ‘Englify’ ourselvesTue 1 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 12.49 EDTShareThe worst job I had was in a bank in Sydney, dealing with a life insurance policy called Lite Life Direct. It was tedious, repetitive and oddly stressful, and involved a lot of time on the phone. What made the situation particularly frustrating was that almost no one could understand my Scottish accent.“Lite Life Direct,” I would say, three, sometimes four times down the line to no avail. Then I would cave: “Loight Loif Direct.” With my faux-Australian pronunciation, suddenly me and the caller would be simpatico.This was all the more enraging because I am Australian. I was born in Sydney and spent the early part of my childhood there. My mother and I emigrated from Sydney to Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire. As a child, living in a strange country and desperate to fit in with new schoolmates, I changed my accent unwittingly. But when I returned to my home town as an adult, my adopted accent made me a stranger.Accents are curious and fascinating things. To the listener, they say everything about us and yet absolutely nothing; change some vowel sounds and you can masquerade as an entirely different person. So I feel somesympathy for Gary Caldwell, manager of Exeter City FC, who was sent from the dugout for his behaviour towards the fourth official. The referee found him to be aggressive and showed him a red card.Caldwell, a former Scotland defender and Celtic captain, was not known for such pugnacity when playing north of the border. He puts his newfound rough reputation down to one thing: his Scottish accent. “I didn’t swear, I didn’t run, in my opinion I wasn’t aggressive,”he told the BBC. “My accent and my Scottishness is aggressive.”However,Caldwell suggestshis disciplinary record will improve if he endeavours to sound a little bit more “Englified”. I’d like to know what Caldwell means, exactly, by “Englified”. Soft, seems to be the assertion. Relatable, maybe.To a fellow Scot, Caldwell’s excuse is a nonsense. He’s from douce Stirling. It’s hardly the cut-throat razor tones of a Glasgow East End accent or a guttural Lanarkshire growl, in which a sincere “I love you” sounds more threat than declaration.But it is true that English-to-Scottish accent bias is a problem. Edinburgh University is shortly tohold a conferenceon “linguistic discrimination” to tackle anti-Scottish accent prejudice on campus. The majority of Edinburgh undergraduates – more than 70% – either come from England, the rest of the UK or overseas, while those who went to private school make up 40% of the intake from UK institutions. Scots students report routine snobbery andridicule from classmates.Perceived aggression may be Caldwell’s concern, but it is only one trope. A study last year found that Scots are used in television adverts to depict working-class characters or thosetight with money. Though it could be worse. “If you want somebody to be a little bit thick, West Country accents,” one advertising exec told researchers. “If you want to signify dirty-handed working class, stick a Brummie in it.”This anti-Scots bias in England extends to the arts. One of theall-time great case studiesis that of Gavin Bain and Billy Boyd. The Dundee college students had designs on becoming hip-hop stars but found their fledgling musical careerstymied by their Scottish accents.The lads, mocked by London record company executives, decided topretend to be from Californiaand restyled themselves as hip-hop duo Silibil N’ Brains. The quick death of their Scottish accents resulted in a £100,000 record deal, an MTV appearance and a support slot for Eminem. Sadly, the ruse went awry when Bain and Boyd found keeping up their California twang too onerous and they returned to their Dundonian speech patterns.The English arts scene is, according to many a Scottish creative, a generally hostile space for our accents. ActorAlan Cumming complainedof “insidious and subliminal racism” faced by Scots who work in London, particularly in comparison to the warm welcome afforded in the US. Similarly, the Scottish director Lynne Ramsayreflected: “I always feel as soon as [the English] hear a Scottish accent, they’re backing away.”Caldwell has not done the situation any favours. It’s one thing for others to claim his Scottish accent is perceived as aggressive, but the football manager has gone two steps further by saying his accentisaggressive. Maybe he’s internalised the negative perceptions the English feel against a Scots brogue, but he should set an example and refuse to modify his speech.It’s self-defeating to tackle prejudice by removing the target for discrimination. A Scottish accent’s melody and charm is a beautiful thing. It’s not incumbent on us to change our tongue; it’s on English ears to change the way they listen.Catriona Stewart is a Glasgow-based journalist and broadcaster specialising in politics and home affairsExplore more on these topicsScotlandOpinionLanguagecommentShareReuse this content"

But he appears to embody the French philosopher’s claim that “politics is the continuation of war by other means”. Nowhere is this more apparent than in his fondness for tariffs. He presents taxing foreign imports as a way torebuildthe American economy in favour of blue-collar workers left behind by free trade and globalisation. Yet he plainly thinks that politics is not about truth or justice. It is about leverage and supremacy.Britain is learning first-hand that Mr Trump, with his us-versus-them framing and taste for spectacle, is an accidentalFoucauldian– using tariffs as tools of loyalty and dominance, even against allies. If Mr Trump follows through on his threat to impose a20% tariffon all imports, UK growth will suffer. The effect depends on the response. No British retaliation would mean GDP0.4% lowerthis year and 0.6% next. A global trade war would push that to 0.6% and 1%. Either outcome would wipe out the government’s fiscal headroom. But while British policymakers fret over the shrinkingmarginsof fiscal rules, Mr Trump sees no need to cloak power in objectivity.His rationale for imposing tariffs is confused. But two things appear to be driving this. One is his self-styled image as the ultimatedealmaker; the man who can turn any situation to his advantage. The other is his view of politics as a means for structuring society to favour one group over another – not just economically, but in terms of legitimacy and who defines reality. Tariffs will probably be lifted if nations accede to Mr Trump’s wishes and, in doing so, reward politically usefulconstituencies, big tech allies or his wealthydonors.All three are visible in a paper-thin UK–US “economic deal”, likely to result in the lifting of Trump’s tariffs – if the US signs it. It, reportedly, would further open British markets to US agribusiness; end thedigital services tax, which applies to companies such as Amazon andGoogle; and make it difficult to holdAI companies, like those owned by Mr Trump’s ally Elon Musk, liable for harm. The danger is that whenever there’s a grievance, Mr Trumpthreatens tariffs– then offers to lift them if you do what he wants.It’s even more blatant with the EU, which isexpectedto fine Apple and Meta under its digital competition rules. After backing Mr Trump early, Meta’sMark Zuckerbergis now calling in a favour – urging the administration to fold his fight with Brussels into the tariff plans, casting regulation as just another front in the trade war.What makes Mr Trump’s “Liberation Day” so dangerous is its scale. In 2024, the US ran a $1.2tn trade goods deficit. Only two months from his White House return, Mr Trump has imposedtariffson goods from Canada, Mexico, China, all steel and aluminium imports, and foreign cars and auto parts. Next up:friendsin Asia, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, India and Vietnam.What emerges is less trade policy than performance politics – where coercion, loyalty and theatre converge. This isFoucaultnot in footnotes but in action: power exercised not through rules, but through disruption and dealmaking that rewards fealty and punishes defiance. Britain, like others, is navigating a battlefield. The US president is no student of Foucault but he seems to grasp the lesson. For him, war isn’t the alternative to politics. It is politics.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A 2018 power-sharing deal between President Salva Kiir and Riek Machar, the first vice-president, put an end to five years of fighting. But last week’s arrest of Mr Machar effectively ended that agreement, his party says. The United Nationswarnsthat his house arrest, along with mounting military clashes and reports of attacks on civilians, has brought a fragile peace closer to collapse, posing a direct threat to millions.The fear is not just of a battle between factions, but ofethnic cleansing and civilian massacres. Political violence in South Sudan has previously descended into intercommunal conflict between the Dinka ethnic group (to which Mr Kiir belongs) and the Nuer (to which Mr Machar belongs).The civil war killed 400,000 people and displaced almost a third of the 11 million population. About two‑thirds live in extreme poverty, and the World Banksaysthat almost all the rest are only one shock away from poverty. Theaxing of US aidand last month’s punishing heatwave have exacerbated this dire situation.The spiralling war in the country’s neighbour, Sudan, had already caused thecollapse of its oil exports, cutting state revenues by about two-thirds and reducing Mr Kiir’s ability to fund his patronage network, as well as resulting in a wave of refugees. Renewed conflict in South Sudan might well merge withthat war. There are suspicions that the Sudanese army may have sent military supplies to Nuer militias, hoping to wrest control of the border area back from its Rapid Support Forces rivals.The rivalry between the president and vice-president never went away. But tensionshave been rising. Elections due to take place last year – which would have been the country’s first national polls – were deferred until 2026. Then, in February, Mr Kiir sacked two other vice-presidents and promoted his adviser Benjamin Bol Mel, who isnow seen as his preferred successor. Some think that the 73-year-old’s priority is keeping Mr Machar from the top spot; others that he hopes disgruntled figures in his own orbit will be unified by turning upon Mr Machar, whom he accuses of trying to depose him.Mr Machar had also accused the army of attacking his forces. Shortly afterwards, the White Army, a Nuer militia aligned with Mr Machar, launched attacks against the country’s army in Upper Nile state. Government counterstrikes, reportedly including theuse of barrel bombs, followed. Several of Mr Machar’s key allies werealso arrested.Uganda, which backs Mr Kiir, recently said it had deployed troops to South Sudan’s capital, Juba, though its governmentdeniesthis. Kenya’s president, William Ruto, is playing a more useful role by attempting to mediate. South Africa and Ethiopia also have a history of interceding, but both are preoccupied at present. The west has shown little interest.The release of Mr Machar, an end to fighting and a recommitment of all parties to the 2018 agreement are needed. Without those steps, the best hope is that the UN peacekeeping force for South Sudan is able to create safe zones to protect civilians. How effective those will prove, if war rages, is hard to say. The African Union’s decision tosend high-level mediatorsis welcome: Mr Ruto cannot fix this problem alone. Others must join him in attempting to end this crisis before it spins out of control.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

His contention that the end result might be a better US, however, is beyond contrarian (27 March).In rejecting his argument, I would cite the work of several American commentators and academics: the constitutional and legal expertsMarc Eliasand Joyce Vance, the widely acclaimed historiansTimothy SnyderandHeather Cox Richardson, and the Yale philosopherJason Stanleyare all full of apprehension for the future of the country they love. None suggests an upside; all anticipate a long and difficult fight. The risk is existential.To take two examples of how serious the challenge to American democracy is, I would draw attention to Mr Trump’s relentless efforts atvoter suppressionand the willingness of his officials both to break the law and todisobey direct judicial instructions. Beyond this, there is the trashing of decades-old alliances, the coddling of Vladimir Putin, the betrayal of Ukraine, the ludicrous appointments, the barefaced lying, the reduction of politics to spectacle and the full-frontal assault on the structures of the federal state. So no, I find it impossible to see how any of this will have the positive outcome Mr Jenkins anticipates.John BaileyFarnborough, HampshireMark Zuckerberg may have said “move fast and break things” years ago, but he did not break organisations, government departments or the lives of impoverished peoples. He broke concepts, and did no damage. Elon Musk is trying tobreak organisationsthat provide food and medical aid to extremely poor people. There are ways to improve organisations, but using a chainsaw and wholesale sackings are not the answers.Simon Jenkins writes: “The US may review its role in the world, ... revert to being … another nation among nations.” That seems very admirable, butDonald Trumpis not doing that. Trump wants to put the US above other nations, using its economic and military power, and if others let him, he will take what he wants. He sees Putin as somebody in his own mould.Yes, Russia is obsessed with its frontier states, yet it has to accept that it can’t rule over people who by misfortune border its land. The Baltic states,Ukraineand others want freedom, and we in western Europe and others believe we have to help them in that desire.Jeffrey FrankelLisbon, PortugalSimon Jenkins optimistically proposes that Donald Trump and his fellow “playground thugs” provide necessary and overdue challenges to convention. I doubt that Jenkins’ lofty hopes are shared by the countries and individuals who will be hit hardest by Trump’s smash-and-burn approach. To give so little consideration to those losing their jobs, healthcare, aid, social security and democratic freedoms while Trump “moves fast” seems self-indulgent and shortsighted.Far from constructive movers and shakers, Trump et al may be more accurately compared to the privileged Great Gatsby characters Tom and Daisy Buchanan, who “smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money … and let other people clean up the mess they had made”. Breaking the fibre of a democratic society hurts the most vulnerable, and may take decades to repair.Dr Annie HickoxThirsk, North YorkshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

When those who commit violence are those whose role is to protect us, it is doubly shattering. We were not present when the forced entry took place, yet the manner of it leaves us with a feeling of devastation and destruction of so much of what we have created. Of course it will be argued that the invasion of the space was a necessary evil, but I have to state with force that what we now suffer is real hurt, whereas the prevention of resistance inLondonis harm as yet not done.While I have plenty of sympathy with the impossible, and quite likely painful, decision made by the police, places of real quiet and sanctuary are deeply needed in our society, and their invasion cannot be passed off as a necessary evil. Violence is violence, whoever commits it, and there is real loss here, real suffering, and real grief.Colum HaywardBarnes, LondonThe fact that I am in the House of Lords is undoubtedly linked to attending a Quaker school for seven years, where the notions of public service, non-violence and a belief in community were a paramount theme running through school life and lessons. Quakers have been at the forefront of many radical changes for the better, such as abolition of slavery and prison reform. The Youth Demand members who were the subject of a police raid continue a tradition.This Labour government must not continue down the repressive route of the last government. We must take the opportunity to roll back the excesses of thePolice, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022and the Public Order Act 2023.Sue MillerLiberal Democrat, House of LordsI suggest that Youth Demand hold their next meeting in Canterbury Cathedral. The optics of the agents of the crown forcing their way into that place of worship might be too much, even in these benighted days.Alastair CameronEdinburghHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It was mainly release. The three months without Saka have been hard, ­Arsenal’sPremier Leaguetitle challenge slipping away as he recovered from a ruptured hamstring.There was certainly a script to be written and, Saka being Saka, he set about it.Arsenalhave an incredible home record in the league against Fulham – 24 wins, seven draws and no defeats before this. They were on their way to another victory thanks to Mikel Merino’s heavily deflected goal on 37 minutes, the latest return from the club’s makeshift No 9.‘Four players in one week’: Arteta rues Arsenal’s injury nightmare at the backRead moreSaka brought the house down. It was Gabriel Martinelli, so fast and purposeful throughout, who ignited the move and when he got the ball back from Merino, the flick was improvised but made to measure for you-know-who. Saka’s header was true. Welcome back, Bukayo. And just in time for the Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid. The first leg is here next Tuesday.It was not all roses for Arsenal. They could shrug off Fulham’s late revival, as Marco Silva’s team pulled a goal back in stoppage time through Rodrigo Muniz, who was on as a substitute. The striker had missed a glorious headed chance on 81 minutes while anotherFulhamsubstitute, Ryan Sessegnon, went close before the end of regulation time. Muniz scored after a Sessegnon run and with a deflection off William Saliba. Arsenal wobbled and yet a Fulham equaliser would have been too much.What left rather more of a mark on Arsenal’s evening were the injuries that forced off Gabriel Magalhães and Jurriën Timber. With Riccardo Calafiori sustaining a knee problem in the international break with Italy and Ben White feeling pain in his knee, Mikel Arteta is facing a defensive injury crisis at the worst moment.Gabriel had turned on the afterburners in the 13th minute when Adama Traoré surged upfield on a Fulham break only to feel ­something pop. He soon realised he could not continue. As one hamstring repairs, another goes. Gabriel’s replacement, Jakub Kiwior, endured a few anxious moments and it was easy to imagine that Kylian Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior would be taking note.Timber’s problems started when he moved to block a Raúl Jiménez shot on the half-hour and appeared to be caught by the Fulham striker’s follow through. He battled on only to depart towards the end, Arteta ­saying the issue was to do with his knee.It was a night when Arteta was never going to risk Saka from the start. Still, there was no mistaking the buzz that his presence brought. The announcement of Saka’s name before kick-off drew a guttural roar. There was warm applause from the home crowd when he made his first warm-up run along the touchline on 24 minutes.The Arsenal support also chanted their old song about Saka and Emile Smith Rowe, who was back at his old club in Fulham colours. But there was not much else for them to cheer in the first-half until Merino did it again, forcing the breakthrough, albeit with a dollop of fortune.View image in fullscreenGabriel Magalhães is a huge doubt for Arsenal’s first leg against Real Madrid next Tuesday after he was forced off in the first half.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPASilva has made Fulham a tough nut to crack. His team do not concede many shots. He set them up with three centre-halves here, the formation was 5-4-1 against the ball and Arsenal struggled to create, despite Martinelli’s best efforts. The first half was coming to an end when Ethan Nwaneri finally got in behind, making a run off Antonee Robinson and on to Timber’s cute pass.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also made a sweet connection on a volley in the 22nd minute from a Martinelli cross only for it to be too close to Bernd Leno. Now, he went inside for Merino but his teammate looked to be surrounded.All Merino could do was jab a shot towards the near post that Leno seemed to have covered, especially as it lacked power. Which was when fate intervened, the ball hitting Jorge Cuenca and flying into the other corner. It was Merino’s fifth goal in eight games since his move to centre-forward.Silva was upset at how flat his team were in attacking terms before the interval and he refused to blame a hangover from the FA Cup defeat at home against Crystal Palace on ­Saturday. But Fulham were better in the second-half, Jiménez slicing up the inside right to work David Raya and Traoré robbing Kiwior before dragging wide.Arsenal had their moments, too. Martin Ødegaard flickered. Timber blasted at Leno. Martinelli wowed with some of his incisions.And then came Saka.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

This time the subject was Anthony Elanga, who tore up the City Ground turf, eating up 85 metres in nine exhilarating seconds, to score the only goal of the game against his former club and maintain Forest’s unlikely push to qualify for the Champions League.The other moment that Forest may look back on as pivotal if they go on to earn a place in the game’s grandest club competition arrived six minutes and 18 seconds into stoppage time. Harry Maguire, thrown up front as an unconventional striker, a needs-must move by Ruben Amorim, prodded the ball goalwards but Murillo hacked it off the line with almost the last kick of the game. A few seconds later, with Forest’s first league double over United since 1991-92, when Brian Clough was in charge, secured, Rockin’ All Over the World blared over the speakers and the locals set off a round of fireworks that soared into the sky above Trent Bridge.Nuno Espírito Santo, the Forest head coach who has levered this side into the elite, shut his eyes as he relived the clearance. “It was huge for us, better than a goal, wasn’t it?“We were against the ropes but it was about heart, belief. I’m very, very proud of the players. When you don’t have energy, we have to have belief. What can I do to stop the ball going in the net? It’s a good example of the dedication and the commitment of the players.” This was another victory for Forest’s rearguard. Nikola Milenkovic and Morato, on as a substitute, both wellied the ball clear to huge cheers late on.Saka’s magic Arsenal return does for Fulham but Gabriel injury casts shadowRead moreAs Murillo fell to his knees to pray inside the six-yard box at the final whistle, a queue of teammates waited to embrace him. The last Forest player off the pitch was Yates, who joined the club aged eight and has played in the top five divisions of the pyramid, and is now dreaming of mixing it with European heavyweights. Forest are third, 10 points clear of Newcastle, who are sixth with two games in hand. Yates came out on top of a feud with Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho’s frustration was typified by his booking for booting the ball away in the second half, with United short of anything resembling attacking bite.Diogo Dalot sent a first-half header against the woodwork and Mason Mount, on as a substitute, went close on his first appearance since December but, incredibly, the wait for Amorim’s side to earn back-to-back league wins goes on. “You’re not famous any more,” the Forest supporters sang and while that may not be true it was another sobering reminder of United’s current state.Forest were, understandably, in a boisterous mood long before a ball was kicked but when the action began the home fans were quick to recognise their latest feat: reaching the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time since 1991. “We’re going to Wembley,” was the chant that initially filled the cool Trent air.View image in fullscreenForest’s Matz Sels hugs Murillo after the match.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersUnited registered the first shot, Fernandes springing an effort on Matz Sels in the Forest goal and the subsequent corner proved the unlikely platform for Elanga’s fifth‑minute strike. Yates cleared a recycled Fernandes cross with a booming header and the ball looped over the referee, Jarred Gillett, and bounced about 10 yards outside the Forest 18-yard box. Elanga stormed on to the ball, controlling it with his studs and then advanced at speed, using both feet to keep the ball close.He flew past halfway with Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho in pursuit. Garnacho slid in to snatch possession but ended up on his backside and Dorgu struggled to stay on his tail. Noussair Mazraoui was torn between pressuring Elanga and backpedalling. The run of Morgan Gibbs‑White, to Elanga’s left, helped frazzle United.By the time Dorgu went to ground it was too late as Elanga drove into the widening gap between Mazraoui and Dorgu and sent a low left-foot shot into the corner. Elanga started his run inside the Forest box, quickly reading the fallout of Yates’s headed clearance, but took just two touches inside the Forest half before motoring upfield. Yates laughed at being informed he was credited with the assist. “I headed it in the six-yard box,” he said with a smile.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rasmus Højlund arrived at half-time in place of Manuel Ugarte and Christian Eriksen replaced Casemiro approaching the hour. But United did not truly threaten until Maguire’s cameo.Forest were typically strong in defence, epitomised by Murillo’s late, late intervention. Neco Williams earlier made a superb block to thwart Garnacho late on. Yates, too, possibly made a match-winning intervention.Garnacho effortlessly took down Fernandes’s diagonal pass and set about bamboozling Yates, stepping over the ball and then jinking inside. Job done, then? Garnacho took aim but Yates flung himself at the forward’s shot, blocking the ball with his right boot.No wonder Yates celebrated with a fist pump towards the Brian Clough Stand. “Over the moon,” Nuno said after two superb wins in four days. “We are delighted.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNottingham ForestManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The conflict is recorded in our annual accounts. It is not accurate to state that there is a gap in accountability.”The DCMS said in a National Audit Office report issued last December that it did not expect to recover up to £29m of the £41.6m it had loaned to three Premiership clubs – London Irish, Wasps and Worcester – after they became insolvent.It also said it would lose out on a further £11m in interest payments connected to those loans. But it has now also been accused of being “overly optimistic” about the returns it expects on the remaining loans of over £400m. However, the DCMS maintains that it will eventually recoup most of the money it has loaned.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While their batting is not quite as strong, only one player in the championship scored more runs last year than Dean Elgar, the former South Africa captain who is back for more, and only one (of those who played more than three matches) averaged more than Jordan Cox.

Vince was their top scorer in each of the past four seasons, last year contributing 986 runs at an average of 49.3, and having also lost the bowling of Mohammad Abbas, Hampshire will need others to step up.

The latter is hoping to build on a breakthrough campaign in which he took 31 wickets before pulling a hamstring in the Hundred. Fergus O’Neill will bolster the bowling at the start of the season, and Mohammad Abbas for six games across May and September.SBPrediction7thView image in fullscreenMohammad Abbas has headed north from Hampshire.Photograph: Dave Vokes/ShutterstockSomersetCaptainLewis GregoryCoachJason KerrLast season3rdAfter a season of frustration in 2024 –Somersetcame second in both white-ball competitions and third in the championship – Somerset will look to snaffle some silverware this year, with their ranks buoyed up by the returns of Will Smeed – who unretired from red-ball cricket, declaring “it would be crazy to not want to be a part of that team” – and of Matt Henry, who had a productive six-game spell in 2023 and has signed up for the first seven matches. The New Zealander will help to balance a bowling attack with enough spin-bowling options in Jack Leach and Archie Vaughan, the 19-year-old son of Michael who took 15 wickets at 20.13 last year (11 of them in one game against Surrey, ) to do without Shoaib Bashir, who has been loaned to Glamorgan.SBPrediction2ndSurreyCaptainRory BurnsCoachGareth BattyLast season1stInevitably favourites after winning the title in each of the past three seasons – no side has won four in a row since Surrey themselves did the, er, seven-peat between 1952 and 1958 – Surrey have become a formidable machine since Gareth Batty’s appointment as coach in 2022 and don’t seem to be fading. England’s focus on high speed suggests they will choose not to steal away Surrey’s outstanding bowler, Dan Worrall, once the Australia-born seamer, who has taken 139 first-class wickets at 21.17 since he arrived at the Oval, qualifies for his adopted country this month. The arrivals of New Zealand all-rounder Nathan Smith and Matt Fisher fromYorkshirewould help to cover for the 33-year-old’s potential loss, plus Kemar Roach is back for the first four games.SBPrediction1stView image in fullscreenWill Surrey make it four in a row?Photograph: Steven Paston/PASussexCaptainJohn SimpsonCoachPaul FarbraceLast season1st Div TwoSussex are looking for evolution rather than revolution on their return to the top flight after a 10-year absence, adding to the squad only a few emerging talents and bringing back most of the overseas players who helped them win Division Two last year. They are bolstered by the Australian seamer Gurinder Sandhu, signed after it turned out that India’s Jaydev Unadkat wouldn’t turn up until September. John Simpson had a brilliant campaign last year, his first after arriving fromMiddlesexto captain the side, and will need to keep up that stellar standard both with the bat (he averaged 74.81 across 20 innings) and with his leadership if his side – for all that their coach, Paul Farbrace, says they are “aiming to win” the title – are not to end up in a survival battle.SBPrediction9thWarwickshireCaptainAlex DaviesCoachIan WestwoodLast season7thMark Robinson paid the price for one underwhelming season too many as he was sacked as coach in February, with the Bears’ chief executive, Stuart Cain, saying: “It’s no secret we’ve been disappointed in our men’s performance in recent years.” Ian Westwood has replaced him, and though the retirement of keeper Michael Burgess and Will Rhodes’ move toDurhamwill smart there has also been some canny recruitment, with New Zealand’s Test captain, Tom Latham, secured for the entire summer (once he recovers from the hand he broke in training last week). Beau Webster, now a fully fledged Australia Test all-rounder, returns to the Midlands in May having spent the summer of 2016 playing for Knowle and Dorridge in the Birmingham and District Premier League.SBPrediction6thView image in fullscreenTom Latham’s stint at Warwickshire has been disrupted by a broken hand.Photograph: Hannah Peters/Getty ImagesWorcestershireCaptainBrett D’OliveiraCoachAlan RichardsonLast season6thDid not win any of their first eight games last season, but then a run of three on the spin dragged them away from relegation worries. This season looks likely to be tougher still: in 2024 their three most productive bowlers each took precisely 27 wickets but of that trio Nathan Smith is now atSurreyand Joe Leach has retired, leaving a lot of pressure on Tom Taylor. They have signed the all-rounder Ben Allison, back after brief loan spells in each of the past two years, and 20-year-old spinner Fateh Singh, who is aiming to contribute across all formats but has only ever bowled in one first-class innings (in which Yorkshire scored 726 for 7 declared), plus the New Zealand seamer Jacob Duffy for the first half of the season.SBPrediction10thYorkshireCaptainJonny BairstowCoachAnthony McGrathLast season2nd Div TwoAnthony McGrath has returned to the club he once captained after nine years in various coaching roles at Essex, arriving with eye-catchingly high ambitions: “The expectation is that we’ve got to try and win it,” he said. “Teams have come up from Division Two before and won it. There’s no reason why not.” Jonny Bairstow, freshly appointed as captain, similarly says “you never say never”. Yorkshire’s promotion season was one of two distinct halves: five draws, two defeats and no wins in their first seven games, five wins, two draws and no defeats in their last seven. Ben Coad had the best season of his career, taking 56 wickets, while Adam Lyth scored 1,215 runs; they may well flourish back in the top flight but winning it seems a bit of a push.SBskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was, however, their only win of the summer, and the new year brought a new (old) captain: 41-year-old Wayne Madsen, whose hand was on the tiller during the 2012 promotion run. That year Usman Khawaja was the overseas player, in 2025 Blair Tickner returns, as does the left-handed Australian opening batter Caleb Jewell – something of a wildcard. England Lion Harry Moore, 6ft 7in and still a teenager, could bring some dynamite to the doldrums.Tanya AldredPrediction8thGlamorganCaptainSam NortheastCoachRichard DawsonLast season6thThe off-season was dominated by the surprise dismissal of coach Grant Bradburn – he was recently censured by theCricketDiscipline Commission – but Glamorgan have coaxed Richard Dawson into taking over as interim coach. He inherits a mixed bag: a talented, if occasionally misfiring, batting lineup and a bowling attack reliant on Timm van der Gugten, though Sri Lankan fast bowler Asitha Fernando slots in for an early summer stint. Mason Crane should benefit from having a spin bowler as head coach. The club are still hoping that the planets will align for Marnus Labuschagne to return to his spiritual home.TAPrediction7thView image in fullscreenAsitha Fernando lets fly for Sri Lanka against England at the Oval last summer.Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/ShutterstockGloucestershireCaptainCameron BancroftCoachMark AlleyneLast season7thA tricky red-ball season, dominated by money worries and a change of chief executive, not to mention Arron Banks lurking in the background, disguised the fact that there is a talented group of young cricketers at Bristol. Cameron Bancroft takes over as captain this year after the resignation of Graeme van Buuren, and he will be joined by another Aussie, titanic all-rounder Cameron Green, for five games starting in mid-April. There was nothing left in the pot for recruitment so Green’s salary has been met by a mysterious club benefactor. On the minus side Zafar Gohar has fled the nest to Middlesex.TAPrediction6thKentCaptainDaniel Bell-DrummondCoachAdam HollioakeLast season10th Div OneAdam Hollioake has landed at Kent with a bang, saying: “I don’t know why [life has brought me to Canterbury], because the crowd always hated me here.” But after relegation, and only one championship win in a dismal campaign, Hollioake’s no-excuses culture could be just the ticket. Daniel Bell-Drummond continues to juggle with limited resources: Wes Agar returns and Chris Benjamin makes the jump fromWarwickshireto line Kent’s once overflowing wicket-keeping pot – Sam Billings is on a white-ball only deal. After totting up only 12 batting points last summer, Hollioake’s first job is reminding his charges how to build an innings.TAPrediction3rdView image in fullscreenKent captain Daniel Bell-Drummond hits a four against Essex at Chelmsford last season.Photograph: Ray Lawrence/TGS/ShutterstockLancashireCaptainKeaton JenningsCoachDale BenkensteinLast season9th Div OneAfter a car-crash 2024, culminating with relegation on the penultimate day of the season, the only way is up at Old Trafford. Both coach and captain survived the winter and hopes are strong that they can bounce straight back to Division One as they did after relegation in 2004, 2012, 2014 and 2018. A team of talented young things is bolstered by the re-oiled cogs of Jimmy Anderson, on a one-season contract, plus the returning Anderson Phillip, a bright spark in last year’s September gloom. Marcus Harris comes for the summer, bringing experience and runs, while Rocky Flintoff hovers in the wings.TAPrediction1stLeicestershireCaptainPeter HandscombCoachAlfonso ThomasLast season5thThe big question is whetherLeicestershirecan still be in contention for promotion when Shan Masood arrives at Grace Road after the first half of the championship. Lewis Hill stepped down after a tough summer and the experienced Peter Handscomb, who averaged 74 last year, slips into the captaincy chair. He will need to coax more out of young charges: Rishi Patel, Rehan Ahmed (still only 20) and 6ft 7in left-armer Josh Hull, who was a casino pick for one Test last year before promptly falling victim to a quad injury.TAPrediction5thView image in fullscreenRehan Ahmed bowling during a friendly against Nottinghamshire in March.Photograph: John Mallett/ProSports/ShutterstockMiddlesexCaptainToby Roland-JonesCoachRichard JohnsonLast season3rdAfter pulling off the overseas signing of the season with Kane Williamson, there is real hope that, after all the off-field drama, promotion is within Middlesex’s grasp. Joining Williamson (who will be available for five games) is slow left-armer Zafar Gohar, who arrives from Bristol just as he becomes locally qualified, South Africa’s Dane Paterson (first seven rounds), while the promising Ben Geddes hot-foots it over from the Oval where he struggled to make his mark. The club will miss Ethan Bamber (who joins Warwickshire) but the academy production line may bear fruit, with the England U19 speedster Naavya Sharma signing a rookie contract.TAPrediction2ndNorthamptonshireCaptainLuke ProcterCoachDarren LehmannLast season4th“I hate draws,” said Darren Lehmann, soon after he stepped into his head coach boots. He may have to grit his teeth – nine of Northants’ 14 games were drawn last year – but strange things can happen when a force of nature blasts through the dressing room door. Northants lost two of their bigger names over the winter – Jack White to Yorkshire, and Emilio Gay to Durham – but the leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal returns for the second half of the season after his tour-de-force cameo in 2024. And fingers are crossed for George Scrimshaw, whose move from Derbyshire was spoiled by injury after two championship games.TAPrediction4thExplore more on these topicsCounty ChampionshipCounty Championship Division OneDurhamEssexHampshireNottinghamshireSomersetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Wolves head coach and fans can enjoy a few righteous pints after his side moved 12 points clear of the relegation zone with a hard-fought victory over West Ham.Jørgen Strand Larsen scored the only goal to open up a greater gap on the drop zone. It was easy to see what the result meant to Pereira and his staff. They spent the final minutes of injury time demanding more noise from the home supporters to see Wolves over the line. At the final whistle the head coach leapt in the air and on to the pitch to celebrate, while the stands erupted, embracing each one of his players to thank them for their endeavours.Electric Elanga haunts Manchester United with Nottingham Forest winnerRead moreWolves’ relegation rivals Ipswich and Leicester have a game in hand but will be level on matches by the end of Wednesdaytoday after difficult trips to Bournemouth and Manchester City respectively.If the battle for survival is not finished yet, Wolves could effectively end it at Portman Road on Saturday when they travel to play Ipswich, a game for which Pereira will be banned from the touchline.It was a fully deserved victory for Wolves but they spent the latter stages looking nervous, risking throwing away two valuable points. Niclas Füllkrug hit the bar and Tomas Soucek could only find the ­side ­netting when gifted the perfect chance to equalise by Toti Gomes. “He said he purposely tried to kill me,” joked Pereira. The tension was flying around the stands, awaiting the toot from Tony Harrington’s whistle to see them one step closer to safety.“This is a fantastic feeling,” Pereira said. “I am a very simple guy, I like to be with them [the fans], I like to feel part of the family. Feeling the happiness of the supporters is, for me, the most important thing. Football is not all about tactics, it is about connection and team spirit. At this moment, when I look at my team, I see a team that celebrates together and suffers together.West Ham never got going, their best chance falling to Evan Ferguson in the first half after good work by Jarrod Bowen down the right. The winger burst into the box and pulled it back but the Republic of Ireland international, making his first start for West Ham, got the ball stuck under his feet and fluffed his lines.Strand Larsen did not suffer from the same problem. Inthis fixture last season, the former Wolves captain Maximilian Kilman thought he had scored a late equaliser, only to have it ruled out by VAR.The way he influenced the opener on this occasion will have left him with a sinking feeling once again. Strand Larsen was given enough space to slowly turn his frame on the edge of the box and take aim, his shot deflecting off the now West Ham defender Kilman and into the net.View image in fullscreenJørgen Strand Larsen unleashes a shot to give Wolves a first-half lead.Photograph: Jack Thomas/WWFC/Wolves/Getty ImagesWolves were dominant before the break, helped by the Brazilian midfield pairing of André and João Gomes, the latter having signed a new five-year deal at the club. The duo have helped ensure that their side have not missed the suspended Matheus Cunha too much, picking up seven points in the three games he has been absent from. Up against James Ward-Prowse and Lucas Paquetá, they were able to give Wolves the edge in a scrappy fixture.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Zimbabwean took aim from the penalty spot but his shot rifled back off the crossbar.There were plenty of fouls and confrontations on the pitch, resulting in four Wolves players going into Harrington’s book. The hosts knew they had to fight for every inch, even if West Ham were not at their best.Graham Potter took action at half-time in an attempt to change the dynamic, making a triple substitution. It meant West Ham got a greater foothold in the match but they were still without a creative spark. They felt they deserved a penalty when Matt Doherty kicked Füllkrug, who was a handful, in the face but Harrington was not interested, adding the further blow of a booking for the Germany striker’s complaints.In the end, it was a case of holding on as Pereira threw on defensive ­reinforcements, although Munetsi almost netted a second in the dying seconds.Not that it mattered and it would not have changed how sweet the pints taste for Pereira, his players and the fans. “I am emotional and very proud of my team today,” Pereira said.

Gjert described that act as a “betrayal”.Jakob Ingebrigtsen’s father denies kicking Olympic champion and whipping daughterRead moreAt one point in the recording Gjert told Henrik: “You have fired me as a coach. You have rejected us as ­parents and you are carrying out a perfect character assassination on top of that. What we have worked for, you erase with a stroke of a pen. And then the last bit of my income goes away.”On another occasion they discussed Ingrid, who was in her mid‑teens at the time of the incident, having to go to child services. “These people want to hurt me and drag me down to hell,” Gjert told Henrik. “They are going to destroy me as a human being.”However Henrik said that the brothers had no choice given the circumstances. “We cannot accept your treatment of Ingrid either,” he said. “We cannot accept that at all. That’s what started all this.”Gjert responded: “I haven’t made enough mistakes to deserve to be fired as coach of my boys.” On another occasion, Gjert said: “If someone invites me to war, I won’t turn the other cheek. I’ll go to that war. With absolutely everything I have. By all means. That’s how I’m made.”Henrik replied: “There is no war.” Towards the end of the conversation, Gjert told his son: “I never thought you would do something like this to me.”Henrik replied: “We didn’t think you would be violent towards Ingrid either.”Gjert, who is facing six years in jail for abusive behaviour towards Jakob and Ingrid, denies all allegations of violence.Earlier in the day, Gjert was again questioned about the towel incident with his daughter – but insisted that he had pulled a wet towel in the ­direction of her fingers rather than whip her in the face.“I don’t associate the movement with a blow,” he said. “Whipping and hitting with a towel are the wrong terms. It’s more of a pull. I pull the towel towards her finger. And I don’t have a concrete idea whether I hit the finger. It’s a relatively small towel. We stand relatively far apart. The pull I do is done – I think – twice.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was a reaction from me that was not very good on my part, I can’t say anything more.”Gjert also accepted that on another occasion he had pushed his daughter with both hands for which he later apologised. However he insisted the push was not a violent force.Under cross-examination, Gjert was also asked about an incident where he was alleged to have hit Jakob. The prosecutor noted that Jakob’s brother Filip had said he had seen “the incident from ­several angles, and believes it may be because it went on for so long”.However Gjert denied this was the case. “I still have no recollection of having beaten Jakob or ­anyone else – either in my household or ­others,” he replied.Under cross-examination, Gjert also denied calling Jakob “stupid”, an “idiot”, and “a terrorist” when he was growing up.The trial, which is due to last until 16 May, continues.Explore more on these topicsSportNorwaynewsShareReuse this content"

Less than three years later, the England and Wales Cricket Board has concluded that she is such a perfect candidate for the job that it expedited her application, somehow condensing the period betweenfiring one coach(Jon Lewis) and hiring another into the space of three weeks.Edwards’s record as head coach now speaks for itself: since domestic women’s cricket entered its professional era in 2020, she has led Southern Vipers to five out of nine available titles. She has alsowon the Women’s Hundred, coached a side to the final of the Women’s Big Bash League in Australia, and (less than three weeks ago) won her second Women’s Premier League in India. It is sometimes said that brilliant players do not translate into brilliant coaches, but Edwards – who during her 20-year playing career won a 50-over World Cup, a T20 World Cup and lifted the Ashes five times – is a notable exception to the rule.Charlotte Edwards ‘relishing winning trophies’ as England’s new head coachRead moreGiven the ECB’s track record of hiring England head coaches who have never previously coached in the women’s game, we should all welcome the appointment of someone who understands that coaching women is a different beast to coaching men, and that it is a rare person who can flit between the two (as Lewis attempted unsuccessfully to do).Indeed, a key element of Edwards’s success as a coach is that she genuinely cares about women’s cricket. Since she was catapulted into the England set-up as a 16-year-old, women’s cricket has been the centre of her world. Offer her the England men’s head coach role tomorrow and – despite the much bigger paycheck on offer – she would turn it down.Crucially, she also knows women’s cricket in England like no one else. Edwards moved to Hampshire in 2017, and took over as head coach of Southern Vipers in 2020. Since then a sea of young players have been spotted by her, promoted rapidly through the ranks at Hampshire and the Vipers, and been picked up by England. In the current squad Maia Bouchier, Charlie Dean, Lauren Bell and Freya Kemp all have Edwards to thank for their international careers. At a time when England have just beenembarrassed by Australiaand need to think clear-headedly about whether their current personnel can cut it at the highest level, Edwards is well placed to know who is ready and waiting in the wings.View image in fullscreenCharlotte Edwards, who has had success with Southern Vipers as a player and a coach, holds the Women’s Cricket Super League trophy in 2016.Photograph: Steve Paston/PAFurthermore, Edwards is a hard worker who will brook no laziness or excuses. It is difficult to imagine her overseeing a team culture where players feel able to prioritise time spent on the golf course, on yachts and in hotel bars during a World Cup, instead of focusing on their next match. Her appointment sends out a clear message that the ECB is serious about making change: an excellent first step on the road towards picking up the pieces from a disastrous Ashes campaign.Some might suggest that this latest development favours the appointment of Dean as the next captain: the 24-year-old was mentored by Edwards for years at Hampshire, and the pair won the Women’s County Championship together in 2018. On the other hand, Edwards never elevated Dean to captain at the Vipers (Dean’s only senior captaincy experience came at London Spirit in the Hundred). The new head coach is also known to have a soft spot for another outside candidate for the captaincy role, Grace Scrivens, having attempted (without success) to recruit her to the Vipers several years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If that means England go into the series against West Indies, which begins on 21 May, with an interim captain rather than a permanent one, then so be it.For Edwards, the real goal will be lifting the T20 World Cup at home in the summer of 2026. She was removed from her role as England captain before she got the chance to captain her country in the2017 World Cup at home, as she had long dreamed of doing: poetic justice might yet see her coach them to glory instead.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's cricket teamCharlotte EdwardsECBWomen's cricketCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

Tour operators and those with individual bookings at Turnberry are in the process of being informed it will be June before the Ailsa, which is routinely ranked among the finest golf courses in the world, is available for play.The clubhouse at the Ayrshire resort was daubed with graffiti and red paint in the early hours of 8 March. More significant in respect of the championship course – that has staged the Open on four occasions – was the ripping up of greens and on turf approaching them. The course has been closed since October due to planned renovation of the 7th and 8th holes.While Trump slashes jobs, his golf trips are costing taxpayers millions | Mohamad BazziRead moreIn a statement provided to the Guardian, Nic Oldham, general manager of Trump Turnberry, said: “The reopening of the Ailsa Course has been delayed due to recent vandalism. While the redesigned holes are ready for play and look spectacular, we now need to restore other areas of the courses to provide the premium playing conditions our members and guests expect from one of the world’s top-ranked links.“Our team is working closely with all parties to minimise any disruption during this time. We look forward to having the iconic Ailsa Course better than ever when it reopens in June.”The economic impact of this delay is likely to be sharp. Tee times for later in the summer are listed at £1,000 per head on Turnberry’s website for non-residents. With neighbouring Ayrshire courses known to be encountering a busy spell, there will be an inevitable knock-on impact for golf tourism.Trump has labelledthose responsible for the damage as “terrorists”before adding that he hopes they would be “treated harshly” by the Scottish justice system. Trump also wrongly claimed that three people were in prison as a result of police inquiries. A 33-year-old man was charged over the incident and appeared at Ayr sheriff court on Monday. Kieran Robson was charged with malicious mischief and made no plea during the brief hearing. He was released on bail pending a further court appearance. Another man, aged 75, and a 66-year-old woman were arrested and released pending further inquiries.Trump bought Turnberry from a Dubai-based group in 2014. Despite a stated aim of returning the Open to the Ailsa – which last staged the major in 2009 – Trump has met stiff opposition from the tournament organisers, the R&A. There is no indication of that stance changing despite Mark Darbon being appointed as the R&A’s new chief executive.Explore more on these topicsGolfDonald TrumpScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

But on the third call, Donald Meeseetawageesic heard his sister’s voice. “We need somebody to come and tow us out,” he told her.It was a warmer-than-normal night in early March and Meeseetawageesic, the elected band councillor for Eabametoong First Nation, was stranded in a 4x4 truck on the dark winter road leading to his community. The tyres were stuck in the deep snow and the temperature outside was below freezing. Help was about 60km (37 miles) away.View image in fullscreenDonald Meeseetawageesic, left, and his brother John use a satellite phone to call for help after getting stuck on the winter road between Pickle Lake and Eabametoong First Nation in Ontario.Photograph: Ed Ou/The GuardianMade entirely of snow and ice, the winter road forms a vital route connecting Eabametoong in northern Ontario to cities farther south. It has 24 snow bridges spanning creeks, and a daunting 5.5-km crossing over a frozen lake. But warmer winters are making the route unpredictable: the snow bridges are weakening and the lake ice is thinning.View image in fullscreenWith lake ice thinning, the overland supply lifeline becomes more fragile each year as warming temperatures shorten the winter season.Photograph: Ed Ou/The GuardianIn past decades, temperatures have been cold enough in March for a firm road surface. But this year, a mild winter has softened the snowy road, and as Meeseetawageesic and his brother drove along the road, their truck got stuck in the snow.More than 50 Indigenous communities – with a total population of 56,000 people – depend on about 6,000km of winter roads.View image in fullscreenJohn Meeseetawageesic, left, and his brother Donald build a fire to stay warm next to their truck after getting stuck on the ice road.Photograph: Ed Ou/The GuardianWith no all-season roads connecting them to the nearest cities, small planes are the communities’ only lifeline for most of the year. But in winter, lakes and rivers freeze,allowing the construction of a vast network of ice roads.Indigenous communities in Canada’s north rely on such routes to truck in supplies such as lumber for housing, fuel, bulk food and bottled water, which are too bulky and expensive to fly in by plane. For Eabametoong, construction materials are crucial as the community is facing a housing crisis, with up to 14 people living in a single home.View image in fullscreenJohn Meeseetawageesic boards a flight to Thunder Bay from Eabametoong First Nation. When the ice road is impassable or hasn’t yet formed, planes are the only way in or out of the community.Photograph: Ed Ou/The GuardianLast year was the hottest year since record-keeping began, bringing deadly wildfires, heatwaves, floods and rising sea levels. In Canada’s north, rising temperatures are threatening a way of life, as the winter road season grows shorter every year. Last year, chiefsdeclared a state of emergencyafter the roads failed to freeze on time. This March, rain temporarily closed the winter road to Eabametoong and four other communities.“We’re getting a shorter window for sure,” said Meeseetawageesic, who oversees housing in Eabametoong. Trucks used to bring materials by winter road in January, but warm temperatures are forcing them to wait until March; the winter road typically melts in April.View image in fullscreenTruck driver Andy Rae, left, checks a map at Pickle Lake, the most northern town in Ontario accessible by all-season road and a hub to refuel before driving north on the winter roads to First Nations.Photograph: Ed Ou/The GuardianWhile they waited on the winter road, Meeseetawageesic and his brother chopped down wood and built a fire. Hours passed, and then suddenly headlights lit up the road. A passing trucker offered to take them toward Eabametoong. He drove them over the bumpy road until they encountered the rescue party – Meeseetawageesic’s sister and her friends in two trucks. They drove the brothers the rest of the way, arriving home at 4am.****View image in fullscreenIsabel Boyce and her daughters in their home in Eabametoong First Nation.

But inside Isabel Boyce’s home, a wood stove kept things toasty.Boyce sat on her living room couch. Across the room lay a mattress on the floor, where a baby slept soundly as other children ran around. Seven people live in the two-bedroom home.“It’s my own family, so I don’t consider myself overcrowded,” Boyce said, explaining that other homes have several families under one roof. Homes are in short supply – and pervasive mould is eating away at the housing stock, including Boyce’s previous home. “We had to move out because it was getting all mouldy [and] rotting.”View image in fullscreenThe worsening state of the winter roads is making it harder to bring in materials to ease the community’s housing crisis, says Donald Meeseetawageesic, a band councillor responsible for housing.Photograph: Ed Ou/The GuardianPeople in First Nations communities are four times more likely to live in crowded housing and six times more likely to live in housing in need of major repairs than non-Indigenous people, according to Canada’s 2021 census. To close the housing gap, more than 55,000 units need to be built, a report by the Assembly of First Nations found.Canada’s historical policies reduced the land base of Indigenous communities to only 0.2% of their original territories, making it nearly impossible to generate revenue from their lands. They rely heavily on federal transfer payments, and the government holds the purse strings for basic infrastructure, including water treatment plants, schools and housing.Now, more funding is needed – not only for housing materials but also to safely and reliably transport them into Eabametoong. “They should build anall-season road,” Boyce said. “It would benefit the community in the future.”View image in fullscreenDonald Meeseetawageesic, centre, sits with his sister Karen, left, and their mother in their home in Eabametoong First Nation. ‘The ice is not freezing as it should,’ his mother says.Photograph: Ed Ou/The GuardianMeeseetawageesic sits in his elderly mother’s living room, speaking to her in Ojibwe. “She has noticed a change on the winter roads. The ice is not freezing as it should. January and February are supposed to be our coldest months, but it’s not as cold as it was before,” he said, translating her words.After separating from his wife, he now lives in his mother’s home. Although he makes decisions about housing for the community of about 1,600 people, there is nowhere else for him to live. The housing committee has received 180 housing applications from families and individuals.View image in fullscreen‘They should build an all-season road,’ said Isabel Boyce. ‘It would benefit the community in the future.’Photograph: Ed Ou/The GuardianThe winter roads crisis is putting pressure on Eabametoong in other ways, too.In January 2024, the communitylost its only schoolto a fire. There was no functioning fire truck, and although new fire trucks were scheduled to arrive, warm temperatures prevented them from being transported by winter road. The community built a temporary school for the children, who missed months of education.View image in fullscreenA snow groomer drags a set of tyres to maintain the winter road connecting Cat Lake First Nation with the rest of Ontario. These roads require constant upkeep.Photograph: Ed Ou/The GuardianWhen the winter road is unavailable for hauling essential supplies, the community must bring them in by air – at a much higher cost.Like other remote First Nations, Eabametoong relies on diesel fuel that used to be trucked over the winter road. “We fly all the fuel in now, and probably for the last four years, five years, because of the ice conditions,” said the Eabametoong chief, Solomon Atlookan.View image in fullscreenUltimately, many First Nations need all-season roads, but they cannot afford to build them themselves.Photograph: Ed Ou/The GuardianThe costs of flying fuel into remote First Nations are soaring. Ontario First Nations collectively move about 20m litres of fuel each year by winter road, according to Indigenous Services Canada emails obtained through public records request. “It costs approximately $0.69/litre more to mobilise by air – potentially resulting in a pressure of $13.8m [per year in Ontario] should winter roads not be available,” an ISC employee wrote in one email. The records show that ISC is aware that long-term planning is needed to address fuel supply issues “due to winter roads trending to open later in the year”.Ultimately, many First Nations will needall-season roads. But they cannot afford to build the roads themselves. “‘Emergency’ doesn’t even feel strong enough [to describe the situation],” said the ISC minister, Patty Hajdu. “It’s so urgent that we do more together to figure out what this next stage of living with climate change looks like for, in particular, remote communities.”View image in fullscreenRachel Wesley, the economic development officer for Cat Lake First Nation, inspects a melting section of a winter road between Pickle Lake and Cat Lake.Photograph: Ed Ou/The GuardianClimate adaptation would look different for each community, Hadju said: some First Nations wanted permanent roads while others were contemplating using airships to bring in heavy loads. The cost of building roads would probably be covered by cost-sharing between different levels of government, and, she said, the federal government was ready to commit funding “in theory”.“For each community, there are many steps to get the federal government’s commitment on any particular cost-shared project. Obviously, we would want to make sure that we’re working in partnership with the province, in partnership with the First Nations,” Hajdu said.View image in fullscreenSolomon Atlookan, the chief of Eabametoong First Nation, has watched climate change erode the reliability of the community’s winter road.Photograph: Ed Ou/The GuardianEabametoong has completed a feasibility study for an all-season road. Chief Atlookan is concerned about the impacts on the community – he knows the road could bring tourism, which could threaten traditional ways of life. But climate change and higher costs are forcing him to seriously consider an all-season road. “We need to begin working on it now,” he said.First Nations are not the only communities anticipating the end of winter roads.Pickle Lake, the most northern town in Ontario accessible by all-season road, is a hub for truckers to refuel before driving north on the winter roads to First Nations. At the bulk fuel supplier Morgan Fuels, semi-truck drivers streamed through the doors in search of coffee and a bathroom.View image in fullscreenTruck driver Andy Rae checks his radio in Pickle Lake while getting road updates before heading out. Rae regularly hauls groceries and supplies to remote First Nations communities along the ice roads.Photograph: Ed Ou/The GuardianAndy Rae was charging his radio before driving a truck full of groceries to Wunnumin First Nation. He pointed to a spot on a map where his truck slid off the winter road and smashed through a frozen creek last year. “We didn’t know the creek was there. Nobody did. I found it,” he joked.Another time, Rae drove a heavy truck across a lake with dangerously thin ice that popped and cracked under his wheels. “They didn’t tell me how thick the lake was until after,” he said. Repeating advice he had received from an older trucker, he said: “As long as you’re popping and cracking, you’re good. If it’s dead silent, you’re going through.”View image in fullscreenAndy Rae says cracking ice, hidden creeks and warming temperatures have made the trips riskier – but the deliveries are essential.Photograph: Ed Ou/The GuardianBehind the front desk sat the site supervisor, Brent Beever, who has worked at Morgan Fuels since the 1980s and watched climate change wreak havoc on the winter roads. “With the warming conditions, that’s your biggest challenge,” he said.Beever explained that temperatures used to drop well below freezing at this time of year, but now he sees rain and above-freezing temperatures in February and March. Warmer conditions mean rougher roads, collapsing snow bridges, and more truck maintenance. “It makes it hard on equipment going in there, and it’s challenging for the drivers to get into the communities,” he said.“I guess that’s why they’re more and more working toward all-season roads. How long that will be, I don’t know. It’ll be probably a few years.”This story was supported by the Pulitzer CenterExplore more on these topicsCanadaIndigenous peoplesClimate crisisIceAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is a much greater reduction than previous estimates, which found the reduction would be 1.4%.Scientists now estimate global temperatures will rise by 2.1Ceven if countries hit short-term and long-term climate targets.Tackling climate crisis will increase economic growth, OECD research findsRead moreCriticisms have mounted in recent years that a set of economic tools known as integrated assessment models (IAM) – used to guide how much governments should invest in cutting greenhouse gas emissions – have failed to capture major risks from climate change, particularly extreme weather events.The new study, in the journalEnvironmental Research Letters, took one of the most popular economic models and enhanced it with climate change forecasts to capture the impacts of extreme weather events across global supply chains.Dr Timothy Neal, of the University of New South Wales’s Institute for climate risk and response and the lead author of the study, said the new research had looked at the likely impact of global heating of 4C – seen by many climate experts as catastrophic for the planet – finding it would make the average person 40% poorer. This compared with about 11% poorer when using the models without enhancements.Previous economic models that “inadvertently concluded” even high levels of global heating would have only modest impacts on the global economy had “profound implications for climate policy”, Neal said.He said economic models had tended to only account for changing weather on a local level, rather than how weather extremes like droughts or floods could affect global supply chains.“In a hotter future, we can expect cascading supply chain disruptions triggered by extreme weather events worldwide,” Neal said.Prof Andy Pitman, a climate scientist at UNSW and co-author of the research, said: “It’s in the extremes when the rubber hits the road. It isn’t about average temperatures”“Retooling economic models to account for extremes in your part of the world and its impact on supply chains feels like a very urgent thing to do so countries can fully cost their economic vulnerabilities to climate change and then do the obvious thing – cut emissions.”Some economists have argued global losses from global heating might be partially balanced by warming that could benefit some cold regions, such as Canada, Russia and northern Europe. But Neal said global heating would hit countries everywhere, because global economies are linked by trade.Prof Frank Jotzo, a climate policy expert at Australian National University who was not involved in the research, said economic climate modelling using IAMs assumed that if climate change made an activity such as agriculture unviable in one part of the world, increased output would simply come from somewhere else.“The result is that the models say that climate change makes little difference to the future world economy, which is contrary to what physical impact science and a nuanced understanding of interdependencies in the economy would suggest.”Areport in Januaryfrom the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, representing the profession that underpins the risk management decisions of the world’s insurers and pension funds, said previous economic risk assessments had failed to account for real-world climate impacts like “tipping points, extreme events, migration, sea level rise, human health impacts or geopolitical risk.”“The benign but flawed results may reinforce the narrative that these are slow-moving risks with limited impacts, rather than severe risks requiring immediate action,” the report said.Mark Lawrence researches climate risk as a professor of practice at the University of Adelaide and previouslyworked in financial risk management with senior roles at major financial institutions including Merrill Lynch and ANZ Banking Group. He said the results of the new research were credible.“If anything, I believe the economic impacts [of climate change] could be even worse,” he said.A consequence of the disconnect between modelling and real-world climate impacts, Lawrence said, was that “the potential economic benefits of urgent climate policy action have also been significantly understated”.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisGlobal economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This volume of leads was far larger than I have experienced on any investigation before or since, including articles I have written about individuals more well-known than Mr Clarke.”Giving oral evidence on Tuesday, Osborne said the investigation received “so many leads that it was impossible to follow up all of them”.In her witness statement she explained her communications with sources and how she and Kale went about corroborating allegations. She said expressions and types of sexual language used by Clarke came up repeatedly.“For example, multiple sources described him talking about sexual acts with sex workers and two women who did not know one another said he told them he wanted to ‘climb them like a tree’ – a term that I felt was so specific it was unlikely to be a coincidence,” wrote Osborne.The beginning of her cross-examination by Clarke’s barrister, Philip Williams, focused largely on Osborne’s communications with Gina Powell, who previously worked for the writer-producer of the Kidulthood trilogy at Unstoppable Productions.Williams suggested that Powell, who started off as an assistant producer with Unstoppable, was part of a conspiracy to destroy Clarke’s career because she had a “financial grudge” against him.Osborne said in her witness statement that the journalists spoke to 12 people who provided information corroborating Powell’s allegations.When Williams suggested to Osborne that it should have been of concern when Clarke told the Guardian that Powell was in dispute with him over money, she replied that Powell had already told her about it and that they had “numerous conversations” concerning the matter. She described Powell as an “upfront” and “credible” witness.In her witness statement, Osborne said Powell provided very detailed descriptions of the alleged incidents involving her former boss and appeared to be “still scared of Mr Clarke and what he could do to her. She told me that she was worried that Mr Clarke would turn up on her doorstep and noted that she was scared of going to Soho in case she bumped into him.“She also told me that she was concerned about the impact that speaking out publicly could have on her career. I did not anticipate she would decide to speak out publicly for that reason.”In the event, Powell’s allegations against Clarke did appear alongside her real name in the first Guardian article. In her witness statement, she said she was quitting the industry because of her experience working with him.Earlier on Tuesday, in a similar vein to his questioning of Osborne about Powell, Williams put to the Guardian’s head of investigation, Paul Lewis, that “some sources clearly have axes to grind”.Lewis replied: “The inference as I see it … is that’s the reason they spoke to us, but I don’t think the sources were speaking to us for that reason.”He told the court that the motivation of the sources was that they were alleged victims of sexual misconduct who wanted to “hold him [Clarke] to account”.Explore more on these topicsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianGuardian Media GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

The magnitude of this, given months of discussion, should have our full attention. The double whammy of it being on a Friday, and coming days before the locals will not do this matter justice,” he said.A Labour source close to MPs concerned about the bill said: “Supporters of the bill seem to be merrily continuing their campaign for assisted dying while the rest of the Labour party are trying to tackle hard issues we face after 14 years of the Tories.“Corralling MPs in Westminster during the short campaign for the local elections when they should be out campaigning in the first real electoral test of the Labour party since the general election feels like the last straw for many of us.”The legislation will return to the Commons later this month after it was subject to scrutiny in the committee stage.The Commons leader, Lucy Powell, has said there have been more than 100 amendments made to the bill since it passed its second reading ina historic Commons vote last year.The scrutiny committee voted in favour of a multidisciplinary panel to approve assisted dying applications instead of high court judges.New amendments impose a duty on a secretary of state in England, and give powers to ministers inWales, to ensure voluntary assisted dying services are provided.However, last week six Labour MPs, who oppose assisted dying, said the bill was “irredeemably flawed and not fit to become law” in a letter to their parliamentary colleagues.The letter from two select committee chairs, Meg Hillier and Florence Eshalomi, alongside the Labour backbenchers Antonia Bance, Jess Asato, James Frith and Melanie Ward, said the promise the bill would be strengthened during the committee stage “had not been kept”.Kim Leadbeater, the bill’s sponsor, said the committee had made “the strongest assisted dying legislation anywhere in the world even more safer and more robust”.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingLocal electionsLabourHouse of CommonsLocal politicsLocal governmentEnglandShareReuse this content"

But the 20% increase in fees from adding VAT meant the child “will be forced to leave the school and return to a state primary school of the sort which was unable to meet his educational needs”, Pannick told the court.James Eadie KC, representing the Treasury, HMRC and theDepartment for Education, said local authorities paid the fees of pupils with assessed special needs who had a private school placement as part of an education health and care plan (EHCP) agreed between councils and parents.More than 1 million children with special needs but without an EHCP go to mainstream state schools in England. The VAT policy will also apply to private schools in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, which have differing forms of provision.Bruno Quintavalle, representing four private Christian schools and parents who have sent their children to them, said the “ill thought-out proposal” placed parents in “impossible positions”.“The claimant parents are not prepared to send their children to state schools, because the secular education provided by the state sector would oblige the children to be educated in a way contrary to the parents’ religious convictions or would otherwise expose their children to risks which they cannot in conscience assume,” he said in a submission.Among those challenging the policy is Stephen White, whose children attend Bradford Christian school, a private faith school in West Yorkshire.Speaking outside the hearing, White said: “We all make a sacrifice to send them there, and it’s wrong, because we’re actually saving the state a load of money.”Eadie said an obligation to respect the religious convictions of parents was not affected by the VAT policy: “The existence of such convictions does not require the state to finance an education system to comply with such convictions, still less to refrain from taxing the provision of that or any private education.”Private faith schools in UK lobby for VAT exemption on fees under £7,690Read moreEadie said in his submissions that abolishing the VAT exemption for school fees was a policy in Labour’s election manifesto, expected to raise up to £1.7bn a year.“Parents wishing to opt out of the system of universally accessible state-funded education are free to choose any private education for their child that they can afford, or to educate their child at home,” Eadie said.“The fact that measures of general application, such as taxes, minimum wage laws, national insurance, etc, affect the cost of providing such a service, and therefore its purchase price, does not make those measures an interference with freedom to offer or receive private education.”The hearing before Dame Victoria Sharp, Lord Justice Newey and Mr Justice Chamberlain concludes on Thursday, with a decision expected to follow later.Explore more on these topicsPrivate schoolsTax and spendingSpecial educational needsSchoolsHuman rightsDepartment for EducationSchool fundingnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood that they raised the issue of the new online safety act and how it risked infringing free speech.The state department body later said the meeting was part of its initiative “to affirm theUS commitment to defending freedom of expression, both in Europe and around the world”. During the meeting, Ofcom officials said the new rules were only in place to deal with explicitly illegal content, as well as material that could be harmful to children.Ofcom rushes to close loophole that lets politicians act as newsreadersRead moreAsked about the meeting, which is understood to have taken place in March, a state department spokesperson said: “As vice-president Vance has said, we are concerned about freedom of expression in the United Kingdom. It is important that the UK respect and protect freedom of expression.”Details of the meeting emerged after Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, denied that concerns over free speech had featured in tariff negotiations with the US. There had been reports that a deal could be jeopardised over the case of anti-abortion campaigner Livia Tossici-Bolt, who was prosecuted for an alleged breach of a safe access zone outside a Bournemouth abortion clinic. The verdict is expected on Friday.It follows months of pressure from figures close to President Trump over free speech. Some have accused the UK government of failing to protect free expression, especially after the riots that took place last summer.In February, the US vice-president JD Vance complained of“infringements on free speech”in the UK. Elon Musk, one of Trump’s closest allies, repeatedly claimed that some prison sentences handed down to people who incited the riots on X were a breach of free speech. X hosts accounts by figures includingTommy RobinsonandAndrew Tate, who were accused of inciting people to join Islamophobic protests.Since the riots last summer, the online safety act has been implemented as a way of regulating illegal online content. During a visit to the UK, the US state department team held meetings with Ofcom, the Foreign Office and the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a US group that funds and campaigns on conservative issues.Among the group was Samuel D Samson, who previously worked for US conservative organisations. He was appointed as a senior advisr at the DRL in January after Trump’s victory. On the day of last year’s US election, he tweeted: “Today we choose God over Pagan idols.”He has previously taken a close interest in freedom of speech issues, writing about the topic in theAmerican Conservative magazine. The DRL’s interest in Britain marks a pivot by an agency originally set up in the 1970s to advance democracy around the world against the backdrop of the cold war. Rather than Britain’s domestic affairs, the DRL’s advocacy has focused on the Middle East, Russia and China.An Ofcom spokesperson said: “This meeting was part of Ofcom’s regular engagement with a range of international stakeholders seeking a factual briefing on how the online safety act works, in practice, to protect UK citizens.”The online safety act applies to all sites and apps that publish user-made content, as well as large search engines. It lists 130 “priority offences”, which include issues such as child sexual abuse, terrorism and fraud.Mark Jones, a partner at the law firm Payne Hicks Beach, said Ofcom was not “clamping down on free speech”. He said that in practice, it delegated to the platforms about how they monitor content, beyond illegal material. “An example is in relation to misogynistic and hypermasculine content,” he said. “Ofcom wrote to social media platforms to urge them to go ‘above and beyond’ their legal obligations under the online safety act, even though the content itself isn’t illegal.“Free speech advocates say that this is going to bring about a culture of ‘if in doubt, cut it out’ as platforms seek to avoid being subject to Ofcom’s enforcement powers. On the other side, we have Musk and [Meta chief executive Mark] Zuckerberg who have spoken out about the online safety laws in the UK and ‘institutionalising censorship’. Duties in relation to misogynistic content, for example, are voluntary unlike the requirements to tackle illegal content and child safety.”Explore more on these topicsOfcomInternet safetyTelevision industryFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

This assessment can be challenged by individuals.The proposed data (use and access) bill, which is expected to come into force in early 2026, would permit the secretary of state to use personal data without the same risk assessment and without it being subject to the same level of parliamentary scrutiny as other legislation.James Baker, a programme manager at Open Rights Group, said: “Political parties are stuck in an arms race as to how they can use data to reach and influence potential voters in order to win elections.“It’s therefore vital that there are clear and fair rules for how political parties are allowed to use our data. Any changes to these rules must be properly scrutinised by parliament. This is not just about how our data is being used now; it’s about the future of our democracy.”While Baker noted the government might not intend to use these powers to sneak through changes, he said there could be no guarantee that future administrations would operate in the same way, particularly against a backdrop of “a surge in populist governments that are prepared to use executive powers to advance their agenda”.He added: “This is not the time to weaken parliamentary scrutiny; the government must act to prevent the data bill from enabling future abuses of power.”A Department for Science, Innovation and Technology spokesperson said the use of personal data for political campaigning or engagement was “not included in the measures of the data bill”.Noting that regulations would be subject to “three robust safeguards”, including consultation with the Information Commissioner’s Officer, approval by the UK parliament and a requirement to serve the general public interest, they added: “It is also false to claim there would be no parliamentary oversight of potential changes to these rules.”Ross McKenzie, a partner at Addleshaw Goddard, said the law was written in such a way that future secretaries of state would not have a “completely unfettered right” to use personal data, and acknowledged it would probably only be in “extreme scenarios” that ministers might “extend recognised legitimate interest grounds without the same level of parliamentary scrutiny”.But he added: “Other countries with General Data Protection Regulation rules in Europe don’t have this allowance. The UK government’s view is to make doing business in the UK easier, and one way is to give more flexible rights to use data – this allowance makes that quicker and easier to achieve. But I can see why it’s not attractive from a human rights perspective.”The data bill is designed to cut red tape around data use, and the government has estimated it could add some £10bn to the UK economy over a period of 10 years.Peers in the House of Lords constitution committee have previously expressed concerns, warning they were “not satisfied that the case has been sufficiently made to entrust the powers in these clauses to secondary legislation”.Explore more on these topicsPrivacyData protectionnewsShareReuse this content"

It fined 15 car manufacturers plus the trade body ACEA €458m (£383m) for participating in a cartel regarding end-of-life vehicle recycling across the trading bloc.The 10 manufacturers subject to the UK fines were contacted for comment by the Guardian.A spokesperson for Renault said: “The infringing practices date back to 2002 and ended up in 2018, at a time when the structuring of the ELV (end of life vehicle) recycling sector was still nascent, as was environmental communication.

The man was shot by police in the station square outside the building and died at 1.44pm.At 2.26pm, about an hour and a half after TVP officers arrived on the scene, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) launched an investigation into the incident after being contacted by the force.The force said: “Officers from Thames Valley police and British Transport Police were called to reports of a man carrying a firearm at Milton Keynes railway station, Elder Gate, Milton Keynes, at 12.55pm today.“Armed officers from Thames Valley police responded and challenged the man, before shots were fired by police. Life-saving actions were immediately taken at the scene, but the man was pronounced dead at 1.44pm.“There is not believed to be any further risk to the public at this time. We will provide more details as soon as we are able to.”A spokesperson for the police watchdog, who described the investigation as being “in its very early stages”, said: “We were notified by TVP shortly after the incident and IOPC investigators have been sent to the station and the police post incident procedure to begin gathering information.“Our thoughts are with the family of the man who died and all those who have been affected by this incident. Our role in these circumstances is to independently investigate all of the circumstances surrounding this incident including the actions and decisions taken by the police.”Shivani Sharma, a reporter from LBC,saida witness told her “he heard screaming back and forth for around 30 minutes and the man refused to drop to the ground”.British Transport Police officers were also on scene. A spokesperson said: “BTP received a report from Thames Valley police at 1pm today, of a man carrying a firearm at Milton Keynes station.“Armed officers from Thames Valley Police responded and he was shot and pronounced dead outside of the station. BTP officers are on scene to assist our colleagues from TVP, and the station is open as normal.”A witness told the Daily Mail they would have nightmares after seeing the “shocking” scene outside the station.“I was having my coffee and I saw a police Volvo arrive, they said. “I heard a pop – I used to work with firearms in private security, I knew it wasn’t a car backfiring or anything.“When I went out people were crowding around and I could see the hole in his stomach and blood gushing out. They turned him to look for an exit wound and then laid him flat and started doing compressions.

The supplier came bottom of the consumer body’s rankings with a score of 2.4 out of 5 with 53 complaints per 10,000 customers between October and December 2024. Its customers waited one minute and 42 seconds on average when they called its helpline, while only 62.9% of emails were responded to within two days.Rebel’s collapse comes weeks after the energy regulator for Great Britain,Ofgem, began disciplinary action against the company over concerns that it had not properly ringfenced the money it had collected from customers to be used to support renewable energy subsidies.In a post on LinkedIn, Bates said he would “take the time to plan my next steps, although please DM me with any opportunities”.Ofgem has urged Rebel Energy’s customers to take a meter reading for their gas and electricity use, and wait to hear from their new supplier, which will be appointed within days.The supplier failure was announced on the same day thatmillions of households face a 6.4% or £111 energy billincrease to an average of £1,849 a year after the regulator raised the energy price cap.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Prior to Rebel’s collapse, the last failure was UK Energy Incubator Hub in July 2022. Since then Ofgem has taken measures to bar companies from entering the market unless they can prove that they are financially robust.Tim Jarvis, a director at Ofgem, said: “We have worked hard to improve the financial resilience of suppliers in recent years, implementing a series of rules to make sure they can weather unexpected shocks. But like any competitive market, some companies will still fail from time to time, and our priority is making sure consumers are protected if that happens.“Rebel Energy customers do not need to worry, and I want to reassure them that they will not see any disruption to their energy supply, and any credit they may have on their accounts remains protected under Ofgem’s rules.“We are working quickly to appoint new suppliers for all impacted customers. We’d advise customers not to try to switch supplier in the meantime, and a new supplier will be in touch in the coming weeks with further information.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryOfgemEnergy billsHousehold billsConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

Representatives for Doge did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment about Lewin, and a representative for the Department of State, which assumed control of USAID programs after it was shuttered, said it does not comment on personnel matters.According to the magazine: “Police records show he was also once accused of threatening a girl with a knife, asking why ‘he shouldn’t gut [her] and cut [her] right now,’” adding that the girl told police she feared for her life.Lewin was recently appointed deputy administrator for policy and programmes at what remained of USAID after the Trump administration’s decision to dismantle it. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that all local workers, diplomats and civil servants associated with USAID overseas had been fired, the final step in shuttering the aid organization. Congress was notified on Friday that virtually all of USAID’s employees were to be fired by September and all of its overseas offices will be shuttered.According to Rolling Stone, it was Lewin who signed the email last week officially closing USAID as he noted that he and Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, were “grateful” for employees’ “continued service to our great nation”.According to the magazine, Lewin previously worked with the prominent constitutional legal scholar Laurence Tribe, a frequent critic of Trump, and those familiar with Lewin described an individual prone to violent outbursts and racially demeaning comments.“I have a vivid memory of him telling me that he believed non-white people were inherently of ‘lower value’ than white people,” a former acquaintance who called him “blatantly racist” told Rolling Stone, one of five former classmates it said made similar remarks.Another person who knew Lewin well as a teenager recalls him being ejected from classes for espousing racist ideals. “He was into the Great Replacement Theory before it was a thing,” they said.The claims about Lewin follow controversies over other individuals who have become promoted by Musk and Doge. In February another young Musk hire at Doge, 25-year-old Marko Elez, who previously worked for Musk’s SpaceX company, resigned over racist remarks before Muskinsisted he would rehire him.A social media account connected to Elez posted a variety of inflammatory comments including the statement: “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool.” Another post, in September, said: “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity.”The most serious incident involving Lewin occurred at a party at his parents house in 2015.According to the police report seen by Rolling Stone, “Jeremy started yelling at [a girl who was also at the party] and blamed her for his missing belongings.”“[Redacted] states during the argument Jeremy pulled out a knife with an Orange [sic] handle and said ‘Tell me why I shouldn’t gut you and cut you right now.’ [Redacted] continued to tell [police officers] that she felt threatened by Lewin’s actions and she was in fear for her life. [Redacted] then left the party and had her friend drop her off at the Newton police station.”In the report, Lewin told police that the girl threatened him during an argument and threw a notepad at his head. He admitted taking out a knife, but said he slammed it on the kitchen countertop and asked her to leave in response.The police officer who investigated the incident called for a hearing to be scheduled “for the charge of assault by means of a dangerous weapon”, which ultimately did not take place for reasons that are not clear.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The move, Bondi notes, was in an effort to “carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again”.Prosecutors say Mangione had a spiral notebook in which he expressed hostility toward thehealth insuranceindustry and wealthy executives. UnitedHealthcare is the largest health insurer in the US, though the company has said Mangione was never a client.Luigi Mangione lawyer says arrest flaws invalidate evidence – but will it work?Read moreAmong the entries, the complaint said, was one from August 2024 that said “the target is insurance” because “it checks every box” and one from October that describes an intent to “wack” an insurance company CEO.Mangione is facing both state and federal charges in connection with Thompson’s killing. He has pleaded not guilty to the state charges and has not entered a plea to the federal ones.The maximum punishment on the state charges is life in prison.Writings and words on bullets recovered from the scene reflected Mangione’s alleged hostility toward health insurers and corporate America.The incident reignited debates about the United States’s healthcare system andincited controversyon social media, where many have expressed support for the Mangione. While private insurers report billions in profits every year, many patients and doctors arestruggling to navigate a complex financial systemto get what they need.Others, including elected officials, decry what they see as glorifying violence and vigilantism.Mangione and his attorneys have said they plan to avail themselves of about $775,000 in money raised on the GiveSendGo platform to aid his legal defense.

Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD79.Experts believe the female sculpture was of an important local woman who was perhaps a priestess of Ceres, who in ancient Roman religion was a goddess of agriculture, fertility and motherly relationships, because of the jewellery and accessories, including earrings, rings and bracelets, carved into it – especially thelunula,a crescent moon pendant hanging in the middle of the necklace.View image in fullscreenThe two sculptures, with a tree root reaching from above the man’s head down to his feet.Photograph: Alfio GiannottiThe woman is veiled and dressed in a large cloak over a tunic, while the man is wearing a toga wrapped over his left shoulder.However, experts are not convinced that the figures, which were joined together and are believed to date back to the late Roman Republic period, represented a married couple.Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the director of Pompeii archaeological park, said: “Because she really looks like a very important woman in the local elite, there is also this idea that she could have been a priestess of Ceres, holding these lands and what appears to be a purist role.”View image in fullscreenA detail from the statue of the woman, showing a hand holding laurel leaves.Photograph: Alfio GiannottiShe is holding what appears to be laurel leaves, which were used to purify and bless religious spaces by dispersing incense and the smoke from aromatic herbs.With most women in Roman society relegated to domestic roles, being a priestess, an important position in public life, was the highest position a woman could aspire to and gave power on a similar level to a male priest.Zuchtriegel said such funerary sculptures did not always represent couples. “Sometimes you get two men, or sometimes they come in threes,” he said. “This could be her husband, but it could also be her son. There was no inscription, so we don’t know.”By the feet of the male statue is the preserved root of an ancient tree that grew on top of the tomb. “It was quite a surprise to find it there a few centimetres beneath the ground,” said Zuchtriegel.The two sculptures are being restored and will be displayed at an exhibition in Pompeii, beginning on 16 April.The excavations at the Porta Sarno necropolis are a joint project between Pompeii archaeological park and the European University of Valencia. In 2021,the partly mummified remains, including hair and bones, of a former slavewho rose through the social ranks, were found.Explore more on these topicsItalyArchaeologyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It came after Trump on Sunday revealed his frustration with Putin,saying he was “pissed off”and threatening to impose tariffs on Russian oil exports.“All we have today is an attempt to find some kind of framework that would first allow for a ceasefire – at least as envisioned by the Americans,” Ryabkov said.“As far as we can see, there is no place in them today for our main demand, namely to solve the problems related to the root causes of this conflict.”Putin has repeatedly referred to what he claimed were the “root causes” of the conflict to justify his hardline position on any prospective deal to end the war inUkraine.As preconditions for a ceasefire, the Russian leader has insisted on terms that would, in effect, dismantle Ukraine as an independent, functioning state – pulling it firmly into Russia’s sphere of influence.He has demanded that Kyiv recognise Russia’s annexation of Crimea and four partly occupied regions in the south-east, withdraw its forces from those areas, pledge never to join Nato, and agree to demilitarisation.View image in fullscreenThe ruins of a building in the abandoned Ukrainian city of Maryinka, which was destroyed during the invasion by Russian forces.Photograph: Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersIn recent weeks the Russian president has also been openly pushing for regime change in Ukraine, claiming that Volodymyr Zelenskyy lacks the legitimacy to sign a peace deal and suggesting that Ukraine needs external governance.Trump appears to be growing increasingly impatient with his lack of progress in a war that he promised to end in 24 hours, expressing frustration with Russian and Ukrainian leaders as he struggles to forge a truce.Trump’s comment that he was “pissed off” with Putin over the Russian leader’s approach to a potential ceasefire in Ukraine was a noticeable shift in tone from a leader who had previously expressed admiration for Putin. However, Trump later dialled back his rhetoric and by Monday was accusing Ukraine of trying to renegotiate an economic deal with the US.The White House on Tuesday said Trump was frustrated with leaders on both sides of the war.Despite a flurry of US-brokered meetings and parallel talks with Russia and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia that produced – on paper – a 30-day energy ceasefire, both sides have continued to strike each other’s energy infrastructure.The Trump administration also attempted to broker a ceasefire in the Black Sea, but Moscow sought to attach several conditions to the deal, including the easing of European sanctions, a demand swiftly rejected by Brussels.Grigory Karasin, who represented Russia at the talks with the US in Saudi Arabia, last week admitted that the sides had failed to make significant progress and that negotiations may drag into next year.But Trump’s team has said it remains committed to halting the war, with the US leader telling NBC he and Putin planned to speak again this week.The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, who spent time with Trump over the weekend, said he proposed setting a deadline of 20 April for Putin to comply with a full ceasefire.However, those close to the Kremlin believe Moscow is unlikely to accept a full ceasefire without securing some of its demands, which include the cessation of all arms and intelligence supplies to Ukraine from the US and other allies.“We’re prepared to keep fighting for some time,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent Russian foreign policy analyst who heads a council that advises the Kremlin. “The continuation of the war, which we are slowly but surely winning, is in our interest. Especially considering that the main sponsor [the US] seems to be backing out … Why should we rush in a situation like this?”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Posts giving the judges’ full names, photographs and a part of de Perthuis’ address were condemned by French legal bodies.Rémy Heitz, the public prosecutor at the court of cassation, France’s highest court, said the “highly personalised” attacks were “unacceptable” and that any threats may be subject to criminal prosecution.Marine Le Pen verdict throws National Rally into chaos but could boost far right | Angelique ChrisafisRead more“Justice is not political; this decision is not a political decision but a legal one rendered by three independent, impartial judges, in accordance with the law,” Heitz said.The justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, said such threats were unacceptable: “In a democracy, it is unacceptable for people to physically threaten judges. When we call for the rule of law it includes all free and independent magistrates in this country.” He called on far-right MPs to support the threatened magistrates.Darmanin said he hoped that if Le Pen appealed against her conviction – as she has said she will – a new trial “can be organised within as reasonable a timeframe as possible”, but added it was up to the courts to fix a date.The French court of appeal said on Tuesday that it should be able to provide a decision in summer 2026.Jordan Bardella, 29, the RN president, alsocalled on supporters not to threaten or insult the judges.“This is unacceptable and we condemn it,” he said.Hours after the verdict, RN officials went on the offensive, giving interviews, press conferences, planning a leafleting campaign and setting up a petition that crashed the party’s website.The RN is reported to be planning a major rally in support of Le Pen in Paris either this weekend on the next and is calling for nationwide demonstrations againstthe court’s decision to banher from public office for five years, seemingly wrecking her hopes of succeeding Emmanuel Macron as president .Le Pen and 24 others from RN, including party officials, employees, MEPs and assistants, were convicted of embezzling millions in European parliament funds as part of a fake jobs scam.The trial last November heard how the party took money for EU parliamentary assistants but spent it on paying staff in France. None of the accused benefited personally from the embezzlement and all denied the charges.Le Pen, 56, was also given a four-year prison term, two years suspended and two to be served wearing an electronic bracelet. The sentence will be postponed until the appeal process is exhausted, but the five-year ban on standing for public office takes immediate effect.Le Pen went on TV to denounce what she said was the court’s“political decision”and vowed to “pursue all legal avenues” to be able to stand in 2027. An appeal by Le Pen will lead to a new trialthat she hopes will overturn the conviction and public office ban in time to campaign for the presidency.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We work together, hand in hand and in total confidence.“I have total loyalty.

The defendants, Israelis aged between 19 and 20, claimed sexual contact with the woman had been consensual.But her lawyer, Michael Polak, described the assertion as absurd. “The young lady in this case is gay, any suggestion that she voluntarily agreed to group sex with men she had never met before, who were speaking in a different language, is ridiculous,” he told the Guardian. “She has been left completely distraught by the court’s verdict today. It was one of the hardest phone calls I have ever had to make.”All five accused had been remanded in custody since the alleged incident on 3 September 2023. On Monday, they were allowed to walk free with lawyer Nir Yaslovitzh, who represented two of the men, telling Israel’s Channel 12: “It is a brave decision that completely rejected the complainant’s version and completely accepts our clients’ version.”Polak, who directs the London-based legal aid groupJustice Abroad, said the case was further proof of a sexist attitude in Cyprus’s “patriarchal” justice system. “Recently, the European court of human rights ruled that there is no effective protection for women subject to sexual offences in the Republic of Cyprus,” he added.“Unfortunately, nothing I have seen shows that there have been any improvements in this area.”He did not rule out the case being taken to the European court of human rights.In February, another British woman who also claimed she had been gang-raped in Ayia Napa by more than a dozen Israeli men in July 2019 won a “monumental victory” over Cypriot authorities afterthe Strasbourg-based tribunal ruledthey had “failed in their obligation to effectively investigate the applicant’s complaint of rape”.Judge Michalis Papathanasiou, sitting in Paralimni on Monday, had been the judge on the district court who had overseen the earlier case. Last year, the island’s supreme court not only overturned his decision but, in an unusual rebuke, criticised the way he had conducted proceedings, agreeing with the defendant’s lawyers that the trial process had been “manifestly unfair” and his “interruptions and interventions unjustified and inadmissible”.The Briton, who cannot be legally identified, had been described as “highly distressed” when, giving testimony to police, she recounted how she had been “taken by force” during a party around the pool area of the defendants’ hotel to a room and sexually assaulted.Women’s groups and campaigners voiced outrage as they reacted to the ruling, with some raising the prospect of the close diplomatic ties between Cyprus and Israel influencing Monday’s judgment.“What this shows is that Cypriot courts haven’t reflected at all on their past mistakes,” said Susana Pavlou, who heads the Mediterranean Institute of Gender Studies in Nicosia, the island’s capital. “We are shocked and appalled.”Pavlou said she had been particularly angered by the court’s argument that, although the woman had taken class A drugs and consumed a “significant amount” of alcohol, neither were enough to remove “her ability to consent”.“That was particularly shocking,” she said. “It is clear, more than ever, that judicial authorities in Cyprus continue to be influenced by stereotypical attitudes and beliefs in relation to victims of sexual violence and rape.” Research, she said, had shown that victims of sexual violence were “often considered unreliable witnesses” because of the lack of psychological and legal support navigating the judicial process.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Mauritius is one of the few countries in the region that has refused to take part in China’s belt and road initiative.Ministers have also argued that the UK has to give up the territory due tointernational legal rulings in favour of Mauritius, and that legal uncertainty over the legitimacy of the military base could compromise its security.The UK government revealed it would spare China from facing stronger rules as part of its register of foreign lobbyists coming into force on 1 July.Russia and Iran would both be included in the enhanced tier of the foreign influence registration scheme once it was launched this summer, Dan Jarvis, the security minister, told the Commons.The enhanced tier of the scheme is reserved for countries that pose a risk to UK national security. Anyone who is directed by Russia or Iran to carry out activities in the UK must declare it or face five years in prison.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Should ministers decide to impose stricter rules on China or any other countries such as North Korea, they will need to give three months’ notice of the change.Announcing greater restrictions on Russian activity, Jarvis said Moscow “presents an acute threat to UK national security” and that its “hostile acts have ranged from the use of a deadly nerve agent in Salisbury, espionage, arson and cyber-attacks, including the targeting of UK parliamentarians through spear-phishing campaigns”.In response Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, described China as the “elephant in the room” and said the country “engages in industrial-scale espionage, seeking to steal technology from government, universities and from industries. They repress Chinese citizens here and have sought to infiltrate our political system.”The foreign influence registration scheme was expected to come into force last year but the new Labour government delayed its implementation.Ministers said on Tuesday that they would work with business and academia to help them prepare for the scheme’s launch, and that there would be a three-month grace period to register existing ties with foreign states.Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsForeign policyDonald TrumpUS foreign policyLabourMauritiusForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

But the most closely watched contest isa battle for a seaton Wisconsin’s seven-member supreme court.Conservatives are trying to flip ideological control of the court, which currently has a 4-3 liberal majority. The contest, which features the liberal judge Susan Crawford facing off against the conservative Brad Schimel, will have huge consequences in the state.The supreme court isset to determine the future of abortionandcollective bargaining rights. The court could also ultimately require the state legislature to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts, which areheavily distortedin favor of Republicans, who control six of them.The race has become the most expensive judicial election in American history, with more than $80m spent on both sides. Elon Musk and groups aligned with him have spent more than $20m, and Musk traveled to the state over the weekend to distribute two $1m checks to voters as part of a sweepstakes-like contest. Musk’s investment in the race began shortlyafter Teslafiled a lawsuit challenging a state law that prevents the company from opening car dealerships in the state. It also comes as he has waged a dangerous attack on judges who block Trump’s executive actions.Trump endorsed Schimel in March.Advertising spending on behalf of Crawford ($42.1m) so far has exceeded that spent on Schimel’s behalf ($33.7m),according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political spending. That much spending is significantly more than the $51m spent on the 2023 state supreme court race and it is orders of magnitude more than was spent in the 2020 race, when candidatesspent a combined $10m.Democrats have seized on Musk’s entrance into the race and sought to energize voters disturbed by his efforts to gut the federal government and make the race a referendum on Trump’s two and a half months in office.After casting her ballot at Olbrich Botanical Gardens just before 9am in Madison, the state capital and a liberal stronghold, Jeannine Ramsey, 65, said she voted for Crawford and not the “Elon Musk-supported Brad Schimel”, who would not rule fairly on the issues most important to her.“I think it’s shameful that Elon Musk can come here and spend millions of dollars and try to bribe the citizens,” she said. “I don’t think it should be allowed. He doesn’t live in our state, and I don’t think he should be able to buy this election. It makes me angry.”She said she was cautious about getting her hopes up. “I live in a very blue bubble and I’ve been very disappointed in the past,” she said. “I thought I knew what people were thinking and feeling, and I was really surprised that people would send a convicted felon back into the presidential office.”Lemuel Anderson, 30, voted for Crawford early and said it was her environmental record that got his support.“It’s a really important race, because you have a lot of cases coming up in the next two years to theWisconsinsupreme court that will determine not only the trajectory of the state, but also the national trajectory,” he said.“The Wisconsin supreme court race is the first major test of Elon Musk’s political power since the November presidential race,” Ben Wikler, the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic party, said in an interview in March.In Florida, much of the attention will be on a special election to replace Mike Waltz, who resigned from Congress to serve as Trump’s national security adviser. Waltzeasily wonre-election last year in the sixth congressional district, which includes Daytona Beach, by 33 points in November. But there arenow concernsthat the race may be more competitive than expected.The Democratic candidate in the race, Josh Weil, has brought in more than $10m while his opponent, the Republican Randy Fine, still favored to win, has brought in around $1m. Weil has also campaigned by emphasizing the threats Muskposes to Medicare and social security.At the Church of Christ polling place in Daytona Beach on Tuesday, there were multiple cars with pro-Trump bumper stickers in the parking lot, including an Oldsmobile that had a “Trump Girl” sticker.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The volunteers for the Fine campaign only had a single folding chair.Victor Valentin, a Weil volunteer, said that this was the first time he had volunteered with a campaign. “I saw the hate that is out there,” he said. “Calling all immigrants or noncitizens ‘illegal’ or calling them ‘criminals’ is insane. I’m a Hispanic man from Puerto Rico, and those are my fellow Hispanic folks also. These are great people that come here to work hard. They come here to educate their kids.”Robert Craddock, a volunteer for the Fine campaign, was also outside the polling place. “Why in the world if you love America would you want to tear down America?” he said.Koralee Sanford, a Democrat, and her friend Diane, a Republican, who declined to give her last name, both went to vote together.“I want the United States to be back on budget. There is so much corruption – I’m talking about all of them over the years,Republicansand Democrats. And Trump is cleaning it up. I mean, that Doge is just haulin’ ass,” Diane said.“Corruption is also the main thing for me, and the money. We’re so far in debt,” Sanford said.Public and private polling has shown a closer than anticipated race,Axios reported last week. Fine is still favored to win the race, but if Weil comes within a closer than expected margin, it could still be a sign of momentum for Democrats.If Democrats were able to flip the seat, it would have significant reverberations in the US House. Republicans hold an extremely narrow 218-213 majority in the lower chamber (there are currently four vacant seats) and cannot afford to lose any advantage in their majority. The concern was so prominent that Trump last week pulled the nomination of Elise Stefanik to be his ambassador to the UN so Republicans could preserve their margin.The other special election on Tuesday is a contest in theFloridapanhandle to fill the seat once held by Matt Gaetz, who resigned when Trump nominated him to serve as attorney general and then later withdrew his nomination. The Republican Jimmy Patronis is expected to win the seat.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsWisconsinFloridaDonald TrumpRepublicansDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was pulled out from beneath the rubble and taken to Rome’s Saint’Eugenio, where he underwent several operations for burns to about 75% of his body.Doctors said a few days ago that Paterson, from East Kilbride in South Lanarkshire, was not conscious and his breathing was being “mechanically assisted”. His death was announced on Tuesday.View image in fullscreenRome’s mayor, Roberto Gualtieri, visiting the scene of the explosion.Photograph: Valentina Stefanelli/APPaterson had arrived in Rome on 17 March on a solo trip, visiting tourist sites including the Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, and the Colosseum.

Sheen used £100,000 of his own money to buy £1m of debt, which was then written off.Both programmes were able to buy large amounts of debt for so little because bad loans are often written down to a small percentage of their value on the secondary market.In their letter, Edelstyn and Powell’s lawyers said they “support Michael Sheen’s efforts to support those treated unjustly in the UK”, but that there were “questions as to the originality of the Channel 4 documentary” as “it focuses on a specific write-off target of £1m as a story hook [and] … grounds the debt write-off in a very specific locality”.They claim that Bank Job marked the “first time an action like this had been undertaken in the UK”, adding, “our client invites all of you (Full Fat TV, Channel 4 and Michael Sheen) to explain what you knew of our client’s work.”“It is difficult for our client not to conclude that its ideas have been used without its permission or, at the very least, cursory credit.”According to Edelstyn and Powell, the genesis of their film was 2014, when they secured partial funding for the project from the Guardian. Aware of Sheen’s work in social justice, theymade contact with his team in 2017, who replied saying: “We are working on a big debt project so we are interested in finding out more.”Emails show Edelstyn responded to say Optimistic, their production company, planned “to buy up and destroy a lot of predatory debt” and suggested “getting Michael involved in one way or another. Perhaps to be the voiceover of the film … given that Michael is an actor I’m sure he could really heist it up.”Subsequent correspondence included a video call with Sheen’s personal assistant, who said in a later email he hoped Sheen would visit them; it was “too early to say” if Sheen’s money could support their film but there were ambitions for “wider cultural impact … We’ll keep you in the loop.”Powell updated Sheen’s PA in December 2018, saying: “We have purchased and cancelled £1m local payday debt”, explaining the stunt wrote off more than £1m “of toxic high-interest debt in our local community” to highlight the debt crisis.The last correspondence was in June 2020, when Sheen’s PA replied to Optimistic saying their email would be forwarded to Sheen.According to the letter sent on behalf of Optimistic by lawyers Russells: “Bank Job premiered in May 2021 at Hot Docs international film festival followed by a UK cinema release and nominations for Bifa and Grierson awards. Our client understands that the production company Full Fat TV pitched their film in June 2021 and Channel 4 subsequently commissioned the idea in 2022.”A spokesperson for Full Fat TV said the company, “independently developed and pitched Michael Sheen’s Secret Million Pound Giveaway to Channel 4. It is a shame that an important message about the unfairness of the credit system in this country, which Michael spent £100,000 of his own money to highlight, risks being lost due to these unfounded claims.”Channel 4 said it did not know Sheen’s team had been in contact with Optimistic. A spokesperson added: “These two programmes are significantly different and it’s ludicrous to suggest that one is a copy of the other.“Buying and writing off debt is an established practice which has been covered in the media on multiple occasions and the commissioner who greenlit and worked on Michael Sheen’s Million Pound Giveaway had no awareness of Bank Job.”A spokesperson for Sheen said: “Michael has said many times that the inspiration for him doing something like this came from watching John Oliver buying medical bill debt in the US in 2016. Michael has long campaigned about debt inequality, which is why Full Fat TV came to him with their ambitious proposal.“They asked Michael to author a campaigning film to drive change in the debt and credit buying industry and to spend £100k of his own money to write off debt of people in his local community.“The production company had to demonstrate to Michael how that could be done and, once satisfied, Michael took an enormous personal and financial risk – pledging £100k of his own money. Michael was not paid for making the documentary. Michael is regularly pitched documentary ideas but only commits to the ones he really believes in.”Edelstyn and Powell have now made Bank Jobavailable free.Explore more on these topicsTelevision industryMichael SheenChannel 4Debt reliefDocumentaryTelevisionWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

But his utterly chaotic approach to looking after five kids turns this reality show into a nightmarishly stressful watchLucy ManganTue 1 Apr 2025 16.00 EDTShareOh man. I really thought this was going to be the one. I thought Stacey & Joe, the new reality show starring Stacey Solomon and Joe Swash and their 800 children (five) would let me escape and forget the troubles of the world. Because I like Joe Swash (for it is impossible to dislike Joe Swash. I mean, disliking Joe Swash is not a thing. You won’t. You can’t.) and I absolutely love Stacey Solomon. Her wit, kindness, radiant energy and endless charisma, plus her ability to bring order out of chaos in Sort Your Life Out heals something deep in my soul.So I was greatly looking forward to seeing them all live in their gorgeous, fully storage-solutioned house in Essex, a peek into a life running – unlike mine – along well-ordered lines, with a place for everything and everything in its place.But it’s chaos. Mostly because of Joe bloody Swash. Give Stacey full control and I bet we’d see something magnificent. I bet the Platonic ideal of motherhood would emerge: a lovingly regimented schedule for the kids that got them off to school smoothly – fed, washed, and in time every morning; an efficiently planned work diary with meetings running to time and deadlines for all her ventures effortlessly met; then quality time in the evenings with the children once their homework and art projects were done, reading diaries signed and bags and lunches prepped for the next day.But Joeisthere. Don’t get me wrong, he is clearly a caring father – as much to the two boys from Stacey’s previous relationship as to the three under-fives they have together. “They may not be my biological kids,” he says (almost tearfully, because all of Joe’s emotions live touchingly close to the surface), “but I’m telling you – if I’d had the choice, I’d have had them.” He clearly loves Stacey with all his heart and other parts of his anatomy (“I’d grab Stacey all day long, but for her there’s a time and a place”) and he certainly means well. Which is lovely, obviously, but does it make up for the fact that he’s utterly useless? He is meant to be a househusband while Stacey works. The definition of “househusband” is surely “someone with almost total responsibility for running domestic matters, both day-to-day and long term, thus freeing the other half of a couple to concentrate on professional and any other concerns, so that both partners may benefit the whole.”What does Joe do? He pops out for an hour to get an anniversary present while she starts preparing for their huge family dinner, in-laws included, and is gone all afternoon. Must be home by 10am from a fishing trip with his pals (“Why is ‘Try my hardest’ part of that sentence?” asks Stacey when she rings to remind him of his promise) so he can take care of the wee ones while Stacey holds an important meeting at home about a proposed new fragrance launch. Is hours late. He does the shopping and forgets nappies. Goes out for nappies precisely when they need all hands on deck packing for their summer holiday in time to catch their flight. “I’m always … one step behind time” says Joe. Stacey is clearer. “I just don’t think he thinks. Whereas I feel like I spend my life thinking, ‘Have I done that, did I remember that … I dunno’,” she adds. “When I come back, I wanna be Joe Swash. It’s an easy life.”They have no childminder or other help apart from Stacey’s lovely dad Dave, who comes across the lens almost as beautifully as his daughter. “My grandchildren are my absolute world. You don’t know until you’ve got them.” But my hopes and dreams of a reality show, a couple and a family that don’t send my blood pressure through the roof, who could be aspirational instead of …thislie broken on the ground. Fragments and dust. Stacey – I have questions, but of course I don’t blame you. Joe – I have no questions. Every woman knows you and your people and has a lot of answers. Come see us and we will instil them and return you to Stacey a new man. It will sort her life out no end.Stacey & Joe aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionReality TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

The book is “a compact, comic tour-de-force”, said judge Jude Cook. “It interrogates postcolonial legacies, domestic abuse and a young girl’s rite of passage into adulthood with the lightest of touches.”There’s a Monster Behind the Door is Bélem’s first of two novels. The French edition won the Grand Prix du Roman Métis and the Prix André Dubreuil du Premier Roman. Bélem also teaches secondary school students and works as an associate judge in a juvenile court.Her “tragi-comedy novel disrupts the tired trope of the trauma novel and is equally brutal in its critique of postcolonial narratives”, said judge Alice Jolly. “The writing is lively, supple and vigorous. The work of the translators who have brought this book to English-speaking audiences must also be celebrated.”The book’s publisher, Bullaun Press, was set up in 2021 by Bridget Farrell to focus on literature in translation. The press’s name comes from the Irish word for a stone with a manmade hollow that holds water at its centre,bullán. “Many bullauns around the country are traditionally associated with magical, healing or holy properties,” reads the publisher’s website.Shortlisted alongside the winning book were Invisible Dogs by Charles Boyle, published by CB Editions; How to Leave the World by Marouane Bakhti, translated by Lara Vergnaud and published by Divided Publishing; Célina by Catherine Axelrad, translated by Philip Terry, published by Les Fugitives; and Mother Naked by Glen James Brown, published by Peninsula Press.All longlisted presses received £500 each.

I just got a message from someone I knew years ago to say they’d seen the news about the award, watched the show and finally felt able to say they were also abused. That moved me to tears. Again!”Comedian and writer O’Sullivan – co-star of cult Channel 4 sitcom Lee & Dean and creator of ITV teen drama Tell Me Everything – is now launching the weekly podcast Making Lemonade. It explores the healing power of creating something positive out of negative experiences, after his own life was radically transformed by his deeply personal film, confronting the abuse he suffered as a child. When he was 12, O’Sullivan began to be sexually assaulted by a member of his extended family. He reported it to the police when he was in his 30s. The culprit was convicted, imprisoned and has since died. Last May’s Channel 4 documentary followed O’Sullivan’s attempt to make mirth from what he endured, by creating an 18-minute TV comedy about his experiences, which was available online on Channel 4. It made for audacious TV, by turns heartbreaking and darkly hilarious.The positive outcomes of the show are reflected in his podcast’s title – which is about the power in making the proverbial lemonade out of the lemons that life throws at you.“Creating my documentary has helped me more than anything else,” he says. “I’ve had so much therapy over the last few decades. I’ve done them all: sitting down talking, tapping your face and following the dot, lying on the floor shaking, a psilocybin retreat in the Netherlands. It was all helpful but what made the biggest difference was doing the documentary. I have a completely different relationship to my past now. This thing that had dominated every day of my life no longer has the same hold over me. I can’t describe how wonderful that is. I’ve been through some nasty stuff but speaking about it has been the best thing I’ve ever done.”For O’Sullivan, it proved the therapeutic power of creative expression in overcoming hardship. “It’s the act of going: ‘It’s really shit, this thing that I’ve been given, this thing I can’t just put down. But I can choose what it looks like and how heavy it is. I can make something new out of it.’ Difficult stuff often gives us a fuel that we wouldn’t necessarily have otherwise. I’ve spoken to many people about their horrible experiences. Most eventually say: ‘But if the bad thing hadn’t happened, I wouldn’t be doing this good thing.’ That’s what Making Lemonade is about.”Guests in early episodes include broadcaster Nicky Campbell, Charlotte Nichols, the Labour MP for Warrington North, athlete Iwan Thomas and comedian Anna Morris, each talking candidly about the challenges they’ve faced and the positives that have emerged from them. Campbell, who went public in 2022 about being physically abused and molested at Edinburgh Academy school, was the first guest on O’Sullivan’s wishlist.“Our experiences have lots in common,” he says. “When Nicky started speaking out, I felt grateful that someone of his profile was being so open. He’s done incredible campaigning work since. I was over the moon when he said yes. He speaks about how making music has helped him, as well as setting up support communities. That’s an important point. When I say creating something, I don’t only mean artistically. It can be tangible or it can happen inside us. Any type of post-traumatic growth. Everyone’s lemonade is different. I’m not saying: ‘Paint an egg! Do a collage!’ Nothing against collages or egg-painting. I’m just saying that good can come out of any situation.”After the response to My Sexual Abuse: The Sitcom, O’Sullivan became an ambassador for the rape and sexual abuse support charity The Survivors Trust. It’s a move that makes sense considering how many survivors have been touched by his work. Since the documentary aired, thousands of victims have been in touch. “For months, I was getting multiple messages daily,” says O’Sullivan. “It’s still very regular. People thank me for sharing my experience and say they now feel able to share theirs. Some finally went to the police or told their partner. I feel two things about that: sad there are so many people going through such pain and happy I’ve played a small role in allowing them to say it out loud.”Labour party politician Nichols clearly benefits from this approach during her appearance on Making Lemonade, albeit discussing a different issue – her experience of antisemitic threats. “That was a really moving but also fun conversation. Charlotte talks about having post-traumatic stress disorder and how she copes. What’s come out of it is that it’s only strengthened her drive to help people. It’s made her even more determined to bring about change.” But alongside the famous names are ordinary people with extraordinary stories. “It’s important for me to feature people not in the public eye,” says O’Sullivan. “This needs to be relatable and universal. None of us go through life untouched by awful things. You might not have heard of some guests but they’re just as inspiring.”These include Andrea Brady, who founded a charity after losing her 27-year-old daughter Jess to cancer. “That’s a helluva conversation,” says O’Sullivan. “I’m welling up thinking about it. Coming out of lockdown, Jess was ill and being turned away by doctors with: ‘It’s probably long Covid’. By the time they discovered stage 4 adenocarcinoma, it was too late. Jess died three weeks later. Andrea became a campaigner by accident to improve diagnosis of cancer in young adults.” Her proposed legislation calls for patients’ cases to be elevated for review after the third contact with their GP surgery. “It’s called Jess’s Law,” says O’Sullivan. “They’ve already got doctors doing things differently and saving lives.”Matt Hollingham, a PhD student whose partner Lovisa was killed by a speeding car, talks about what he’s doing in her memory. “That’s another difficult conversation but he is such an admirable young man,” says O’Sullivan. “If I’d have had anything like Matt’s strength and outlook at his age, I don’t know what I’d have achieved by now.” He meets Dan Breeze, a victim of the infected blood scandal. “Dan’s episode is a bit different,” says O’Sullivan. “We follow his journey to making his lemonade, from its inception to a live premiere of his work.”Although it’s made in association with Acast and Spirit Studios, Making Lemonade is entirely crowdfunded and produced by volunteers. “I didn’t know if anyone would donate but lots did. People have lent their expertise for free. That generosity and support enabled me to get the podcast on its feet. Maybe one day we’ll get a sponsorship deal with R White’s. Or Fentimans if we’re posh enough.”He stresses that he’s a beginner at this podcast business. “I’m no expert, I’m just some prick. I don’t interview people as such, we just chat. I try not to speak too much myself because I get irritated by podcasts going: ‘Today, we’re talking to this person …’ then you barely hear from them. Tone-wise, I aimed for something like Cariad Lloyd’s Griefcast, which I adore. Things get emotional but there’s lots of laughter as well. Being daft is my happy place, so I find humour where I can. It’s a sanity valve. I hope listeners send in their own experiences, too. I want to create a safe space where we share stories from everyone.”He’s all too aware of the prevailing podcast landscape. “Let’s face it, nobody needs yet another podcast from a white, middle-aged man,” he laughs. “It’s fucking ridiculous. That’s why it’s vital to feature people from all walks of life with all manner of experiences. Everything feels shit out there. We need as much light as we can get. This podcast is about that, as much as the dark stuff. I hope listeners will be inspired, either to give themselves a pat on the back for what they’ve already managed, or to do that thing that’s been nagging away at the back of their mind. Making sense, making peace, making something – it’s all making. Trauma can destroy lives. What better response to destruction than creation?”If O’Sullivan’s experiences are anything to go by, it might even win you an RTS award. “I worked out that the last thing I won was an Easter egg at the primary school raffle in 1986,” concludes O’Sullivan. “So I reckon I was due something!”Making Lemonadelaunches on 2 April on all podcast providers.

Why are none of the new Beatles cast from Liverpool?Peter BradshawSo Sam Mendes has cast his Beatles tetralogy, but none are from Merseyside. Don’t worry, I’ve just invented the Beatles Cinematic UniverseTue 1 Apr 2025 08.32 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 09.19 EDTShareSam Mendeshas announcedthe cast for his colossal four-film Beatles extravaganza:Harris Dickinsonas John, Paul Mescal as Paul, Barry Keoghan as Ringo and Joseph Quinn as George – and to tumultuous acclaim he brought his Fab Four on stage at the CinemaCon event in Las Vegas, a now well-established affair in the film world, incidentally, satirised in a forthcoming episode of Seth Rogen’s TV comedyThe Studio.I’m sorry to say, however, that Sam has almost entirely ignoredthe casting suggestionsthat I made in February last year. For what this is worth, I went with Leo Woodall as Paul, Finn Wolfhard as George, Harry Melling as Ringo and Barry Keoghan as John (though Barry got Ringo in the end). But I like to think that Sam Mendes and his producer Pippa Harris were thinking on more or less the same lines as me. Interestingly, there are no American actors doing Brit accents – just the kind of well-trained British or Irish actors who can fabricate perfect American accents for American roles elsewhere.But wait. No Merseyside actors! Without wishing to get stuck into an identity politics controversy, this could be an issue. So please allow me to suggest a second, concurrent four-film special to run alongside this tetralogy (surely Apple or Netflix can pay for it) which Sam can direct in his spare time, all about four people from the Beatles Cinematic Universe, with a strict Liverpool-only casting rule.Stephen Graham in Jim, the story of Paul McCartney’s dadView image in fullscreenStephen Graham.Photograph: Gavin Bond/The ObserverThere can hardly be a more respected actor anywhere in the world right now thanStephen Graham, who can portray Jim McCartney, father of Paul and Mike (this could be Chris Mason from TV’s Riverdale), a formidable and demanding personality who loved music. This standalone film will show his early manhood playing in a jazz band with Paul’s uncle Jack (played by Paul McGann), his meet-cute with nurse Mary (I’m thinking Amelia Warner) and his encouragement of young Paul – also big scenes such as meeting Princess Margaret (played here by Liverpool actor Emily Fairn) at the premiere of A Hard Day’s Night.Jodie Comer in Mo, the story of Maureen Starkey TigrettView image in fullscreenJodie Comer in The Bikeriders.Photograph: Courtesy of Focus Features/APJodie Comer can pull out the stops here, playing Ringo’s fiery first wife Mo, the convent school-educated manicurist and hairdresser who was a Beatles fan from the Cavern days before she was a Beatles spouse – getting into face-clawing scraps with other jealous Beatles fans. She gets pregnant at 18 and Brian Epstein (a crossover cameo for David Morrissey) arranges for Ringo and Mo to get married. There’s a scene in which Frank Sinatra (played here by Ian Hart) records a special version of The Lady Is a Tramp for Mo’s birthday.David Morrissey in Brian, the story of the Beatles’ troubled manager Brian EpsteinView image in fullscreenBrian Epstein.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesMorrissey can play Brian Epstein, starting in Liverpool where the family had a music shop – and where Jim McCartney once bought a piano (Stephen Graham can have a crossover cameo here). In London, Brian gets arrested for cottaging, drops out of Rada and finally moves into the music business where he discovers the Beatles and shows his inner steel by sacking Pete Best and finally we see Epstein’s terrible loneliness and depression.Peter Serafinowicz in Ed, the story of Ed SullivanView image in fullscreenThe Beatles with Ed Sullivan.Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesLiverpool-bornPeter Serafinowiczcan portray the American legend Ed Sullivan, who was a nationally syndicated newspaper columnist before he invented his top-rated TV show and it was his destiny to be for ever associated with the Beatles, as the man who introduced them to the American public and gave them global fame. Before this, a car crash and hospitalisation had meant that he had missed out on introducing Elvis personally on his show and so he was determined to be associated with the Beatles. The movie would show his somewhat Trumpian temper and grudges against other bands such as Buddy Holly and the Crickets, but also his sentimental attachment to the Fab Four.Explore more on these topicsThe Beatles filmsThe BeatlesSam MendesPaul MescalBarry KeoghanStephen GrahamJodie ComercommentShareReuse this content"

For example, one might put All Summer Long on their wedding do-not-play list because Kid Rock’s alwayshanging out with Trump.One might indeed!Any other examples?Well one interviewee, Rebecca Keren Jablonski, a Manhattan rabbi, told the NYT that as well as giving the DJ at her wedding a list of songs shedidwant to dance to, she also made a list of what to avoid. Namely Kanye West.Because of hisvile undisguised antisemitism?Quite. In an article in The Times, also reporting on “do not play” lists, Ben Boylan, the founder of Non-Traditional Wedding DJs, said R Kelly and P Diddy were the other artists who, like Kanye, were regularly vetoed by couples.Seems reasonable.But there are other reasons for omitting an artist beyond any controversies. It could be on the grounds of genre and taste (you might just really hate a popular song), explicit lyrics, knowing family members and what they like (death metal might be your go-to genre, but it’s unlikely to be a floor-filler), etc.Grandma’s not into grime or drill?Exactly. The NYT spoke to a wedding DJ called Don Woodbury in Salt Lake City, who gets clients to list five to 10 songs they want him to avoid.Would it not be easier just to get a list of songs theydowant?Oi, this is about do not play lists, OK? Another wedding DJ told of a couple who banned Justin Timberlake, because the bride said: “I have a problem with Justin Timberlake since he ripped Janet Jackson’s bra off at the Super Bowl.”Good reason! Get on that list, Timberlake. I’m also rethinking Michael Jackson.That’s a tricky one– such is his enduring popularity, the consensus is he’s possibly too big to cancel. But, really, it can just be that you don’t like a song.Do say:“Yeah, who cares that it’s the new in-laws’ favourite: Sweet Caroline is top of the do not play list.”Don’t Say:“Hey DJ, play YMCA!

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Sweet, smoked, hot … What’s the difference between the various paprikas? And are there any substitutes?“Paprika brings warmth, it brings colour and it brings another layer of flavour,” says Monika Linton, founder ofBrindisa. “Even just a sprinkling over goat’s cheese on toast, hummus or any kind of dip, along with a bit of olive oil, will bring it to life.” Crucial to both Spanish and Hungarian cuisines, paprika is made by drying peppers (generally speaking, Hungarian varieties are air-dried whereas the Spanish stuff is smoke-dried) and grinding them to a fine powder. The taste, meanwhile, depends on the variety of pepper used, although, as Linton points out, not all tins of paprika specify that.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“Paprika brings a certain richness,” says Jeremy Salamon, author ofSecond Generationand chef/owner of Hungarian restaurantAgi’s Counterin New York. “It has this unique, vegetal, unripe fruit-like quality, and lends itself in different ways to different dishes.” While he generally has sweet (“to use as a flavour base to build on with other spices”) and smoked (“to whip into butters”) to hand, hot paprika always comes out tops: “I like the kick it adds, so I’ll use it in chicken paprikash or in a pimento cheese dip.”Linton, meanwhile, always has four Spanish paprikas, orpimentón, on the go: smoked (ahumado), sweet and mild (dulce), hot (picante) and bittersweet (agridulce). “Unsmoked are fruitier and somehow fresher, so I’d use those for rice dishes, which are generally not a long, slow cook,” she says. “You’re not trying to impregnate everything for hours on end with flavour; instead, you want the feeling of sunshine.” That’s why it could also play a part in eastern Mediterranean-style meze, Linton adds: “They suit a fresher, more tomatoey paprika.”When it comes to smoked paprika, its most high-profile coupling is probably with chorizo. At home, though, remember that a little goes a long way: “It’s such a big flavour, so use it sparingly,” Linton says. It pairs particularly nicely with legumes and chickpeas: “They tend to require quite a long cook, and somehow don’t get overwhelmed.” Slow-cooked meat dishes and stews also thrive in its company, especially if you’re usingpimentón de la vera, which is made from the sweet-smoky agridulce variety of jaraíz pepper, saysJosé Pizarro. “The smokiness is incredible, and really balanced – it lifts all the other flavours,” says the restaurateur, whose new book,The Spanish Pantry, is published in June. He uses it especially in salads, soups and with vegetables (think potatoes): “It’s the taste I grew up with.”Whether you go for hot smoked paprika, though, really comes down to personal taste. Guardian regularRukmini Iyer, for example, punts for the hot stuff in aone-tin curry, combining it with turmeric, ground cumin and ground ginger, then adding grated garlic, yoghurt, oil, onion, paneer, cauliflower florets and some salt in a baking tin before roasting for half an hour. Finish with a squeeze of lemon, plus some chopped coriander and red chilli, and that’s dinner sorted.As for substitutes, you do have some options, though perhaps unsurprisingly they all involve peppers. “Soak a whole dried pepper in water, scrape out the flesh and add it to a sauce, bolognese or whatever it is that you’re cooking,” Linton says. Otherwise, simply drop in the pepper whole: “Let it infuse the dish, like a bouquet garni, then discard it at the end of cooking.” Alternatively, get yourself some pepper paste: “That’s good if you want a lot of pepper flavour,” she says, but for a really deep, savoury hit, it’s much better just to get yourself a pot of paprika.Got a culinary dilemma?

But equally, in today’s tough job market, not using AI wisely as part of your search could mean you miss out. It’s a tricky balancing act to harness the technology’s power without losing the human touch.You can use AI models such asChatGPTandPerplexityto research employers, competitors and industry trends before applying for a job.Hannah Salton, a careers coach, says some of her clients have successfully used AI to find out more about companies, allowing them to “gain insights into culture, competitors and market positioning. It can also help identify SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] to apply to or network with.”‘It’s nightmarish’: why 1.5m Britons are still hunting for a jobRead moreShe says: “For example, you can askChatGPTto suggest SMEs with marketing teams based in your city if that’s who you are targeting. However, AI models aren’t always accurate, so cross-check your results using other sources.”AI can also be used to help you to spot shifts in your industry and identify the skills needed to future-proof your career.For example,JobsGPT, a tool from SmarterX, can analyse how a role in your industry is evolving, breaking it down into specific tasks and assessing which parts are most exposed to automation. This could help you to work out whether there are skills you need to acquire, or if you should consider moving into a more in-demand area.Eloise Skinner, a careers coach, says her clients also use AI to find industries and roles that match their skills and values, helping them to think beyond the jobs they would normally consider. Jobseekers can ask ChatGPT and Perplexity to suggest roles that align with their particular skills, passion and experience, for example.She says: “AI can suggest roles based on previous experience, values, ambitions and strongest skill sets. It might also summarise information about an industry or job, such as career prospects, work-life balance or salary expectations, helping candidates decide where to apply.”Stay humanHung Lee, the founder of theRecruiting Brainfoodnewsletter, says jobseekers often rush their applications because they are afraid that roles will be snapped up quickly. This urgency drives many to use AI to speed up the process. “It’s become an arms race,” he says. This trend has led to recruiters receiving a flood of generic AI-generated applications.View image in fullscreen‘I’m looking for candidates who sound human, showcase their unique voice,’ said one recruiter.Photograph: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/RexMartha Brook, who founded and runs her own stationery brand, says: “I recently received over 2,000 applications for a role within a week, and spotting AI-generated copy was surprisingly easy – it was an instant turn-off and in most cases led to immediate rejection.”She adds: “Aside from the obvious copy-and-paste jobs from ChatGPT, many applications regurgitated the job description and sounded generic. In a pool of thousands, I’m looking for candidates who sound human, showcase their unique voice and show they’ve done their research rather than relying on AI to do the heavy lifting.”Make sure your application stands out by sharing specific reasons for your interest in the role. Maybe you have used the company’s products, or its mission fits with your values. Tools such as ChatGPT, Grammarly and Hemingway can improve your grammar, clarity and readability, but use AI to refine your writing rather than create your application. Showcasing individuality and genuine enthusiasm is vital.Beat the screening systemsMany large companies now use AI-powered applicant tracking systems (ATS) to screen CVs before they reach a human. These systems scan applications for particular keywords and phrases, ranking them based on how well they match the job description.“One of my clients was struggling with a wordy CV,” says Salton. “They used ChatGPT to highlight their key skills more concisely. But they were careful to keep their authentic voice.” For example, you could prompt ChatGPT to “refine my CV for clarity to highlight my key skills and experience in a concise, engaging way while preserving my voice”.Sign up toLinkedIn Premium Career(£29.99 a month after a free trial), and you benefit from a host of AI-powered jobseeking tools.These include a profile-writing assistant that also acts as a CV enhancer. You can refine your headline and summary, which LinkedIn claims can make you visible for nearly twice as many job opportunities. You can also highlight three advertised jobs a month as top choices, making your profile stand out to recruiters with a verified badge and a personalised message when applying.And you can also message recruiters directly, even without being connected. LinkedIn is rolling out a job-match feature that shows you how your skills and experience fit particular jobs to focus your search.Sharpen interview skillsUse the AI interview tool alongside practice with real people, recruiters advise.Photograph: LumiNola/GettyAI can be a useful interview practice tool. “Saying your answers out loud provides a more natural and immersive practice experience,” says Skinner. “It helps you hear how you actually sound, which can be revealing. But use it alongside practice with real people – that’s still essential.”ChatGPT’s advanced voice mode, for example, can provide feedback on your delivery. This can pinpoint weak areas that you need to work on, building confidence for the real event. Open ChatGPT and activate the voice mode on the search bar. Ask it to conduct a mock interview for a particular role after providing the job details and give feedback on your answers.Platforms such asGoogle’s digital skills trainingoffer AI-powered career coaching so that you can speak clearly about your achievements.However, be prepared at an actual interview to discuss your AI usage if it played a role in the application process. Transparency about how you used AI to prepare can demonstrate adaptability and a practical approach to technology.And, just as with your CV, Julia Morgon, a director at the recruitment agency Brook Street, says: “Don’t forget to inject your own personality into an interview. What makes you different from your colleagues is what employers see the most value in. AI can’t help you stand out as an individual on the day.”Know your worthUse AI-powered platforms such asGlassdoorandPayscaleto research potential salaries and boost your negotiating position. You may discover, for example, that some companies consistently pay above the market rate. AI-powered salary tools can also highlight regional salary differences and remote working pay variations.As roles evolve, salaries change, too. The average British worker changes jobs every five years, according to a study by the insurer LV=. Understanding these trends is vital when negotiating an offer.For more detailed salary insights, platforms such as Totaljobs and Reed can provide up-to-date pay data based on industry, location and experience level. This could help you benchmark offers more accurately.Tom Buckell, a director at the recruitment company Manpower UK, says you can use what you learned in your research in your contract negotiations, asking about flexibility around shifts, for examples, or opportunities for training. “This also gives you more options for increasing non-salary related benefits if your potential employer can’t meet your wage expectations,” he adds.Explore more on these topicsJob huntingMoney hacksArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatGPTWork & careersWork-life balancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

What is it doing to us?Chloë HamiltonTue 1 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 13.11 EDTShare‘Alexlilly1999* has left you feedback!” pings the Vinted notification. My stomach flips as the app loads and I open my review: “Quite good.” A gut punch. I sit in shock, scrutinising the words in front of me. “Good” is a bit uninspired but “quite” feels both passive-aggressive and viciously spiteful:quitegood. Alexlilly1999 has also given me just four stars. It’s a lukewarm write-up considering the dress I sold them was good quality, a brilliant price and shipped quickly. I glare at the review. And then another notification pops up: do I want to leave feedback for the buyer? Well, yes, actually, I do.It’s likely we’ve all, at some stage, been asked to leave feedback online. Called your electricity provider with a query? Please answer a few quick questions about the service you received. Had something delivered by a courier? Please rate your experience. Often, the promise of prizes – from £200 worth of high street vouchers, to spa trips and luxury hampers – is dangled in exchange for our appraisals. We’re asked to judge the people who serve us coffee; drive us in taxis; cut our hair; extract our teeth. A friend of a friend was recently asked to leave feedback for an interview process just moments after the company had rejected them for the role.The odd thing is, lots of us do leave feedback. Perhaps it has become normalised to mark, out of five, the toilet plunger we bought at 2am – or perhaps we’ve been influenced by “influencer culture”, in which everyone can (and does) have an opinion. Lots of us also, of course, like getting feedback, with positive ratings on platforms like Uber,Airbnband Vinted becoming badges of honour.View image in fullscreenDoes your new purchase cut the mustard?Photograph: Posed by model; filadendron/Getty ImagesAccording to a study byPower Reviews, 98% of consumers see reviews as an essential part of the decision-making process and 45% of users won’t buy a product if there aren’t any reviews. Ratings, it seems, have become so ubiquitous that an absence of them is an automatic red flag.But while, on the face of it, authentic, real-world information about goods and services may seem helpful – necessary, even – one can’t help but wonder what this culture of mutual surveillance is doing to our brains – and our lives. If every decision is judged, often publicly, how long before it starts to change the way we interact?For Helen Plyconic, it already has. The 45-year-old has a 4.12 (out of 5) rating on Uber – a ranking so low it can, reportedly, mean some Uber drivers refuse to pick you up (although the company itself says destination and fare are more likely to drive a driver’s decision to turn down a booking). The Walthamstow resident, who says she has never been rude or drunk in an Uber, believes her rating is low because she once missed a taxi when her phone ran out of battery after booking, and she jumped in a friend’s cab instead. While she concedes this was her fault, she has, since then, received consistently low ratings for reasons, she thinks, such as needing help with her bags (she had three children with her) and a driver having to change a pickup point due to closed roads. As a result, she has begun to alter her behaviour, tipping extra-generously and even explaining her predicament to drivers, all to no avail.The Vinted phenomenon: how one woman sold her clothes – and created a billion-dollar companyRead moreA self-confessed people pleaser, Plyconic now feels anxious each time she takes an Uber. “Do I chat to show I’m friendly or be silent so as not to upset them?” she says. She describes, too, how drivers even tell her how lucky she is they picked her up, given her poor rating. “I then question why they did, and wonder if they are dodgy themselves.” (Riders, incidentally, can check their drivers’ ratings, meaning Plyconic could, if she wanted, refuse a driver if she deemed their rating too low. She would, however, incur a £5 cancellation fee.)Anxiety specialist Vic Paterson – who, when we speak, is considering how best to review her dog walker – says she has noticed her clients struggling with this constant feedback culture. “While specific research on ubiquitous rating systems is still developing, therapists and psychologists – including me – are noticing recurring patterns,” she says. “Many clients [experience] increased self-consciousness during everyday interactions that may be rated.” Paterson suggests that, although the rise of online reviews and ratings “gives opportunities to those who might otherwise not speak up”, the endless and sometimes seemingly needless requests for feedback are changing how people interact, on both sides of the transaction.“Now, I’m greeted cheerily by name when I collect a coffee – not always what I want – because the server is concerned about how I might rate them, which forces me into an interaction,” she says. “The delivery driver could be having a horrible day and just want to get stuff done, but if I want to have a quick chat, they’re forced to spend some time in case I rate them poorly. I have no way to tell whether their cheery chat is authentic or based around their need for a five-star review,” she says. “When everyday encounters become potential evaluations, it may change how freely we express ourselves.” From a psychological perspective, Paterson says, there is reason for “thoughtful concern about constantly outsourcing evaluation of our performance to others” – especially if those “others” may have their own agenda.Members of the public threaten to leave over-embellished reviews, fake reviews, if they don’t get their wayLast year, 42-year-old Sam Morgan, who owns and runs eight restaurants across the north-west, the Midlands and north Wales, was blackmailed by fraudsters threatening to post fake one-star reviews across the restaurants’ online platforms unless the company sent them £2,000. When Morgan and his business partner, chef Andy Sheridan, didn’t comply, the extortionists began to post negative reviews on Google and Tripadvisor, claiming the wine list was “overpriced” and even that the restaurant itself was a “scam”.Although Morgan, who used to work in law enforcement before moving into the hospitality industry, describes the experience as “a challenging time” that took its toll, he says their restaurants are still, in a way, being held to ransom – but by customers. “The fraudster, that was at the most extreme end,” he says. “But this is an everyday occurrence in respect of members of the public leaving what we would call over-embellished reviews, fake reviews, threatening to leave these reviews if they don’t get their way.” This, he says, is the bigger problem.Morgan has short shrift, too, for the review platforms themselves, saying it was only once his team had gone to the press that they acted. “They [Google and Tripadvisor] weren’t interested in dealing with it,” he says. “They don’t do any checks.” Neither Tripadvisor nor Google responded to a request for comment but, previously, a spokesperson for Google told the BBC: “Our policies clearly state that reviews must be based on real experiences and information. We’ve looked into this case and are removing the policy-violating content.”View image in fullscreenEven as you rate your lunch, the cafe owner may be rating you.Photograph: Posed by models; Tom Werner/Getty ImagesPerhaps Morgan should take a leaf out of restaurateur Chris D’Sylva’s book. The owner ofDorian in Notting Hill– supposedly David Beckham’s favourite restaurant – reviews diners using a behind-the-scenes system torecord their behaviour and rank them accordingly. But, although Morgan reveals they have banned guests before, he says he wouldn’t introduce a similar system. “Ranking or scoring is a little extreme and, to be honest, would be hypocritical of me when I don’t like the purpose of review sites,” he says. “I do, however, wonder how guests would feel if we created a ‘GuestAdvisor’ and [reviewed] their behaviour online.”Quite apart from the looming sense that we’re under constant observation, the very act of leaving feedback also takes time – something many of us feel we don’t have. “I’ve just stopped giving feedback now,” says 38-year-old Daisy Ferns, a business owner from Derby. In the last few days, she tells me, she has been asked to leave a review for a hotel stay, a vitamin purchase, something she bought from Boots, an Uber trip, a courier delivery and a returns process. “I don’t mind a tick box thing but it’s a lot of brain power to think of comments.” She worries, though, that if she doesn’t engage, it will reflect badly on her. “If I don’t rate them, will they not rate me or rate me badly?”‘The customer isn’t always right’: top chef loses appetite for difficult dinersRead moreAs fed up with feedback as we may be, it is pertinent to remember that some people – small businesses, especially – live and die by their reviews. And reviews can still have their uses. I devour online reviews of clothing, for example, before making a purchase, picking apart customers’ thoughts on style, fabric, and – especially useful given how different sizing is across brands – fit. Paterson agrees this is one of the benefits: public feedback is a “form of social proof” that reduces anxiety around unknown experiences, whether you’re worried about the cleanliness of anAirbnbor the sizing of a River Island skirt.However, it’s worth questioning the authenticity of some reviews. The rise of fraudulent feedback has become so prolific thatnew laws under the Digital Markets and Competition and Consumer Act, coming in on 6 April, include the banning of submitting and commissioning fake reviews. Helen Dewdney,the Complaining Cow consumer expert, says AI reviews, in particular, are often easy to spot: “They are bland, lacking in emotion or feeling and appear to have no strong opinion about the subject of the review.”Constructive feedback can also drive improvements. Certainly, the buyer on Vinted who flagged, politely, that my packaging hadn’t been sufficiently sturdy made me rethink how I was sending out my items. And there will always be people, as well, who go the extra mile in search of praise, such as the seller who sent extra treats – some wax melts – for me in my parcel (along with a note reminding me to confirm delivery and leave a review). This particular seller had five-star reviews across the board, glowing write-ups and – I noted with interest – repeat custom, so her approach is clearly working.The more we are canvassed for online feedback, the less value it may come to hold. Paterson believes that “unsolicited feedback is generally seen as more genuine because it wasn’t prompted”, adding that readers tend to give this feedback more weight, too.As I finish my drink in a cafe, I notice a card on the table in front of me: a QR code requesting feedback on my experience. Instead, I approach the till and, taking a deep breath, thank the barista for my coffee, for the pleasant space and for their hard work. He is taken aback. “You’re welcome,” he beams. “We put a lot of effort in, so it’s nice when it’s noticed and people say.”* This name has been changedExplore more on these topicsRetail industryOnline shoppingAirbnbfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To be able to fish the River Itchen for free is a gift; this is the same river that Frederic Halford and GEM Skues fished more than 100 years ago, starting fly-fishing as we know it today. Shrimp and caddis patterns work best for fly fishing here. It’s rare to see rising trout in these town waters except during the mayfly season so time your fishing trip appropriately if it’s trout you’re after. The mayfly season is not exact but it tends to run between late May and early June here.winchester.gov.ukStroud, GloucestershireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bill BoadenThe stretch of the River Frome which snakes behind Dr Newton’s Way is recovering from an industrial past which saw its waters used to power corn mills, woollen mills and even the production of walking sticks and umbrellas. Today there is fly life present, encouraging brown trout and grayling. Trout tend to be small but there is potential for larger catches and it’s well worth having a go if you’re visiting Stroud. This is classic urban fishing; use a shorter rod to cast between trees and other obstacles but not so short that you can’t roll cast (a useful technique that allows you to flick the fly out without a back cast).stroud.gov.ukLlanidloes, PowysVisitors flock to the small Welsh town of Llanidloes, with its picturesque high street, organic food shops and national collection of antique quilts. To the north of the town’s Long Bridge, however, the River Severn promises a very special (and free) half-mile of fishing. Blessed with brown trout and grayling, it has good hatches of fly. There are wooded and open sections; be prepared for the temperature to drop considerably as you enter the shadier sections. The trout can, at times, be free rising, but late evenings provide excellent angling opportunities during the summer months, or at times of low water. Salmon have been known to put in an appearance as well.fishingwales.netFishing from a kayakRottingdean Cliffs, East SussexView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Tony Watson/AlamyThis is a splendid fishing area, with excellent spinning for pollack, mackerel, bass and garfish. It can be snaggy, with uneven ground and obstacles below the water threatening to ensnare your tackle, so you need to be philosophical about losses. Casting from the lovely shingle beach with Rottingdean Cliffs rearing up behind you is delightful. For kayak fishing, check the water at low tide to find a patch of clean ground to ensure trouble-free entering and exiting. You can lure fish, and float fishing with a prawn may draw up a bass or two, especially in the evening. Park up at the Marine Cliffs car park.Polzeath Beach, CornwallThis wide sandy beach at the mouth of the River Camelis an excellent bass fishery. If you have a sea kayak, it’s a great place to use it but do keep a careful eye on the tides. The beach is exposed to swell (hence its popularity with surfers), so launching is only advisable when the sea is relatively calm but, once out, expect to encounter bass and pollack towards and around Pentire Point. There is also the occasional gilthead bream at the entrance to the Camel. A great place for mackerel fishing in the summer months, park at Polzeath Beach car park. If you do launch a kayak here, expect a bit of a hike at low tide to reach the water’s edge.Loch Ken, Dumfries & GallowayView image in fullscreenPhotograph: James JohnstoneRenowned for marvellous catches of pike, perch, roach, dace and bream, this long, ribbon-like loch stretches for nine miles through the gloriously wild scenery of the Galloway Hills in south-west Scotland. James Murray, a local gamekeeper, famously caught a 72lb pike here in 1774 that was seven feet long. To catch a seven-foot fish on a fly made of bits of peacock feather is a remarkable achievement. These days the loch is home to good-sized wild brown trout, and can be fished from shore or kayak. Alongside the trout, it’s possible to catch bream and perch too. There are a number of car parks around the loch but you can also stay and fish very inexpensively from theLoch Ken Holiday Park.Fishing permit £5 a day fromlochkenholidaypark.co.uk. Two-night camping pitches from£60Fishing from campsitesLoch Awe, ArgyllView image in fullscreenPhotograph: RFPhotography/Ronnie FlemingPicturesque Loch Awe holds a lot of trout, and the mayfly hatch leads to a feeding frenzy, which is unforgettable.

It’s all about coarse fishing here, and the coarse fishing season closes from the middle of March to the middle of June. However, the rest of the time you can fill your boots with bream, roach, rudd, tench or pike. This is a place for the kind of old school fishing you did as a kid – float fishing with worms or maggots work well, as do sweetcorn or bread pellets.

If you’re visiting for the day, it’s usually possible to park on the verge along the lane to Trevayne Farm campsite, but we recommend staying over. This lovely campsite, on a working farm just up from the beach, maintains a wonderfully simple, back-to-nature ethos but facilities stretch to a farm shop selling local, seasonal produce.

A blaze of fire coral, darting clown fish, crimson sponge, electric blue ray … a turtle! Your heart soars, your head spins. Nowhere else will you encounter such density and diversity of life.Corals are the architects of all this splendour. Their immobile forms suggest plants, but they’re animals – solar-powered ones. Each is a colony of thousands, sometimes millions, of tiny coral polyps, each resembling a slimmed-down sea anemone, just millimetres tall.Coral polyps are invertebrates. They protect their delicate bodies by building tiny cups of pure limestone, the building blocks of every reef. Two hundred and fifty million years before our first cities and pyramids rose, corals were already giving free rein to their monumental architectural impulses. No human structure matches the grandeur of the largest reefs. The Great Barrier Reef spans 344,400 sq km, redirecting ocean currents and deflecting tsunamis.Their engineering creates niches for millions of other species. These living riches sustain an estimated 1 billion coastal and island dwellers worldwide.And they conjure all this magnificence from virtually nothing: tropical waters are nutrient deserts.Darwin was the first to wonder how reefs could possibly create so much from so little. The solution to Darwin’s conundrum is that coral polyps don’t weave their magic alone. Their achievements depend on mutually-beneficial symbioses with other reef organisms, particularly invisible microbes. These partnerships are so pivotal that biologists view corals not as individual animals, but as “holobionts” – living collectives where host and microbes function as one.Thecoral holobiont, which narrowly did not on the 10-strong shortlist forthe Guardian’s invertebrate of the year 2025, has honed two critical capabilities that allow burgeoning reefs to prosper in watery deserts. First, reefs run on genuinely renewable energy. Photosynthesising algae living inside coral harvest tropical sunlight, funnelling energy into the reef ecosystem.Second, coral reefs operate as the ultimate circular economy: nothing wasted, everything re-used. Billions of symbiotic microbes coating the coral’s mucous surfaces recycle nutrients, while also protecting against disease, buffering heat stress and providing essential vitamins.And yet coral polyps are bang on the frontlines of the climate emergency (they are vulnerable to even a small change in temperature) and many scientists now see it as probable, not just possible, that most reefs won’t survive the industrial age. Why? Because we’re changing the oceans too quickly for these adaptable organisms to evolve. A single heatwave can shatter the coral holobiont. Algae jump ship first, bleaching the coral white, before the entire microbiome dissolves into hunger and chaos. Reef ecosystems that took millennia to build can collapse in days.In defiance of their apparent fragility, corals have survived multiple mass extinctions during their long evolutionary past. It is, therefore, their amazing successes that offer the most urgent lesson for our increasingly individualistic industrial societies: sustainable flourishing on a finite planet requires collective action. Coral holobionts didn’t conquer nutrient-poor waters through competition, but through cooperation – creating abundance out of extreme scarcity.Between 24 March and 2 April, we will be profiling ashortlist of 10 of the invertebrateschosen by readers and selected by our wildlife writers from more than 2,500 nominations. The voting for our 2025 invertebrate of the year will run from midday on Wednesday 2 April until midday on Friday 4 April, and the winner will be announced on Monday 7 April.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentInvertebrate of the year 2025CoralMarine lifeOceansWildlifeEndangered speciesClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If anything, it made her more determined, and left her feeling that “impossible is nothing”.Ebaide, 32, spent five months on the road, from March to July 2024, riding solo from Mombasa on the Kenyan coast to the Nigerian capital, Lagos, on a Tekken 250cc “adventure” motorbike, which can handle rough roads. Two years earlier she had driven alone across east Africa after converting a minivan into a “tiny home on wheels” and becoming a full-time“vanlifer”.Now she is about to complete her third big adventure: another solo motorbike trip, this time from Lagos to Morocco. She is due to arrive in Rabat this month.“It’s been a tumultuous experience, but it’s been the highlight of my existence,” she says.View image in fullscreenJoy Ebaide, who says her adventures on the road have been ‘the highlight of my existence’.Photograph: HandoutEbaide has documented all three adventures on social media, from morning routines in the van to navigating her motorbike through the traffic-clogged roads of Kampala, and sharing her best and worst moments.“When you think of Africa you are probably thinking of safaris, wildlife and dirt roads; well, today we are flipping the script,” she says inone YouTube video. “I’m about to tell you my top five African countries with the best roads … smooth, modern, luxurious roads that you can drive on without spilling your tea.”Along the way, she has also alerted her 528,000-plus followers across Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and YouTube to the challenges of travelling with a Nigerian passport.In one of the mostpopular YouTube videos from her current trip, she describes crossing the border from Benin into Togo as “an absolute nightmare”.“The whole experience felt like I was trapped in a system designed to bleed travellers dry,” she says, arguing that borderless travel is needed for Africans to move around their continent without hindrance.Nigeria is one of 12 countries in the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), a regional trade and economic bloc that allows visa-free movement for citizens of its member states. Beyond west Africa, Nigeriansrequire visas to enter 26 countriesin Africa, afterKenyabecame visa-free for Africans in January 2024. But, as Ebaide found, border crossings do not always run smoothly.It's really sad … more than half of the visas I needed were either refused or hadn’t been approved yetAlma Asinobi“I know many Africans don’t travel around Africa because of the border issues. But I’m an exceptional woman. I’m kind of known on the internet for border madness and being feisty because I want to show people, especially those with the Nigerian passport, that travelling [within Africa] is possible,” she says.The Nigerian passport is considered weaker than those of many other African countries, ranking 91st on theHenley global mobility index– on a par with Ethiopia, and only slightly above conflict-ridden or politically unstable countries, such as Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Libya. By comparison, South Africa ranks 48th on the index and Kenya 68th.Ebaide is not alone in sharing her frustrations on the road. She is one of a growing number of Nigerian female adventurers who are as vocal about the difficulties of travelling as they are about their love of experiencing new cultures.View image in fullscreenMunachimso Osisiogu in Monaco. ‘It is very hard to travel with a Nigerian passport,’ she says. ‘Travel should be accessible.’Photograph: HandoutMunachimso Osisiogu, a travel influencer, started educating people about travel requirements and visa-free countries for Nigerians afterher 2022 post about Rwanda’s policywent viral. She says she has helped more than 100 people secure visas across Africa and the Middle East. Initially, she offered free advice; now she charges a fee of 50,000 naira (£25) for consultations.“It is very hard to travel with a Nigerian passport, especially in Africa. It costs less to go from Lagos to Paris than to Senegal,” says Osisiogu. “Many Nigerians want to travel and go back to [Nigeria]; some of us don’t want to relocate. Nigerians are not even the top five people who overstay their visas – travel should be accessible.”Travelling outside the continent can be even more frustrating and expensive, requiring proof of funds, airline tickets and hotel booking in advance, with no guarantee of visa approval – and no refunds.Last month, Alma Asinobi, a 26-year-old content creator, finally set out to break theGuinness world record for taking the shortest time to visit all seven continentsin an effort to raise awareness of the difficulties of travelling with a low-mobility passport after facing a series of costly bureaucratic hurdles during her preparations.“I’m trying to keep it together,” she tweeted, “but it’s really sad when I remember that I could have done this trip much earlier in the season – better weather, more options in case of cancellations etc – but more than half of the visas I needed were either refused or hadn’t been approved yet.”At 71 hours, the trip took Asinobi seven hours more than the 64-hour record set by an American, Johnny Cruz Buckingham, after Asinobi wasprevented from boardingher flight from Dubai to Perth in Western Australia – due to visa issues.View image in fullscreen‘You have to queue at ungodly hours of the day to get a visa,’ says Alma Asinobi, who believes Africans are often treated worse than other travellers at consulates.Photograph: Alma Asinobi/X“I don’t have a problem with getting visas; it makes sense to see yourself as a guest in anybody’s country. However, there are some ways that the authorities treat people who have to get visas [at consulates], especially Africans. You have to queue at ungodly hours of the day to get a visa,” Asinobi told the Guardian before embarking on her record attempt.I have to wear a fake wedding ring sometimes to reduce the constant sexualisation and unwanted attentionPelumi NubiPelumi Nubi, who in 2024 became the first African woman to drive solo from London to Lagos, says that as a dual-passport holder (British and Nigerian), she can use the most convenient one depending on where she is travelling to. This helps prevent the additional scrutiny that Nigerian passport-holders usually experience.“There is a striking difference when you travel with a Nigerian passport. It’s just that extra effort that you have to pay the price [for],” Nubi says.“For the London to Lagos trip, I used my British passport all the way to the Gambia. Then I switched to my Nigerian passport once I got into the Ecowas zone, which was visa-free.”As well as helping others navigate border requirements, Nigeria’s female travel influencers are raising awareness of the risks of solo travel.View image in fullscreenPelumi Nubi launches a YouTube travel show aimed at Africans this week.Photograph: HandoutNubi says: “The reality of our daily life as women is amplified because you’re travelling in a foreign land, away from family and friends that could protect you. You have to put extra security that I feel a man doesn’t even think about.“I have to wear a fake wedding ring sometimes when I’m travelling to reduce the constant sexualisation and unwanted attention.”‘Africa has zero PR in the west’: the Nigerian influencer using sarcasm on the cluelessRead moreAsinobi adds: “The trip itself is a victory. Because historically, travelling as a black woman has an additional layer of complexity.Womenhave done a lot of big things, but you hardly find women doing audacious things without any pushback.“I just want more women to know that you can do things, and it’s OK whether it works or not: just do things.”That can-do attitude, plus the thrill of the open road and experiencing new cultures, outweighs the challenges these influencers have faced. This week sees the launch of One Week In … , a travel show presented by Nubi on Africell’s YouTube channel billed as “an African telling the African narrative of travel in the continent.”Omolewa Adesuyi, 34, set off on a solo ride from Lagos on 16 March, and plans to spend a month riding her motorbike to Cameroon, Congo-Brazzaville, Angola, Namibia and South Africa. For her, travel is a means of helping create more female representation in motorcycling.View image in fullscreenOmolewa Adesuyi, who is trying to change the narrative about women riding motorbikes as she rides from Nigeria down to South Africa.Photograph: Courtesy of Omolewa Adesuyi“They say [motorcycling] is a man’s sport, but now we see a lot of women riding motorbikes as well. We’re changing narratives, letting the future generation of women know that you can do whatever you set your heart to do, even if it’s overcoming stereotypes and visa challenges.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentAfricaWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)Adventure travelTravelling soloSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Part of the door had been smashed from the inside. He soon realised it was no accident: thieves had broken into his aviary in Moortsele in Flanders and stolen five birds, including Finn, one of his most renowned breeders. Father and grandfather to many champions, Finn was “the Mona Lisa of the pigeon world”, Van Gaver said.The five birds, he estimates, were worth €750,000 (£625,000), but like da Vinci’s masterpiece, it is hard to tell, because he had no plans to sell. He had ordered a retirement loft so his oldest birds could live out their days under more sun. Instead, CCTV footage shows one of the thieves snatching Finn and bundling the delicate jade-necked dark bird into a plastic bag.0:51CCTV footage shows a thief in Tom Van Gaver's pigeon loft – video“Of course you feel sad and upset,” Van Gaver told the Guardian. But his first thought was fixing the weak point in his security. The Belgian and international champion, feted for the endurance of his birds, already had cameras, locks and sensors.But he had not bargained on thieves breaking in through a loft roof, having chopped down hedges in his neighbours’ gardens to reach his property. Now his home is separated with a fence bearing laser sensors and cameras. “It is like a prison in my garden.”View image in fullscreenLast November, thieves broke in through a loft roof and stole five birds worth about €750,000, including Finn, one of Van Gaver’s most renowned breeders.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianThe theft of Van Gaver’s pigeons is only one of the latest thefts to hit pigeon racing inBelgium, renowned as the birthplace of the sport. “The problem has always existed … but in the last year it has exploded,” said Patrick Marsille, secretary general of the Royal Belgian Pigeon Federation, speaking in an interview at its headquarters in Halle, south of Brussels.The association estimated that up to 15 thefts had taken place between October and mid February, with perhaps about 500 birds stolen. Well-organised criminal gangs from easternEuropeare suspected of targeting particular birds or owners, with the goal of seizing champions to breed their offspring. “It is not at all by chance. It is a network that is very well organised, that knows exactly what it wants,” Marsille said.The Descheemaecker Pigeon Centre, near Antwerp, which has been breeding racing birds since 1955, has taken greater precautions against theft in the last decade. The centre, which claims to be the largest and oldest pigeon-racing breeding station in the world, is secured by a wall and locked doors, monitored by cameras and a concierge. Stephan Descheemaecker, whose grandfather co-founded the business with a pigeon magazine in 1930, thinks he can spot a potential thief.“We know from the beginning when they enter and start looking around and looking to the cameras above them. We know that they are not coming to have a look at pigeons, that they are coming to scan the environment to see what can be taken, or how good the security is.”View image in fullscreenA poster of the stolen champion Finn, who Van Gaver called ‘the Mona Lisa of the pigeon world’.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianPigeon racing, once described as the horse racing of the poor, took root in the coal-mining region around Liège in 19th-century Belgium, reaching its heyday after the second world war, with about 200,000 fanciers in 1950. These days interest in the time-consuming hobby has waned. At the same time animal welfare activists and ethicists have criticised the sport for the stress imposed on birds kept in baskets before races and losses of pigeons in gruelling long-distance competitions.The Belgian Pigeon Federation says it requires its members to make the wellbeing of their animals a priority. For many fanciers, the sport is about more than competition – it’s about the companionship of the birds, the pursuit of breeding champions, and the thrill of the race.In a typical competition, pigeons are released from one spot and fly back to their lofts, covering hundreds of kilometres. The winner is the fastest bird, measured in metres per minute, using an ankle tag linked to a loft sensor. In contrast to the millisecond-precise technology, no one really knows how pigeons find their way home. For years it was suggested that birds use the Earth’s magnetic field to guide them, but some scientists lean to the theory thatsense of smell and spatial awarenessare what counts.Fanciers look for a good eye, long muscles, quality feathers, but those characteristics do not reveal whether a bird has a good orientation. “It’s only with racing that you will find out,” Descheemaecker said. “An ugly pigeon becomes a beautiful pigeon after winning prizes every week.”While it’s possible to get started with a €25 bird, or donations from other fanciers, elite birds command huge prices. One of stolen Finn’s children was recently sold for €45,000. In 2020 a Chinese buyer set a recordpaying €1.6m for the Belgian pigeon, New Kim.View image in fullscreenThe Royal Belgian Pigeon Federation estimates that up to 15 thefts have taken place between October and mid February, with about 500 birds stolen.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianDespite the big money, Frans Bungeneers, a retired police inspector and pigeon racer, believes thefts of the birds are not a priority for Belgian police or prosecutors.Bungeneers was twice Belgium’s national champion in the renowned Barcelona race, the ultra marathon of pigeon racing, where birds fly from Catalonia to northern Europe, usually travelling more than 1,000km. But months after this exceptional double victory, his world was shattered.Thieves stole 60 of his pigeons in 2016, including Iron Lady Ellie, his first-placed international ace pigeon. In one night the strain of champions he had been breeding for 16 years was gone. “I cried like a little boy when I saw it in the morning; it was unbelievable,” he told the Guardian. “The ground under my feet was gone.”Prosecutors were not very interested in pursuing the case at first. “The prosecutor said: ‘Gentlemen we are not going to prosecute for chickens and rabbits – and now you ask for pigeons!’” he recalled.His tenacity paid off. In 2020 three Romanians were sentenced in absentia to 30 months in jail and fined €340,000, the value of the pigeons, according to the Belgian trial judge, he said. But they never served the time. Bungeneers got neither compensation nor his pigeons, despite tracing them to locations in Romania near the Ukrainian border. The retired police inspector, who now advises other victims, does not believe he would have got the same result without knowing the system.View image in fullscreenFrans Bungeneers, a retired police inspector and pigeon racer, believes thefts of the birds are not a priority for Belgian police or prosecutors.Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianIn most cases, he says, pigeon thefts are classified as a simple crime that generates a report, rather than a serious crime triggering an investigation where police are empowered to check mobile phone use and CCTV near the scene. “To get results in pigeon theft you need to act fast.”Despite the devastating setback, Bungeneers still races pigeons. Van Gaver has no plans to stop: “When you are a pigeon fancier you normally never quit.”Descheemaecker says that all pigeon fanciers dream of having the best pigeon this year. He describes that moment waiting for his birds to return to the loft: “It is the excitement of a pigeon which was released 500 miles away returning … and seeing it falling out of the sky.”Explore more on these topicsBirdsAnimalsBelgiumEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The town sits a stone’s throw fromSyriaand save for three soldiers manning an army checkpoint at the entry to the village, the presence of the Lebanese state is minimal.The people of Qasr and the villages that straddle both sides of the nearly 248 mile-long (400km) Syria-Lebanon border were for decades in business together. Authorities in Assad’s Syria profited from the flow of weapons, drugs and fuel over the border, and its ally in Lebanon, the Iran-backed Shia militiaHezbollah, relied on routes used by smugglers to receive weapons coming from Iran.View image in fullscreenA fighter with the new Syrian government stands watch near the border with Lebanon after Syrian forces clashed with smuggling gangs on 10 February.Photograph: Bakr Alkasem/AFP/GettyBut after the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad wasousted by Syrian rebelson 8 December and a war-battered Hezbollah lost its grip over the Lebanese state, authorities in both countries have sought to reassert control over their borders and crack down on smuggling.The attempt to seal the porous border has disrupted the decades long smuggling trade between Syria and Lebanon and has turned local tensions into deadly international military incidents.Map of northern LebanonOn 16 March, three Syrian soldiers were killed in Lebanese territory, prompting the Syrian army to begin to pummel Qasr and surrounding villages with artillery. Smuggling tribes in the villages returned fire and the Lebanese army also responded to Syrian rockets, with a ceasefire agreed a day later.In all, three Syrians and seven Lebanese were killed on both sides, while another 52 were wounded in Lebanon.It was the second time in a month that clashes had erupted between Syria and Lebanon. Syrian authorities blamed Lebanon’s Hezbollah for the skirmishes, claiming it had infiltrated Syrian territory, kidnapped three Syrian soldiers and killed them. Hezbollah denied any involvement.Lebanese people painted a very different story, of a new Syrian army that did not yet know the lay of the land, and of a local dispute that escalated quickly.A member of the Lebanese Jaafar tribe, an influential smuggling clan that controls many of the routes in the area, said: “Three Syrian soldiers [were] walking, and stepped on Lebanese land by accident. They ran across a shepherd who got scared and called his relatives, who killed the soldiers immediately.”He described how tensions have been running high between the people of Lebanese border villages and the new Syrian authorities. “Smugglers are scared to go to Syria now, they don’t feel there’s security,” he said.Many Lebanese living in towns on the Syrian side of the border for decades fled after the fall of Assad for fear of the new authorities. One 68-year-old farmer who was born and raised in Syria said his land had been taken from him in December, so he fled to Qasr.Arms have poured into Lebanese border towns after Assad’s troops abandoned their posts, leaving weapons ranging from rifles to light artillery by the roadside. The Jaafar family member said it was now common to find Kornets, a Russian anti-tank guided missile, in Qasr – and that they were quite cheap, too.When Syrian artillery fire started on Qasr and the surrounding area, tribes such as the Jaafar family took up arms to defend the town – and arms they had aplenty. Avideoof an al-Arabiya correspondent inside Syria during the clashes captured the moment a rocket was shot from the Lebanese side, slightly injuring the reporter.View image in fullscreenA convoy of Syrian defence ministry vehicles heading to the border with Lebanon on 17 March.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyMany people in Qasr are members of Hezbollah – the group announced four of its fighters were killed in the clashes – although residents insisted the militia did not direct the battle, but rather fighters participated as members of the town.Experts say the relationship between smugglers and Hezbollah is more of a partnership, rather than the tribes that engage in smuggling being under the Lebanese group’s control.Joseph Daher, the author of Hezbollah: The political economy of the party of God, said: “Most of these clans are politically covered and have connections with Hezbollah. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) [the Islamist authority that rules Syria] is trying to strengthen its controls at the border, especially targeting clans affiliated with Hezbollah.”The Lebanese state has also been keen to strengthen its control over the Syria-Lebanese border, eager to show western powers it is preventing weapons from reaching Hezbollah. Before the fall of the Assad regime, the Lebanese group would receive weapons shipments via Syria through the Bekaa valley.Despite the clashes, business is business. Smugglers say the flow of illicit goods has continued after the fall of Assad. “Publicly, [HTS] is saying they want smuggling to stop, but they need our goods. Business doesn’t have an identity,” said a second member of the Jaafar family. The new Syrian authorities have regularised and decreased the fees they charge smugglers, he said, as Syria desperately needs Lebanese fuel and diesel as western-led sanctions have throttled its ability to import them.The only goods smugglers can no longer traffic are drugs. The factories that used to produce the popular amphetamine captagon were run by the now deposed Assad regime and smuggled through the Bekaa valley to be exported via Lebanon’s ports. Syria’s new authorities have cracked down on the narcotics trade.Lebanon’s smugglers and Syrian officials are still getting to know one another. Gone are the fourth armoured division soldiers under the control of Maher al-Assad, the brother of Syria’s ousted president, which used to control the Syrian side of the smuggling routes.The introduction is off to a rocky start. As the Jaafar clan member was speaking, bursts of machine-gun fire erupted, followed by the dull thuds of rocket-propelled grenades fired by the Syrian authorities at a neighbouring village.“If the ceasefire continues then we won’t attack them and they won’t attack us. But it seems we are entering a cycle of violence and revenge,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaLebanonHezbollahMiddle East and north AfricaBashar al-AssadfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Tony Woolford is among a far more exclusive club.In fact, the 66-year-old South Australian may well be the first person ever plucked by helicopter in this, one of the driest places on Earth,from flood waters.At least, that is according to the man who coordinated his rescue, Don Rowlands.A lifelong resident of Birdsville –the iconic gateway town to the Simpson– Rowlands has seen “stacks” of rescues in Queensland’s outback south-west over his 31 years as a desert ranger.“A lot of them having troubles now when these new fang-dangled computers throw in the towel,” the 76-year-old Wangkangurru Yarluyandi elder says.“Computers in the cars, you know, just some little thing goes wrong and you can’t get them to go again.“But anyone rescued from floods in the desert … no, not that I can recall.“I think this is the first you know?”It certainly won’t be an experience Woolford will forget in a hurry.When heavy rain turned the Madigan Line track he was driving to mud, Woolford was stranded in his 4WD for five days, watching the rising flood waters come to within a metre of his refuge before he was airlifted to safety.“I thought I would float away,” hetold the national broadcasterafter his rescue last week.1:17Video on social media shows Adavale flood waters on the ground and from the air – videoHad he done so, perhaps he would have ended up in Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre.With vast swathes of outback Queensland inundated and many places receiving more than a year’s worth of rain in a matter of days, flood waters are gradually making their way to the lowest place in Australia – that arid salt pan is set totransform into ephemeral lake.Map of QueenslandAs those flows pass towns and cattle and sheep stations – normally isolated by desert, plain and sheer distance – many sit as islands in a muddy sea.Birdsville has been cut off for more than a week, Rowlands said, and on Tuesday, the town was preparing for flood waters to rise once more as the remnants of ex-tropical cyclone Dianne wash into Queensland from the west.But “no one is complaining”, he said. Food was being flown in weekly from Boulia, almost 400 kilometres to the north. The town’s iconic pub was not going to run out of beer – they have their own plane.The situation for others was more dire. At least one dad did a school run to the remote town of Jundah,in a tinnie last week. Days later, at least 25 people were airlifted from the town in helicopters as the Thomson River burst its banks.Adavale, about 195km further to south-east was also evacuated.Mayor of the neighbouring Longreach shire, Tony Rayner, said his council was providing refuge for those who fled Jundah – while make their own flood preparations.“The situation there is really unprecedented, and we’ve been helping as much as we can to receive evacuees and assist with resupply,” he said. “There’s a lot of water up there”.Rayner said the full effects of the flood would not be known for weeks.But early estimates from the Queensland Department of Primary Industries (DPI) were already pointing to potentially devastating loss of cattle and sheep.The DPI said that estimates from Monday afternoon indicated more than 140,000 livestock were missing or dead – and that figure was set to rise.Rayner said “significant stock losses for western Queensland” would “have an impact on every community out here”.“Not only economically, but psychosocially – we’re already getting reports of landholders that are struggling mentally with the prospect of what they know is to come,” he said.“The trauma isn’t just damage to homes and possessions – it’s losing beloved animals, generations of blood lines, and in some cases faithful companions.”A clearer picture may begin to emerge later this week, according to Miriam Bradbury from the Bureau of Meteorology.The senior meteorologist said the rain was continuing to fall in many places on Tuesday, prolonging a weather event that officially began on 23 March as an inland low that dragged monsoonal rain from the tropical north to the arid south, but has been complicated by the likes of Dianne.“From the 23rd onwards we’ve seen huge amounts of rain falling across western and inland Queensland,” Bradbury said.“Across some parts of southern and south west Queensland, several locations have exceeded their annual average rainfall in just a three-day period.”The meteorologists said most areas under flood warnings should see widespread clearing of skies by Thursday, but that forecasting the rain had been made “so challenging” by “one rainfall event flowing into the next”.“For places around Birdsville those rivers are still rising … and have actually seen multiple flood peaks move through,” she said.1:08Drone vision shows coastal erosion on Gold Coast beaches after ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred – video“It rises, it comes down a little, and then it rises again as that next bout of rain moves through the catchment.“That’s certainly caused massive and long lasting disruption”.While the channel country of the outback south west was used to periodic flooding, Bradbury said such a “huge amount of rain” over a period of days “sets this apart from other events”.“That’s what is going to make it remembered very distinctly,” she said.But amid the challenges and the loss, Rowlands said the normally dusty flood plains around his home town were already lush and green and “pretty magic”.And when the waters do recede, he expects these landscapes, normally among the harshest in the world, to explode with life.“Mate the country will be like a garden,” he said.“It’ll be a sea of flowers”.Explore more on these topicsAustralia weatherQueenslandFloodingExtreme weatherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I can’t cope with it any more. It’s just too much and there’s nothing I can do about it.”Though he dips into his favourite news apps occasionally in the evening, he now strictly limits his news consumption. He’s not alone. The Guardian has been contacted by a series of one-time news junkies who are now seeking to restrict their news intake after suffering from disturbed sleep or a downturn in their mood.A related concern is affecting the sleep of Caroline Waterston, the Daily Mirror’s editor-in-chief. “The biggest challenge right now that’s keeping me awake is the under-35 audience,” she said this week, adding that if news companies can figure out how to reach them, they could also offer a big opportunity.Across newsrooms around the world, strategies are being launched to reach news avoiders, a cohort of refusniks behind a long-term decline in news engagement. The proportion of people who say they selectively avoid the news to some degree increased three percentage points last year to 39%,according to a surveyacross 17 countries by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Since 2017, it has increased by 10 percentage points.Want to stay sane? Try switching off your news alertsRead moreOver the last decade, the number of people getting any news online, whether through a news website or on social media,fell across every age group. In fact, the news avoiders break down into three groups. The first is a growing group of former news consumers who are dialling back, the second is a group who have never engaged with news in the first place, while the third group worrying media executives is young people, who appear to have lost trust in established news brands.The problem has been accelerated by changes to social media algorithms and search engines that mean fewer people are finding their way to news sites. “The perception is definitely that it’s getting worse,” said Benjamin Toff, the director of the Minnesota Journalism Center and the co-author of Avoiding the News. “Part of that perception is based on the digital analytics data that many of these organisations are looking at.“On the audience side, there is a degree of fatigue and exhaustion. A lot of people just feel, for their own mental health, they want to curtail the amount of news they’re paying attention to. Meanwhile, younger people who are using Instagram and TikTok, where the ability to include links to content outside of those platforms is a major challenge, are probably contributing to the decrease in [news site] traffic.”The response in newsrooms has been varied, but there are a few clear trends. To deal with the boom in content and declining free time, curation is king. Newsletters with a few handpicked stories, podcasts delving into a single subject and a reduction in story counts have already emerged as early winners from the news avoider war. Personalisation is the next frontier, with some newsrooms already using newsletters personalised using AI.“If the personalisation algorithm takes into account personal interest and what’s trending now in a relevant way, you can increase retention by double-digit numbers,” said Danny Lein, the founder of the Twipe tech company, which pioneered personalised newsletters at the Times. The firm has since rolled it out across seven international newsrooms. “Finding that good mix is really key. If it’s only based on personal interest, you get echo chambers.”Turness believespersonalisation is part of the answerat the BBC. The corporation has a lot of personal data that could help it tailor products, but it also has strict rules on the use of AI and has not yet been clear on its plans. There are also dangers. “We tend to find that people aren’t so keen,” said Craig T Robertson from the Reuters Institute. “If you’re personalising a news feed or news homepage, there’s a sense that they’re missing out on other things. It’s not like music or movies.”Then there’s the problem of negativity and a sense of powerlessness – another theme that emerged among news avoiders contacted by the Guardian. “We need to feel uplifted, encouraged and hopeful, not oppressed and afraid,” said one. After discovering that a third of those ditching their subscriptions complained of news fatigue, executives at Spain’s eldiario.es started looking at a new product that concentrated on the best news of the month, or stories with a constructive angle. Dagens Nyheter in Sweden is another outlet consciously including more positive pieces even on difficult topics.The “constructive journalism” movement, which began in Denmark and encourages more stories on progress and problem solving, is gaining ground. Oliver Duff, the editor of the i Paper, said this week that it was often seen as a “dirty word in newsrooms”, but said it needed to be taken seriously because “our audience disagrees”.As for winning over Gen Z, many are concluding that overcoming their different habits and lack of trust requires a radical reimagining of what newsrooms do. In Scandinavia, publishers such as Schibsted are spending more time explaining their editorial decisions. Duff also said there was a need to “pull back the curtain” on the editorial process. “You’re explaining exactly why this author or this creator has got expertise on this story, or why Katie spoke to 18 sources in Whitehall to tell this story that’s never been told,” he said.Likewise, Reach, which owns the Daily Mirror, is planning to use new studios to reach a younger audience with video – and some of their journalists are being encouraged to be more like influencers. Waterston said a journalist at a prominent court case was encouraged to talk about “what it felt like for them sitting in the court. We should lean into that.”Explore more on these topicsMediaTelevision industryNewspapersBBCDaily MirrorEuropeYoung peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A few years later, she hit rock bottom. Here is how she started overTue 1 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 05.37 EDTShareIt’s hard to know where to start with champion wrestler Saraya-Jade Bevis. Do we start in the same place as her memoir, at rock bottom aged 25 when a sex tape of Bevis taking part in a threesome was leaked and went viral? At that time, Bevis was suspended from wrestling, addicted to alcohol and, she says, snorting so much cocainethat her nose was spraying out blood.Or do we start with her childhood inNorwich, raised by a family of wrestlers, ex-cons and alcoholics, living in a council house where, she says, the rent was always due and dinner might be mashed potato sandwiches. The childhood sexual abuse that she had kept hidden for most of her life? Her rags-to-riches signing at 18 to WWE, the largest wrestling promotion in the world? Her new life in the US, when she was enjoying success as champion wrestler Paige, but feeling lonely, homesick, vulnerable? She met some very bad men. She partied too hard. She fractured her neck. She spent five years in recovery before returning to the ring. Her memoir is called Hell in Boots: Clawing My Way Through Nine Lives for good reason. “There’s actually a lot I had to leave out as I couldn’t fit it all in,” Bevis says of the book. “How am I only 32?”Anyone who has seen the 2019 film Fighting With My Family, starring Florence Pugh as Bevis, will know something of her story. It’s a feelgood comedy, written and directed by Stephen Merchant, which focuses on her family in Norwich – although it nearly didn’t make it on screen. Production was halted for a while because Bevis was in such a bad way, she says, and the team were worried she might have died by the time it was released. Her memoir goes much deeper – there’s still a lot of light and love, especially for her family, but darkness too.View image in fullscreen‘I was always thinking: “I will not let anybody hurt me”’ … Saraya-Jade BevisBevis’s parents both had difficult starts. She says they were saved by wrestling. “My dad was this old-school gangster, getting into trouble, going to prison, drinking,” she says. Patrick Frary, once a football hooligan known as Paddy the Bat for his weapon of choice, was working as a bouncer when someone told him he’d make a good wrestler. He learned the moves and began doing shows as Rowdy Ricky Knight, then met Bevis’s mum, Julia Hamer, when performing at a holiday camp. “She’d been homeless, she was on drugs,” says Bevis. They fell in love, got married and got sober. Hamer started wrestling too, as well as their children – Bevis, her older brother Zak, and her dad’s children from a previous marriage. (Bevis herself was named after the band Slayer, who her mum had seen live in the 80s while high on acid. She’d misheard the name and saved it for her future daughter.) Together, they built a family business, WAW (World Association of Wrestling), performing, running training sessions and selling merch.Fighting With My Family, says Bevis, captured her home life to a T. There was always mayhem. School wasn’t a priority. Her parents were big-hearted people who’d been at the very bottom, and wanted to save anyone who needed help. “We were the kind of family that would invite everybody into the house,” says Bevis. “There were always wrestlers, troubled youths and stray animals at our door. If someone was on the street, my dad would take them in, give them a bath, give them a bed. My parents were nice … to a fault.”When Bevis and her brother were young children, one of those guests began molesting them at night. The siblings shared a room and had been asked to make space for someone older whose dad was in prison. This abuse went on for quite some time and makes for truly harrowing reading – the smells that to this day make Bevis gag, the sounds of life and laughter continuing downstairs while she and her brother were trapped in hell. They had no words to explain what was happening to their parents, and instead tried somehow to manage it themselves. At one point, Bevis remembers Zak calling the abuser away from her bed and into his, simply to save his sister. When the abuse finally ended, the two siblings locked it away and never spoke of it. Bevis was 29 and living in LA when Zak called, close to a breakdown, finally needing to put it into words. “We both really did sob,” she says. “I didn’t want to talk about it but when we finally did, it was weirdly wonderful because we could validate each other. In the back of my mind, I’d always wondered: ‘Did this happen? Am I dreaming it?’ I was so young. Just saying it out loud helped heal me.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s like a drug’... Bevis, right, competing in WWE in 2016.Photograph: Marc Pfitzenreuter/Getty ImagesBevis still hasn’t spoken to her parents about it, she says. “We’re British, and I didn’t have the courage. I put it in the book instead. But I’m not angry at them. They’re good people. They tried to help someone they thought they could trust. I don’t blame them at all. The only person I blame is him.”Though wrestling was her family’s beating heart, as a child Bevis had no intention of doing it herself. (She wanted to be a zoologist.) Seeing the blood spilled during matches unnerved her. “The pain just didn’t make sense to me,” she says. Her mum was particularly injury-prone and lost most of her vision for six months after a knock on the head. At 13, though, at a family wrestling event, the women’s tag team was a few short and Bevis was persuaded to get in the ring with Zak, who was dressed as a pink Power Ranger with a mask and a padded bra. Bevis was knocked out in the first match but still caught the bug. “Unless you know the feeling, you’re not going to understand,” she says. “How can I explain it? Whether it’s five people in the Norwich Corn Exchange or 100,000 at WrestleMania, you know that you can control what [the audience] are feeling. You can make them hate you, love you, cry for you and you get this adrenaline rush. It’s like a drug.”She gets frustrated by claims that it’s all fake. “It’s predetermined,” she says. “But you don’t watch a movie and say: ‘Oh this is fake.’ We’re just trying to tell you a story – and we don’t have stunt doubles. We’re doing everything. We get hurt all the time. I’ve had two neck surgeries. And when you win, when you’re selected to be the champion, you’re chosen astheface front and centre, to sell the merchandise, to have all eyes on you. It’s magical when they pick you.”View image in fullscreenBevis, pictured as a child.Photograph: Courtesy of Saraya-Jade BevisAt 18, Bevis was scouted by WWE, flown to Florida and has remained in the US ever since. It was a dream come true, but the wrestling culture was very different to the one she’d known. In the early days especially, female wrestlers in the US were expected to parade in bikinis between matches and “fight like girls” – pulling hair and scratching rather than the lifting and slamming. “I was uncomfortable at first,” she says, “and I really did stick out like a sore thumb. The other girls were so put together, so beautiful, perfect bodies, perfect hair. I was this pale girl from Norwich with piercings and black hair. I looked a hot mess.” She was lonely too, which led to her first real relationship, with another wrestler who was eight years older than her.“I look back on it now and think: ‘Ugh, what was I doing?’” she says. “I was 19 and at that age, girls just want to please. He was making suggestions about stuff he wanted to do and things he wanted to film.” Bevis ended up having a threesome with her boyfriend and another wrestler, which was filmed. “Ultimately, it was my decision, no one was holding a gun to my head, but I felt gross afterwards,” she says. Five years later, after the relationship had long since ended, the recording was leaked. “I don’t know how [it was leaked], but I have my thoughts,” she says. “I had to drink to be able to do those things, and now everyone was getting to see them.”By the time this happened, Bevis’s life was already in freefall. Her rise through WWE had been meteoric and she’d quickly become a full-time main roster star and a two-time WWE Divas Champion (the youngest ever at 21). “Looking so different actually turned into a selling point,” she says. “It was more attainable. People thought: ‘I can be like her.’” But the schedule of a star wrestler was exhausting, flying across the country five days a week, then three or four-hour drives to perform at packed venues. (She remembers falling asleep in a chair before a match while someone was applying her makeup.)Bevis was also invited to join the cast of the wrestling reality TV show Total Divas, so she was usually followed by a camera crew. Alcohol flowed. “The more drunk we were, the more outrageous, the better the ratings,” she says. After a while, she couldn’t sleep without alcohol. At some point, she added in cocaine. The childhood abuse played a part here. “I’d always think about it when I’d been drinking or doing drugs,” she says, “and I’d get into fights every time. I was always thinking: ‘I will not let anybody hurt me.’ I was having paranoid thoughts.”View image in fullscreen‘I was this pale girl from Norwich with piercings and black hair. But looking so different turned into a selling point.’Photograph: Xposurephotos.com/TimmsIn the midst of this, the source of Bevis’s increasing neck pain – necks are a very vulnerable area for wrestlers – was revealed to be multiple small fractures and a condition called spinal stenosis, which required surgery. After the operation, Bevis stopped going to physio and training. Around the same time, she failed two WWE drug tests and was suspended. Then came the sex tape.Her first response on seeing it online was to vomit. Her next was to open the door of her house in Texas and start running. “I wanted to kill myself,” she says. “I didn’t want to be around any more. It was like the straw that broke the camel’s back. I felt as if there was no way I could recover from this – my career, my friendships, my family. I felt that everything was done.”A few things helped bring her back from the edge. The first was her family. For months, as she had spiralled out of control, Bevis had been distancing herself from them, ignoring their messages and lying about her drug use – but now she needed to talk to them. “My dad has always been my biggest supporter,” she says, “and I’d put them through so much. I felt like they must be gutted, that they weren’t going to forgive me.” She called her dad that day, sobbing, crouched behind a hedge in a car park. He answered the phone with “Hello princess” and told her that it was absolutely normal to have sex and nothing to be ashamed of. “He made a dad joke that it might make me more famous – like Kim Kardashian,” says Bevis. He said he’d always be proud of her, and not to let it break her. “I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect reaction.”WWE also reached out immediately to check she was OK, to say that “these things happen” and that they would put out a statement and work on getting the video taken down. Bevis returned to training, got a sober coach, and eventually got back in the ring. But, within months, another neck injury forced her to take a five-year break.She stayed sober, got therapy and lived in LA with her partner, the singer and rapper Ronnie Radke. In 2022, at the age of 30, Bevis was finally able to wrestle again, and signed with AEW (All Elite Wrestling), ditched the Paige persona and wrestled under her own name, Saraya. “Going back was so hard,” she says. “My body was no longer a giant callus. I wasn’t a tough, giant scab any more – I was soft and to start taking all the bumps again was awful. I did think I’d made a mistake at first.”View image in fullscreenWith Florence Pugh and Dwayne Johnson, stars of Fighting With My Family in 2019.Photograph: Rich Fury/Getty ImagesAt the end of her memoir, which was released last week, Bevis is still wrestling and still with Radke, then her partner of five years. But, when we speak, a lot has changed. Now she’s single, living with three birds and three dogs and in the process of moving herself and the menagerie to Nashville. “Ronnie and I split up,” she says. “It wasn’t meant to be.” She’s no longer wrestling, either, and her brother, who performs as Zak Zodiac, is on wrestling hiatus. (“He’s got a food truck in Norwich called Zaket Potato and he’s having a great time,” she says. “He has a wife, three kids, he wants to be at home and focus on his business.”)“I’m going to be 33 soon,” she continues. “A lot of the girls wrestling are 22. Wrestling will always be in my heart, but I need a fresh start. I have the book coming out, I want to focus on acting – I have a bunch of plans. That will have to be book two.”Hell in Boots: Clawing My Way Through Nine Lives by Saraya-Jade Bevis is published by Simon & Schuster (£20)In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

During the 15 years of Mozambique’s civil war – in which more than a million people died – the country’s wildlife also paid a terrible price. Poaching for meat and ivory was so intense that the small surviving elephant populationrapidly evolved to lose their tusks. Leopards, wild dogs and spotted hyenas had all disappeared. Populations of zebra, buffalo and other herbivoreshad collapsed.In the following years, ahuge effort to restore the park took shape. Led by the philanthropist Gregory Carr and Mozambique’s government, it was the start of the park’s journey to becoming one of Africa’s most celebrated wildlife conservation success stories. Today, elephants, lions, hippos, antelope, painted wolves, hyenas and leopards all thrive in the park once again – thanks to work that for the past 20 years has been supported by along-term partnership with USAID.View image in fullscreenSinchi Roca’s forest control and surveillance in Peru is funded by USAID.Photograph: Jason Houston/USAIDBut now, Gorongosa is among hundreds of conservation projects around the world thrown into uncertainty byDonald Trump’s budget cutsto USAID and other branches of the American government.

None believes the shortfall can be made up from other funding sources.“These funding cuts could not have come at a worse time. The loss of US funding means an immediate reduction in rangers protecting wildlife on the frontlines,” says one wildlife trafficking expert, who did not want to be named. “We were already experiencing rapid growth in trafficking of live wildlife, jaguar canines and bone products as substitutes for tiger from Latin America; an expanding illegal trade of elephant ivory in southeast Asia; an uptick in rhino poaching in southern Africa; and professional tiger poaching groups targeting tigers.”View image in fullscreenEfforts to combat wildlife crime in Uganda are supported by USAID.Photograph: Ashley Netherton/USAIDAnother, also requesting anonymity, says: “Efforts to prevent the illicit trade in high-value wildlife products also disrupt the transnational crime cartels driving the illegal trafficking of narcotics, people and weapons. Demand and the illicit money for wildlife products largely originates from China, and the consequences of slackening existing controls is terrifying.”Through USAID, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Forest Service and the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, the American government has supported a vast network of conservation initiatives, averaging about $740m a year of direct assistance between 2015 and 2022, according to the OECD. Schemes range from helping Indigenous communities to secure formal land rights to helping to tackle illegal logging and gold mining in the Amazon. USAID alone providedat least$350m in 2023 for conservation initiatives, making it one of the largest funders in the cash-strapped sector, and was often matched by contributions from philanthropists and the private sector.Mark Freudenberger, an environmental expert who has worked onUSAIDschemes for more than 30 years, says that while it is too early to know the immediate effects of the cuts, he fears there will be a rise in poaching and encroachment in national parks in the coming years.“I’m very concerned about the future of lemurs in Madagascar; white rhinos and elephants in southern Africa; gorillas in Rwanda, Congo and the Central African Republic; orangutans in south-east Asia. The list goes on, and it is long. These species are of great intrinsic value to the global community,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The survey includes questions about how they work to protect women and children from “gender ideology”, with a link toTrump’s 20 January executive orderrolling back transgender and gender-identity rights. The review process extends until 19 April.View image in fullscreenProjects protecting lemurs in Madagascar may be at risk.Photograph: Jason Houston/USAIDMatthew Hansen, a professor at University of Maryland and an expert on remote sensing, says USAID funding of conservation has been critical for soft power. In recent years, his team has worked on improving monitoring of the Congo basin rainforest, the world’s second largest, to reduce deforestation threats.“Some people seem to believe our international engagement should only consist of guns, Bibles and the occasional Band-Aid. Unfortunately, we have not defended, nor advertised, more substantive interactions that create a world of global engagement and partnership, which is what USAID does,” he says.“Being a generous and concerned partner with other countries in their quest to develop stable, participatory political systems, human development, conservation of nature and institutions that serve their populations across a range of needs, should remain a critical national mission for the United States. It is incredible that we are purposefully withdrawing from such interactions when they are most needed,” he says.Explore more on these topicsWildlifeThe age of extinctionConservationMozambiqueUSAIDAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Mauritius is one of the few countries in the region that has refused to take part in China’s belt and road initiative.Ministers have also argued that the UK has to give up the territory due tointernational legal rulings in favour of Mauritius, and that legal uncertainty over the legitimacy of the military base could compromise its security.The UK government revealed it would spare China from facing stronger rules as part of its register of foreign lobbyists coming into force on 1 July.Russia and Iran would both be included in the enhanced tier of the foreign influence registration scheme once it was launched this summer, Dan Jarvis, the security minister, told the Commons.The enhanced tier of the scheme is reserved for countries that pose a risk to UK national security. Anyone who is directed by Russia or Iran to carry out activities in the UK must declare it or face five years in prison.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Should ministers decide to impose stricter rules on China or any other countries such as North Korea, they will need to give three months’ notice of the change.Announcing greater restrictions on Russian activity, Jarvis said Moscow “presents an acute threat to UK national security” and that its “hostile acts have ranged from the use of a deadly nerve agent in Salisbury, espionage, arson and cyber-attacks, including the targeting of UK parliamentarians through spear-phishing campaigns”.In response Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, described China as the “elephant in the room” and said the country “engages in industrial-scale espionage, seeking to steal technology from government, universities and from industries. They repress Chinese citizens here and have sought to infiltrate our political system.”The foreign influence registration scheme was expected to come into force last year but the new Labour government delayed its implementation.Ministers said on Tuesday that they would work with business and academia to help them prepare for the scheme’s launch, and that there would be a three-month grace period to register existing ties with foreign states.Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsForeign policyDonald TrumpUS foreign policyLabourMauritiusForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

However, from the start, it has faced criticism over itspotential impact on important ecosystemsand displaced people.About 13,000 people in Uganda and Tanzania have been displaced by the pipeline. Those obliged to move were given the option of resettlement or cash compensation.On Tuesday, Haki Defenders Foundation, a Kampala-based nonprofit, and the University of Sheffieldreleased a reportbased on interviews with 100 people affected by the pipeline in Uganda, including those whose land had been compulsorily acquired.The researchers found that although the project included a resettlement plan in accordance with local laws and international best practices that emphasise restoration or improvement of livelihoods, many people reported unfair and inadequate compensation and a lack of transparency.View image in fullscreenDrilling started at the Kingfisher oilfield, on the south-eastern shores of Lake Albert in Uganda, in 2023.Photograph: Hajarah Nalwadda/Getty ImagesThose who chose resettlement moved to designated areas such as the Kyakaboga resettlement camp. The researchers found people were given uniform houses, regardless of household sizes, meaning larger households are overcrowded. A typical resettlement house consists of one bedroom and a living room.The researchers also found that the resettlement sites lack basic infrastructure, with people having to travel long distances to access water, markets and medical facilities.Among those who chose cash compensation, the researchers found many had felt under pressure to accept terms they did not fully understand due to language barriers and a lack of access to legal advice.The report says that many people found the monetary compensation inadequate to secure new land or rebuild their livelihoods. Land was often undervalued, and compensation for residential structures was calculated based on government rates that did not account for regional variations or actual rebuilding costs.View image in fullscreenThe Kyakaboga resettlement village, built by the Ugandan government, lacks basic infrastructure, the researchers found.Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty ImagesIn September, the Uganda governmenttook landowners who refused to move to court.TotalEnergies said the land acquisition process was being “carried out in accordance with the stringent standards of the International Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of the World Bank, aimed at ensuring compensation for affected populations”. A spokesperson added that both Total and Eacop “take a proactive approach to ensuring that the projects are implemented in accordance with internationally recognized human rights standards”.Spokespeople for Eacop and the Ugandan energy ministry did not respond to requests for comment, but Eacophas previously saidit was “committed to world-class environmental and social compliance” and was carrying out land acquisition “in compliance with national laws and the applicable international standards”.Jonathan Silver, a professor of urban geography at the University of Sheffield and co-author of the study, said the research aimed to show how large-scale infrastructure projects affected lives. “We cannot forget the lived experiences of those displaced,” he said. “We should pay attention to the ways in which projects such as Eacop cause a spectrum of harm.”A total of 6.5bn barrels of crude oil were discovered in western Uganda in 2006. According toan analysisby the Climate Accountability Institute, transporting, refining and burning oilwould produce 379m tonnes of global carbon emissionsover the 25-year operation of the pipeline.The project, which is due to be completed next year, is expected to cost about $5bn (£3.87bn).View image in fullscreenA drilling rig and the central processing facility at Kingfisher oilfield in Kikuube, on the south-eastern shore of Lake Albert.Photograph: Hajarah Nalwadda/Getty ImagesThe researchers also found that authorities in Uganda had suppressed dissent about the project by affected people, activists and community-based organisations. People have been denied permits to hold peaceful protests, and where the assemblies have taken place, security forces have violently dispersed them.As part of what activists calla government crackdownon protesters against Eacop, 11 environmental activists werecharged with “common nuisance”and remanded after a rally in Kampala in February.Dr Tom Ogwang, a senior lecturer in political economy of natural resource at Mbarara University of Science and Technology in Uganda, said it was important for concerns about the pipeline to be addressed. “If people feel they have been given a raw deal, then their hearts and minds will never be for that project,” said Ogwang,who has researched Eacop’s impacts.Explore more on these topicsUgandaTanzaniaOil (Business)Human rightsAfricaOil (Environment)Oil and gas companiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The move “reflects a stated intent to reinforce security for oil sites”, the bulletin stated, without providing further details.The MNJTF was formed in 2015 byCameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria in the wake of increasing jihadist attacks across their territories. At its peak, it had an estimated 10,000 troops and fought many armed groups, especially Boko Haram and its offshoots. But any serious progress has been hampered or even undone by poor collaboration and equipping, analysts say.“The force was never that effective, said Ulf Laessing, the Bamako-based director of the Sahel programme at Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a German thinktank. Its decline, he added, was “good news for jihadists and it is bad news for villagers on the lake side, fishers or farmers who just want to go about their business but who will now get less military support”.Niger’s exit from MNJTF came days after the junta’s leader, Abdourahmane Tiani, was sworn in as president until 2030 under a new charter that suspended the constitution and dissolved all political parties.Niger has also isolated itself from the Economic Community of West African State (Ecowas), after Ecowas imposed a range of sanctions followingthe coupthat ousted the democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, in July 2023.Within two months of the coup, it had joined the splinter Alliance of Sahel States (AES) along with Burkina Faso and Mali, where there have also been military takeovers since 2020.Since then, AES has introduced new biometric passports to replace the old regional passports and on Monday, it announced a 0.5% levy on imported goods from Ecowas states.Ikemesit Effiong, managing partner at Nigerian geopolitical risk advisory SBM Intelligence, said the levy put an end to “a long history of free trade across the western Sahel” and could change the dynamics of Ecowas’s negotiations with AES.“When squared with Ecowas’s statement commitment to keep open trade and borders with AES states, I think this [levy] will force Ecowas to drop its kid gloves strategy and be more forceful with the AES,” Effiong said.It remains unclear what impact Niger’s withdrawal from the MNJTF will have on a security agreement signed with neighbouring Nigeria last August. The countries share a border that spans 1,000 miles but Nigeria-led Ecowas’s push for a rapid return to democratic governance has caused friction between both countries.Effiong said recent moves in the capital, Niamey, which has been seeking new military and economic partners since expelling French troops in 2023, are unsurprising.“Niger has been pulling out of all its main regional bilateral and multilateral commitments, much of which it sees as western influenced or inspired,” said Effiong, who noted that MTNJTF had received military and intelligence aid from western partners in the past.Explore more on these topicsNigerAfricaCameroonChadNigerianewsShareReuse this content"

The possible star of the show is the 3.5-acre sandy, rocky savannah where a number of species will roam together, just as they would in the wild.View image in fullscreenSam Harley: ‘The only other animals they [the giraffes] had seen were the Congo buffalo across the road.’Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverThe zoo is taking things slowly. Sam Harley, a giraffe keeper, admits her charges have been less enthusiastic than the zebras about sharing paddock space.But it’s early days and understandable. “Most of our giraffes were born here so the only other animals they had ever seen were the Congo buffalo across the road,” she said.It’s also a bit cold for a giraffe, which is practically all muscle and no fat. Plus, they have a new state-of-the-art giraffe house heated to a constant 23C, so staying indoors has its attractions.View image in fullscreenA meerkat.Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverChriston said they would take things slowly. “It is difficult to know how the animals will mix and how they will get on with each other so we are just doing it really, really gradually making sure everyone is comfortable – the animals and the keeping staff.”Over the past few weeks staff have been letting animals out together for short periods. “It’s baby steps. We want to make sure everyone’s happy and we are not putting any animals under pressure.”View image in fullscreenJamie Christon: ‘It’s baby steps.’Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverElsewhere, white-headed vultures seem content with the dead animal carcass breakfast they have been served. In other enclosures there is a flock of 107 flamingos, an aviary of black-cheeked lovebirds, Africa’s rarest species of lovebird, as well as meerkats, African wild dogs, aardvarks, yellow mongoose and dik-dik.The zoo came up with the Heart of Africa concept in 2017 with the assumption that building would begin in 2020. The pandemic and resultant zoo closure for 208 days set them back. A spade finally got in the ground in November 2022 and work was completed at the end of last year.Christon said one aim was to shine light on the biodiversity crisis in Africa and the work being done to save species.View image in fullscreenAfrican wild dogs in their enclosure.Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer“Some of these species are critically endangered in the wild and unfortunately their numbers are going the wrong way. So we are doing work here and we are doing work out in Uganda and Kenya.”He hopes it honours the spirit ofGeorge Mottershead, who created the zoo in the 1930s. After being horrified by caged and chained animals he encountered in an amusement park in Manchester, Mottershead had the dream of creating a “zoo without bars”.View image in fullscreenVisitors to the new facility at the zoo.Photograph: Richard Saker/The ObserverToday,Chesteris the most visited zoo in the UK including 150,000 schoolchildren a year.Christon said he understands that some people are opposed to even the concept of a zoo but for him it is all about conservation. He sees the project as a “symbol of our commitment to safeguarding wildlife across Africa”.While the Heart of Africa project cost £28m, the aim was that it would increase visitor numbers by 200,000 a year and pay for itself. Crucially it should generate an extra £3m to spend on conservation, he said.Mark Brayshaw, head of mammals at the zoo, believes the project will enrich the lives of the animals in the zoo’s care.View image in fullscreenZebras in the ‘African savannah’.Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer“It has been a huge undertaking and occupied a lot of our time,” he said. “I don’t think we’ve had any blood but there’s been a lot of sweat, maybe a few tears along the way.“To finally get to the end is fantastic and a big relief but actually the real work starts now … there is plenty to keep us busy.”Explore more on these topicsZoosChesterAfricaAnimalsConservationEnglandEndangered speciesnewsShareReuse this content"

Later in life, he tattooed two crowns on his wrists to memorialise those carnival-like Epiphany commemorations and his Catholic roots.‘Deported because of his tattoos’: has the US targeted Venezuelans for their body art?Read more“MostCapacherosget crown tattoos, often adding the name of their father or mother. We’ve lots of people with these tattoos – it’s a tradition that began in 1917,” said Miguel Chacón, the president of Capacho’s Three Kings Day foundation.The Latin American tradition appears to have been lost on theUS immigrationofficers who detained Hernández, a 31-year-old makeup artist, hairdresser and theatre lover, after he crossed the southern border last August to attend a prearranged asylum appointment in San Diego.Hernández, who is gay, told agents he was fleeing persecution stemming from his sexual orientation and political views. Just weeks earlier, Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, had unleasheda ferocious crackdownafter being accused of stealing the presidential election to extend his 12-year rule.But Hernández’s tattoos were deemed proof he was a member of Venezuela’s most notorious gang, the Tren de Aragua, and a “security threat” to the US.View image in fullscreenThe crown tattoo tradition stems from the Three Kings Epiphany commemorations.Photograph: US DoJ immigration court“Detainee Hernandez ports [sic] tattoos ‘crowns’ that are consistent with those of a Tren de Aragua member,” an agent at California’s Otay Mesa detention centre claimed, according to court documents published this week.Those 16 words appear to have sealed the fate of the young Venezuelan stylist, who friends, family and lawyers say has never committed a crime.On 15 March, after more than six months in custody in the US, Hernández was one of scores of Venezuelans flown from Texas to a maximum security prison inEl Salvadoras part of Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign. To the horror of their relatives, some detainees were paraded before the cameras and filmed being manhandled by guards and having their heads shaved before being bundled into cells.“Let my son go. Review his case file. He is not a gang member,” Hernández’s mother, Alexis Dolores Romero de Hernández, pleaded as she came to terms with her son’s disappearance into the notorious Central American “terrorism confinement centre”, known by the Spanish acronym Cecot.“Everyone has these crowns, many people. But that doesn’t mean they’re involved in the Tren de Aragua … He’s never had problems with the law,” said Hernández, 65, who has not heard from her son since he called on the eve of his transfer to let her know – incorrectly – that he was being deported to Venezuela.View image in fullscreenAndry José Hernández Romero participating in Capacho’s Three Kings celebration“We know nothing. They say nothing. They give no information. That’s the trauma – not knowing anything about these young men, especially mine,” Alexis Hernández complained.Her son’s plight has caused outrage in Táchira, the western state where he grew up, with people packing Capacho’s picturesque 19th-century church, San Pedro de la Independencia, to demand his freedom.“We’re talking about someone who has been part of Capacho’s Three Kings Day celebrations for 23 years,” said Chacón, who is leading the campaign. “That’s why I’m doing everything I can to get this young man released. He is completely innocent.”Krisbel Vásquez, 29, a manicurist, denied her “calm, kind and humble” childhood friend was a villain. “I’ve known him all my life. He doesn’t bother anyone,” Vásquez said, urging Trump and El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, to backtrack.Xiomara Ramírez, 57, said her son had grown up with Hernández, with the pair doing homework together at her house. “I wonder why so much injustice. Why doesn’t the US give good people like Andry opportunities?” Ramírez asked.Melissa Shepard, an attorney from theCalifornia-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center, representing Andry, was perplexed that her “very sweet, kind and thoughtful” client had been incarcerated in “one of the worst places in the world.“The fact that this administration has taken somebody who is so vulnerable and put them into such a terrifying situation has just been horrific. We fear that if it can happen to him, it can happen to anyone,” she said.View image in fullscreenAndry José Hernández Romero.Growing indignation over Hernández’s plight, and that of other apparently innocent Venezuelans deported to El Salvadoron the basis of their tattoos, is spreading to unexpected places.“It’s horrific,”Joe Rogan, a Trump-endorsing podcaster, said on his latest show. Rogan supported Trump’s offensive against Venezuelan “criminals” the president claimed terrorised the US. “But let’s not [let] innocent gay hairdressers get lumped up with the gangs,” he said, asking: “How long before that guy can get out? Can we figure out how to get them out? Is there any plan in place to alert the authorities that they’ve made a horrible mistake and correct it?”But theTrump administrationhas shown no sign of reconsidering its decision to send so many Venezuelans to El Salvador on the basis of such flimsy evidence.On Monday, Trump thanked Bukele for receiving another group of alleged Latin American criminals “and giving them such a wonderful place to live!”Bukele said the deportations were “another step in the fight against terrorism and organised crime”, claiming the 17 detainees were all “confirmed murderers and high-profile offenders”.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, bristled whenquestionedabout agents’ use of a “points system” to classify detainees as gang members based on their tattoos or attire. “Shame on you and shame on the mainstream media for trying to cover for these [criminal] individuals,” she replied, claiming “a litany of criteria” was used to correctly identify “foreign terrorists” or “illegal criminal aliens” for removal.View image in fullscreenAndry José Hernández Romero among the crowds at one of the many Epiphany parades he took part in in the town of Capacho.Shepard questioned the administration’s assertion that detainees such as Hernández were being “removed”. “He has been disappeared,” she said. “I know the government tries to use the language that he was ‘removed’ [but] … he has absolutely been disappeared.”Thousands of miles away in Capacho, Hernández’s mother spoke sorrowfully of how her son had decided, against his family’s wishes, to abandon their economically damaged country last May and make the perilous journey north through the Darién jungles between Colombia and Panama. “He left because he wanted to help us … and to fulfil his dream,” Hernández said, adding: “Now the reality is different.”On a recent evening, she and hundreds of protesters filled the San Pedro church for their latest vigil in support of Hernández. The crowd included three men dressed as the Three Kings, who wore theatrical beards and diadems dotted with fake jewels and carried plaques bearing the words: Conscience, Justice and Freedom.“We, his family, and the entire town vouch for [Hernández’s] innocence. It’s not possible that in Capacho having a crown tattoo is a symbol of pride, but for him, it makes him a criminal,” Chacón said, appealing directly to the presidents of the US and El Salvador.“I know Trump is a good man and Bukele is a good man,” Chacón said. “But it cannot be that they have sent this young man to prison. There must be many others like him.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsCatholicismReligionVenezuelaEl SalvadorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In some areas in Mandalay the aid did not arrive. The aid was confiscated by the military junta,” said Dr Nang Win.Since the earthquake, Nang has been communicating with colleagues in Mandalay, where she says aid has been scarce and makeshift clinics are being set up in lieu of a proper emergency response system.She said one medical colleague in the city had signed paperwork to receive $1,000 in aid but received only about $100 of it, claiming the skimmed supplies would probably end up in a disaster black market. “Then there is a market that happens and they have to go around and buy their own,” she said.Since Myanmar’s military seized power in a February 2021 coup, an armed resistance movement – comprising various groups that formed to oppose the junta, as well as older, ethnic armed groups–has beenlocked in a chaotic and deadly civil warwith the junta. Over the past year the junta has been consistently losing ground, controlling less than 30% of the country’s territory, though it retains control of the biggest cities.The military had been blocking aid and rescuers from areas where it does not have full control, said Dr Nang. “If a group of rescuers comes and say we want to enter, especially in Sagaing, they will not let you, they will say you need a permit and once you get a permit it is too late,” she said.A spokesperson for the junta did not immediately respond to the claims.Dr Tun Aung Shwe, a medical doctor and Australian representative of Myanmar’s exiled opposition National Unity Government (NUG), said the military was leveraging control of checkpoints to block medicine flowing to areas controlled by the NUG and ethnic resistance groups.“Outside of the major cities, the military already checks and then tries to block the flow of aid,” he said, adding that local communities were forced to seek alternative routes. “They’re finding other ways. So it’s getting there, but it’s taking longer.”Emergency aid had been being blocked to areas such as Sagaing as well as Mogwe, he said.A member of a rescue team in Sagaing said they faced restrictions and blockades. “When we try to transport supplies from Mandalay, the military council doesn’t permit it. Even yesterday, when food supplies were being transported from Mandalay, they confiscated half of everything,” they said.The military inspects the rescue teams, they said, suspicious of weapons being brought into the areas under the guise of aid supplies. “They scrutinise even the helping teams thoroughly, prioritising only their [own] security. They don’t prioritise rescuing civilians. They also investigate food distribution teams, asking where they’re from and checking everything. If supplies are transported across the river from other cities, food supplies are confiscated and don’t reach their destination adequately,” the rescue worker said.On Tuesday, a major rebel alliance declared a unilateral ceasefire to support the humanitarian response to the earthquake. The Three Brotherhood Alliance, which comprises the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Ta’ang National Liberation Army and the Arakan Army, said it would not initiate offensive operations for one month to allow the rescue effort, and would engage in combat only in self-defence. The NUG previously announced that groups affiliated with it would observe a two-week ceasefire in earthquake-affected areas, with an exception for defensive actions.The junta also faces criticism for conducting airstrikes on villages. The Karen National Union, one of Myanmar’s oldest ethnic armies, said in a statement the junta “continues to carry out airstrikes targeting civilian areas, even as the population suffers tremendously from the earthquake”.Myanmar earthquake death toll tops 2,000, as health system ‘overwhelmed’Read moreTom Andrews, the UN’s special rapporteur on Myanmar, said confirming what was happening on the ground was challenging due to communication outages but that there were “consistent reports of aid being blocked” and that airstrikes were continuing.“Instead of focusing every ounce of energy, attention and resources on saving lives the junta is taking lives. That’s the first thing. Secondly, yesterday there have been consistent reports of aid being blocked, of aid workers being denied access at checkpoints,” he said.These reports were emerging from areas that were under opposition control or contested, he said, adding that the military should “stop killing people and focus on saving people”.On Monday night, airstrikes were reported in Singu township, Mandalay region, and Nawnghkio township, Shan state. Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said: “Myanmar’s military junta still invokes fear, even in the wake of a horrific natural disaster that killed and injured thousands. The junta needs to break from its appalling past practice and ensure that humanitarian aid quickly reaches those whose lives are at risk in earthquake-affected areas.”Scot Marciel, a retired US diplomat and ambassador to Myanmar from 2016 to 2020, said the military had a bad track record when it came to providing assistance to its citizens in need.“Myanmar has very poor infrastructure, and where the military government, where to the extent it controls things, [it] is not really going to lift much of a finger to help,” he said. “It’s a really bad place for it to happen.”During the Covid pandemic, he said, the military heavily restricted aid, providing oxygen mostly only to its supporters. During cyclone Nargis in 2008, a disaster that claimed almost 140,000 lives, the military leaders initially rejected all international aid.“Their history shows that they basically are willing to stand by and let lots of suffering and even death happen, if not inflicting it themselves, rather than do anything that might risk their power position,” Marciel said.Aid agencies warned of an urgent need for clean water and food in affected areas, and said there is a lack of sanitation systems.Kanni Wignaraja, the UN assistant secretary general and regional director for Asia and the Pacific at UNDP, said the magnitude of the devastation was unimaginable.“If you look at basic infrastructure … we’re already seeing that more than 80% of Sagaing town’s infrastructure is either destroyed or unsafe,” Wignaraja said.“A lot of these urban centres are going to have to be razed.“[It is] really important that the UN disaster assessment and response teams that are ready in Bangkok are allowed in fast,” she said, adding that a total ceasefire was needed so that relief work could be conducted.Myanmar’s junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing, said in a televised address that the death toll was expected to surpass 3,000, having reached 2,719 on Tuesday, with 441 missing.In neighbouring Thailand, teams continued to search the site of a tower block that collapsed while under construction, trapping dozens of workers. The death toll in Thailand rose to 20.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarEarthquakesAsia PacificSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said they were a “stern warning” to Taiwan’s democratically elected government over what Beijing claims is separatist activity.“China’sreunificationis an unstoppable trend - it will happen, and it must happen,” Guo Jiakun, a foreign ministry spokesperson, told a daily press conference on Tuesday afternoon.The maps that show how China’s military is squeezing TaiwanRead moreForces from the PLA Navy, Army and Rocket Force were approaching Taiwan from “multiple directions”, said China’s Eastern Theatre Command, which manages military operations in the region, on its official WeChat social media account.It said the drills would focus on “combat readiness patrols at sea and in the air, seizing comprehensive control, striking maritime and land targets and imposing blockade controls on key areas and routes”.The Command later said China’s Coast Guard was also involved, conducting what it called “law-enforcement patrols” close to Taiwan’s main island. A key element of China’s military advancement has been the integration of non-military arms, including the Coast Guard, and its maritime militia fleet of fishing boats, and theconversion or creation of civilian ships for military transport.“These drills are concrete actions to exercise legitimate jurisdiction and control over the Island in accordance with the one-China principle,” said Zhu Anqing, a China Coast Guard spokesperson.Taiwan’s defence ministry said it had detected 71 PLA aircraft and at least 19 Navy and Coast Guard vessels on Tuesday , including the Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong. More than 10 of the ships approached close to Taiwan’s contiguous zone, which stretches 24 nautical miles (44km) from the coast, military officials told Reuters. Taiwan’s military had deployed aircraft, Navy ships, and coastal missile systems in response, the ministry said.Beijing claims Taiwan is Chinese territoryand is building capability to seize it by military force. Analysts believe it is not there yet, but has been making significant advances and in the meantimeuses military pressure– such as drills – and other coercive means to push Taiwan towards submission.“‘Taiwan independence’ means war, and pursuing ‘Taiwan independence’ means pushing the people of Taiwan into a dangerous situation of war,” Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office, claimed in a statement.5:03How China uses ‘salami-slicing’ tactics to exert pressure on Taiwan - videoTaiwan, which is recognised as a country by around a dozen others mostly in the Pacific and Caribbean, operates as a sovereign state with its own democratically elected government, military and currency. Its government and people overwhelmingly oppose the prospect of Chinese rule.Taiwan’s presidential office spokesperson, Wen Lii, condemned China’s “escalatory behaviour” and “military provocations”, linking it to other recent exercises nearAustralia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, the Philippines and in the South China Sea.“China’s wide-ranging drills indicate that its ambitions are not limited to annexing Taiwan, but rather aim to achieve hegemony in the western Pacific.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Other imagery called Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, a “parasite courting ultimate destruction” and portrayed him as a cartoon bug being held by chopsticks over a burning Taipei. That cartoon, which was in Chinese and English, also showed him holding a former opposition figure, Ko Wen-je, in a cage, in apparent provocation of Taiwan’s febrile domestic politics – Ko is now in jail on corruption charges but some supporters have called it a political persecution.China has launched numerous drills against Taiwan in recent years, often in response to perceived acts of separatism or pro-independence. Lai,who was elected last yearto continue the rule of the pro-sovereignty Democratic Progressive party, has taken a forthright approach to cross-strait tensions. Last month hedeclared China to be a “foreign hostile force”under national security legislation, and announced a series of measures to counter its growing influence andespionage operations. His speech and measures were specifically cited in Tuesday’s propaganda.Amanda Hsiao, a director in Eurasia Group’s China practice, said Tuesday’s propaganda“makes it clear that China is breaking from what has been a relatively quiet approach since Trump’s election”.“This is primarily about Lai’s 13 March speech which Beijing found provocative,” she said. “The publicity around the exercise likely also has the US in mind – they want to persuade the Trump administration that Lai is a troublemaker andto deter the US from maintaining high levelsof support to Taiwan.”Tuesday’s drills have differed slightly from more recent efforts, which have not been so explicitly linked to “punishing” Taiwan. They were also launched with little warning. Taiwan’s government and military have been ramping up their response training amid growing concern that Beijing might launch a real attack or blockade under the guise of a drill.On Tuesday, defence ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang said Taiwan had elevated its readiness level to ensure China didn’t “turn drills in to combat” and “launch a sudden attack on us”.The drills appeared to be of similar size to the PLA’s “Joint Sword” exercises held in 2023 and 2024, but were unnamed, which a Chinese military analyst told state media was a sign of such activity being “normalised”.The US secretary of defence, Pete Hegseth, has visited several Asian countries in recent days, emphasising that countering China and deterring it from attacking Taiwan was akey priority for the US.Explore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

A report from Aston Business School has forecast a full-scale trade conflict of protectionist retaliation could result in aUS$1.4tn global welfare loss.But Leavitt indicated the US would be willing to consider amending the tariffs after they had been imposed. Trump has already sought to use tariffs as leverage to pursue foreign policy goals, such as seeking to stem the flow of illegal fentanyl across US bordersfrom Canada and Mexico.“Certainly, the president is always up to take a phone call, always up for a good negotiation, but he is very much focused on fixing the wrongs of the past and showing that American workers have a fair shake,” Leavitt said.In Trump’s first administration, Australiasecured exemptions from tariffsafter arguing that Australia ran a trade deficit with America, had a signed and ratified a free trade agreement, and was a committed ally and security partner.But Trump’s second administration has repeatedly said the president regrets the exemptions he gave to Australia in his first term, particularly for the precedent they set for other countries claiming similar carve-outs.Earlier this week, the office of the US trade representativereleased its annual reporton “foreign trade barriers”, listing Australia’s biosecurity regime on importing beef, pork and poultry from US producers as a major grievance.The trade body also took issue with Australia offering generic drugs at lower prices without notifying US patent owners, and plans to strengthen laws forcing foreign social media companies to pay Australian media companies for news.Pharmaceuticals, one of the US’s most significant exports to Australia, attracted particular attention.Last month, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PHrMA) industry lobby groupwrote to the Trump administration’s trade representativecondemning Australia’s $18bn PBS, which subsidises medicines for Australians.In its submission, PHrMA said the PBS was “egregious and discriminatory”, and urged the US to “use all available trade enforcement tools to eliminate the unfair and non-reciprocal trade practices”.2:09Malcolm Turnbull: 'Get off your knees and stand up for Australia' when dealing with Trump – videoAustralia’s trade minister warns Trump tariff war could raise price of Big Mac in USRead moreExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyTrump tariffsAustralian foreign policyDonald TrumpInternational tradeBusiness (Australia news)newsShareReuse this content"

On the same day, he allegedly pushed over one police officer and stood over them with clenched fists.While on bail for these offences, he is alleged to have committed six robberies, possessed a large machete and been involved in multiple assaults.He was arrested and bailed again in September last year. Police allege he committed two more robberies and an armed robbery in the following fortnight.He was released on bail again later that month, allegedly breached his conditions and was then granted supervised bail in October.MMA attended five of eight scheduled appointments and was expected to attend court in December. He allegedly failed to show up.Police allege that he was involved in an aggravated carjacking, when a rideshare driver was threatened with a machete, and other offences.He was remanded in custody until he appeared before Justice James Gorton for a bail application in the supreme court on 5 March.Youth Justice opposed bail.Its concerns included that MMA told them he did not want any bail conditions with a curfew and would rather “return to the community on a sentenced order”, he refused to engage in an assessment, and could only live with relatives where alleged co-offenders also resided.He maintained connections with young people known to Youth Justice and told them he has “issues with multiple young people from opposing ‘gangs’” and allegedly committed numerous physical assaults while on remand, including on Youth Justice staff.But he also told Youth Justice staff he wanted to get a job and did not want to let his family down.“The allegations, if correct, reveal an ongoing preparedness to engage, repeatedly, in violent and threatening behaviour, including with the use of weapons, against members of the public,” Gorton found.“The applicant’s history also reveals, if the allegations against him are correct, that his engagement with police, the laying of charges and being subject to a summons to answer an offence and even the imposition of bail conditions have not operated in the past to prevent his continuing to offend in the same way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While there remained a need to impose on a child “the minimum intervention required in the circumstances”, the remand of a child was no longer to be seen as “a last resort”.Despite the new laws, Gorton said, he still had to consider MMA’s age and maturity at the time of the alleged offences, the need to strengthen and preserve his relationship with his family, and the importance of supporting him to live at home or in a safe, stable and secure living arrangement.He also had to consider the importance of supporting him to engage in education, training or work, the need to minimise the stigma to him resulting from being remanded in custody, the likely sentence should he be found guilty, the need to ensure that the conditions of bail are no more onerous than are necessary, and recommendations or information contained in any report provided by a bail support service.He said MMA remained an unacceptable risk of reoffending without the strict conditions and extended his bail on those conditions for a month.There is nothing simple about alleged youth offenders such as MMA, despite how those who are charged with offences such as robberies and using machetes are portrayed on the nightly news or on the social media reels of influencers.Locking alleged offenders like these up, experts say, often just momentarily delays their offending, rather than challenging them to change their lives. It is the difference between burning a containment line to control a fire and putting it out.The signs in MMA’s case, Gorton said, were “good and positive”. It will take far longer than two weeks to see what new bail laws will mean for other alleged youth offenders like him, or how they will help a state governmentdesperate to be seen as tough on crime.Explore more on these topicsVictoriaVictorian politicsYouth justiceanalysisShareReuse this content"

It fined 15 car manufacturers plus the trade body ACEA €458m (£383m) for participating in a cartel regarding end-of-life vehicle recycling across the trading bloc.The 10 manufacturers subject to the UK fines were contacted for comment by the Guardian.A spokesperson for Renault said: “The infringing practices date back to 2002 and ended up in 2018, at a time when the structuring of the ELV (end of life vehicle) recycling sector was still nascent, as was environmental communication.

Warning sirens went off around the town. By 12.35pm local time it was estimated to be 1,200 metres long.A second fissure has also opened between Grindavík’s protective barriers and the town.View image in fullscreenAn ‘earthquake swarm’ was observed near Grindavík before an eruption on Tuesday morning. This photo shows a previous eruption in November.Photograph: Marco di Marco/APDramatic video footage showed magma spewing up on the Grindavík side of the defence barrier. “The fissure continues to grow, and it cannot be ruled out that it may continue to open further south,” the IMO said.The IMO later said it had received a report of a broken hot water pipeline in northern Grindavík, which it said “confirms that significant fault movements have occurred within the town”.Later in the afternoon it said that while volcanic activity appeared to have significantly decreased, seismic activity was “ongoing”.The fishing town, about an hour’s drive from the capital, has been largely uninhabited since 10 November 2023, when an eruption resulted in the town cracking open with fissures reaching a depth of 20 metres. Although some of the town’s 3,800 residents and some of its businesses returned, most dispersed to other parts of the country after the state bought up most of its buildings because they were uninhabitable.Regional police said they had completed the evacuation of Grindavík, with the exception of a small number of residents who refused to leave. The Blue Lagoon, one of Iceland’s most popular tourist attractions, said it had successfully evacuated the thermal spa.View image in fullscreenThe orange-red fissure has been seen expelling lava and smoke.Photograph: Marco di Marco/APRunólfur Þórhallsson, Iceland’s director of civil protection, urged those who had chosen not to leave the town to evacuate, saying the eruption could be much larger than recent ones because the magma tunnel is longer and a lot of magma has accumulated.The Blue Lagoon said it was temporarily closed due to the volcanic eruption and that it would provide more information as it became available.Earlier in the day, the IMO said the signals it was picking up were stronger than those recently on Sundhnúkur crater row, indicating that “a considerable amount of magma is currently on the move”.“Emergency responders in Grindavík have reported that earthquakes can be felt in the town, and signs of deformation are also visible there, suggesting that fault movements could occur within the town itself,” it added.View image in fullscreenMost residents have already left Grindavík.Photograph: Marco di Marco/APThe Icelandic tourist board said there was “no threat to the population” and that flights were operating as usual at Keflavík airport.Snorri Valsson, a spokesperson for the tourist board, said: “The area has been closed off and is completely closed until further notice. Gas pollution might form in isolated areas around the eruption depending on wind direction and is closely monitored.”Valsson added: “The eruption is still developing and we will publish further information when gathered.”Although there was an initial effect on tourist numbers after the November 2023 eruption – which the tourism board in part blamed on international reporting – numbers have since slightly increased.The number of foreign nationals coming through Keflavík airport rose by 2% to 2,261,391 in 2023-24 compared with the same period the year before, according to Statistics Iceland. The 383,963 overnight hotel stays recorded in November 2024 were also up compared with the number in November 2023.Explore more on these topicsIcelandVolcanoesEuropeGeologynewsShareReuse this content"

It came after Trump on Sunday revealed his frustration with Putin,saying he was “pissed off”and threatening to impose tariffs on Russian oil exports.“All we have today is an attempt to find some kind of framework that would first allow for a ceasefire – at least as envisioned by the Americans,” Ryabkov said.“As far as we can see, there is no place in them today for our main demand, namely to solve the problems related to the root causes of this conflict.”Putin has repeatedly referred to what he claimed were the “root causes” of the conflict to justify his hardline position on any prospective deal to end the war inUkraine.As preconditions for a ceasefire, the Russian leader has insisted on terms that would, in effect, dismantle Ukraine as an independent, functioning state – pulling it firmly into Russia’s sphere of influence.He has demanded that Kyiv recognise Russia’s annexation of Crimea and four partly occupied regions in the south-east, withdraw its forces from those areas, pledge never to join Nato, and agree to demilitarisation.View image in fullscreenThe ruins of a building in the abandoned Ukrainian city of Maryinka, which was destroyed during the invasion by Russian forces.Photograph: Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersIn recent weeks the Russian president has also been openly pushing for regime change in Ukraine, claiming that Volodymyr Zelenskyy lacks the legitimacy to sign a peace deal and suggesting that Ukraine needs external governance.Trump appears to be growing increasingly impatient with his lack of progress in a war that he promised to end in 24 hours, expressing frustration with Russian and Ukrainian leaders as he struggles to forge a truce.Trump’s comment that he was “pissed off” with Putin over the Russian leader’s approach to a potential ceasefire in Ukraine was a noticeable shift in tone from a leader who had previously expressed admiration for Putin. However, Trump later dialled back his rhetoric and by Monday was accusing Ukraine of trying to renegotiate an economic deal with the US.The White House on Tuesday said Trump was frustrated with leaders on both sides of the war.Despite a flurry of US-brokered meetings and parallel talks with Russia and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia that produced – on paper – a 30-day energy ceasefire, both sides have continued to strike each other’s energy infrastructure.The Trump administration also attempted to broker a ceasefire in the Black Sea, but Moscow sought to attach several conditions to the deal, including the easing of European sanctions, a demand swiftly rejected by Brussels.Grigory Karasin, who represented Russia at the talks with the US in Saudi Arabia, last week admitted that the sides had failed to make significant progress and that negotiations may drag into next year.But Trump’s team has said it remains committed to halting the war, with the US leader telling NBC he and Putin planned to speak again this week.The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, who spent time with Trump over the weekend, said he proposed setting a deadline of 20 April for Putin to comply with a full ceasefire.However, those close to the Kremlin believe Moscow is unlikely to accept a full ceasefire without securing some of its demands, which include the cessation of all arms and intelligence supplies to Ukraine from the US and other allies.“We’re prepared to keep fighting for some time,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent Russian foreign policy analyst who heads a council that advises the Kremlin. “The continuation of the war, which we are slowly but surely winning, is in our interest. Especially considering that the main sponsor [the US] seems to be backing out … Why should we rush in a situation like this?”Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Posts giving the judges’ full names, photographs and a part of de Perthuis’ address were condemned by French legal bodies.Rémy Heitz, the public prosecutor at the court of cassation, France’s highest court, said the “highly personalised” attacks were “unacceptable” and that any threats may be subject to criminal prosecution.Marine Le Pen verdict throws National Rally into chaos but could boost far right | Angelique ChrisafisRead more“Justice is not political; this decision is not a political decision but a legal one rendered by three independent, impartial judges, in accordance with the law,” Heitz said.The justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, said such threats were unacceptable: “In a democracy, it is unacceptable for people to physically threaten judges. When we call for the rule of law it includes all free and independent magistrates in this country.” He called on far-right MPs to support the threatened magistrates.Darmanin said he hoped that if Le Pen appealed against her conviction – as she has said she will – a new trial “can be organised within as reasonable a timeframe as possible”, but added it was up to the courts to fix a date.The French court of appeal said on Tuesday that it should be able to provide a decision in summer 2026.Jordan Bardella, 29, the RN president, alsocalled on supporters not to threaten or insult the judges.“This is unacceptable and we condemn it,” he said.Hours after the verdict, RN officials went on the offensive, giving interviews, press conferences, planning a leafleting campaign and setting up a petition that crashed the party’s website.The RN is reported to be planning a major rally in support of Le Pen in Paris either this weekend on the next and is calling for nationwide demonstrations againstthe court’s decision to banher from public office for five years, seemingly wrecking her hopes of succeeding Emmanuel Macron as president .Le Pen and 24 others from RN, including party officials, employees, MEPs and assistants, were convicted of embezzling millions in European parliament funds as part of a fake jobs scam.The trial last November heard how the party took money for EU parliamentary assistants but spent it on paying staff in France. None of the accused benefited personally from the embezzlement and all denied the charges.Le Pen, 56, was also given a four-year prison term, two years suspended and two to be served wearing an electronic bracelet. The sentence will be postponed until the appeal process is exhausted, but the five-year ban on standing for public office takes immediate effect.Le Pen went on TV to denounce what she said was the court’s“political decision”and vowed to “pursue all legal avenues” to be able to stand in 2027. An appeal by Le Pen will lead to a new trialthat she hopes will overturn the conviction and public office ban in time to campaign for the presidency.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We work together, hand in hand and in total confidence.“I have total loyalty. Those who think they have killed off the RN and put us out of the game will not succeed.“If you are in politics, you are not above the law, but neither are you below it.”Bardella added that he hoped the appeal court hearing could be held in time to “correct the error” of the lower court so that Le Pen could stand in 2027, and said RN voters were being ignored as “second-class” citizens.“We are not fashos, racists or far right. We are reasonable people who are patriotic, who love our country and we are fighting for the French people.

Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD79.Experts believe the female sculpture was of an important local woman who was perhaps a priestess of Ceres, who in ancient Roman religion was a goddess of agriculture, fertility and motherly relationships, because of the jewellery and accessories, including earrings, rings and bracelets, carved into it – especially thelunula,a crescent moon pendant hanging in the middle of the necklace.View image in fullscreenThe two sculptures, with a tree root reaching from above the man’s head down to his feet.Photograph: Alfio GiannottiThe woman is veiled and dressed in a large cloak over a tunic, while the man is wearing a toga wrapped over his left shoulder.However, experts are not convinced that the figures, which were joined together and are believed to date back to the late Roman Republic period, represented a married couple.Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the director of Pompeii archaeological park, said: “Because she really looks like a very important woman in the local elite, there is also this idea that she could have been a priestess of Ceres, holding these lands and what appears to be a purist role.”View image in fullscreenA detail from the statue of the woman, showing a hand holding laurel leaves.Photograph: Alfio GiannottiShe is holding what appears to be laurel leaves, which were used to purify and bless religious spaces by dispersing incense and the smoke from aromatic herbs.With most women in Roman society relegated to domestic roles, being a priestess, an important position in public life, was the highest position a woman could aspire to and gave power on a similar level to a male priest.Zuchtriegel said such funerary sculptures did not always represent couples. “Sometimes you get two men, or sometimes they come in threes,” he said. “This could be her husband, but it could also be her son. There was no inscription, so we don’t know.”By the feet of the male statue is the preserved root of an ancient tree that grew on top of the tomb. “It was quite a surprise to find it there a few centimetres beneath the ground,” said Zuchtriegel.The two sculptures are being restored and will be displayed at an exhibition in Pompeii, beginning on 16 April.The excavations at the Porta Sarno necropolis are a joint project between Pompeii archaeological park and the European University of Valencia. In 2021,the partly mummified remains, including hair and bones, of a former slavewho rose through the social ranks, were found.Explore more on these topicsItalyArchaeologyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But under the French laws, it would not result in an interim suspension the application of the immediate public office ban, risking prolonged uncertainty about her eligibility to stand in the 2027 race until the appeal is decided.He also called Tanguy out for not condemning attacks on and threats against the independent judiciary in the aftermath of yesterday’s decision.Speaking for the Socialist Party, its parliamentary group presidentBoris Vallaudcriticised those attacking the decision by saying that “to question a court decision is to breach the basic principles of the separation of powers and the rule of law.”He said “all French women and all French people are equal before the law,” and one should only look at the “damning” facts of the case, as he warned that to juxtapose the courts with the will of the people would be “a dead road” undermining democracy.He asked prime ministerFrançois Bayrouto express “unconditional support” for judges, despite “attacks against our rule of law made from the Kremlin to the White House by the friends of Le Pen.”In response, Bayrou said it would not be right for a government official to ever criticise a court decision as he declared his “unconditional, unmeasured” support for the independent judiciary.He also stresses that Le Pen can appeal against the decision.Butin comments that are likely to cause further controversy, he adds that, speaking as a private citizen, he has some questions about the unappealable nature of the immediate public office ban.Share"

One body was recovered on Saturday. Fourteen more were found in a sandy grave at the site on Sunday and were brought back for autopsies in the nearby city of Khan Younis.Dr Ahmed al-Farra, a senior doctor at the Nasser medical complex in Khan Younis, witnessed the arrival of some of the remains.“I was able to see three bodies when they were transferred to the Nasser hospital. They had bullets in their chest and head. They were executed. They had their hands tied,’’ Farra said. “They tied them so they were unable to move and then they killed them.”He provided photographs he said he had taken of one of the dead on arrival at the hospital. The pictures show a hand at the end of a long-sleeved black shirt with a black cord knotted around the wrist.Another witness, an official from an international aid agency who took part in the recovery of remains from Rafah on Sunday, also said they saw evidence of one of the dead having been shot after being detained.“I saw the bodies with my own eyes when we found them in the mass grave,” the witness, who did not want his name used for his own safety, told the Guardian in a telephone interview. “They had signs of multiple shots in the chest. One of them had legs tied. One was shot in the head. They were executed.”1:23Bodies of Palestinian rescue workers recovered from mass grave – videoThe accounts add to allegations made by a senior Palestinian Red Crescent official, the Palestinian Civil Defence and the Gaza health ministry that some of the victims had been shot after they were detained and put in restraints by Israeli troops.The incident came after the Israeli government ended a two-month-old ceasefire and resumed its military campaign against Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza on 17 March, with heavy aerial bombing and ground operations. The people of Rafah were ordered to leave the town on Monday, before Israeli ground operations there.The international criminal court issued arrest warrants for war crimes in November against the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and the ICC prosecutor has said he is still investigating Israeli forces and Hamas for suspected atrocities.The victims are believed to have been killed on 23 March, two of them in the early hours when their ambulance came under Israeli fire while on the way to collect injured people from an earlier airstrike. The remaining 13 of the dead were in a convoy of ambulances and civil defence vehicles dispatched to retrieve the bodies of their two colleagues. One of the dead was a UN employee. A Red Crescent paramedic, named as Assad al-Nassasra, is still missing.The UN said the ambulances and other vehicles were buried in sand by bulldozers alongside the bodies of the dead, in what appears to have been an attempt to cover up the killings. UN video footage taken by the recovery team showed a crushed UN vehicle, ambulances and a fire truck that had been flattened and buried in the sand by the Israeli military.“This is a huge blow to us … These people were shot,” Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN aid coordination office,said on Tuesday. “Normally we are not at a loss for words and we are spokespeople, but sometimes we have difficulty finding them. This is one of those cases.”Israel’s military has said its “initial assessment” of the incident had found that its troops had opened fire on several vehicles “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals”, and has claimed, so far without evidence, that Hamas fighters and other militants had been using the ambulances for cover.The Israel Defense Forces have so far not responded to questions, first posed on Monday, about the reports that the bodies and their vehicles had been buried or to the allegations that some had been shot after being detained.mapDr Bashar Murad, the Red Crescent’s director of health programmes in Gaza, said at least one of the recovered bodies of the paramedics had had his hands tied, and that one of the paramedics had been on a call to the ambulance dispatcher when the attack took place.On that call, Murad said, gunshots fired at close range could be heard as well as the voices of Israeli soldiers on the scene speaking in Hebrew, ordering the detention of at least some of the paramedics.“The gunshots were fired from a close distance. They could be heard on the call between signal officer and of the medical crews that survived and phoned the ambulance centre for help. The soldiers’ voices were clearly audible in Hebrew and very close, as well as the sound of the gunfire.”“Gather them at the wall and bring some restraints to tie them,” was one of the lines that Murad said could be heard by the dispatcher. He said the call had not been recorded.Mahmoud Basal, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Civil Defence in Gaza, said the bodies had been found with at least about 20 gunshots in each of them and confirmed that “at least one of them had their legs bound”.In a statement released on Monday, Gaza’s health ministry said: “They were executed, some of them handcuffed and had sustained head and chest injuries. They were buried in a deep hole to prevent their identities from being identified.”On Monday the IDF issued evacuation orders covering most of Rafah, indicating it could soon launch another major ground operation, eight days after the paramedics and rescue workers were killed.According to the Red Crescent, an ambulance was dispatched to pick up the casualties from the airstrike in the early hours of 23 March and called for a support ambulance. The first ambulance arrived at hospital safely but contact was lost with the support ambulance at 3.30am. An initial report from the scene said it had been shot at and the two paramedics inside killed.The Palestinian Red Crescent president, Dr Younis al-Khatib, said the IDF had impeded the collection of the bodies for several days. The IDF said it had facilitated the evacuation of bodies as soon as “operational circumstances” allowed.“The bodies were recovered with difficulty as they were buried in the sand, with some showing signs of decomposition,” the Red Crescent said.Their burial had been put off pending autopsies at the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. The autopsies have now been carried out, according to hospital sources, and a full report is due to be delivered to the Gaza health ministry within 10 days.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Ahmad said he noticed during Walid’s four court appearances – conducted over video link – that his son appeared to be in poor health.“His body was weakened due to malnutrition in the prisons in general,” Ahmad said. He said Walid had told him at one point he was suffering from scabies, a contagious skin rash caused by mites. “Don’t worry about me,” his father recalls him saying.Walid’s lawyer, Firas al-Jabrini, said Israeli authorities had denied his requests to visit his client in prison. He told AP three prisoners held alongside Walid said he had dysentery and that it was widespread among young Palestinians at the facility.Palestinian prisoners describe systemic abuse in Israel’s jailsRead moreThaer Shriteh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority’s detainee commission, told AP that Walid had collapsed and hit his head on a metal rod, losing consciousness. “The prison administration did not respond to the prisoners’ requests for urgent care to save his life,” he said, citing witnesses who spoke to the commission.The Israeli prison service said in a statement that an investigation was under way: “A 17-year-old security detainee from Megiddo prison, from the West Bank area, passed away yesterday in the prison, with his medical condition being under privacy protection,” it said. “An investigation is still ongoing.”More than 14,000 Palestinians have been detained by the Israeli army in the West Bank since the Hamas attack in Israel in October 2023, according to Palestinian figures. Most are held in administrative detention, which allows for the pre-emptive arrest of individuals based on undisclosed evidence.Israel says those detained are suspected of either militancy or aggression towards soldiers.Rights groups have documented widespread abuse in Israeli detention facilities but prison authorities deny any systemic abuse and say they investigate accusations of wrongdoing by staff. The Israeli ministry overseeing prisons acknowledges conditions inside detention facilities have been reduced to the minimum level allowed under Israeli law.Walid is the 63rd Palestinian prisoner from the West Bank or Gaza to die in Israeli custody since the start of the war and the first Palestinian teenager to die in Israeli detention, according to the Palestinian Authority.Oneg Ben Dror of the Jaffa-based NGO Physicians for Human Rights Israel called for an independent investigation into the death of Palestinians in Israeli prisons and military camps. “We urge the international community to hold Israel accountable for these deaths,” he said.Palestinians have long alleged that imprisonment is a key element of Israel’s 57-year occupation: estimates suggest up to 40% of Palestinian men have been arrested at least once.Explore more on these topicsIsraelWest BankPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The town sits a stone’s throw fromSyriaand save for three soldiers manning an army checkpoint at the entry to the village, the presence of the Lebanese state is minimal.The people of Qasr and the villages that straddle both sides of the nearly 248 mile-long (400km) Syria-Lebanon border were for decades in business together. Authorities in Assad’s Syria profited from the flow of weapons, drugs and fuel over the border, and its ally in Lebanon, the Iran-backed Shia militiaHezbollah, relied on routes used by smugglers to receive weapons coming from Iran.View image in fullscreenA fighter with the new Syrian government stands watch near the border with Lebanon after Syrian forces clashed with smuggling gangs on 10 February.Photograph: Bakr Alkasem/AFP/GettyBut after the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad wasousted by Syrian rebelson 8 December and a war-battered Hezbollah lost its grip over the Lebanese state, authorities in both countries have sought to reassert control over their borders and crack down on smuggling.The attempt to seal the porous border has disrupted the decades long smuggling trade between Syria and Lebanon and has turned local tensions into deadly international military incidents.Map of northern LebanonOn 16 March, three Syrian soldiers were killed in Lebanese territory, prompting the Syrian army to begin to pummel Qasr and surrounding villages with artillery. Smuggling tribes in the villages returned fire and the Lebanese army also responded to Syrian rockets, with a ceasefire agreed a day later.In all, three Syrians and seven Lebanese were killed on both sides, while another 52 were wounded in Lebanon.It was the second time in a month that clashes had erupted between Syria and Lebanon. Syrian authorities blamed Lebanon’s Hezbollah for the skirmishes, claiming it had infiltrated Syrian territory, kidnapped three Syrian soldiers and killed them. Hezbollah denied any involvement.Lebanese people painted a very different story, of a new Syrian army that did not yet know the lay of the land, and of a local dispute that escalated quickly.A member of the Lebanese Jaafar tribe, an influential smuggling clan that controls many of the routes in the area, said: “Three Syrian soldiers [were] walking, and stepped on Lebanese land by accident. They ran across a shepherd who got scared and called his relatives, who killed the soldiers immediately.”He described how tensions have been running high between the people of Lebanese border villages and the new Syrian authorities. “Smugglers are scared to go to Syria now, they don’t feel there’s security,” he said.Many Lebanese living in towns on the Syrian side of the border for decades fled after the fall of Assad for fear of the new authorities. One 68-year-old farmer who was born and raised in Syria said his land had been taken from him in December, so he fled to Qasr.Arms have poured into Lebanese border towns after Assad’s troops abandoned their posts, leaving weapons ranging from rifles to light artillery by the roadside. The Jaafar family member said it was now common to find Kornets, a Russian anti-tank guided missile, in Qasr – and that they were quite cheap, too.When Syrian artillery fire started on Qasr and the surrounding area, tribes such as the Jaafar family took up arms to defend the town – and arms they had aplenty. Avideoof an al-Arabiya correspondent inside Syria during the clashes captured the moment a rocket was shot from the Lebanese side, slightly injuring the reporter.View image in fullscreenA convoy of Syrian defence ministry vehicles heading to the border with Lebanon on 17 March.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyMany people in Qasr are members of Hezbollah – the group announced four of its fighters were killed in the clashes – although residents insisted the militia did not direct the battle, but rather fighters participated as members of the town.Experts say the relationship between smugglers and Hezbollah is more of a partnership, rather than the tribes that engage in smuggling being under the Lebanese group’s control.Joseph Daher, the author of Hezbollah: The political economy of the party of God, said: “Most of these clans are politically covered and have connections with Hezbollah. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) [the Islamist authority that rules Syria] is trying to strengthen its controls at the border, especially targeting clans affiliated with Hezbollah.”The Lebanese state has also been keen to strengthen its control over the Syria-Lebanese border, eager to show western powers it is preventing weapons from reaching Hezbollah. Before the fall of the Assad regime, the Lebanese group would receive weapons shipments via Syria through the Bekaa valley.Despite the clashes, business is business. Smugglers say the flow of illicit goods has continued after the fall of Assad. “Publicly, [HTS] is saying they want smuggling to stop, but they need our goods. Business doesn’t have an identity,” said a second member of the Jaafar family. The new Syrian authorities have regularised and decreased the fees they charge smugglers, he said, as Syria desperately needs Lebanese fuel and diesel as western-led sanctions have throttled its ability to import them.The only goods smugglers can no longer traffic are drugs. The factories that used to produce the popular amphetamine captagon were run by the now deposed Assad regime and smuggled through the Bekaa valley to be exported via Lebanon’s ports. Syria’s new authorities have cracked down on the narcotics trade.Lebanon’s smugglers and Syrian officials are still getting to know one another. Gone are the fourth armoured division soldiers under the control of Maher al-Assad, the brother of Syria’s ousted president, which used to control the Syrian side of the smuggling routes.The introduction is off to a rocky start. As the Jaafar clan member was speaking, bursts of machine-gun fire erupted, followed by the dull thuds of rocket-propelled grenades fired by the Syrian authorities at a neighbouring village.“If the ceasefire continues then we won’t attack them and they won’t attack us. But it seems we are entering a cycle of violence and revenge,” he said.Explore more on these topicsSyriaLebanonHezbollahMiddle East and north AfricaBashar al-AssadfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the cost of treating cancer is way higher.”Now, she said: “Everything is kind of converging and we want to make the most of this opportunity. We are also keeping the pressure on the government so that we don’t miss this chance.”Last year about 11,000 members of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (Fogsi)underwent virtual training. About 100 of those trainees have now become the National HPV Faculty and will each train 500 general physicians from the Indian Medical Association over the next six months.The idea, Biswas said, “is to build confidence”. Training includes practical information on dosages, details of the World Health Organization’s push toeliminate cervical cancer, and advice on how to answer common questions.The implementation of India’s cervical screening programmehad been sluggish, she said. Most cancers are diagnosed late, and most people’s experiences of the disease relate to death.Many non-specialist doctors “didn’t even know that a cancer could be eliminated and vaccination could be such a gamechanger”, Biswas said.After the training, doctors are asked to approach their community in their local language to give short presentations.India gets its own HPV vaccine to stop 70,000 women dying of cervical cancer a yearRead moreThe Covid-19 pandemic, and associated vaccination campaigns, had helped, Biswas said – even in less-educated rural communities people now understood the link between viruses and vaccines. “Now, when we are talking in the community, we can [explain] there’s a virus causing cervical cancer – that’s why we are here, we have a vaccine.”Training was also offered separately to local civil society organisations, she said “on how to understand this and talk about it so there is no backlash”.View image in fullscreenThe vaccine has been available in India since 2008 but has had low take-up.Photograph: Hindustan Times/Getty ImagesDr Priya Ganeshkumar, the gynaecologist and cancer specialist leading the project within Fogsi, said gynaecologists were well placed to do advocacy work.Families often returned to the doctor who had delivered their baby when their daughters started having periods, or in subsequent pregnancies “so we have a lot of scope for talking about this vaccine”, she said. It might be “the daughter is sitting with the mother, and [we can] proactively ask the question ‘hey, girl – what’s your age?’ [and ask the parent] ‘Did you vaccinate your child?’”.While many gynaecologists were already aware of the HPV vaccine, she asked: “Did they emphasise it?” The training, she said, helped them to understand the importance of raising it with patients and to not assume that vaccination was the job of a paediatrician. The HPV vaccine is typically given to preteens, later than most childhood vaccinations.The potential was vast, Ganeshkumar said. “We all know about cervical cancer –Indiais a hub of it. Every seven to eight minutes, a lady in India is dying due to cervical cancer, when it is preventable.”Cancer Research UK is providing about a quarter of the project’s funding. Its chief executive, Michelle Mitchell, said it was part of efforts towards “a future where almost nobody develops cervical cancer”.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentHPV vaccineIndiaGlobal healthSouth and central AsiaVaccines and immunisationHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The UK has not so far threatened to hit back, though Starmer has said he is “keeping all options on the table”.Downing Street sources confirmed the UK had reached broad agreement with US counterparts on a trade deal, focusing on technology, which it hopes will help the UK secure a carve-out from tariffs. Talks between officials will continue.The UK’s trade deal offer is understood to include a proposal to broaden the DST to bring smaller companies within scope, meaning they would contribute to a tax take which is forecast to increase to £1.2bn a year by the end of the decade.As a result the 2% levy on the UK revenues of the big US tech companies could fall. Five have publicly said they pay the tax – Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, eBay and Apple – and some have lobbied the government to pay less, arguing that it discriminates against larger firms and should apply to profits rather than revenues.Tax experts say that Elon Musk’s X is also likely to have paid the tax in recent years but the company has not said so publicly. Tech businesses that generate more than £500m in worldwide revenues and more than £25m from UK users are liable.Government sources suggested that broadening the scope of the tax would mean some tech firms from other countries would now be expected to pay, helping to address the fairness argument made by the White House.Trump has complained about the impact that DSTs around the world are having on US firms. In February he issued an executive order – entitled “Defending American Companies and Innovators From Overseas Extortion and Unfair Fines and Penalties” – threatening tariffs in retaliation.No 10 remains confident it can secure exemptions once a trade deal is signed, but believes that Trump’s focus on a “big bang” of announcements means the UK should initially brace itself for 20% tariffs on all goods entering the US.The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said the UK was in “the best possible position of any country to reach an agreement” on duties getting lifted, while officials cited the US president’s pledge to “be nice” to countries that had balanced trade with the US.But with Trump’s car tariffs due to come into force tomorrow, 3 Aprilthinktank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) warned that 25,000 jobs at UK-based auto-manufacturers are heavily dependent on exporting to the US, and could be under threat.One in eight cars built in the UK is sold to US buyers. The IPPR’s research fellow Pranesh Narayanan said: “Trump’s tariffs have huge potential to completely destabilise the UK car manufacturing industry, affecting tens of thousands of jobs and putting the government’s growth plans at jeopardy.”The UK is also understood to have made concessions on agriculture, with tariffs on imports of US beef, chicken and other meat to the UK to be lowered. The move is likely to further infuriate farmers, who have already attacked the government over its changes to inheritance tax rules for agriculture.However, sources said that animal welfare and hygiene standards were “an absolute red line”, meaning the ban on importing hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken will remain in place.As ministers braced themselves for the impact of Trump’s trade war, however, economists warned that the UK economy is likely to be hit, even if it dodges direct tariffs.John Springford, of the Centre for European Reform, said: “At a minimum, Trump’s trade wars make it even more likely that further spending cuts or tax rises are coming in the autumn budget – we just don’t know how much at this stage.”He added that even if the UK is not hit with tariffs, “the far bigger costs would arise from an escalating global trade war, even if a deal is done or the UK does not retaliate. Higher trade barriers would hurt demand in the EU and the US, with knock-on effects for British exports.”Analysts at Goldman Sachs revised down their forecast for the UK economy this year from 0.9% to 0.8% on Tuesday, warning of the spillovers from wider trade tensions, even if Reynolds succeeds in having direct tariffs lifted.Emily Fry, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Even if the UK’s sensible strategy of avoiding tit-for-tat tariffs pays off, as a small, open economy it won’t be immune to the impacts of supply chain disruptions and global growth headwinds as a result of US tariffs and possible retaliation.”When the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) deliveredits forecasts alongside Rachel Reeves’s spring statementlast week, it warned that a tit-for-tat trade war could upend its projections.The OBR committee member David Miles underscored that prediction on Tuesday, stressing that 20-25% tariffs on the UK, maintained for five years, would eliminate the £10bn of headroom the chancellor left herself against her self-imposed fiscal rules – though he stressed that this would be “in some ways a very extreme assumption”.Government insiders rejected suggestions that any economic deal would be contingent on the UK’s approach to free speech, saying they were “completely unlinked”. Reynolds said the issue had “not been a material factor” in the trade negotiations.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrade policyInternational tradeLabourDonald TrumpForeign policyGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

To enforce a strict licensing model, the UK would also need to restrict access to models that have been trained on such content, which could include US-owned AI systems.In a report published on Wednesday, TBI said it backed government proposals to let AI firms train their models on copyright-protected material without permission, unless creatives have signalled they want to opt out of the process. With the Trump administration signalling it will not pursue strict AI regulations and China pursuing AI growth at “breakneck speed”, the UK could weaken its economic and national security interests by lagging in the AI race, said TBI.“If the UK imposes laws that are too strict, it risks falling behind in the AI-driven economy and weakening its capacity to protect national security interests,” said TBI.The report said arguing that commercial AI models cannot be trained on content from the open web was close to saying knowledge workers – a broad category of professionals ranging from lawyers to researchers – cannot profit from insights they get when reading the same content.Rather than fighting to uphold outdated regulations, said TBI, rights holders and policymakers should help build a future where creativity is valued alongside AI innovation.A more restrictive approach to copyright than the one taken by the EU, Singapore or Japan risked pushing AI developers out of the UK, said TBI.Fernando Garibay, a record producer who has worked with artists including Lady Gaga and U2, said history has been dotted with “end-of-time claims” related to technological breakthroughs, from the printing press to music streaming. Those fears were unfounded, said Garibay in an introduction to the report, and the creative community should not “cling” to a legal status quo.“The progressive solution is not about clinging to copyright laws designed for an earlier era but allowing them to co-evolve with technological change, to remain effective in fulfilling their regulatory and protective aims in the age of AI,” said Garibay.The report, called Rebooting copyright: How the UK can be a global leader in the Arts and AI, also calls for the creation of a Centre for AI and Creative Industries that will encourage collaboration between the tech and creative sectors.Beeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer andprominent campaigner against the government proposals, said the report was effectively telling artists to “put up or shut up” because AI’s advance is inevitable.“It cannot be that the sum total of the government’s imagination is that the UK become an AI hub for Silicon Valley,” she said. “That has got to be the most depressing vision of the UK imaginable.”Kidron added that TBI’s acceptance of donations from the US tech billionaire Larry Ellison, which reached $270m (£210m) last year, were “the very definition of conflict of interest”. According to documents filed in the US last year, Ellison’s foundation donated more than $52m (£40m) to TBI in 2024, with a further $218m (£169m) committed. TBI said the $270m commitment was for helping governments around the world, particularly in Africa, with “reform and change programmes”.“We maintain intellectual independence over our policy work,” said TBI.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingThinktanksTony BlairnewsShareReuse this content"

They can learn about credit and debit cards, the tactics advertisers use, and how to keep money safe from scammers.Resources for secondary schools are designed to help pupils understand inflation, personal risk, cryptocurrency and investing. There are also lessons on how to understand bank statements and payslips, and how to scrutinise data and claims made by campaigners, advertisers and online influencers.Parents and financial experts have campaigned for years for better financial education for children to prepare them for the everyday challenges of adult life.The recent interim report on the government’s independent curriculum and assessment reviewnoted that parents and children want an increased focus on applied knowledge and skills in the curriculum, including finance and budgeting.John Roberts, Oak’s interim CEO, said: “By giving teachers the tools to provide well-sequenced, engaging financial learning, we can make sure it resonates with children to support them through adulthood.”Pepe Di’Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “There’s a strong case for more financial education on the curriculum in general but we must be mindful of not further overloading an already packed school day.”Sarah Hannafin, head of policy at the National Association of Head Teachers, added: “Online platforms also need to step up to the plate, however, by strengthening age verification procedures, improving monitoring, providing clearer functions for reporting concerns and introducing more transparent codes of conduct setting out the implications of misuse.”Explore more on these topicsSchoolsConsumer affairsEnglandiPhoneOnline shoppingYouTubeApplenewsShareReuse this content"

When he was convicted,most of the victims were still to be identified by police.On Zou’s conviction, the Met appealed for women to contact them and said 23 had come forward in little more than four weeks describing the same method of attack by Zou.One is believed to be a woman Zou has already been convicted of attacking, with 22 of the women believed to be previously unknown to police.Some of the attacks outlined to police in initial accounts were not caught on video and were unknown to the force. This is increasing police fears that Zou, who outwardly appeared to be a charming man and who was from a wealthy Chinese family, could have attacked more than 60 women.Just over half of the women who have come forward in the past month allege attacks in London; Zou was a master’s and then PhD student in engineering at University College London.A Met commander, Kevin Southworth, said police fears about the scale of Zou’s offending are being borne out by the number of women who contacted them in the month since he was found guilty.Detectives fear he may be one of the worst attackers of women in British criminal history.Southworth said: “This particular one seems to be stacking up in exactly the way we were concerned that it would. It tells you something that 23 victims have come forward in a month since we did the appeal. That’s quite a strike rate.”Further charges and a long jail term when Zou is sentenced on 19 June may further encourage other victims to contact the Met, Southworth said.He said police were in the “middle” of establishing the extent of the engineering student’s offending, with months, perhaps years of work to come. He said the case was being transferred to the Met’s complex case work unit: “The potential for a second or even third trial is there. We’re still now working to build a case.”The most recent female complainants are believed, like Zou’s other victims, to be of Chinese heritage and allege attacks in London orChina. They live all over the world, with some in North and South America and Europe.Most of Zou’s victims in the videos played at his trial were unconscious or stupefied because of the drugs he had given them. He ignored their pleas to stop his attacks as they lost consciousness after being drugged, with videos played in court leaving some jurors in tears.In court Zou claimed to be sleeping with five women a month.He came to Britain to study in 2017 at Queen’s University Belfast. He began his studies at UCL two years later, which continued until his arrest in January 2024.He stayed in London in the vicinity of Woburn Place and later had a flat in the Elephant and Castle area.He would invite women for drinks at his home, which he would spike.Reportsby victims or witnesses about Zou can be madeonline.

Satisfaction fell from 31% in 2023 to just 19% last year – the lowest proportion in the 41 years the British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey of the views of patients in England,Scotlandand Wales has been carried out.Satisfaction with NHS dentistry has collapsed, too, from 60% as recently as 2019 to just 20% last year. More people (55%) are dissatisfied with dental care than with any other service.Starmer unlikely to fulfil pledge on hospital waiting times, says IFSRead moreSimilarly, fewer than a third (31%) of adults are satisfied with GP services.“The latest results lay bare the extent of the problems faced by the NHS and the size of the challenge for the government”, said Dan Wellings, a senior fellow at the King’s Fund. “For too many people, the NHS has become too difficult to access. How can you be satisfied with a service you can’t get into?”The collapse in satisfaction from 70% to 21% in 14 years had been “extraordinary”, he said, adding that people should not be scared about going to A&E, or that an ambulance will not come quickly after dialling 999 or that they may have to get themselves to hospital some other way. “People are sad and angry at the place we’ve got to.”A generational divide is also emerging. Over-65s are more likely to be satisfied, though the figure is still only 27%. But satisfaction among under-65s has fallen from 24% to just 19%.More positively, a narrow majority (51%) are satisfied with the quality of the NHS care they receive when they manage to access services. And there remains overwhelming support for its founding principle that it should be available to everyone free at the point of use and funded through taxation.Wes Streeting, the health and social care secretary, said: “We inherited a broken NHS and this survey shows patients agree. Ever-longer waiting lists, widespread corridor treatment and a regular struggle to see your GP have led to these record levels of dissatisfaction with the health service.”Since the survey was undertaken in September and October, the government had “taken the NHS off life support”, pledged an extra £26bn in investment over the next two years and was drawing up a 10-year plan to make the service once again “fit for the future”, he added.Meanwhile, a separate study has found that almost one in 10 (9.7%) people in Britain have been harmed by either NHS treatment or a delay in obtaining help in the past three years.In 45% of cases, the harm the person suffered had a severe impact and in 38% of cases a moderate impact.But those from disadvantaged groups – such as people with a disability, from poorer backgrounds or with a long-term health condition – were more likely to be harmed and suffer serious harm.Researchers, whose findings are published on Wednesday in the journal BMJ Quality and Safety, surveyed more than 10,000 people in Britain between November 2021 and May 2022.They were asked about their experience of NHS adverse events, which included the medical or physical consequences of treatment, and also the psychological damage involved and harm caused by lack of access to care.“Our study confirms that disparities in rates of NHS harm for socially disadvantaged groups exist and impacts are more severe,” said Dr Michele Peters, an associate professor at Oxford PopulationHealthand an author of the study.“These groups may find it harder to have their needs met within a difficult-to-navigate system with a culture that is less able to hear more vulnerable people.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthHospitalsDentistsGPsEnglandScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Led by Dan Corry, a No 10 adviser under Gordon Brown, it sets out 29 recommendations, nine of which are being immediately adopted.The most radical is that major projects should only have to deal with a single “lead regulator”, which would be responsible for ensuring environmental decisions happen at speed. This would not be a new body but one of the existing quangos developers already deal with such as theEnvironment Agency, Natural England and the Forestry Commission.UK housebuilders ‘very bad’ at building houses, says wildlife charity CEORead moreOther recommendations being adopted include a streamlining of environmental permits and guidance, intended to assist “sensible and risk-based” decisions; a single digital portal for such permissions; and a new “infrastructure board” in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), intended to help projects clear barriers.Reed said the intention was to “boost economic growth and unleash an era of building, while also supporting nature to recover”. However, some nature groups expressed concern that the former would overshadow the latter, with ministers visibly pushing against protection that could hold up new housing or big projects.Joan Edwards, the head of policy at the Wildlife Trusts, said: “Slashing red tape won’t work for this government any more than it worked for the last because protecting wildlife and wild places is essential to achieving truly sustainable growth.“We don’t need more short-term sugar-rush economics – we need housebuilding which supports healthy communities and which is built on a foundation of nature’s recovery.”Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the RSBP, said the bird charity would support changes that could help natural recovery and would “thoroughly review” Corry’s proposals.She added: “However, any changes must prioritise nature, ensuring that protected areas are shielded from harmful development that could cause irreversible damage. Reassurances alone are not enough.”Kit Stoner, the chief executive of the BatConservationTrust, said: “The secretary of state talks about a commonsense approach to better regulation; we would urge him to work with us to take an evidence-based approach. Without this, the cutting of corners is likely to accelerate nature and economic decline.”The 64-page review by Corry aims to end what one official called the current “merry-go-round” of regulators, replacing it with a streamlined approach based on outcomes, rather than one that was “too risk-averse and focused on process”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Our approach must also make ample space for innovation, development and growth.”Corry wrote that he would expect environmental groups to be “nervous” about whether the new focus and parallel plans to give regulators more discretion, could mean nature suffered.He added: “But everything I have heard and learned during this review suggests that the current system does not work as well as it could for nature and the environment, let alone for growth.”Officials acknowledge that this is very likely to mean a less stringent policy for specific protection, particularly around distinct major projects, with this “focus on proportionality” meaning something such as the bat tunnel would be unlikely to happen again.There are, however, no plans to amend or scrap wider habitats regulations, introduced under EU laws and blamedby previous governmentsfor creating unnecessary red tape.Reed said: “Nature and the economy have both been in decline for too long. That changes today.

Having begun at 7pm on Monday night, was not a filibuster but instead an effort to warn of what he called the “grave and urgent” danger thatDonald Trump’s presidential administration poses to democracy and the American people.“I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able,” Booker said near the start of his speech. “I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our nation is in crisis.”Booker said that he has heard endless stories of “pain and fear” from constituents who are both Democrats and Republicans due to theTrump administration’s policies.“Institutions that are special in America, that are unique in our country, are being recklessly – and I would say unconstitutionally – affected, attacked and even shattered,” Booker said.“In just 71 days, the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans’ safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy and even our aspirations as a people for, from our highest offices, a sense of common decency.“These are not normal times in America and they should not be treated as such. I can’t allow this body to continue without doing something. The threats to America’s democracy are grave and urgent.”Emphasizing the roll Congress should play to hold the executive branch accountable, Booker decried his fellow congressmembers for failing to vote against the president’s cabinet nominees and other policies.“The most powerful man in the world and the richest man in the world have taken a battle axe to the Veterans’ Association, a battle axe to the Department of Education, a battle axe to the only agency solely focused on protecting consumers against big banks and other factors that might abuse them,” he said. “What will we do in this body? What will we do in the House of Representatives? Right now the answer is nothing.”As he approached a full day of speaking, Booker began to stumble slightly in his speech, but was still on his feet, making sweeping gestures as he spoke.Booker evoked the Founding Fathers, Civil Rights leaders and lawmakers who stood up against McCarthyism in his calls for congressmembers to more assertively hold theTrump administrationaccountable.Yielding to a question from Connecticut senator Chris Murphy, while retaining the floor, Booker rested a moment while Murphy recounted the longest speech in Senate history, given in 1957 by Republican senator Strom Thurmond to filibuster the Civil Rights Act.“What you have done here today Senator Booker couldn’t be more different than what occurred on this floor in 1957,” he said. “Strom Thurmond was standing in the way of inevitable progress.” He added: “Today, you are standing in the way not of progress but of retreat.”Booker’s speech is not technically a filibuster as he is not trying to run down the Senate’s time to prevent a piece of legislation from passing.Instead, he has used his speaking slot to decry the Trump administration’s spending cuts, its attempt to abolish the Department of Education, the president’s attempts to bypass the judicial system and the removal of people from the US who speak out against the administration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cruz is no stranger to marathon speeches, having spoken for more than 21 hours in 2013 in an attempt to filibuster an expansion of Medicaid eligibility. At one point, Cruz read from Green Eggs and Ham, the Dr Seuss children’s book.Around his 20th hour of speaking, Booker offered an apology to his fellow Democrats for the current political climate, saying: “I confess that I’ve been inadequate. That the Democrats have been responsible for allowing the rise of this demagogue.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsCory BookerUS SenateTrump administrationDemocratsDonald TrumpUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday, itannounced a review of $9bnin federal contracts and grants awarded toHarvard University, over similar allegations that it failed to address issues of antisemitism on campus.In his statement on Tuesday, Nadler said that “withholding funding from Columbia and, potentially, Harvard will not make Jewish students safer”.“Cutting funding to programs that work to cure cancer and make other groundbreaking discoveries will not make Jewish students safer,” he said. “Impounding congressionally appropriated funding will not make Jewish students safer.”“Trump’s ‘review’ is part of a larger effort to silence universities and intimidate those who challenge the Maga agenda,” the representative added, describing it as “a dangerous and politically motivated move that risks stifling free thought and academic inquiry”.Nadler continued: “Make no mistake. Trump’s actions are not rooted in genuine concern for combatting hate. If Trump were truly committed to fighting antisemitism, he would not have crippled the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, the only agency specifically tasked with enforcing anti-discrimination laws at our nation’s educational institutions.”The administration’s campaign to weaken universities perceived as bastions of leftism, along with Columbia’s apparent willingness to accept Trump’s terms for restoring funding, has prompted anxiety that academic freedom in the US is facing an unprecedented crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Trump administration has directed far more egregious violations of our constitution than the imagined actions of the Biden administration on which this hearing is premised.”She singled out the detention and attempted deportation of Rumeysa Ozturk, a doctoral student at Tufts University, who wrote an opinion article critical of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, which she compared to the actions of authoritarian regimes in Russia, Belarus and Hungary.Republicans have used their control of the House and Senate to stage a series of hearings in different congressional committees on the alleged existence of a censorship complex – whose name derives from the military industrial complex described by president Dwight Eisenhower in his farewell speech before leaving the White House in 1961. Opponents dismiss the notion as a conspiracy theory.The committee hearings have coincided with the Trump administration’s dismantling of safeguards designed to stop the spread of influence and disinformation in cyberspace by Russia in particular, but also widely attributed to China and Iran.Even before Trump returned to office, the Republican-controlled Congress declined last December to renew the mandate of the state department’s global engagement center (GEC), the leading government agency fighting Russian and Chinese propaganda.Huizenga, a representative from Michigan, called on two other witnesses, Matt Taibbi and Benjamin Weingarten, to support the Republican contention that the body had been subverted to instead suppress rightwing opinion in America.As evidence, Taibbi, a former Rolling Stone journalist who was among the recipients of the so-called “Twitter files” released by Elon Musk, the platform’s owner, to show evidence of alleged censorship, cited the case of Alex Berenson, a former New York Times journalist.Berenson had been expelled from platform following White House pressure after posting that the Covid-19 vaccine did not prevent infection or the virus’s transmission, Taibbi claimed.Weingarten, a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute, a rightwing thinktank, condemned the GEC as a “truth squad … designed to suppress any information that countered national policy and to identify people who may have had opinions that were controversial or unwanted as foreign inspire”.Democrats lined up to denounce the hearing as “hypocrisy” and “waste of taxpayers’ money” in light of the Trump administration’s attempts to deport foreign students who had expressed pro-Palestinian views, moves that Jankowicz said violated the US constitution’s first amendment, which protects free speech.Sydney Kamlager-Dove, the subcommittee’s ranking Democrat, said the hearing was “out of touch with the concerns of everyday Americans.“I’ve been to the state department, and I do have concerns about censorship – censorship of the employees who are terrified to say the wrong thing, to say anything, or have the wrong word in their job title and be terminated by an administration that publicly relishes punishing people for their speech,” she said. “If we want to talk about censorship, we should begin with Trump’s unprecedented assault on the first amendment and rule of law.”Keith Self, a Republican representative from Texas, provoked anger among Democrats by appearing to liken the Biden administration’s anti-disinformation efforts to steps by the Nazi to construct public opinion in 1930s Germany.“A direct quote from Joseph Goebbels [the Nazi propaganda minister]: ‘It is the absolute right of the state to supervise the formation of public opinion,’ and I think that may be what we’re discussing here,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHouse of RepresentativesBiden administrationUS politicsFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

His administration in March put tariffs on imported steel and aluminium and saidhigher duties on cars would come into effect on Thursday.Von der Leyen, speaking to the European parliament on Tuesday, said the next sectors facing tariffs would be semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and timber.She said many Europeans felt “utterly disheartened” by the US announcements. “Europe has not started this confrontation. We do not necessarily want to retaliate, but if it is necessary we have a strong plan to retaliate and we will use it,” she said.After the announcement of the steel and aluminium tariffs in March, the commission said it would imposecountermeasures on up to €26bn of US goods. These include the reimposition of tariffs on $4.5bn of US goods, such as jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes, which were suspended during the presidency of Joe Biden. The measures are due to be implemented in mid April, after the EU executive chose to delay the initial 1 April date in order to align them with other steps and fine-tune the EU position among the 27 member states.The EU executive is consulting member states over a second tranche of tariffs, worth around €18bn, covering steel, aluminium, poultry, beef, seafood and nuts.However, it is facing pressure from European capitals to protect national interests. France, for example, is concerned about the impact on French wines and spirits if the commission targets American bourbon. Its prime minister, François Bayrou, described proposed EU tariffs on Kentucky bourbon as a misstep, after meetings with the French cognac industry.Under the EU-US trade relationship, worth €1.6tn in 2023, the European bloc exports more goods across the Atlantic than the US does, led by cars, medicines and pharmaceutical products, which could give it leverage.EU officials have not ruled out retaliatory measures on US services, such as suspending intellectual property rights. In theory, retaliation could target US tech companies, banks and financial service providers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The move, Bondi notes, was in an effort to “carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again”.Prosecutors say Mangione had a spiral notebook in which he expressed hostility toward thehealth insuranceindustry and wealthy executives.

He has pleaded not guilty to the state charges and has not entered a plea to the federal ones.The maximum punishment on the state charges is life in prison.Writings and words on bullets recovered from the scene reflected Mangione’s alleged hostility toward health insurers and corporate America.The incident reignited debates about the United States’s healthcare system andincited controversyon social media, where many have expressed support for the Mangione.

On average, these consumers say they won’t begin buying eggs again until costs come down to $5 or less for a carton.Shell-shocked! Why eggs – and their rising price – are an American obsessionRead moreThe report compared the average price of eggs across all US states, observing a significant jump in 2018, when the average was $1.49. In 2025, that figure is sitting at about $5.18.The study found that nearly 95% of Americans have noticed the significant rise in egg prices, with shoppers reporting their perceived average as $7 a dozen. The average American said they would stop buying eggs when prices hit $8 a dozen.Illinois, a state which is about three-quarters farmland, is seeing the most dramatic jump in egg prices, increasing 1,048% from $0.42 to $4.82.The research also found that the majority of Americans (61%) are eating fewer eggs due to rising costs, and 44% are seeing themselves using fewer eggs in their cooking and baking habits.

This time the subject was Anthony Elanga, who tore up the City Ground turf, eating up 85 metres in nine exhilarating seconds, to score the only goal of the game against his former club and maintain Forest’s unlikely push to qualify for the Champions League.The other moment that Forest may look back on as pivotal if they go on to earn a place in the game’s grandest club competition arrived six minutes and 18 seconds into stoppage time. Harry Maguire, thrown up front as an unconventional striker, a needs-must move by Ruben Amorim, prodded the ball goalwards but Murillo hacked it off the line with almost the last kick of the game. A few seconds later, with Forest’s first league double over United since 1991-92, when Brian Clough was in charge, secured, Rockin’ All Over the World blared over the speakers and the locals set off a round of fireworks that soared into the sky above Trent Bridge.Nuno Espírito Santo, the Forest head coach who has levered this side into the elite, shut his eyes as he relived the clearance. “It was huge for us, better than a goal, wasn’t it?“We were against the ropes but it was about heart, belief. I’m very, very proud of the players. When you don’t have energy, we have to have belief. What can I do to stop the ball going in the net? It’s a good example of the dedication and the commitment of the players.” This was another victory for Forest’s rearguard. Nikola Milenkovic and Morato, on as a substitute, both wellied the ball clear to huge cheers late on.Saka’s magic Arsenal return does for Fulham but Gabriel injury casts shadowRead moreAs Murillo fell to his knees to pray inside the six-yard box at the final whistle, a queue of teammates waited to embrace him. The last Forest player off the pitch was Yates, who joined the club aged eight and has played in the top five divisions of the pyramid, and is now dreaming of mixing it with European heavyweights. Forest are third, 10 points clear of Newcastle, who are sixth with two games in hand. Yates came out on top of a feud with Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho’s frustration was typified by his booking for booting the ball away in the second half, with United short of anything resembling attacking bite.Diogo Dalot sent a first-half header against the woodwork and Mason Mount, on as a substitute, went close on his first appearance since December but, incredibly, the wait for Amorim’s side to earn back-to-back league wins goes on. “You’re not famous any more,” the Forest supporters sang and while that may not be true it was another sobering reminder of United’s current state.Forest were, understandably, in a boisterous mood long before a ball was kicked but when the action began the home fans were quick to recognise their latest feat: reaching the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time since 1991. “We’re going to Wembley,” was the chant that initially filled the cool Trent air.View image in fullscreenForest’s Matz Sels hugs Murillo after the match.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersUnited registered the first shot, Fernandes springing an effort on Matz Sels in the Forest goal and the subsequent corner proved the unlikely platform for Elanga’s fifth‑minute strike. Yates cleared a recycled Fernandes cross with a booming header and the ball looped over the referee, Jarred Gillett, and bounced about 10 yards outside the Forest 18-yard box. Elanga stormed on to the ball, controlling it with his studs and then advanced at speed, using both feet to keep the ball close.He flew past halfway with Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho in pursuit. Garnacho slid in to snatch possession but ended up on his backside and Dorgu struggled to stay on his tail. Noussair Mazraoui was torn between pressuring Elanga and backpedalling. The run of Morgan Gibbs‑White, to Elanga’s left, helped frazzle United.By the time Dorgu went to ground it was too late as Elanga drove into the widening gap between Mazraoui and Dorgu and sent a low left-foot shot into the corner. Elanga started his run inside the Forest box, quickly reading the fallout of Yates’s headed clearance, but took just two touches inside the Forest half before motoring upfield. Yates laughed at being informed he was credited with the assist. “I headed it in the six-yard box,” he said with a smile.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rasmus Højlund arrived at half-time in place of Manuel Ugarte and Christian Eriksen replaced Casemiro approaching the hour. But United did not truly threaten until Maguire’s cameo.Forest were typically strong in defence, epitomised by Murillo’s late, late intervention. Neco Williams earlier made a superb block to thwart Garnacho late on. Yates, too, possibly made a match-winning intervention.Garnacho effortlessly took down Fernandes’s diagonal pass and set about bamboozling Yates, stepping over the ball and then jinking inside. Job done, then?

NFL team owners had been set to vote on Green Bay’s proposal to ban the play that hashelped the Philadelphia Eagles win one Super Bowlandreach another, but the motion was tabled until May.ESPN reportedthat 16 teams currently support a ban on the rush push. The NFL requires the approval of 24 teams to pass a change in rules.Also on Tuesday, team owners approved modifying the kickoff rule, expanding replay assist and revising overtime rules.Postponing thetush pushvote means the debate will continue while teams gather more information. Proponents of the play and those who oppose it presented strong arguments while the league’s medical experts expressed safety concerns.Browns owner admits team are in a hole after ‘big swing and miss’ on Deshaun WatsonRead moreNFL Competition Committee chairman Rich McKay stressed the issues surrounding the play extend beyond safety because there’s not enough data to indicate the tush push is dangerous. The league already has said no injuries have been reported on a tush push.“There are definitely some people that have health and safety concerns, but there’s just as many people that have football concerns,” McKay said. “So I wouldn’t say it was because of one particular health and safety video or discussion. It was much more about the play, the aesthetics of the play, is it part of what football has been traditionally, or is it more of a rugby play? All those types of discussions. Health and safety is still there because of potential but I wouldn’t go beyond that.”The league prohibited pushing or pulling a player before a rule change in 2004. McKay said the Packers asked to pull the proposal so they could reintroduce the previous language, study it, and bring it up for discussion for a vote at the May meetings.“It went to many different directions beyond health and safety,” McKay said of the 30 to 40-minute conversation. “Just the traditional-ness of the play, the idea that you could push another player, the idea that we prohibit pushing on the defense but we don’t prohibit it on the offense. It went in all those directions.”As for changes that did pass, regular-season overtime rules will now match those in the playoffs and both teams will have a chance to get a possession even if the offense scores a touchdown on the opening drive. The proposal was amended to make overtime 10 minutes rather than 15 minutes.Owners also approved a proposal from the NFL Competition Committee to allow replay assist to consult on-field officials to overrule objective calls such as facemask penalties, whether there was forcible contact to the head or neck area, horse-collar tackles or tripping if there was “clear and obvious” evidence that a foul didn’t occur. Replay also would be able to overturn a roughing-the-kicker or running-into-the-kicker penalty if video showed the defender made contact with the ball.Replay assist could wipe out a foul only if it was incorrectly called, but it will not be used to throw a flag if a penalty wasn’t given.The dynamic kickoff rulebecomes permanent, with touchbacks moving to the 35-yard line instead of the 30.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over the weekend, the New York Yankees used the bat, designed by an MIT-educated professor,as an instrument of destructionagainst the hapless Milwaukee Brewers. Since then, I’ve heard about the bats so often that they’ve been showing up in my dreams. And that makes sense, because prior to this weekend, even in a bandbox like Yankee Stadium, even for a franchise that’s featured the likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Mickey Mantle, such home run power could only have been cooked up in the sweetest slumbers of their fanbase. Such a display of muscle was less video game and more cartoon, as inthe famed 1946 Bugs Bunny clipthat saw the Gas-House Gorillas rack up 46 straight runs against the genteel Tea Totallers.The scene at Yankee Stadium over the weekend.In case you missed it, the Yankees, minus the 68 home runs of the now departed Juan Soto and the injured Giancarlo Stanton, provided a franchise record nine home runs in one game, 15 home runs across three games and 36 total runs against the Brewers. We’re talking about a Yankees team that coughed up five errors on Saturday andstill won by 11 runs.The torpedo bats, just about the only thing that could overshadow MLB’s botching of Opening Day thanks to thecrashing of its own app, is another example of how over-innovation can ruin baseball. The engineers who came up with the bat are cousins of the stats savants who brought us the analytics which slowly sucked the entertainment out of the sport, and the physics experts who came up with scientifically altered pitchers which sank the 2024 batting averages of all but six teams to below .250.The latest over-innovation moves the bulk of the wood in the bat to the customized area where the batter is most likely to hit the ball the hardest. The enlarged sweetspot, which gives a player a better chance of making good contact makes perfect sense, and frankly, it’s incredibly smart. And yes, hitters do need something, anything, to take back some of the game from the pitchers who have shrunk batting averages for years. Now they have.Yankees’ new torpedo bats draw attention after home-run blitz against BrewersRead moreThat said, 15 home runs in three games? That’s a problem. After the Yankees’ 12-3 win over the Brewers on Sunday, their radio voice Suzyn Waldman was trying to explain away the torpedo issue, by saying that it’s not new, that the exit velocity is similar between traditional and torpedo bats, that other teams use them and that the issue will be a talking point for a while until everyone moves on.That’s partially true: other players around the league are toying with the bats, and it’s not entirely new. But New York, thanks to the 2022hiring of the bat’s key brain, Aaron Leanhardt, who holds a postgraduate degree in physics from MIT, are seemingly more in on the torpedo bats than any other team. If New York – or any other teams who decide to adopt the bat – continue to hit like this over the long-term it will turn box scores into farces, and mess with the integrity of the game in a way we haven’t seen since the steroid era.It should be said that some players and coaches from other teamsdon’t seem to have an issuewith the new bats. “It’s still a human that has to hit it,” said Cleveland Guardians manager Stephen Vogt. “It’s not the bat hitting the homer.”Swap “bat” for “PEDs”, and that’s a common defense for Barry Bonds’ election into the Hall of Fame. In this case, an important distinction is that the bats are totally legal, the Yankees have not broken any rules of the game. Coincidentally, Bonds’ early adoption of maple bats was, to a way lesser degree, somewhat controversial.View image in fullscreenBarry Bonds and torpedo bats have something in common.Photograph: Eric Risberg/APThe reason he began using maple, and PEDs, is the same reason the torpedo bat is in the news today – players and teams are continuously looking for an edge. And right now the Yankees are getting it.Now that we’re here, I have several questions. Will New York’s torrid stretch continue? Will this tech be adopted by other teams and players? If that happens, will more games become farcical? And should the bats be banned? If torpedo bats are banned – and there’s no indication that one is forthcoming – then why didn’t the Yankees wait until the playoffs to unveil their secret weapon? Now that would have surely wrestled back their “evil empire” label from the Dodgers.There’s a caveat here. Aaron Judge smoked the Brewers – one of his four homers in the series went 468ft –withoutthe torpedo bat. And then, on Monday, the Royalscrushed the Brewers 11-1. As far as we know, the Royals don’t have torpedo bats, leading us to the conclusion that rather than being victims of technology, the Brewers are just … bad. But if the Yankees’ power-surge continues for another two weeks or so, MLB will probably have no choice but to ban the bats, legal or not, under the little used “best interests in baseball” clause. This would be another embarrassing mess for baseball, as Leanhardt told the Athletic that “it was a group effort, the results coming from conversations with coaches, players, MLB and bat makers.” So unless we’re all overreacting, MLB may have botched the rollout of this new tech by not unilaterally taking over the usage from the clubs.The good news is that dialed down torpedo bats could actually serve as the long-term answer for suffering hitters. This could be vital for a sport which needs more dynamic offense and less of the increasingly predictable and boring three outcomes: a walk, strikeout or a home run. For now, much to the chagrin of Yankees fans, I’d put the toy back in the box, do the research and development in the minor leagues, and reintroduce a more refined product in a few seasons.Explore more on these topicsMLBBaseballUS sportsNew York YankeesMilwaukee BrewersLos Angeles DodgersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Before they headed west to Oakland in 1968, their characterful former owner, Charlie Finley, threatened to move them from Kansas City to acow pasturein the tiny town of Peculiar, Missouri.Now they are in a place you might call Limbo, California – also known as the home of the Pacific Coast League’s Sacramento River Cats. It’s a staging post for Major League Baseball’s most contentious franchise after the burning of their Bay Area bridges left them needing somewhere to play ahead of a planned relocation from Oakland to Las Vegas.The A’s evoke 70s nostalgia thanks to three successive World Series titles from 1972 to 1974, their distinctive green and gold colours and icons such as Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter and Rollie Fingers. And they are admired by analytics obsessives for the Moneyball innovations in the 2000s under the front-office leadership of Billy Beane.Now they are symbols of executive dysfunction and geographical confusion. The brand plays on – but don’t call them the OaklandAthleticsanymore. They’re not officially the Sacramento Athletics, either. Just the Athletics or the A’s. Players don’t have a city name emblazoned on the front of their shirts but wear a patch with an image of Sacramento’s Tower Bridge on their right sleeve and a Las Vegas emblem on the left arm. With an outfield hoarding promoting Las Vegas near a banner hailing the team’s nine World Series championships dating back to 1910 – when they were the Philadelphia Athletics – and a handful of fans in suddenly-retro Oakland gear, it feels like this is a franchise in flux, its identity addled by ownership’s wanderlust.Baseball’s last dive bar: Farewell to the crumbling Oakland ColiseumRead moreSutter Health Park is the site they will share for at least the next three seasons with the River Cats, the Triple-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. The River Cats are run by Vivek Ranadivé, who also controls the NBA’s Sacramento Kings. Sacramento, an often-overlooked city that was close to acquiring an MLS team butbrought down in 2021when seemingly clear on goal, would like another major-league outfit to boost its profile.Though the A’s do not want to stick around for long, the 25-year-old venue has beenupgraded, with bigger dugouts and clubhouses, better video and sound systems and facilities in the bullpens so that relievers can, well, relieve themselves. But it clearly remains a minor-league stadium, pleasant but petite, with its low-slung stand, grassy tree-lined picnic slope, kids’ playground and clubhouses accessed via the outfield.Still, the buzz from crowded concourses and crammed seating areas in Monday’s home-away-from-home opener was palpable; and, for this team, unusual. With a capacity of about 13,000 and evident enthusiasm in the Californian capital, an 80-mile drive from Oakland with a regional population of about 2.5m, the A’s are very likely to better last year’sleague-worstaverage attendance of 11,528.In 2028 the A’s intend to move to a new $1.75bn ballpark on the site of the former Tropicana Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. The clubreleased renderingslast year of a 33,000-capacity ballpark. With the razzle-dazzle the location demands, the design boasts swooping silver curves and shimmering green illuminations, resembling the Gateway Arch on St Patrick’s Day or the Sydney Opera House if it were slathered in pesto.TheMLBcommissioner, Rob Manfred, has made progress in speeding up games but stadium negotiations roll at their own pace: however long it takes billionaire team owners and property developers to persuade politicians to fork out taxpayer funding for new venues.Or not: this transfer completes adevastatingtriple don’t-play for the city of Oakland: the NFL’s Raiders left for Vegas in 2020 and the Golden State Warriors relocated across the water to San Francisco in 2019.The A’s are not the only MLB team in a minor-league park this year, with the Tampa Bay Rays borrowing the New York Yankees’ spring-training facility because Tropicana Fieldwas damaged by Hurricane Milton. While that was a natural disaster, this problem was man-made.The club has been owned since 2005 by John Fisher, heir to the Gap retail fortune and accused ofwilfully making the A’s unfashionablein order to make the switch to Nevada more palatable as their 60s-era multi-purpose stadium in Oakland, the Coliseum,crumbledand no deal was reached with city officials. He denies that claim and has insisted that “weworked as hard as possiblefor six years to find a solution in Oakland.” Fisherasserted to reporters on Mondaythat his hand was forced because “our lease was ending … and there was not really a legitimate offer on the table to extend”.Still, last year the A’s payroll was $66.5m, the lowest in MLB by more than $20m. The New York Mets led the league with $333m. The A’s last made the playoffs in 2020 and have endured a losing record for the past three seasons. This year’s payroll is$75m, above only the Chicago White Sox and Miami Marlins.The club hopes tobegin ballpark constructionby the middle of this year. Until the new palace is finished, what happens in Vegas stays in Sacramento. A short walk from downtown, Sutter doesn’t have under-seat cooling like the planned new climate-controlled arena. That feature would surely be appreciated in Sacramento in July when the average daily high is 35C (95F). Monday, though, was chilly and blustery, and the A’s were embarrassingly crushed 18-3 by the Chicago Cubs following a tribute to the late Hall of Famer, Rickey Henderson. This was the most runs allowed by a team in a home opener for a hundred years,according to Sportradar.Many fans left long before the end, though the atmosphere remained upbeat. A man hawking “F*** Fisher” T-shirts on the sidewalk seemed to find few takers; nor was much dissent evident inside the ballpark save for a “sell the team” chant that briefly erupted after the contest became a blow-out. Most attendees were more interested in celebrating the team’s arrival in Sacramento than mourning its exit from Oakland. Among the loudest cheers were in praise of the bat boy when hethwarted a drone.Some 175 years ago, fortune-seekers flocked to Sacramento to chase the gold rush. These A’s are only passing through in the hope of finding more glittering rewards elsewhere. But for the next few years the city with a landmark bridge may prove an adequate home for a club in transition.“I think we recognise the need for a temporary home until we get to where we’re going and I think we are fully ready and fully prepared to embrace this as our home for the next three years, both this stadium and this city, and to make the very best of it. It’s going to be a unique environment,” outfielder Brent Rooker told reporters.“I thought the energy [from fans] was great,” A’s manager Mark Kotsay said after the game. A sustained run of bad performances, however, would surely curdle the mood. “Not a good showing on our first night,” Kotsay conceded.Explore more on these topicsMLBBaseballAthleticsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gjert described that act as a “betrayal”.Jakob Ingebrigtsen’s father denies kicking Olympic champion and whipping daughterRead moreAt one point in the recording Gjert told Henrik: “You have fired me as a coach. You have rejected us as ­parents and you are carrying out a perfect character assassination on top of that. What we have worked for, you erase with a stroke of a pen. And then the last bit of my income goes away.”On another occasion they discussed Ingrid, who was in her mid‑teens at the time of the incident, having to go to child services. “These people want to hurt me and drag me down to hell,” Gjert told Henrik. “They are going to destroy me as a human being.”However Henrik said that the brothers had no choice given the circumstances. “We cannot accept your treatment of Ingrid either,” he said. “We cannot accept that at all. That’s what started all this.”Gjert responded: “I haven’t made enough mistakes to deserve to be fired as coach of my boys.” On another occasion, Gjert said: “If someone invites me to war, I won’t turn the other cheek. I’ll go to that war. With absolutely everything I have. By all means. That’s how I’m made.”Henrik replied: “There is no war.” Towards the end of the conversation, Gjert told his son: “I never thought you would do something like this to me.”Henrik replied: “We didn’t think you would be violent towards Ingrid either.”Gjert, who is facing six years in jail for abusive behaviour towards Jakob and Ingrid, denies all allegations of violence.Earlier in the day, Gjert was again questioned about the towel incident with his daughter – but insisted that he had pulled a wet towel in the ­direction of her fingers rather than whip her in the face.“I don’t associate the movement with a blow,” he said. “Whipping and hitting with a towel are the wrong terms. It’s more of a pull. I pull the towel towards her finger. And I don’t have a concrete idea whether I hit the finger. It’s a relatively small towel. We stand relatively far apart. The pull I do is done – I think – twice.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was a reaction from me that was not very good on my part, I can’t say anything more.”Gjert also accepted that on another occasion he had pushed his daughter with both hands for which he later apologised. However he insisted the push was not a violent force.Under cross-examination, Gjert was also asked about an incident where he was alleged to have hit Jakob. The prosecutor noted that Jakob’s brother Filip had said he had seen “the incident from ­several angles, and believes it may be because it went on for so long”.However Gjert denied this was the case. “I still have no recollection of having beaten Jakob or ­anyone else – either in my household or ­others,” he replied.Under cross-examination, Gjert also denied calling Jakob “stupid”, an “idiot”, and “a terrorist” when he was growing up.The trial, which is due to last until 16 May, continues.Explore more on these topicsSportNorwaynewsShareReuse this content"

Tour operators and those with individual bookings at Turnberry are in the process of being informed it will be June before the Ailsa, which is routinely ranked among the finest golf courses in the world, is available for play.The clubhouse at the Ayrshire resort was daubed with graffiti and red paint in the early hours of 8 March. More significant in respect of the championship course – that has staged the Open on four occasions – was the ripping up of greens and on turf approaching them. The course has been closed since October due to planned renovation of the 7th and 8th holes.While Trump slashes jobs, his golf trips are costing taxpayers millions | Mohamad BazziRead moreIn a statement provided to the Guardian, Nic Oldham, general manager of Trump Turnberry, said: “The reopening of the Ailsa Course has been delayed due to recent vandalism. While the redesigned holes are ready for play and look spectacular, we now need to restore other areas of the courses to provide the premium playing conditions our members and guests expect from one of the world’s top-ranked links.“Our team is working closely with all parties to minimise any disruption during this time. We look forward to having the iconic Ailsa Course better than ever when it reopens in June.”The economic impact of this delay is likely to be sharp. Tee times for later in the summer are listed at £1,000 per head on Turnberry’s website for non-residents. With neighbouring Ayrshire courses known to be encountering a busy spell, there will be an inevitable knock-on impact for golf tourism.Trump has labelledthose responsible for the damage as “terrorists”before adding that he hopes they would be “treated harshly” by the Scottish justice system. Trump also wrongly claimed that three people were in prison as a result of police inquiries. A 33-year-old man was charged over the incident and appeared at Ayr sheriff court on Monday. Kieran Robson was charged with malicious mischief and made no plea during the brief hearing. He was released on bail pending a further court appearance. Another man, aged 75, and a 66-year-old woman were arrested and released pending further inquiries.Trump bought Turnberry from a Dubai-based group in 2014. Despite a stated aim of returning the Open to the Ailsa – which last staged the major in 2009 – Trump has met stiff opposition from the tournament organisers, the R&A. There is no indication of that stance changing despite Mark Darbon being appointed as the R&A’s new chief executive.Explore more on these topicsGolfDonald TrumpScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The reason was simple: The Huskies aren’t done yet.Bueckers carried UConn to their record 24th national semi-final in the women’sNCAA Tournament, scoring 31 points on Monday night in a 78-64 victory over Southern California, which couldn’t overcome the loss of injured star JuJu Watkins.UConn head to Tampa, Florida, to face overall No 1 seed UCLA on Friday. The other semi-final will be between an All-SEC showdown between defending champions South Carolina and Texas.Why hasn’t middle America given Paige Bueckers the Caitlin Clark treatment?Read moreFreshman Sarah Strong added 22 points and 17 rebounds for the second-seeded Huskies, who have won a record 11 NCAA titles, all under coach Geno Auriemma. Their most recent championship was in 2016, the last of a run of four straight.“We’ve got a whole lot of heart, and a whole lot of toughness about us. And we play together as a team. We’re super well-connected,” Bueckers said. “I feel like every team that I’ve played on, we’ve been super well-connected. But just the way we’ve been through so much adversity as individuals, as a team, how much it’s brought us together, how much it’s made us stronger.”Rayah Marshall scored 23 points and 15 rebounds for top-seeded USC (31-4), who also lost to UConn in the Elite Eight last year when Watkins was a freshman.Fans had anticipated a rematch between Bueckers and Watkins when the brackets were announced, but the matchup lost some luster when Trojans’ star guard tore an ACL in the second round and needed surgery. While the Trojans got past Kansas State in the Sweet 16 without Watkins, they had a tougher challenge against UConn and Bueckers, the likely No 1 overall pick in next month’s WNBA draft.After scoring just two points in the opening quarter, Bueckers had 11 points in the final period.“None of it would happen without the team, and everything that goes into a performance,” she said. “So just trying to lead with what the game is calling for, lead with what we need at that moment, at that time, whether it’s passing, rebounding, scoring, just trying to do whatever it takes to win.”Bueckers, a senior, earned AP All-America honors and was the Big East player of the year for the third time. The only thing left for her to achieve is a national title after she and the Huskies were beaten in the Final Four last year by Caitlin Clark and Iowa. She has averaged 35 points in her last three March Madness games, including career highs of 40 points and six three-pointers in the Huskies’ 82-59 rout of Oklahoma in the Sweet 16.In Monday’s other game, Madison Booker scored 18 points and No 1 seed Texas used their stifling defense to reach the Final Four for the first time since 2003, beating well-traveled point guard Hailey Van Lith and second-seeded TCU 58-47. Texas won a regional final for the first time under coach Vic Schaefer, who previously made two Final Four trips with Mississippi State. The Longhorns’ 35 wins are one more than their only national title-winning squad had in 1986 under Jody Conradt, who was in the stands on Monday night.The Final Four is on Friday night, with the championship game at 3pm ET on Sunday. A year ago, the women’s title game drew a bigger television audience than the men’s for the first time, with an average of 18.9 million viewers watching undefeated South Carolina beat Iowa and Clark.Explore more on these topicsNCAA TournamentCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsBasketballnewsShareReuse this content"

It was mainly release. The three months without Saka have been hard, ­Arsenal’sPremier Leaguetitle challenge slipping away as he recovered from a ruptured hamstring.There was certainly a script to be written and, Saka being Saka, he set about it.Arsenalhave an incredible home record in the league against Fulham – 24 wins, seven draws and no defeats before this. They were on their way to another victory thanks to Mikel Merino’s heavily deflected goal on 37 minutes, the latest return from the club’s makeshift No 9.‘Four players in one week’: Arteta rues Arsenal’s injury nightmare at the backRead moreSaka brought the house down. It was Gabriel Martinelli, so fast and purposeful throughout, who ignited the move and when he got the ball back from Merino, the flick was improvised but made to measure for you-know-who. Saka’s header was true. Welcome back, Bukayo. And just in time for the Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid. The first leg is here next Tuesday.It was not all roses for Arsenal. They could shrug off Fulham’s late revival, as Marco Silva’s team pulled a goal back in stoppage time through Rodrigo Muniz, who was on as a substitute. The striker had missed a glorious headed chance on 81 minutes while anotherFulhamsubstitute, Ryan Sessegnon, went close before the end of regulation time. Muniz scored after a Sessegnon run and with a deflection off William Saliba. Arsenal wobbled and yet a Fulham equaliser would have been too much.What left rather more of a mark on Arsenal’s evening were the injuries that forced off Gabriel Magalhães and Jurriën Timber. With Riccardo Calafiori sustaining a knee problem in the international break with Italy and Ben White feeling pain in his knee, Mikel Arteta is facing a defensive injury crisis at the worst moment.Gabriel had turned on the afterburners in the 13th minute when Adama Traoré surged upfield on a Fulham break only to feel ­something pop. He soon realised he could not continue. As one hamstring repairs, another goes. Gabriel’s replacement, Jakub Kiwior, endured a few anxious moments and it was easy to imagine that Kylian Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior would be taking note.Timber’s problems started when he moved to block a Raúl Jiménez shot on the half-hour and appeared to be caught by the Fulham striker’s follow through. He battled on only to depart towards the end, Arteta ­saying the issue was to do with his knee.It was a night when Arteta was never going to risk Saka from the start. Still, there was no mistaking the buzz that his presence brought. The announcement of Saka’s name before kick-off drew a guttural roar. There was warm applause from the home crowd when he made his first warm-up run along the touchline on 24 minutes.The Arsenal support also chanted their old song about Saka and Emile Smith Rowe, who was back at his old club in Fulham colours. But there was not much else for them to cheer in the first-half until Merino did it again, forcing the breakthrough, albeit with a dollop of fortune.View image in fullscreenGabriel Magalhães is a huge doubt for Arsenal’s first leg against Real Madrid next Tuesday after he was forced off in the first half.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPASilva has made Fulham a tough nut to crack. His team do not concede many shots. He set them up with three centre-halves here, the formation was 5-4-1 against the ball and Arsenal struggled to create, despite Martinelli’s best efforts. The first half was coming to an end when Ethan Nwaneri finally got in behind, making a run off Antonee Robinson and on to Timber’s cute pass.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also made a sweet connection on a volley in the 22nd minute from a Martinelli cross only for it to be too close to Bernd Leno. Now, he went inside for Merino but his teammate looked to be surrounded.All Merino could do was jab a shot towards the near post that Leno seemed to have covered, especially as it lacked power. Which was when fate intervened, the ball hitting Jorge Cuenca and flying into the other corner. It was Merino’s fifth goal in eight games since his move to centre-forward.Silva was upset at how flat his team were in attacking terms before the interval and he refused to blame a hangover from the FA Cup defeat at home against Crystal Palace on ­Saturday. But Fulham were better in the second-half, Jiménez slicing up the inside right to work David Raya and Traoré robbing Kiwior before dragging wide.Arsenal had their moments, too. Martin Ødegaard flickered. Timber blasted at Leno. Martinelli wowed with some of his incisions.And then came Saka.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Wolves head coach and fans can enjoy a few righteous pints after his side moved 12 points clear of the relegation zone with a hard-fought victory over West Ham.Jørgen Strand Larsen scored the only goal to open up a greater gap on the drop zone. It was easy to see what the result meant to Pereira and his staff. They spent the final minutes of injury time demanding more noise from the home supporters to see Wolves over the line. At the final whistle the head coach leapt in the air and on to the pitch to celebrate, while the stands erupted, embracing each one of his players to thank them for their endeavours.Electric Elanga haunts Manchester United with Nottingham Forest winnerRead moreWolves’ relegation rivals Ipswich and Leicester have a game in hand but will be level on matches by the end of Wednesdaytoday after difficult trips to Bournemouth and Manchester City respectively.If the battle for survival is not finished yet, Wolves could effectively end it at Portman Road on Saturday when they travel to play Ipswich, a game for which Pereira will be banned from the touchline.It was a fully deserved victory for Wolves but they spent the latter stages looking nervous, risking throwing away two valuable points. Niclas Füllkrug hit the bar and Tomas Soucek could only find the ­side ­netting when gifted the perfect chance to equalise by Toti Gomes. “He said he purposely tried to kill me,” joked Pereira. The tension was flying around the stands, awaiting the toot from Tony Harrington’s whistle to see them one step closer to safety.“This is a fantastic feeling,” Pereira said. “I am a very simple guy, I like to be with them [the fans], I like to feel part of the family. Feeling the happiness of the supporters is, for me, the most important thing. Football is not all about tactics, it is about connection and team spirit. At this moment, when I look at my team, I see a team that celebrates together and suffers together.West Ham never got going, their best chance falling to Evan Ferguson in the first half after good work by Jarrod Bowen down the right. The winger burst into the box and pulled it back but the Republic of Ireland international, making his first start for West Ham, got the ball stuck under his feet and fluffed his lines.Strand Larsen did not suffer from the same problem. Inthis fixture last season, the former Wolves captain Maximilian Kilman thought he had scored a late equaliser, only to have it ruled out by VAR.The way he influenced the opener on this occasion will have left him with a sinking feeling once again. Strand Larsen was given enough space to slowly turn his frame on the edge of the box and take aim, his shot deflecting off the now West Ham defender Kilman and into the net.View image in fullscreenJørgen Strand Larsen unleashes a shot to give Wolves a first-half lead.Photograph: Jack Thomas/WWFC/Wolves/Getty ImagesWolves were dominant before the break, helped by the Brazilian midfield pairing of André and João Gomes, the latter having signed a new five-year deal at the club. The duo have helped ensure that their side have not missed the suspended Matheus Cunha too much, picking up seven points in the three games he has been absent from. Up against James Ward-Prowse and Lucas Paquetá, they were able to give Wolves the edge in a scrappy fixture.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Zimbabwean took aim from the penalty spot but his shot rifled back off the crossbar.There were plenty of fouls and confrontations on the pitch, resulting in four Wolves players going into Harrington’s book. The hosts knew they had to fight for every inch, even if West Ham were not at their best.Graham Potter took action at half-time in an attempt to change the dynamic, making a triple substitution. It meant West Ham got a greater foothold in the match but they were still without a creative spark. They felt they deserved a penalty when Matt Doherty kicked Füllkrug, who was a handful, in the face but Harrington was not interested, adding the further blow of a booking for the Germany striker’s complaints.In the end, it was a case of holding on as Pereira threw on defensive ­reinforcements, although Munetsi almost netted a second in the dying seconds.Not that it mattered and it would not have changed how sweet the pints taste for Pereira, his players and the fans. “I am emotional and very proud of my team today,” Pereira said.

It had been long, it had been wild, and at the end of the night, somehow they were the ones celebrating, which it seems they always are. Madrid did not win and were not always very good until they were irresistible, but it was enough.Three times they had trailed but ultimately a draw, secured by the thumping forehead of Antonio Rüdiger in the 115th minute was enough. A game that went from 0-1 to 1-1, 1-3 to 3-3, and then 3-4 finally finished 4-4 deep into extra time.Real Sociedad became the first team, beyond Barcelona, to come here and score four since they did so themsleves en route to winning the cup cup four years ago; this time, 5-4 winners on aggregate, it isReal Madrid, somehow surviving again, who will be in Seville, where Atlético Madrid or Barcelona will await.View image in fullscreenAntonio Rüdiger and Arda Guler celebrate with the Real Madrid fans after late drama.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThis semi-final had the ending everyone expected, the Bernabéu bouncing about; it was just the journey there no one anticipated, nor how close Real Sociedad came.A goal down from the first leg, defeated 1-0 at home then, eliminated at Old Trafford next, with a solitary win in the five weeks since – an unconconvincing 2-1 victory against virtually relegated Real Valladolid – and with Brais Mendez out injured, few truly thought that Real Sociedad had any chance of going through. The coach Imanol Alguacil though had said he could see it. And, 15 minutes into this game, suddenly others could too. What no one expected, even then, was for the feeling to last so long, so late into the night, still there when the clock struck 12. Which was when Madrid finally slipped in the knife.It had been a long, long night, and it had hurt all the more for that. It had delighted too, on the other side, another astonishing occasion here.La Real had started well, keeping the ball out of reach of a passive Madrid and then, in a flash, releasing it into the space behind them to open the scoring. Martin Zubimendi provided the first telling pass, Madrid drawn in and then cut open. Pablo Marin nodded it on, aware of the run over his shoulder, and there was Ander Barrenetxea dashing into a familiar space, behind Lucas Vázquez. Cutting into the penalty area from the left, he guided his finish under Andriy Lunin and into the net.For all that this was aCopa del Reysemi-final, there had been little sense of jeopardy or urgency, and now the tie was level. Maybe this was on after all or maybe Madrid would react now that they had to, which tends to be the way. Instead, they kind of carried on. It is not that they hadn’t had half chances before – Endrick had tried an outrageous overhead kick after Igor Zubeldia had allowed the ball to bounce inside the area and Alex Remiro had pushed away a Vinícius Júnior effort – and nor was there a sudden acceleration either, that typical bugle call from the Bernabéu.There was time, after all. Talent, too. A sharp turn led to Jude Bellingham escaping Nayef Aguerd and shooting wide before Rodrygo’s effort flashed past the post, and they got the equaliser.European football: Bielefeld stun Leverkusen to reach DFB-Pokal finalRead moreIt was a wonderful goal too, Vinícius bent a superb pass with the outside of his boot from inside his own half. The ball drew the perfect trajectory, just away from Zubeldia, as if teasing him as it went past, and Endrick ran through to scoop it over Remiro. Real Sociedad’s lead had lasted just 15 minutes, normal service resumed?That was kind of how it felt, in truth, and therein perhaps lay the trap, a failure from Madrid to appreciate how close they were to the edge. Only they always find a way to escape that fate. Endrick opened the second half running at Sociedad on the left and almost setting up Rodrygo on the edge of the six-yard box.From the corner, Bellingham headed wide from barely a yard and got a full goalkeeper glove in his face for it. The Englishman also had a 20-yard shot pushed away by Remiro just after the hour. At the other end, a dreadful error from Camavinga almost gifted Real Sociedad a goal.Otherwise, not very much was happening, a few frustrated whistles occasionally greeting Madrid’s more plodding passages of play and the looser passes, those moments when it seemed they were wilfully, almost sleepily ambling into dangerous territory, offering the visitors an opportunity. As if sure that at some point they would score, and it would be done.That risk was underlined when, with 20 minutes to go, Lunin had to make a superb save from Zubimendi’s side-footed volley. From two yards and a tight angle, Oyarzabal put the shot over. And then, a moment later, it happened. Kubo ran at Madrid, deep into the area, and although the ball was blocked it came to Marin who went at them again, delivering a low ball that went in off David Alaba.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In fact, it was Sociedad that threatened more, far more, Zubimendi swiping at another volley from yet another corner, the numbers racking up swiftly. This time, he missed; the next time Sociedad advanced, they scored.View image in fullscreenMikel Oyarzabal makes it 3-1 and 3-2 on aggregate to the visitors.Photograph: Ángel Martínez/Getty ImagesKubo ran at them again, stepping away from Luka Modric and Raul Asencio and laying the ball back to Oyarzabal, whose shot hit Alaba first, the post second, Lunin third and the net fourth. Real Sociedad were 3-1 up, 3-2 on aggregate and on their way through. SonowMadrid reacted, now this stadium stood, now they made a noise, and now what happens here happened. Barely a minute had passed by when Vinícius, for whom Carlo Ancelotti had had angry words before, raced up the left and delivered a perfect cross for Bellingham to guide in a volley.It was level now but there were still eight minutes left and that’s an eternity to them, Aurelién Tchouaméni rising to bring the final rumble of thunder and a place in the final, or so it seemed.Instead it turned out that eight minutes really was an eternity, time enough for so much to happen, for football to do its magic again; for Madrid to experience, if only for a little while, what they so often inflict on others and seemed to have just inflicted on Sociedad. Again, it was Kubo, who had torn into them all night.This time, EduardoCamavinga came across and wiped him out. But one last, violent service for the cause was not the salvation he had expected, because from the free kick Sergio Gómez’s wonderful inswinging delivery, just out of reach of Lunin’s right hand, was headed in by Oyarzabal.Amazingly, there was still time for Bellingham’s diving header to be brilliantly saved by Remiro, but half an hour more awaited.Exhausted now, Sociedad were hanging on, Madrid running at them, Vinícius seeming never to tire. If anything, he was getting faster, if only in comparison to those around him. He was getting more determined too, a one-man whirlwind. He struck the side-netting on one side and had another shot blocked as defenders backed off. Mbappé had two chances as well: the first flew over; for the second he lifted the ball over Zubeldia five yards out and tried to head past Remiro.Still Madrid came, but there was no way through, penalties came closer, and you started to wonder if this time, maybe, just maybe, it would have a different end. And then the clock ran past midnight and there, rising above them all was just the right man to drive everyone wild.Explore more on these topicsCopa del ReyReal MadridReal SociedadEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

However, the main purpose of the meeting was to remind Liverpool’s players of the effort required to land silverware.Slot said: “There was definitely a message to the players and it was as simple as it has always been: don’t accept being outworked by a team, which we were against Newcastle. If the stakes are so high, that is almost unacceptable. It can happen in a season once or twice but it shouldn’t happen many times.“We showed them the work rate they have put in for so many games in a row. Paris Saint-Germain was a great example of that. Maybe, maybe, I made the biggest mistake by not rotating enough but I thought there were four days in between for Newcastle and they had enough rest. But it is too simple to only say we were outworked; we have to give credit to everything Newcastle did. It was about ­emphasising what made us where we are now. For me, apart from quality, that is an incredible work rate in every single game we played in the Premier League.”The 246th Merseyside derby comes 49 days after theexplosive last encounter at Goodison Park, when Slot was shown a red card for his outburst against the referee Michael ­Oliver after the final ­whistle. The Liver­pool head coach believes Everton, unbeaten in nine league matches under David Moyes, will pose similar problems to Eddie Howe’s team.“It is always difficult when you play against a team likeEvertonor Newcastle: they bring a lot of balls into your last line,” he said. “In ­general, I think we have handled that quite well, even Everton away, but we have to play better when we have the ball in our home game and that is something we are focusing on.”Slot refused to be drawn on reports that Trent ­Alexander-Arnold is poised to join Real Madrid on a free transfer this summer. The right-back remains sidelined with an ankle injury sustained against PSG and, along with Joe Gomez, will be absent for several more weeks. Conor Bradley could feature, ­having been out with a hamstring problem since February, and Alisson and Ryan Gravenberch are expected to recover from injuries sustained on ­international duty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And that was only [after] five or six minutes of extra time. The PSG game took me longer to get over because we were so, so close to getting to the quarter‑finals.

Four red cards were shown after the final whistle – to Curtis Jones, ­Abdoulaye Doucouré, Arne Slot and Slot’s assistant Sipke Hulshoff – after James Tarkowski’s 98th-minute equaliser sparked wild scenes at the end of a competitive and controversial game. The match itself, Moyes insists, is what many football fans want to see.Golden Goal: Kevin Campbell for Everton v Liverpool (1999)Read moreThe Everton manager said: “There were so many people who enjoyed that game in many ways.Liverpoolsupporters might have not enjoyed the end but I think generally there was a real competitiveness to it. We’ve got to watch that we don’t sanitise the game too much and every­thing’s stopping and starting and we’re not getting any flow to the game.“It was good to see that type of game. We probably needed to make it tough for Liverpool, and now we’ll get another chance to do it again. Anfield is a different version of it. It’s always been difficult for any team to go there and put that type of game on ­Liverpool. We’ll need to be clever and do the right things.”Moyes has never won in 21 visits to Anfield as a manager withEverton, Manchester United, Sunderland and West Ham and is desperate to shed the unwanted record. “I want to win and make sure I get rid of it if I can, that’s for sure. Every time we go there it’s another chance.”On Monday Moyes met Everton’s executive chairman, Marc Watts, and Brian Walker, the vice-president of strategy for The Friedkin Group, to explore plans for next season. Moyes believes Everton’s next five games, against each of the current top five teams in the Premier League, will be a gauge of the squad’s level before a summer of upheaval.“Our form’s been good, we’ve had to show consistency, but now we have to see if we can keep it going against the bigger teams and that will give me an idea for next year as well; where we are and can the players we have here compete against some of the top sides? They’ve certainly shown that they’re capable against a lot of the teams we have played up to now.”Watts told club staff on Tuesday that TFG were looking into the possibility of Goodison Park becoming the new home for Everton Women. In an address at the club’s Royal Liver Building headquarters to mark 100 days since the American company became Everton owners, the executive chairman said TFG were determined to deliver the best possible stadium for the women’s team. It is understood TFG have commissioned a feasibility study into the viability of Goodison serving that purpose.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their joy only lasted three minutes with Marius Wörl beating goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky with a low drive to draw the home side level.Hradecky pulled off a spectacular save when he blocked Sarenren Bazee’s point-blank effort but Bielefeld’s comeback was complete on the stroke of half-time with a close-range volley from Maximilian Grosser. The hosts were relentless, keeping up the pressure and carving out several chances after the break before Leverkusen’s Patrik Schick hit the post with an 81st-minute header.“We were missing all our usual strengths,” said the Leverkusen midfielder Robert Andrich. “We could not have an impact up front and we made far too many mistakes at the back.

The Guardian has learned that no charges have been issued owing to very low conviction rates for tailgating, which has become a big problem for the FA and some Premier League clubs.Quick GuideSemi-automated offsides get Premier League go-aheadShowSemi-automated offside technology will be introduced into the Premier League.The technology will be used in top-flight games taking place on 12 April. Its introduction comes following non-live testing in the league and live operation in the FA Cup this season.A Premier League statement read: 'Semi-automated offside technology automates key elements of the offside decision-making process to support the video assistant referee (VAR). It provides more efficient placement of the virtual offside line, using optical player tracking, and generates virtual graphics to ensure an enhanced in-stadium and broadcast experience for fans.'The technology maintains the integrity of the process while enhancing the speed, efficiency, and consistency of offside decision-making.'PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The FA is concerned about the lack of a deterrent for tailgaters and has petitioned the Home Office to pass a law to make it an offence that would lead to a criminal record and a football banning order, which prohibits offenders from attending matches in the UK. A private member’s bill was introduced to parliament by the Labour’s Linsey Farnsworth, the MP for Amber Valley, Derbyshire, last December, and the FA is determined to keep pressure on the government to make it law.“Enforcing entry points at Wembley is a huge drain on our resources,” an FA source said. “The police often don’t make arrests, as tailgating isn’t a criminal offence so won’t lead to convictions, and it’s often just left to the stewards. Even when the offenders are caught they just run off to the next turnstile and try again.“We need a proper deterrent in place, particularly with the Euros coming up. The Euro final [in 2021] was very challenging and we can’t have a repeat of that.”Johnson met at Wembley with police and senior stadium staff who were on duty during the Euros final in July 2021. She also visited the stadium control room, police and stewards on the frontline and witnessed individuals trying to force entry at the turnstiles.An independentreview led by Louise Caseyof the crowd disorder that marred the Euros final four years ago found that about 2,000 ticketless individuals had gained entry to Wembley, 400 of whom were ejected. Casey also found that a ticketless group of about 6,000 were preparing to storm the stadium had England won. She referred to collective security failures that “jeopardised the lives of legitimate supporters and staff”.The review made several recommendations to prevent a repeat at Wembley, many of which have been introduced by the FA. Alcohol has been banned from Olympic Way, kick-off times have been altered, stewarding has been increased and matches have been recategorised to ensure a larger police presence. A recommendation for stronger penalties for tailgating has yet to be enacted however, despite Lady Casey pointing out that it is a big problem.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Should Haaland be missing for seven weeks, he would miss for the Cup final on 17 May if City get there but be back for the final league match at Fulham eight days later. City’s opening Club World Cup group game is on 18 June against the Moroccan club Wydad.Haaland was replaced at Bournemouth by Omar Marmoush, who scored the winner in the 2-1 victory. Asked whether the Egyptian could replace Haaland as the No 9, Guardiola said: “We will find a solution … We don’t have another player with his [Haaland’s] skills or specific qualities. We have to adapt. We need players with other qualities and we have to bring more players with a sense of goal close to the box. That’s for sure. Because of course Erling’s numbers again have been exceptional and he is our incredible threat for many things, for the long balls, for the sense of goal.”City host Leicester on Wednesday and a home fans’ protest is asking supporters not take their seats for the first nine minutes owing to unhappiness at rising ticket prices and last week’s announcement of a partnership with Viagogo, a ticket resale site.Guardiola said: “Of course I have sympathy. When the fans can express good moments or bad moments or feelings, it’s because the team and the club is alive. So the worst is when you cannot express yourself. We need them, since minute one.“The club has to take [decisions] for the benefit of the club. The club doesn’t take it for granted.

He was previously a federal government sport minister and president of Athletics Australia for six years until 2021.Brisbane Olympics 2032: why these Games could turn out nothing like we had plannedRead moreArbib said it was an honour to lead the Australian Olympic movement. “The Olympics are the pinnacle of sport – both in Australia and across the globe,” he said. “To be chosen as chief executive of the Australian Olympic Committee, with a home Games in 2032, is an incredible opportunity to harness the power of the rings to inspire and advance our nation.”AOC president Ian Chesterman said Arbib’s experience runs “deep and wide” and he has demonstrated a passion for athletes. “Mark is highly skilled in the workings of the sports system having served as president of Athletics Australia for six years,” he said. “Together with his experience in government, business, fundraising and philanthropy, I look forward to him bringing his unique and compelling skillset to the operations of the AOC.”From his experience as a trade unionist in the 1990s, Arbib rose quickly in the right faction of the NSW Labor party in the 2000s. In 2007 he was elected a NSW senator at the age of 35, and was the first Labor frontbencher to publicly back same-sex marriage in 2010.As a so-called “kingmaker”, he played a major role in the party’s tumultuous period when in 2010Kevin Rudd was replaced as prime minister by Julia Gillard. But the saga triggered a change in his career. Arbib sensationally retired from politics in 2012 to help the party “heal” following the first of three leadership spills faced by Gillard, and he subsequently pursued opportunities in sport and media.“I’ve seen first hand the extraordinary power of the Olympic movement to unite and transform lives,” Arbib said. “I’ve also had the pleasure of working alongside our national federations over many years and know well the important role they play in delivering all the great benefits sport brings to our communities.“I am committed to working tirelessly for athletes – and making sure they are at the heart of everything we do.

The conflict is recorded in our annual accounts. It is not accurate to state that there is a gap in accountability.”The DCMS said in a National Audit Office report issued last December that it did not expect to recover up to £29m of the £41.6m it had loaned to three Premiership clubs – London Irish, Wasps and Worcester – after they became insolvent.It also said it would lose out on a further £11m in interest payments connected to those loans. But it has now also been accused of being “overly optimistic” about the returns it expects on the remaining loans of over £400m. However, the DCMS maintains that it will eventually recoup most of the money it has loaned.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He ran over to the bench to celebrate with one of the club’s performance coaches, Sam Wilson.Saka’s Arsenal return sinks Fulham but Gabriel and Timber add to injury crisisRead moreBut with the Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid looming, the last thing Arteta needed were more fitness issues. Gabriel was forced off with a hamstring problem while Timber could not finish the game because of pain in his knee. Arteta saw Riccardo Calafiori ­damage his knee on international duty with Italy, while he reported that Ben White also had a knee injury. The first leg against Madrid is next Tuesday at the Emirates Stadium.“It was a beautiful moment to see how much our people love, respect and admire Bukayo,” Arteta said. “The best example is his reaction. Immediately after scoring a goal, what does he do? He goes and says thank you for all the hard work that all the sports ­science guys, physios and everybody involved in the recovery have done for him. He lifted the stadium.“The downside is Gabi and Jurriën. We don’t know how they’re going to be. We’ll be assessing them tomorrow to understand better how we are with those two. There are two players in this team that never want to come off and it’s those two, probably. Gabi felt something in his hamstring. Jurriën was already struggling very early in the game. He managed to continue [but] at some point he couldn’t.“Calafiori, Ben White, Jurriën and Gabriel Magalhães – you can imagine [how I feel] with those four players in the defensive line in one week.

Maguire, who earlier headed a Patrick Dorgu cross wide, steered a shot goalwards only for the Forest defender Murillo to make a goal-saving clearance on the line.Amorim acknowledged United “had a lack of quality in the final third” but defended Maguire appearing more threatening than Rasmus Højlund, who entered at half-time in place of Manuel Ugarte, and Joshua Zirkzee, who were signed for a combined cost of more than £100m, but failed to trouble Forest.“In the end of the game when the opponent is just protecting the box with a line of six we can reach the final third but then we have to put the ball inside the box,” the United head coach said. “Harry Maguire when he is attacking at set pieces is maybe the best player in our team, so inside the box you are not a defender but a striker. That was the idea to put one man that is really good at that to score a goal.”Asked if it was concerning that Maguire fashioned United’s best chances, Amorim replied: “It depends on the characteristics of the game. Nottingham were playing with a low block with a line of six and then it’s also a matter of size, and the way that you have the ability to head a ball. That can happen with any team with the best strikers in the world. The defenders sometimes are the best ones to attack a goal inside the box. Harry is really good at that.”Elanga, who spent nine years at United, scored the only goal in the fifth minute after carrying the ball about 85m after the Forest captain, Ryan Yates, cleared a Bruno Fernandes cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Transforming the site, which hosts the 50,000-seat stadium, a 10,000-capacity indoor arena and a track and field venue, cost £3bn.On Monday it was confirmed that in July, Tottenham will play Arsenal at Kai Tak stadium in the first north London derby staged outside the UK while Liverpool will also be in action against Milan.Al Baxter, a former Australia prop under Eddie Jones turned architect and one of the brains behind the stadium in Hong Kong, said it would be the “perfect venue” and the city was “really keen” to host the Nations Championship finals.Meanwhile the British & Irish Lions are looking for a warm-up match on the way to New Zealand in 2029. The Lions played in Hong Kong in 2013, facing off against the Barbarians, while Australia played New Zealand in two Bledisloe Cup fixtures in 2008 and 2010. The Lions match was blighted by the searing heat in Hong Kong in June but the Kai Tak stadium’s retractable roof solves that problem.View image in fullscreenSarah Hirini, left, and Jorja Miller of New Zealand pose at Kai Tak Stadium after winning the women’s tournament in the Hong Kong sevens.Photograph: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty ImagesAsked if Hong Kong was an option for the Lions in the future, Alan Gilpin, the chief executive of World Rugby, said: “Definitely. The beauty of this is when the Lions did come through here, it would have been 2013 on the way to Australia. It was so hot that no one could hold the ball, it was like a bar of soap. Now if you close the roof, it would be a brilliant spectacle.”The Kai Tak stadium may also offer a clue as to what the planned £663m refurbishment of Twickenham may look like.

It added that SoftBank’s support would “pave the way” towards AGI, or artificial general intelligence, the term for AI systems that can match or exceed humans at nearly all cognitive tasks.“Hundreds of millions people use ChatGPT each week,” said the OpenAI chief executive,Sam Altman. “This investment helps us push the frontier and make AI more useful in everyday life.”Norwegian files complaint after ChatGPT falsely said he had murdered his childrenRead moreThe fundraising came as Altman said ChatGPT had added a million users in just one hour as its new image generation feature takes off with consumers – accompanied by a viral obsession with recreating Studio Ghibli-style art.SoftBank is to put $10bn at first into OpenAI and $30bn more by the end of 2025 if certain conditions are met. The Japanese company will provide 75% of the funding in the latest round, with the rest provided byMicrosoft– a key backer of OpenAI – and the tech-focused investment companies Coatue Management, Altimeter Capital and Thrive Capital.“AI is a defining force shaping humanity’s future,” said Masayoshi Son, the chair and chief executive of SoftBank. “Our expanded partnership with OpenAI accelerates our shared vision to unlock its full potential.”OpenAI also announced on Monday that it was building a more open generative AI model as it faces growing competition in the open-source space fromDeepSeekand Meta, whose models are freely available and, unlike ChatGPT, can be adjusted. OpenAI is preparing to launch an “open weight” model which can be fine-tuned by users.OpenAI had been a fierce defender of closed, proprietary models that do not allow developers to modify the basic technology to adapt AI to their goals. “We’ve been thinking about this for a long time, but other priorities took precedence. Now it feels important to do,” said Altman.OpenAI and defenders of closed models – which include Google – have often decried open models as riskier and more vulnerable to malicious and non-US government use.Elon Musk, a former OpenAI investor whorecently leda near-$100bn consortium bid for the company, hascalled on OpenAIto “return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was”.Large companies and governments have been reluctant to use AI models they have no control over, especially when data security is a concern. Meta and DeepSeek let companies download and modify their models.The Meta chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said this month that its large language AI model Llama had hit 1bn downloads. DeepSeek’s lower-cost R1 model rocked the world of artificial intelligence in January.OpenAI has been riding on the success of its latest image-generation features in ChatGPT.

Their goal: stigmatize Tesla’s cars. One sign in Manhattan read: “Burn a Tesla, save democracy.” Protesters are using the commercial democracy of consumer products to influence US political democracy.My colleagues Dara Kerr and Edward Helmore report:InNew YorkCity, several hundred anti-Tesla protesters gathered outside the EV company’s Manhattan showroom on Saturday. Sophie Shepherd, 23, an organizer with Planet Over Profit, explained that the rally was not about protesting electric cars.“We’re here to protest Musk, who has essentially held aTeslacar show on the White House lawn,” she said. “We want to disrupt his business as much as possible, so that includes all Teslas, and not just the Cybertruck.”The demonstrations did not draw huge crowds. Nonetheless, Musk’s fortune has dropped more than $100bn as Tesla’s stock has fallen by nearly half since its peak value in December 2024.Musk’s political ventures are forcing many Tesla owners to either be a spokesperson for or against the companyMusk is synonymous with Tesla. In its comprehensive annual report, the company discloses in the section on risks that it is “highly dependent on the services ofElon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer”. Technoking of Tesla is one of Musk’s official, if juvenile, titles.By extension, consumer sentiment regarding Musk’s public persona is inextricable from Tesla. When he was known primarily as a multi-hyphenate technical genius, the inspiration for Iron Man, that perception boosted Tesla’s brand like an engine from his rocket company.In light of the polarization of Musk as a public figure, however, reading Tesla’s risk assessments in its 10-K form takes on a different tone: “We will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed.”“We are targeting a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers,” reads Tesla’s disclosure.Musk’s political ventures are forcing many Tesla owners to either be a spokesperson for or against the company. Individual owners are being asked tojustify their purchasesor publicly declare the separation of their beliefs from their vehicles. Of particular concern are the dates of the purchases, with “I bought this before Elon went crazy” bumper stickers proliferating as a sign of rebuke of the so-called “department of government efficiency”. Yet there is a wide swath of the US public that seems to want their car to just be a car, not a political statement.For his own part, Musk is targeting a narrower and narrower audience, hosting a Tesla sales event on the White House lawn alongside one of the most poorly rated and divisive presidents in modern political history. I can’t predict Tesla’s fate, but for now, widespread social souring on Tesla is making a dent in its finances.Read the full story on Saturday’s protestshere.More on Elon MuskTesla investors brace for global sales data amid consumer backlash over Elon MuskElon Musk hands out $1m checks to voters amid Wisconsin supreme court election raceskip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The image was captioned: “Virginia Basora-Gonzalez, a previously deported alien felon convicted of fentanyl trafficking, was arrested by @ICEgov in Philadelphia after illegally reentering the U.S. She wept when taken into custody (picture attached).”By ghiblifying this woman, the White House inadvertently made a previously deported felon and literal fentanyl trafficker sympatheticThe White House’s image is shocking. The contrast between the harshness of deportation and the round softness of the characters rendered in a warm color scheme, evocative of children’s animated classics such as Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro, is ghoulish. That seems to be the point. The image is both viral nonsense – there may be little meaning to extract from it other than its capacity to appall – and also a communication from the most powerful office in the United States. We may be obligated to attempt to understand it.Earlier last week, OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT with better image generation. Soon, there was a deluge on Twitter/X of real photographs reproduced as still images in the distinctive style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind, most recently, the Oscar, Bafta- and Golden Globe-winning film The Boy and the Heron. Imade oneof the images. The OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, changed his profile photo to a character he described as “a twink Ghibli style”, too. The White House appears to have done the same. (OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment on the cartoon depiction of the arrest and deportation.)Trump has never seen Ghibli’s Princess Mononoke, I would venture. Part of what is supremely bizarre in the image is visual; another part is political. Hayao Miyazaki, the 84-year-old founder of Ghibli, hascriticized nationalismand championed environmentalism, expressing opposition to positions easily attributable to Trump’s administration.In a 2018 documentary, Miyazaki called one young animator’s use of artificial intelligence to produce a grotesque moving figure “an insult to life itself”. Whether OpenAI violated Ghibli’s copyright in equipping its AI model to imitate the studio’s style remains an open legal and philosophical question. I recommend reading Walter Benjamin’sThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, which concerns recreations of the Mona Lisa.Mike Solana, the chief marketing officer of Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and the founder of the conservative newsletter Pirate Wires, tweeted that the image was ineffective in its mockery because it was tookawaii.“24 hours in and we face the first great example of a person working with a form they didn’t earn, and therefore don’t understand. by ghiblifying this woman the white house inadvertently made a previously deported felon and literal fentanyl trafficker sympathetic … this specific aesthetic is innately endearing. you can’t make me want to see a ghibli character in pain,” Solanatweeted.I have written before about howUS conservatives love AI while liberals shun it, which I think remains the case. The jarring admixture of seemingly silly internet aesthetics with the Trump administration’s punitive approach to immigration will not disappear soon.

But equally, in today’s tough job market, not using AI wisely as part of your search could mean you miss out. It’s a tricky balancing act to harness the technology’s power without losing the human touch.You can use AI models such asChatGPTandPerplexityto research employers, competitors and industry trends before applying for a job.Hannah Salton, a careers coach, says some of her clients have successfully used AI to find out more about companies, allowing them to “gain insights into culture, competitors and market positioning. It can also help identify SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] to apply to or network with.”‘It’s nightmarish’: why 1.5m Britons are still hunting for a jobRead moreShe says: “For example, you can askChatGPTto suggest SMEs with marketing teams based in your city if that’s who you are targeting. However, AI models aren’t always accurate, so cross-check your results using other sources.”AI can also be used to help you to spot shifts in your industry and identify the skills needed to future-proof your career.For example,JobsGPT, a tool from SmarterX, can analyse how a role in your industry is evolving, breaking it down into specific tasks and assessing which parts are most exposed to automation. This could help you to work out whether there are skills you need to acquire, or if you should consider moving into a more in-demand area.Eloise Skinner, a careers coach, says her clients also use AI to find industries and roles that match their skills and values, helping them to think beyond the jobs they would normally consider. Jobseekers can ask ChatGPT and Perplexity to suggest roles that align with their particular skills, passion and experience, for example.She says: “AI can suggest roles based on previous experience, values, ambitions and strongest skill sets. It might also summarise information about an industry or job, such as career prospects, work-life balance or salary expectations, helping candidates decide where to apply.”Stay humanHung Lee, the founder of theRecruiting Brainfoodnewsletter, says jobseekers often rush their applications because they are afraid that roles will be snapped up quickly. This urgency drives many to use AI to speed up the process. “It’s become an arms race,” he says. This trend has led to recruiters receiving a flood of generic AI-generated applications.View image in fullscreen‘I’m looking for candidates who sound human, showcase their unique voice,’ said one recruiter.Photograph: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/RexMartha Brook, who founded and runs her own stationery brand, says: “I recently received over 2,000 applications for a role within a week, and spotting AI-generated copy was surprisingly easy – it was an instant turn-off and in most cases led to immediate rejection.”She adds: “Aside from the obvious copy-and-paste jobs from ChatGPT, many applications regurgitated the job description and sounded generic. In a pool of thousands, I’m looking for candidates who sound human, showcase their unique voice and show they’ve done their research rather than relying on AI to do the heavy lifting.”Make sure your application stands out by sharing specific reasons for your interest in the role. Maybe you have used the company’s products, or its mission fits with your values. Tools such as ChatGPT, Grammarly and Hemingway can improve your grammar, clarity and readability, but use AI to refine your writing rather than create your application. Showcasing individuality and genuine enthusiasm is vital.Beat the screening systemsMany large companies now use AI-powered applicant tracking systems (ATS) to screen CVs before they reach a human. These systems scan applications for particular keywords and phrases, ranking them based on how well they match the job description.“One of my clients was struggling with a wordy CV,” says Salton. “They used ChatGPT to highlight their key skills more concisely. But they were careful to keep their authentic voice.” For example, you could prompt ChatGPT to “refine my CV for clarity to highlight my key skills and experience in a concise, engaging way while preserving my voice”.Sign up toLinkedIn Premium Career(£29.99 a month after a free trial), and you benefit from a host of AI-powered jobseeking tools.These include a profile-writing assistant that also acts as a CV enhancer. You can refine your headline and summary, which LinkedIn claims can make you visible for nearly twice as many job opportunities. You can also highlight three advertised jobs a month as top choices, making your profile stand out to recruiters with a verified badge and a personalised message when applying.And you can also message recruiters directly, even without being connected. LinkedIn is rolling out a job-match feature that shows you how your skills and experience fit particular jobs to focus your search.Sharpen interview skillsUse the AI interview tool alongside practice with real people, recruiters advise.Photograph: LumiNola/GettyAI can be a useful interview practice tool. “Saying your answers out loud provides a more natural and immersive practice experience,” says Skinner. “It helps you hear how you actually sound, which can be revealing. But use it alongside practice with real people – that’s still essential.”ChatGPT’s advanced voice mode, for example, can provide feedback on your delivery. This can pinpoint weak areas that you need to work on, building confidence for the real event. Open ChatGPT and activate the voice mode on the search bar. Ask it to conduct a mock interview for a particular role after providing the job details and give feedback on your answers.Platforms such asGoogle’s digital skills trainingoffer AI-powered career coaching so that you can speak clearly about your achievements.However, be prepared at an actual interview to discuss your AI usage if it played a role in the application process. Transparency about how you used AI to prepare can demonstrate adaptability and a practical approach to technology.And, just as with your CV, Julia Morgon, a director at the recruitment agency Brook Street, says: “Don’t forget to inject your own personality into an interview. What makes you different from your colleagues is what employers see the most value in. AI can’t help you stand out as an individual on the day.”Know your worthUse AI-powered platforms such asGlassdoorandPayscaleto research potential salaries and boost your negotiating position. You may discover, for example, that some companies consistently pay above the market rate. AI-powered salary tools can also highlight regional salary differences and remote working pay variations.As roles evolve, salaries change, too. The average British worker changes jobs every five years, according to a study by the insurer LV=. Understanding these trends is vital when negotiating an offer.For more detailed salary insights, platforms such as Totaljobs and Reed can provide up-to-date pay data based on industry, location and experience level. This could help you benchmark offers more accurately.Tom Buckell, a director at the recruitment company Manpower UK, says you can use what you learned in your research in your contract negotiations, asking about flexibility around shifts, for examples, or opportunities for training. “This also gives you more options for increasing non-salary related benefits if your potential employer can’t meet your wage expectations,” he adds.Explore more on these topicsJob huntingMoney hacksArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatGPTWork & careersWork-life balancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This assessment can be challenged by individuals.The proposed data (use and access) bill, which is expected to come into force in early 2026, would permit the secretary of state to use personal data without the same risk assessment and without it being subject to the same level of parliamentary scrutiny as other legislation.James Baker, a programme manager at Open Rights Group, said: “Political parties are stuck in an arms race as to how they can use data to reach and influence potential voters in order to win elections.“It’s therefore vital that there are clear and fair rules for how political parties are allowed to use our data. Any changes to these rules must be properly scrutinised by parliament. This is not just about how our data is being used now; it’s about the future of our democracy.”While Baker noted the government might not intend to use these powers to sneak through changes, he said there could be no guarantee that future administrations would operate in the same way, particularly against a backdrop of “a surge in populist governments that are prepared to use executive powers to advance their agenda”.He added: “This is not the time to weaken parliamentary scrutiny; the government must act to prevent the data bill from enabling future abuses of power.”A Department for Science, Innovation and Technology spokesperson said the use of personal data for political campaigning or engagement was “not included in the measures of the data bill”.Noting that regulations would be subject to “three robust safeguards”, including consultation with the Information Commissioner’s Officer, approval by the UK parliament and a requirement to serve the general public interest, they added: “It is also false to claim there would be no parliamentary oversight of potential changes to these rules.”Ross McKenzie, a partner at Addleshaw Goddard, said the law was written in such a way that future secretaries of state would not have a “completely unfettered right” to use personal data, and acknowledged it would probably only be in “extreme scenarios” that ministers might “extend recognised legitimate interest grounds without the same level of parliamentary scrutiny”.But he added: “Other countries with General Data Protection Regulation rules in Europe don’t have this allowance. The UK government’s view is to make doing business in the UK easier, and one way is to give more flexible rights to use data – this allowance makes that quicker and easier to achieve. But I can see why it’s not attractive from a human rights perspective.”The data bill is designed to cut red tape around data use, and the government has estimated it could add some £10bn to the UK economy over a period of 10 years.Peers in the House of Lords constitution committee have previously expressed concerns, warning they were “not satisfied that the case has been sufficiently made to entrust the powers in these clauses to secondary legislation”.Explore more on these topicsPrivacyData protectionnewsShareReuse this content"

They can learn about credit and debit cards, the tactics advertisers use, and how to keep money safe from scammers.Resources for secondary schools are designed to help pupils understand inflation, personal risk, cryptocurrency and investing. There are also lessons on how to understand bank statements and payslips, and how to scrutinise data and claims made by campaigners, advertisers and online influencers.Parents and financial experts have campaigned for years for better financial education for children to prepare them for the everyday challenges of adult life.The recent interim report on the government’s independent curriculum and assessment reviewnoted that parents and children want an increased focus on applied knowledge and skills in the curriculum, including finance and budgeting.John Roberts, Oak’s interim CEO, said: “By giving teachers the tools to provide well-sequenced, engaging financial learning, we can make sure it resonates with children to support them through adulthood.”Pepe Di’Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “There’s a strong case for more financial education on the curriculum in general but we must be mindful of not further overloading an already packed school day.”Sarah Hannafin, head of policy at the National Association of Head Teachers, added: “Online platforms also need to step up to the plate, however, by strengthening age verification procedures, improving monitoring, providing clearer functions for reporting concerns and introducing more transparent codes of conduct setting out the implications of misuse.”Explore more on these topicsSchoolsConsumer affairsEnglandiPhoneOnline shoppingYouTubeApplenewsShareReuse this content"

But he appears to embody the French philosopher’s claim that “politics is the continuation of war by other means”. Nowhere is this more apparent than in his fondness for tariffs. He presents taxing foreign imports as a way torebuildthe American economy in favour of blue-collar workers left behind by free trade and globalisation. Yet he plainly thinks that politics is not about truth or justice. It is about leverage and supremacy.Britain is learning first-hand that Mr Trump, with his us-versus-them framing and taste for spectacle, is an accidentalFoucauldian– using tariffs as tools of loyalty and dominance, even against allies. If Mr Trump follows through on his threat to impose a20% tariffon all imports, UK growth will suffer. The effect depends on the response. No British retaliation would mean GDP0.4% lowerthis year and 0.6% next. A global trade war would push that to 0.6% and 1%. Either outcome would wipe out the government’s fiscal headroom. But while British policymakers fret over the shrinkingmarginsof fiscal rules, Mr Trump sees no need to cloak power in objectivity.His rationale for imposing tariffs is confused. But two things appear to be driving this. One is his self-styled image as the ultimatedealmaker; the man who can turn any situation to his advantage. The other is his view of politics as a means for structuring society to favour one group over another – not just economically, but in terms of legitimacy and who defines reality. Tariffs will probably be lifted if nations accede to Mr Trump’s wishes and, in doing so, reward politically usefulconstituencies, big tech allies or his wealthydonors.All three are visible in a paper-thin UK–US “economic deal”, likely to result in the lifting of Trump’s tariffs – if the US signs it. It, reportedly, would further open British markets to US agribusiness; end thedigital services tax, which applies to companies such as Amazon andGoogle; and make it difficult to holdAI companies, like those owned by Mr Trump’s ally Elon Musk, liable for harm. The danger is that whenever there’s a grievance, Mr Trumpthreatens tariffs– then offers to lift them if you do what he wants.It’s even more blatant with the EU, which isexpectedto fine Apple and Meta under its digital competition rules. After backing Mr Trump early, Meta’sMark Zuckerbergis now calling in a favour – urging the administration to fold his fight with Brussels into the tariff plans, casting regulation as just another front in the trade war.What makes Mr Trump’s “Liberation Day” so dangerous is its scale. In 2024, the US ran a $1.2tn trade goods deficit. Only two months from his White House return, Mr Trump has imposedtariffson goods from Canada, Mexico, China, all steel and aluminium imports, and foreign cars and auto parts. Next up:friendsin Asia, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, India and Vietnam.What emerges is less trade policy than performance politics – where coercion, loyalty and theatre converge. This isFoucaultnot in footnotes but in action: power exercised not through rules, but through disruption and dealmaking that rewards fealty and punishes defiance. Britain, like others, is navigating a battlefield. The US president is no student of Foucault but he seems to grasp the lesson. For him, war isn’t the alternative to politics. It is politics.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s about erasure, and ‘erasure is violence’Tue 1 Apr 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 17.21 EDTShareLast week,Donald Trumpissued another executive order, this one aimed directly at the Smithsonian Institution, and called for “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”. He contended that the Smithsonian had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology” and that it advocates “narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive”. Specifically, the order targeted American history and art that focused on stories of race and racism.Being responsible for the distillation of the nation’s narrative is no small thing. The Smithsonian oversees 21 museums, libraries, research centers and the National zoo. Every year millions of people visit various sites that are free to the public. The collection of museums represents the pinnacle of public history and the story America tells the world about itself.But Trump’s executive order is not about restoring the truth. Quite the opposite. It creates false narratives and myths that promote the supremacy of whiteness. This executive order has the potential for harm because erasure is violence; it robs the public of the truth. Because there is no way to explain slavery and segregation as not “inherently harmful and oppressive”, Trump would rather not explain it at all.One of the most popular Smithsonian sites is the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC), affectionately known by Black people as the “Blacksonian”. The museum was conceived of as early as 1915 by Black veterans who fought during the civil war and wanted recognition for their service and valor. These soldiers were not only left out of national memorials and ceremonies, but also faced tremendous discrimination often culminating in deadly violence when they returned home. They wanted a space and memorial that would honor their achievements and pivotal contributions.It was impossible to separate the story of Black military service and valor from racial discrimination and violence. Similarly, one cannot separate out the “good” from the “bad” in creating an honest narrative about the United States. Accordingly, the NMAAHC holds a special place in America, one where the complexity of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are recognized as founding fathers and slaveholders. There is no abolitionist movement without slavery. There is no suffrage movement without women’s denial. There is no civil rights movement without racism and oppression. These are the facts.Museumsexist to collect, preserve and exhibit the past as it happened. Archivists and curators care deeply about their mission to be accurate and authentic.An America that willre-erect statues and rename military basesafter Confederate generals, while simultaneously stripping the evidence of race and racism from the Smithsonian history museums isn’t correcting the historical record. That nation is whitewashing the political record to legitimize the actions of those in power. Slavery is a fact. Jim Crow is a fact. Racist and exclusionary immigration laws are a fact. Japanese internment is a fact. Native American removal and extermination is a fact. Mexican and Mexican American expulsion is a fact. Removing them from the sight of the public doesn’t change the facts, it only changes one’s perspective on and relation to them politically.Museums offer cautionary tales, hard lessons about where the country has been and where we hope to never be again. They hold a great deal of public trust, perhaps more than schools, media, newspapers or even films. Patrons get to experience first hand documents, letters, original photographs and artefacts. Museums are public time capsules of where we have been. I will never forget seeing Emmett Till’s casket, Harriet Tubman’s shawl, Nat Turner’s Bible or an early flag of the First Republic of Haiti. These artefacts do more than defy the odds by still existing; they tell a powerful story about who people were during the times that they lived. Museums should not be party to culture wars. Our history is a collective memory whether Trump likes it or not.A nation that cannot reckon with its past, triumph and tragedy, is ultimately a weaker one; puffed up with its own delusions of grandeur. There is more power in the truth than there is in a lie. The efforts in the last 50 years to give the powerless a place politically, academically and legally is not from a revisionist view of American history, but rather a move to make all of America the democratic nation it claims to be.Moreover, key features of the NMAAHC reflect optimism, spirituality and joy because anti-Blackness is not the totality of the Black experience. The museum showcases Black food pathways, artistry, music, sports, film, ingenuity and technological advancements. It is a celebration of achievement despite the barriers and challenges racism presents. But even if museums solely focused on slavery, they still deserve a right to exist. America has been a land with enslaved people longer than it has been a county without slavery.Are museums contested spaces? Absolutely. No one space can include everything and offer an exhaustive history of a country, person or movement. But what is included or not included is painstakingly considered. Museums are bipartisan sites where everyone can grapple with the good, bad and the ugliness of nation making. But Trump will not stop until every American relic reflects his imaginary world view, a place where few can see their lived experiences on full display.Explore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionRaceTrump administrationDonald TrumpMuseumsWashington DCSlaverycommentShareReuse this content"

As a candidate Trump often wooed workers by promising to fight for them, but ever since he returned to the White House, he has taken dozens of anti-worker and anti-union actions.In an unprecedented anti-union action last Thursday, the president moved toend collective bargainingfor a million federal employees and scrap union contracts nearly that number, while attackingtheir unions as “hostile”merely because they were doing what unions are supposed to do: battling to save the jobs of tens of thousands of union members whom Trump and Elon Musk had summarily fired.In an era when many workers are demanding respect, Trump keeps showing disrespect toward the country’s 2.3 million federal workers. He and Musk have cavalierly fired more than 50,000 federal employees, ignoring contractual protections saying they could only be terminated for poor performance. Then Trump blamed the victims, saying, without evidence: “Many of them don’t work at all. Many of them never showed up to work.” Trump views federal employees not as dedicated workers who serve the nation’s 340 million people, but as deplorables who work for the detested deep state.Not stopping there, Trump has named several vehemently anti-union figures to be his right-hand men.Russell Vought, head of Trump’s office of management and budget, has shown true sadism toward workers. “We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,” Voughtsaid in a video disclosedby ProPublica and the research group Documented. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains … We want to put them in trauma.”Would anyone who cared an iota about workers name such a callous, anti-worker person to a top position?Then there’s the aggressively anti-union Mr Musk. Trumppraised Muskover the idea of firing striking workers, an action that is illegal and would go far to cripple labor’s most powerful weapon: the strike. Musk has become a pariah in Scandinavia for his extreme anti-union animus: Tesla hasrefused to recognize a union there– something that virtually all Scandinavian corporations do. Like Trump, Musk has a penchant for disrespecting workers, repeatedly tarring federal employees as being guilty of “waste, fraud and abuse”. Last week on Fox News, Musk insulted the intelligence of federal workers by falselysaying: “Basically almost no one [no federal employee] has gotten fired.”Again, would anyone who cared a whit about workers and unions tap Musk for such a powerful position?One has to strain to think of even one or two pro-worker or pro-union moves that Trump has takenTrump’s first two months back in office have been filled with anti-worker and anti-union actions. In an unseemly move, the Trump administrationcalled on federal workersto snitch on each other, to report on co-workers who promote diversity and inclusion. Trump fired Gwynne Wilcox, the acting chair of the National Labor Relations Board –a move she says is illegal– leaving the board without a quorum to penalize employers that break the law when fighting against unionization. Trumpalso firedthe NLRB’s vigorously pro-union general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, and wants to replace her with a management-side lawyer whose firm represents many anti-union companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.Trump, the supposed champion of workers, has done little to raise workers’ wages. As in his first term, he’s done zilch to increase the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at a shockingly low $7.25 an hour for 15 years. He also rescinded Joe Biden’s order securing a$17.75-an-hour minimum wagefor federal contractors. As a candidate Trump wooed tipped workers by vowing to end the income tax on employee tips, but he has failed to get the House budget bill to end that tax, although that bill tentatively includes Trump’sidea not to tax overtime pay.Labor leaders have denounced Trump’s order to gut union bargaining for 1 million workers. Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, called Trump’s actions “the biggest assault on collective bargaining rightswe have ever seen in this country”. Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said Trump’s order was “a disgraceful and retaliatory attackon the rights of hundreds of thousands of patriotic American civil servants – nearly one-third of whom are veterans – simply because they are members of a union that stands up to his harmful policies”.Anti-union CEOs and ideologues will no doubt applaud Trump’s order. By targeting unionization among 1 million workers, Trump aims to weaken the nation’s 14-million-member labor movement. If successful, his move would end bargaining for those 1 million workers, holding down employee pay and thereby making more money available for Trump’s tax cuts for the rich.Want to defeat Trump? Support unions | Eric BlancRead moreRepublican lawmakers will love Trump’s move because it undermines a key financial pillar for the Democrats. Half of US union members are government employees, and their unions are often major funders of Democratic candidates. Trump certainly knows that – 10 minutes after the supreme court issued itsJanus decisionin 2018, ruling that no federal, state or local government employee can be required to pay union dues, Trump tweeted“big loss for the coffersof the Democrats!” Trump’s new executive order will further skew a huge imbalance: Open Secrets, a research group that tracks political contributions, found that in the 2024 election cycle, businessout-donated unions by 16 to one. Corporations donated $6.1bn to unions’ $264m, which is less than the gazillionaire Musk gave all by himself.Trump also won over many workers by vowing to cut prices. Not only did he vow to cut egg prices, he boldly said he’dcut auto insurance pricesandenergy pricesin half. But Trump has totally failed to do any of that. Moreover, his 25% auto tariff will cause auto prices to soar.One has to strain to think of even one or two pro-worker or pro-union moves that Trump has taken. The White House says his tariffs are pro-worker and pro-union, insisting they will bring back manufacturing jobs. But many economists say Trump’s tariffs will hurt myriad industries and workers. His auto tariffs, for instance, will increase car prices and as a result, auto sales, auto production and auto jobswill decline, at least short-term. Not only that, other countries’ retaliation will pummel various US industries and trigger additional layoffs. Moreover, Trump’s tariffs will undermine GDP growth and perhaps push the US into recession. Bottom line: Trump remains obsessed with tariffs, even though they’re likely to result inmore pain than gainfor US workers.When it comes to worker issues, Trump resembles the emperor in the famous fairytale: he sees himself wearing magnificent union-made clothes covered with buttons containing pro-worker slogans. But more and more Americans realize that when it comes to helping workers, Trump is like Hans Christian Andersen’s emperor: his nakedness is showing.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS unionsUS politicsElon MuskTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

How realistic is the prospect of Trump 3.0?Tue 1 Apr 2025 08.41 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 13.58 EDTShareHell is empty and all the devils are in Washington DC. And, what with devils being immortal and all, it looks as if they might stay there indefinitely. Now, before I seamlessly segue from fun devil facts into talking about Donald Trumpthreatening to run for a third term, the current political climate compels me to make a few things clear. I recently had to submit my US green card for renewal (impeccable timing!) so I’d like to explain to any United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers reviewing my file that the first line of this piece was justriffing on Shakespeare. I’m absolutely not comparing Trump, the greatest man to walk this Earth, to Satan. Nor am I suggesting evil people seem to live long lives.On the contrary, I am thrilled that our 78-year-old president has suggested he is looking into “methods” that will allow him to serve this wonderful country longer. And it’s a shame my enthusiasm isn’t universally shared. I mean, to quote JD Vance (who is up there next to Shakespeare in the words department), have any Trump detractors SAID THANK YOU ONCE? Trump could be relaxing with his billions; he could be playing golf every day. Instead, the poor man only gets to play golf every few days –costing taxpayers millions of dollars– and has to spend most of his time sorting out the US. The economy doesn’t just crash itself, you know? So thank you, Mr President. Thank you, thank you, thank you.But, look, while I’m obviously overjoyed by the idea that our esteemed leader might stick around far longer than norms, conventions and the constitution allow, just how realistic a prospect is Trump 3.0? The president has insisted he is “not joking” about seeking a third term in office, but is all this talk just a tactic to distract us from what he is getting up to in his current term?Obviously, I can’t tell you what goes on in the murky depths of Trump’s mind. But I can tell you this: Trump has no regard for norms or laws, and will do whatever he wants if he thinks he can get away with it.Perhaps the better question to ask isn’t whether Trump is serious about extending his rule, but – should he seek a third term – who might stop him? Unless they all get spine transplants, the Democrats aren’t going to put up a fight. Want to know what Kamala Harris is doing now? Getting ready to speak at areal estate conference in Australia. It’s obviously not Harris’s job to safeguard US democracy but, after raising enormous amounts of money from regular people who believed in her campaign promises, you would think she might care a little more about the optics.As for Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader – the person whose job it actually is to represent the opposition – his strategy for dealing with Trump appears to be to give Republicanswhatever they wantand hope that, somehow, this turns out badly for them. It’s not surprising then, that arecent surveyshowed 70% of Democratic voters gave the party’s response to Trump a “C” grade or below.It is not just the Democrats who appear to have capitulated to Trump: a number of big legal firms have also bowed down to the president’s efforts to get them to comply with hisinterpretation of the law. Elite universities such as Columbia Universityhave also caved in to Trump’s demands. Even the White House Correspondents’ Associationjust cancelledan appearance by an anti-Trump comedian in an attempt to stay on the president’s good side. And, as we all know, Silicon Valley has beenbending the knee toTrump for months.Meanwhile, as any opposition to Trump seems to evaporate, Elon Musk is running around handing out checks to voters in Wisconsin in what many critics have characterised as an attempt to influence thestate’s supreme court election. Even if Trump doesn’t go for a third term, even if the Democrats win the next election, the US’s descent into techno-authoritarianism isn’t going to be easily reversed. Not, to be clear to any USCIS officers reading this, that I’m complaining. Not little old me! I’m renaming my daughter Donalda, getting a Tesla tattoo, and cheering as all my rights are systematically taken away.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsJD VanceRepublicansTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

In 2016, Chuck Schumer summed up the party’s attitude by predicting that “for every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs of Philadelphia”.What a difference a decade makes. In a recent report titledRenewing the Democratic Partythe thinktank Third Way warns: “For the first time since the mid-20th century, the central fault line of American politics is neither race and ethnicity nor gender but rather class.” The policy shop even organized a meeting of heavy-weight Democratic party leaders to develop a new strategy for how they might win back the working class.Can moderate Democrats, plotting their path back to power in Loudoun county, Virginia (therichest countyin the US), convincingly make a populist pivot?Cryptocurrency will not save the Democratic party | Alex Bronzini-VenderRead moreWhile Third Way’s advice, collected in a widely circulatedmemo, has some useful insights, more than anything it demonstrates establishment Democrats’ failure to understand the nature of working-class woes. In fact, the revival of populism, left and right, can be understood as a revolt against the world Third Way helped midwife. After all, they embraced an economic model – defined by free trade, deindustrialization, mass global migration and stagnant wages – that was responsible for the left’s breakup with the working class in the first place.Working-class culture clashThird Way’s first takeaway from the election is thatDemocratsare culturally disconnected from the working class. And they’re right. They advocate moving away from identity politics, insist that candidates use “plain language”, “avoid jargon”, reject “fringe positions” and eschew “overly moralistic or condescending messaging”. This makes sense. Yet newfound fears of identity politics, or the excessive influence of the foundation-funded non-profit left, reflect a certain amnesia. Moreover, turning the ship around is easier said than done.It’s no secret that sanctimonious political correctness, and preachy “social-justice” rhetoric have served as a major means to sideline progressive critics of the prevailing economic order. In fact, long before Hillary Clinton infamouslywonderedwhether breaking up the big banks would “end racism”, her husband’s campaign architects – paradigmatic Third Way Democrats – pursued the same line of attack againstcriticsof the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Those who didn’t want jobs shipped to the lowest-wage corners of the globe were labeled “racists”. It’s not a coincidence, then, that the rise of identity politics, and even “wokeness”, happened in tandem with the ascent of globalization as championed by Third Way adherents.As factories closed and millions of jobs were drained out of the US, the economic and social power of the working class fell into a steep decline. By the mid-1990s non-profits and thinktanks replaced labor unions as the major source of political influence on the left. With unions taking a backseat, politicking within the Democratic party took on a more elite character. Fights over slices of the economic pie shifted from the vertical axis – between labor and big business, between the rich and the poor – to the horizontal, between cross-class “groups”, unfailingly represented by well-staffed professional advocacy organizations.This all had the convenient effect of rendering blue-collar concerns practically invisible to elite Democrats. While trade, immigration and dissension over cultural issues have long appeared at the top of lists of concerns for non-college educated workers, Democrats wouldn’t listen. Instead they embraced liberal professionals as the vanguard of the New Democrat movement. Welcoming the influence of the Brahmin caste. Meanwhile, liberal cultural institutions (the media, the academy, the arts) increasingly applied downward pressure on blue-collar workers to embrace new values. That is, the values of the elite.Consider that, for the first half of this decade, there were wall-to-wall injunctions from the largest corporations in retail, tech and even finance – not to mention virtually all major media conglomerates – to embrace liberal identity politics, “diversity, equity and inclusion”, and cosmopolitan sexual ethics. Looked at in this light, today’s culture war can best be understood as a working-class revolt against the values of “knowledge economy” elites. It won’t be easy to make peace with the same elite still in charge.Resentment is richNor is it a coincidence why educational cleavages, in particular, play such a major role in cultural and political conflict today. While they were busy fashioning the “New Economy”, Third Way elites insisted that non-college educated workers refashion themselves to suit it. They implored everyone to go to college and learn to code to compete in the emerging high-tech hyper-global world. They were confident that the short-term pain of job losses would be rewarded with future gains. It hasn’t panned out. In terms of income, wealth and even life expectancy, blue-collar workers have found themselves lagging further and further behind their educated white-collar counterparts. Since 2000 wages for non-college educated workers have remained flat oractually fallen. For those with a college degree they have modestly increased. The earnings gap has grown wide.Meanwhile, none have benefitted from the contemporary economic and political arrangement as much as the wealthy. In inverse proportions have the rich profited alongside working-class decline. In 1990 – before Clinton signed Nafta, before Democrats presided over further deregulation of the financial sector, and before the dot-com boom – there were 66billionaires in the United States. Just 10 years later – after gobs of factory jobs were off-shored – there were 298. A 350% increase. Today, there are more than 748.As a result, evenLarry Summers(once a pre-eminent Third Way economist) has identified an “investment dearth” combined with a “savings glut” that has led to economic “secular stagnation”. In layman’s terms: the rich have all the money and they refuse to share. The billionaire hoarding of wealth means investment in the real economy is anemic. They sit like elephants on top of global growth rates. And because workers can’t spend wages they don’t have, effective demand stays flat.The Third Way left promised that the fire sale of public assets, the unshackling of big banks and the introduction of unfettered free trade would unleash unprecedented growth and a rising standard of living for American workers. It didn’t. Instead, it drove down wages and helped them transform their own party into a haven of the affluent and the educated.The paradoxes of pragmatic populismConfronting all this, Third Way now advocates that Democrats embrace a brand of pragmatic populism. They recognize the need to critique “corporate excess and corruption”, they counsel Democrats to avoid “dismissing economic anxieties” and instead acknowledge “real struggles like high prices and stagnant wages”. They even suggest that Democrats fight “for systemic reforms rather than just defending the status quo”.At the same time, they stress that Democrats are hurt by “reflexively attacking wealthy business leaders”. They warn against “vilifying the rich” and “demonizing” corporations. And insist that Democrats be pragmatic “pro-capitalist” reformers.They argue that candidates ought to own “the failures of Democratic governance” they don’t count among these, the broad failure of liberal economic policy to improve the lives of most voters. And while the authors of the memo are right to notice that “Democrats lack a cohesive, inspiring economic agenda”, they don’t offer any ideas for economic renewal. There is nothing about trade, manufacturing, the crisis of mass layoffs or the crumbling of American infrastructure. There is no discussion of jobs programs, labor market policies, overtime pay, or cost-of-living raises. The only mention of wages is to suggest that they ought to be “better”. Worse, Third Way’s insistence that candidates avoid blaming the corporations and the rich – the very group responsible for the broad economic and political crisis – presents a conundrum for would-be Democratic populists: how are they meant to make “the economy” a central talking point, if they don’t have anything to talk about?Blue-collar preferences do seem politically heterodox – progressive on wages and jobs, protectionist on trade, restrictive on immigration, moderate on culture and conservative on the deficit – and it can seem difficult to build a program to suit what seem like conflicting demands. But looked at another way these views add up to a fundamental break with the prevailing economic order. A call to shift society in favor of workers.Yet Third Way’s economic proposals – summed up by the demand for “middle-class tax cuts”– are a last gasp effort at preserving that order. Until, and unless, progressives can campaign in ways that address the root causes of workers’ cultural, social and economic concerns – that is, until the leftcan provide a compelling casefor how to exit the global race to the bottom – the result will be a string of narrow majorities and narrow defeats.Each party taking their turn in office, neither providing a permanent home for the working class.Dustin Guastella is a research associate at the Center for Working Class Politics and the director of operations for Teamsters Local 623.Explore more on these topicsDemocratsOpinionUS politicsUS economyClass issuesInequalitycommentShareReuse this content"

We need reform to save the American university as we know itTue 1 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 13.40 EDTShareLate on Friday evening, the trustees of Columbia University announced that its interim president, Katrina Armstrong, wasleaving her post.Six days earlier, she had convened an emergency meeting with 75 faculty members after the university had cravenlysurrendered to the demands of the Trump administrationin the hopes of recovering $400m in federal grants and contracts. The president and her staff called their predicament “heartbreaking” and sought to reassure faculty that academic freedom and departmental autonomy remained intact.A transcript of the meeting wasleaked. Two days later, the president was “returning to lead” the university’s medical center. She was replaced by a trustee.For a member of the board of trustees to assume leadership of the university, without even the fig leaf of faculty consultation, has never occurred in the 271-year history of Columbia. Unprecedented in its own right, the episode also exposes a deeply worrisome problem of governance in American higher education. This has been building for years, but now the stakes are higher than ever: the very survival of the university as we know it.American universities, in their recent dealings with the federal government – and with their own trustees – have repeatedly shown themselves incapable of preserving the core values of academic freedom and shared governance. This failure has been widely noted, but unasked is who bears responsibility. Who precisely decides to surrender those values, whether at private institutions like Columbia, Harvard or the University of Pennsylvania, or at public ones like the University of North Carolina or the University of Minnesota?The US government’s round-up of student protesters is genuinely shocking | Jameel JafferRead moreThe ultimate decision-maker at colleges and universities is the board of trustees. And these boards, as the explosive events of the past year demonstrate, have serious problems, both in how they are constituted and how they lead. Those committed to the distinctive strengths of the university as a maker, teacher and custodian of knowledge, both old and new, must at long last try to grasp why these boards are failing and figure out how to fix them.Trustees (sometimes called governors, regents, visitors or “members of the corporation”) have a lofty function: to ensure the financial health and stability of the institution, partly through their own donations. This fiduciary responsibility has extended to the recruitment, appointment and retention of the school president, and sometimes of other senior administrators, usually (as at Columbia) with little substantive faculty consultation required by the norms of shared governance. Trustees play an increasingly active role in academic decisions through the levers of cost, donor power and financial austerity. In our fraught times, these levers are in increasing use, especially by the Trump-driven Republican party, to target disciplines, departments and individual professors. Many boards have become political wolves in the guise of fiduciary sheep.Boards of trustees are essentially private clubs, which follow their own, always confidential, norms to determine who is asked to join, who controls key committees, and who is gently persuaded to resign when they do not meet the criteria of the most influential trustees. (In some private institutions, presidents may have a say in who gets selected as trustees, but presidents themselves are appointed by trustees.) At public universities, these boards are directly tied to the powers of state legislatures and administrators and thus are at the mercy of state politics in key matters. At private universities, the club is dominated by heavy hitters in business, law and technology; the number of alumni, academics and students is vanishingly small. These business-oriented trustees (a majority being white and male) treat their board meetings as golf parties; they schmooze, network and discuss deals while going through the motions of discussing university policies and priorities.The most urgent need today, as the Columbia case shows, is to create a new social contract on boards of trusteesWho becomes a trustee? At Columbiathere are 21, all of them from business, law and technology, with the exception of a former journalist. Although they are in charge of an academic institution, none of them is an academic. None has ever led a classroom or a lab meeting or medical rounds with interns. None has gone through the process of tenure, where their teaching, publication record and service are rigorously assessed by colleagues in the field both from within the institution and outside it. None has ever had their work peer-reviewed by anonymous readers or panels of experts. None has ever published in academic or scientific journals or presses and had their ideas debated in the public sphere. None has ever framed a hypothesis and tested it on the basis of evidence they have collected. None, in short, has sought truth and had their search confirmed by objective scholars and scientists.How, we ask, can people be entrusted with running a university when they have no lived experience with or understanding of its core functions and aims? What qualifications do such trustees bring to their office beside the capacity and expectation to donate? And what do those qualifications, which pertain to private profit, have to do with the concerns of scholars and scientists and doctors, which pertain to the public good? Universities are replicating the plutocratic domination of theTrump administration.Is it any wonder, then, that Columbia’s trustees are prepared to ignore the foundational values that constitute a university – academic freedom and shared governance – in order to reach an accommodation with the federal government?The Columbia board is by no means unique. The same situation prevails, with few exceptions, across the Ivy League and its peer institutions (exemplary is theUniversity of Chicago). As far as public universities are concerned, though there are some variations among several of the flagships, such as the regents of the universities of California, Michigan and Wisconsin, they are typically composed of lawyers, politicians and businessmen, and generally appointed by governors of individual states. Their accountability is hard to locate in their charter documents, and their near-autonomous powers are wide-ranging. In these regards, they are very much like their private counterparts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But there is an even more worrisome issue.Boards are accountable to no one– only to themselves, and to some vague set of norms, often unwritten, about their obligations. Accountability is for faculty, administrators and students.Given the remarkable absence of any mechanism for assessing, monitoring or auditing their performance, should we be surprised if trustees bring the most intense political agendas into the heart of the institutions they oversee? With their powerful connections to local, state, and federal agendas and networks, trustees become conduits for politicians and finance-driven values that affect the core life of academic institutions rather than buffers against these forces. (A Penn trustee was accused by the faculty last year of attempting a “hostile takeover” of the university.)The most urgent need today, as the Columbia case shows, is to create a new social contract on boards of trustees, who have become too craven to be watchdogs and too self-interested to be trusted. This change will require hard community-based activism that balances lawyers, hedge fund managers and tech bros with professors, schoolteachers, researchers, scientists and students. For public institutions, this may require legal support, as well as a powerful alliance between communities and state governors. Without such changes in boards of trustees, the current capture of colleges and universities by an unholy alliance of wealthy alumni, rightwing billionaires and bureaucrats is likely to become entrenched.Creating this new social contract will require two crucial steps. The first is to bring the full force of public scrutiny to bear on boards, their membership, their accountability and the checks on their powers. The second is to demand that all academic governing boards both reflect and defend the fundamental values of universities in a liberal democracy: freedom of academic speech, opinion and inquiry; procedural transparency; and demographic diversity.There are many universities left on the government’s hit lists, and before they lose their souls, their boards of trustees must be held to account.Arjun Appadurai, professor emeritus atNew YorkUniversity, is the former provost of the New School.

How we handle him will reveal what kind of country we really areAndrei PopoviciuWe could have a fair, independent process, as justice demands – or buckle under pressure from the US. Frankly, it could go either wayTue 1 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 04.49 EDTShareAturquoiseKoenigsegg Jesko, the world’s fastest car and worth about £2.3m, zipped through central Bucharest at nearly 100mph on Monday 24 March. At the wheel, the self-proclaimed “misogynist” influencer Andrew Tate, exuding an air of invincibility as he sped past the imposing Palace of the Parliament.To the surprise of many Romanians – and to their horror, frankly–Andrew and his brother, Tristan, collectively known as the Tate brothers, hadreturned to Romaniafrom the US as part of their legal obligations in the investigation against them on serious charges of rape, money laundering and human trafficking. The two also face separate charges ofrape and human trafficking in the UK. The two men deny any wrongdoing. Their return made front pages around the world – but this is so much more than a big news story for people here. It is a true test of our political and judicial system at a tense time in our history.Will officials bow down to pressure from the new US administration? What will their handling of the case say about the country we are now?The omens aren’t good. After reporting to a Bucharest police station, as required under the conditions of a recently relaxed travel ban, Andrew Tate told reporters he was“happy” to be back in Romania. Then he declared himself “one of the most important people on the planet” andberated journalistspressing him on whether he planned to stay in the country. Ebullience merged with farce. The flashy return was briefly interrupted when their supercarbroke down, bleeding oil on to the streets and forcing them to tow it to a repair shop. This week, the authorities arereturningmore than a dozen luxury cars they had confiscated during the investigation, while also ordering the Tates to remain under “judicial control” for an extended period, meaning they must check in with Romanian authorities periodically.In Romania, the far right has unleashed a tide of hate and resurrected our fascist ghosts | Andrei PopoviciuRead moreThe return of the Tate brothers follows theirsudden departure last month, when Romanian prosecutors lifted their travel restrictions, allowing them to board a private jet to Florida after spending several months under house arrest. They celebrated their exit online like they had defeated the system itself.But their ability to leave and the return of the cars have raised uncomfortable questions about whether this was a routine legal decision or the result of outside influence. Reports claiming that the Trump administrationhad put pressure on Romanian authoritieshave ignited tense public debate across the country.A prosecutor can unilaterally ease travel restrictions if defendants argue they stand to lose significant money, Augustin Zegrean, a former Romanian constitutional court judge, explained to me. Defendants can – and often do – legally request that prosecutors lift such bans, sometimes for long periods, or alter the conditions of their release. Many who have been granted permission to leave never returned. Still, the Tates did.“I don’t want to believe that we have become such a despicable country that others tell us what to do,” Zegrean told me. He speaks for many.If Washington did lean on Bucharest to ease its restrictions, Romania’s justice system must resist. Being a US ally does not mean bending to pressure – especially not if it undermines the rule of law. To do so sends a dangerous message: justice here is negotiable, a commodity subject to foreign lobbying and backroom deals if you’re rich and influential enough.We can’t have that. This country has spentmore than 35 yearstrying to build democratic institutions and prove it has made efforts to shake off the perception that its institutions are corrupt or politically compromised.If Romania’s justice system wants to maintain any credibility, it must remain independent – not just from Washington, but from any external or political influence. Judges, prosecutors and lawmakers must take the allegations against the Tates seriously, and the government must be independent, not least for the sake of the Tates’ alleged victims. They haveexpressed deep concernabout potential US interference in the judicial process. One of Andrew Tate’s ex-girlfriends recentlyaccusedhim of sexual assault and battery. His lawyer, Joseph McBride, said his client “firmly denies” the claims.Even before the homecoming, this was a moment of extreme political tension in Romania, after the far-right candidateCălin Georgescu, a controversial pro-Russian outsider who claimed to have run a “zero-budget” campaign, unexpectedlywon the first round of the electionin November last year.In December, Romania’sconstitutional court annulled the vote, citing foreign interference. It extended that decision in March when it banned Georgescu fromrunning in the May rerun, citing unconstitutional behaviour, including allegedly plotting a6 January-style insurrectionreminiscent of the one following Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss.View image in fullscreenAndrew Tate is surrounded by media after checking in at a police station in Voluntari, Romania, 24 March 2025.Photograph: Vadim Ghirdă/APA firestorm of criticism from Trump’s sidekicks followed, particularly from Elon Musk and the US vice-president,JD Vance. “If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn’t very strong to begin with,” mocked Vance, whileMusk asked on X: “How can a judge end democracy in Romania?”On 25 March, the US state departmentindefinitely suspendedRomania’s accession to the visa waiver program, which had been approved by the Biden administration and would have permitted Romanians visa-free travel to the US for up to 90 days.It’s an obvious power play, and seems to be working. Last month, Romania’s justice minister, Radu Marinescu, called for a public explanationas to why restrictions were easedto allow the brothers to leave the country. Now he praises the brothers’“correct attitude”in choosing to return and fulfil their legal obligation. His tone seems to have changed. The Tate brothers may enjoy their freedom of movement for now, but much like their multimillion-dollar supercar – left stranded and leaking oil on the streets of Bucharest – the illusion of invincibility can break down when reality overtakes it. Romania’s justice system may bring that to pass. But under pressure, it may break down itself.Andrei Popoviciu is a Romanian investigative journalistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Different iterations of the fabled spring – which is said to give anyone who drinks or bathes in its waters the power to defy ageing – have echoed across cultures for thousands of years.In the modern age, this quest for youthfulness is known as “biohacking” – where individuals take a do-it-yourself approach to enhance their biology, often through supplements – and the latest trend is NAD boosters.Ever since Kendall Jenner and Hailey Biebertook IV drips with NAD in an episode of The Kardashians, influencers on TikTok and Instagram have followed suit, telling their followers NAD boosters will“literally give you the fountain of youth … you will stop ageing in its tracks”, in addition to other claimed benefits such as boosting energy and improving hair, skin and metabolic function.But do any of these claims stack up or are we still in the realm of myth?What is NAD?NAD (also referred to as NAD+ and short for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a naturally occurring molecule involved in more than 500 different reactions in the body, including energy generation, explains Prof Nigel Turner, the head of the Cellular Bioenergetics Laboratory at the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute.Anti-ageing jabs – they can rejuvenate mice, but will they work on humans?Read moreMore recently – in the last 25 years – it has become apparent the molecule also has really critical functions in ageing, Turner says.“The whole hype around the NAD boosting therapies is the fact that there’s pretty good scientific evidence that as we age … the levels of NAD decline, and so the efficiency of all these pathways and reactions within the body declines, because the levels naturally drop with ageing,” Turner says.What does the evidence say?NAD boosting therapies have been marketed in the form of pills, shots and IV infusions. They are selling manufactured supplements of the nicotinamide precursor compounds that can be converted into NAD. The two primary versions marketed are nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide riboside (NR).Prof David Vaux, a molecular biologist and honorary fellow of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, said while a number of labs are promoting them as treatments for ageing, “in my opinion, it’s way too early. I haven’t seen convincing evidence that they prolong life span in animal models, and I certainly wouldn’t take any myself until they’d been proven to work, be safe and efficacious in a properly run, double-blind placebo-controlled human trial.”Turner says while studies in mice and pre-clinical models have shown the replenishment of NAD is associated with changes in the way cells function, better metabolic health and some anti-ageing effects, the evidence of the translation of that research into humans is in its infancy.“What comes through in the limited amount of studies that have been done in humans, is that it appears that giving these supplements to already healthy or relatively healthy people is not going to do too much because your body’s already got enough.”However, of the already limited studies, those that have shown some benefits tend to be in overweight and older populations, where the NAD levels may be compromised a bit more, he says.Quick GuideWhat is your age mindset?ShowScientists have developed various measures to assess people’s perceptions of ageing – which may be evident in many different beliefs. Here are a few examples:1Do things get better, worse or stay the same as you get older?2In each pair of the following words, which one do you associate with retirement and beyond: uninvolved or involved; unable or able; dependent or independent; idle or busy?3When does middle age end and old age begin?If you answered “better” or “the same” on (1) and “involved”, “able”, “independent” and “busy” on (2), you are more likely to experience better health as you age.On question (3), people who believe old age starts at a later point – over 70 years – live longer than people who believe that old age starts at 60 or younger.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.What’s Vegemite got to do with it?The body already has a series of pathways that allow for the constant maintenance or replenishment of the NAD that’s being broken down all the time, including through our diets, Turner says.Vitamin B, specifically vitamin B3 (which is found in Vegemite, among other food sources) is also a precursor, one of these pathways that eventually lead to the formation of NAD, he says.What do the experts think?Vaux stresses that the Therapeutic Goods Administration has two kinds of approval: medicines are either registered (when a drug is proved to be effective for treating certain conditions) or they are listed (which means it is safe but there is no evidence it works). Only the second kind of TGA approval has been given for any NAD boosters, he says, “but the people marketing them don’t make that distinction. They just say ‘approved by the TGA’ and trick people into thinking that they actually work.”‘It’s not ethical and it’s not medical’: how UK rehab clinics are cashing in on NAD+Read moreA/Prof Lindsay Wu runs the Laboratory forAgeingResearch at the University of New South Wales. Wu is also the founder of a company developing NAD precursors and trying to establish efficacy for specific conditions and diseases, as well as safety.“We don’t yet have that data, whether there is truly these massive effects,” Wu says. However, “a lot of the people who are taking these NAD precursors are in fact young, healthy people [or] middle-aged people. The whole concept of doing this is to replace NAD levels when they get low – but fit healthy people don’t need this … Their NAD levels are already going to be very high.”Eating a healthy diet and doing exercise have been associated with boosting NAD levels, Turner says. However, he stresses that the best evidence for promoting longevity comes back to a healthy lifestyle, including not smoking or drinking excessively.“People seem to want to be able to do all of those things and then just take a pill that will overcome it,” he says.“I still hold great hope that [NAD is] going to be a pathway that will have some benefit, but it’s not going to meet the claims that you see online. It’s not going to take a person who’s got grey hair and turns them back into a 20-year-old.”Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporterAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsAsk AntiviralWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

This is devastating news for people whose lives would have been changed by the guideline, such aspregnant women and mothers.The Sentencing Council’s updated “imposition of community and custodial sentences” guideline signalled a change in sentencing. It would have required magistrates and judges to consult a pre-sentence report before deciding whether to imprison someone of an ethnic or religious minority, alongside other groups including young adults, abuse survivors and mothers. It would have taken into account structural disparities in sentencing outcomes, such as thehigh risk of stillbirththat pregnant women face in prison and the damage caused by separating mothers from children. It would also have introduced measures to combat racism in courts. The UN has described our justice system assystemically racist, and a 2017 review conducted by the now minister David Lammy acknowledged its “racial bias”.The guideline was commonsense, evidence-led policy that the Sentencing Council had developed in careful consultation with criminal justice experts. England and Wales are in the grip of a prisons overcrowding crisis, overseen by a prisons minister, James Timpson, who has called for the need to “take politics out of sentencing”. In this context, you would think the government would champion these new changes, which could serve to reduce the women’s prison population in particular.Instead, the lord chancellor, Shabana Mahmood, chose to perform a populist pantomime instigated by the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick. When the Sentencing Council announced the guideline last month, Jenrick labelled it “two-tier justice”. This echoed Tommy Robinson’s “two-tier policing” slogan from last summer’s riots, which claimed that white far-right protesters were treated more harshly than ethnic minorities.View image in fullscreenProtesters outside the Royal Courts of Justice, London, 18 March 2023.Photograph: Elizabeth DalzielJenrick’s ploy to hijack the guideline is not surprising: this is the same man who resigned as immigration minister in 2023 because the Rwanda deportation scheme didn’t “go far enough”. What is truly appalling is that Mahmood decided to play along in an attempt to win over Conservative and Reform UK voters.The number one rule of political communications is that you don’t repeat your opposition’s framing, even to refute it. Repeating the right’s slogans only reinforces its power. Mahmood’s response that “there will never be a two-tier sentencing approach under my watch” was foolish and dangerous. Instead of challenging the dog-whistle slogan, she legitimised it, which then triggered its repetition across the press. When the Sentencing Council stuck to its guns, Mahmood threatened to pass emergency legislation to overrule it. The council, browbeaten, suspended the implementation of the guideline.It is infuriating to see another Labour government seek to appease a rightwing voter base by reinforcing the “tough on crime” doom loop that has gridlocked our justice system for the past 30 years. It was New Labour’s punitive posturing that drove up the prison population by 40% between 1997 and 2010. Feverishly trumpeting law and order, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown collectively introduced more than 3,500 new criminal offences, and courts began to hand down increasingly longer – and indefinite in the case of theIPP scandal– sentences that have directly contributed to the prisons overcrowding crisis we see today. England and Wales have thehighest incarceration ratein western Europe. The statistics are clear: prison creates more problems than it solves.Yet political debates on criminal justice issues are never about the facts; they are opportunities for political parties to score points against each other. This is a trend known as “penal populism”, which the government’s own independent sentencing review has cited as the main driver of our dangerously overcrowded prisons. Political grandstanding on criminal justice is one of Labour’s trademarks, but Mahmood’s readiness to perform on the populist stage is a new low.Janey Starling is the co-director of gender justice campaign group Level UpDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Hear, hear, as the Windsors might sayTue 1 Apr 2025 08.11 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 15.25 EDTShareStraight faces, please, as we try to look charitably at the toxic row engulfing Prince Harry’s charity. Are you up to speed with this everyday story of giving folk? I’m in such a muddle with it all that I can’t remember if I’m allowed to say that purely from my observations of her telly interviews, Sentebalechair Sophie Chandaukadoes seem like a right old loose cannon.But I’m getting ahead of myself, so let’s do a quick recap. Sentebale is a charity to help children and young people with HIV and Aids in Lesotho and Botswana, and wasset up almost two decadesago by Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, in honour of their mothers. Its current chair isChandauka, a Zimbabwean lawyer, and something about her stewardship of the charity has provoked its entire board of trustees to judge that their relationship has broken down irretrievably. Accordingly, they have all resigned. Chandauka in turn has said that the charity was riddled with “poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny [and] misogynoir”, and accused Prince Harry of “harassment and bullying at scale”.Oh dear. As I say, she does seem like quite hard work. Poor Prince Harry. It must be difficult having something you’ve served as a custodian of for a long time, only for some publicity-incontinent member of it to go on a full-spectrum media rampage, airing a load of dirty linen, but leaving you feeling like you have to bite your tongue because you can’t really win against the specific typesof identity-based accusationsthey’re making against you. In fact, saying anything at all will probably just make it all worse and ensure it goes on for much longer. At present, Prince Harry has kept a stiff upper lip and declined to complain or explain, but it’s possible that at some point he’s going to have to offer a concisely delphic statement in an attempt to draw a line under the whole business. Impossible to pluck the perfect phrase out of the air, of course, but I’d go with something like “recollections may vary”.And in case that wasn’t clear, in the interests not of balance, but of accuracy, we do have to state that Prince Harry seems like quite hard work, too.Likewise, his wife.Meanwhile, it goes without saying that despite its brevity, the above paragraph will serve as the twat-signal to the so-called “Sussex Squad”, a hilarious cavalcade of single-issue human beings who patrol the internet round the clock, policing any and all criticism of theMontecito millionaire couplewho ironically need expensive security in part to deal with nutjob fans like them. I mean, I’m paraphrasing, but only vaguely. The Squad also does a lot of other valuable work, like explaining that laughing at Meghan’s ridiculousNetflix lifestyle show is racist.Donors quit Prince Harry’s charity when he left UK, says Sentebale chairRead moreAnyway, because of all this, I did wonder how they would readjust themselves to the Sentebale blow-up, given that at its heart is a black woman making accusations of bullying and racism. Inevitably – and indeed amusingly – there has been a new bending of reality. Humans, particularly single-issue ones, really are so incredibly resourceful, and I’m hugely enjoying the Sussex Squad’s latest mad conspiracy theory: that Sentabale’snewest trustee, Iain Rawlinson, is someone who, between 10 and 20 years ago, served as chair of Prince William’s conservation charity, and consequently CAN ONLY BE a formal plant by Harry’s brother.The theory suggests that Rawlinson is deliberately sabotaging Sentebale and the Sussexes on the orders of the Prince of Wales. (Do I have to even run the denial here? To be clear: I imagine both Iain and the Prince of Wales would rubbish these claims.) Still, it’s some more yarn to pin up across the Squad’s investigation wall, which already resembles one of those webs spun by a spider which has ingested considerable quantities of LSD. (Again, in the interests of running comprehensive denials, I imagine the spider would rubbish that claim, and insist it had taken nothing stronger than a fly.)As for the allegations buzzingaround between the Chandauka and Sussex camps, they are becoming more gothically petty by the day, and you’d expect we haven’t heard the last of them yet. They include, but are by no means limited to: Harry writes high-handed emails; Sophie has done a predictable publicity stunt; Meghan made Sentabale lose agood price on a venue for a polo game; Meghan spent too much timetalking to her friend Serena Williamsat the polo game; Sophie wouldn’t publicly defend Meghan after some impenetrable hokey-cokey about where people were standing on a stage when the trophy for the polo game was handed out.And on it goes. It does seem absolutely mad that there is a charity to help some of the world’s poorest children living with the blight of life-threatening disease, when the true victims in all of this seem to be very senior professional or royal people who simply can’t work with each other without explosive fallouts and worldwide publicity tours. Could there not be a much more worthwhile charity set up to help all these people in positions of power and influence when things go wrong at work, instead of children who – let’s face it – aren’t subject to anything like the same pressures? Call it Sentanexplosiveinterview, and I’m sure the donations would flood right on in.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

One girl raised her hand and asked me: “Why is everything in the shops so expensive?”In just eight words she had encapsulated the mood of the country. She had cut through to the core question that people had on their minds when they went to the polls on 4 July last year. If the question wasn’t “why is everything so expensive?”, it was “why are our pay packets not going as far as they used to?”.The Covid pandemic and war in Ukraine might have pushed up prices, but it was the pure negligence of the Conservatives that squeezed the country’s household finances. They played fast and loose with spending, frittering hard-earned taxpayer money on political gimmicks such as theirfailed Rwanda scheme. Their carelessness came at a cost, most acutely felt by the lowest paid in the country. It was a dereliction of duty that resulted in their legacy being summed up in one statistic: that people were worse off by the end of the government than they were at the beginning.The biggest failure of all was that working people, doing the jobs that keep the country going – in shops, care homes, cafes, as couriers – weren’t earning enough to make ends meet. The system had failed, and something had to change.Last summer, the country made clear that it wanted a government that was on the side of working people. We had made a promise to it that we would deliver a genuine living wage. It was the last Labour government thatintroduced the national minimum wage. It was one of our most transformational policies. A policy that was true to our core: recognising the dignity in secure work – a decent day’s pay for a decent day’s work, opposed, unsurprisingly, by the Conservatives.In October I stood up to deliverthe first Labour budget in 14 years, and made a promise to put more money in working people’s pockets. Today we deliver on that promise by increasing thenational minimum and living wage, a pay rise that will go straight into the pockets of up to three million workers across the country. That’s a pay rise worth an extra £1,400 per year for an eligible full-time worker, and a significant boost that will ease the strain on household finances and finally make work pay. A boost for those in work and those looking for work. A boost for productivity and for the economy as a whole. And a boost – and a pay rise – that is once again dismissedby our opponents.I am in no doubt that there is more to do. That too many people are still struggling with the cost of living or in insecure work. That’s why we’re going further and faster, rolling out breakfast clubs in every primary school to save families £450 per year. It is why we are strengthening the rights of people at work through our employment rights bill. And it is why we are investing in the industries of the future – from life sciences to green energy – to create high-skilled, well-paid jobs in every corner of the country.Today marks a milestone on our most important mission: to put more money in working people’s pockets. This is a changed Labour party showing that we can change Britain. Security at work and renewal for our country, that was our promise and we are getting on with delivering it.Rachel Reeves is the chancellor of the exchequerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But as a fellow Scot, I know the answer isn’t to ‘Englify’ ourselvesTue 1 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 12.49 EDTShareThe worst job I had was in a bank in Sydney, dealing with a life insurance policy called Lite Life Direct. It was tedious, repetitive and oddly stressful, and involved a lot of time on the phone. What made the situation particularly frustrating was that almost no one could understand my Scottish accent.“Lite Life Direct,” I would say, three, sometimes four times down the line to no avail. Then I would cave: “Loight Loif Direct.” With my faux-Australian pronunciation, suddenly me and the caller would be simpatico.This was all the more enraging because I am Australian. I was born in Sydney and spent the early part of my childhood there. My mother and I emigrated from Sydney to Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire. As a child, living in a strange country and desperate to fit in with new schoolmates, I changed my accent unwittingly. But when I returned to my home town as an adult, my adopted accent made me a stranger.Accents are curious and fascinating things. To the listener, they say everything about us and yet absolutely nothing; change some vowel sounds and you can masquerade as an entirely different person. So I feel somesympathy for Gary Caldwell, manager of Exeter City FC, who was sent from the dugout for his behaviour towards the fourth official. The referee found him to be aggressive and showed him a red card.Caldwell, a former Scotland defender and Celtic captain, was not known for such pugnacity when playing north of the border. He puts his newfound rough reputation down to one thing: his Scottish accent. “I didn’t swear, I didn’t run, in my opinion I wasn’t aggressive,”he told the BBC. “My accent and my Scottishness is aggressive.”However,Caldwell suggestshis disciplinary record will improve if he endeavours to sound a little bit more “Englified”. I’d like to know what Caldwell means, exactly, by “Englified”. Soft, seems to be the assertion. Relatable, maybe.To a fellow Scot, Caldwell’s excuse is a nonsense. He’s from douce Stirling. It’s hardly the cut-throat razor tones of a Glasgow East End accent or a guttural Lanarkshire growl, in which a sincere “I love you” sounds more threat than declaration.But it is true that English-to-Scottish accent bias is a problem. Edinburgh University is shortly tohold a conferenceon “linguistic discrimination” to tackle anti-Scottish accent prejudice on campus. The majority of Edinburgh undergraduates – more than 70% – either come from England, the rest of the UK or overseas, while those who went to private school make up 40% of the intake from UK institutions. Scots students report routine snobbery andridicule from classmates.Perceived aggression may be Caldwell’s concern, but it is only one trope. A study last year found that Scots are used in television adverts to depict working-class characters or thosetight with money. Though it could be worse. “If you want somebody to be a little bit thick, West Country accents,” one advertising exec told researchers. “If you want to signify dirty-handed working class, stick a Brummie in it.”This anti-Scots bias in England extends to the arts. One of theall-time great case studiesis that of Gavin Bain and Billy Boyd. The Dundee college students had designs on becoming hip-hop stars but found their fledgling musical careerstymied by their Scottish accents.The lads, mocked by London record company executives, decided topretend to be from Californiaand restyled themselves as hip-hop duo Silibil N’ Brains. The quick death of their Scottish accents resulted in a £100,000 record deal, an MTV appearance and a support slot for Eminem. Sadly, the ruse went awry when Bain and Boyd found keeping up their California twang too onerous and they returned to their Dundonian speech patterns.The English arts scene is, according to many a Scottish creative, a generally hostile space for our accents. ActorAlan Cumming complainedof “insidious and subliminal racism” faced by Scots who work in London, particularly in comparison to the warm welcome afforded in the US. Similarly, the Scottish director Lynne Ramsayreflected: “I always feel as soon as [the English] hear a Scottish accent, they’re backing away.”Caldwell has not done the situation any favours. It’s one thing for others to claim his Scottish accent is perceived as aggressive, but the football manager has gone two steps further by saying his accentisaggressive. Maybe he’s internalised the negative perceptions the English feel against a Scots brogue, but he should set an example and refuse to modify his speech.It’s self-defeating to tackle prejudice by removing the target for discrimination. A Scottish accent’s melody and charm is a beautiful thing. It’s not incumbent on us to change our tongue; it’s on English ears to change the way they listen.Catriona Stewart is a Glasgow-based journalist and broadcaster specialising in politics and home affairsExplore more on these topicsScotlandOpinionLanguagecommentShareReuse this content"

Doubling council tax on holiday homes in England is a sensible, revenue-raising policy for communities in serious needTue 1 Apr 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 08.07 EDTShareShould you have the world’s tiniest violin to hand, prepare to play it. This week, English councils gain the power todouble council tax on second homes, and the holiday-cottage-owning classes are fuming. “Nothing but a racket,” thundered the Daily Telegraph, dismissing a supposedly “vindictive” raid on weekenders that was (gasp) “socialist” to boot.Its Sunday sister paper further tugged on readers’ heartstrings with tales of homeowners who hadinherited a second placesomewhere lovely from their parents, and bridled at being asked to pay a few thousand pounds more a year to keep it in the family. In the Times, a retired barrister who felt forced togive up the seaside padshe had bought in her mother’s native St Davids complained of the tax “destroying generations of community-building”, as though houses sitting empty all winter were the one thing really guaranteed to bring a thriving community together. To which one can only say: people, learn to read a room(s). You’ve certainly got enough of them.A little weekend bolthole by the sea is, of course, the dream for many, but therein lies the clue. It’s a luxury, a nice-to-have, a signifier of good fortune and plenty in a world of such scarcity that millions of people can’t see how they are ever going to own one measly home, never mind two. Shrieking in horror when asked to pay a bit morefor the privilege, at a time when benefits for disabled people are apparently considered a reckless national extravagance, wins roughly as many friends “in the village” as did second-homers stealthily decamping there from Covid-riddled London on the eve of lockdown with a cough.Places where grockles have long rubbed along more or less tolerably for generations with locals who are well aware that they rely on tourism for a living – from the Cotswolds to the Lakes to those Cornish villages where every house seems to have a telltale key safe by the front door – are visibly tipping over into something much more dystopian. One recent survey in Devon found seaside hotspots where more thanthree-quarters of propertieswere holiday homes. That’s no longer really a village in anything but name: more a giant deconstructed hotel complex, offering tourists the chance to scroll through a bewildering choice of holiday rentals every August while working people are forced further and further from where they grew up.View image in fullscreenSince April 2023, local authorities in Wales have had the powers to introduce higher discretionary council tax premiums on second homes and long-term empty properties – up to 300%.Photograph: Phil Rees/Athena PicturesIt is not just buying that has become impossible. Renters live in fear of having to move, because what were once long-term permanent landlords have long switched to more lucrative short lets via Airbnb, leaving precious little on the market. In coastal north Norfolk, whereone in 10 propertiesis a holiday home, thecouncil’s spendingon temporary bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless families has more than quadrupled in five years. Despite all this, nobody is saying peoplecan’thave a second home if they really want one – just that it’s going to cost more, which doesn’t seem enormously outrageous in the circumstances.It is true that the exact purpose of the second-homes tax – whether it’s really about cooling overheated markets and freeing up houses for locals, or more about freeing up some useful money for councils on theverge of going bust– has become suspiciously blurry. In Wales, where the idea was pioneered and billed as an answer to the chronic housing shortage in tourist traps such as Tenby in Pembrokeshire or around the national park in Eryri, thejury is still outon how many first-time buyers it is actively helping on to the ladder. Local estate agents complain of a glut of holiday homes languishing on the market because they are not what locals want: a miniature fisherman’s cottage on the harbour might be charming for a week, but real-life families would rather have a garden and a bus route than a sea view.In Cannes, I saw English councils pander to gilet-wearing property developers – at the cost of their residents | Phineas HarperRead moreBut straight house swaps from out-of-towner to local aren’t the only measure of success, if the money raised from second-homers who decide not to sell up is earmarked for good use. In Gwynedd in Wales, the council has pledged to spend the proceeds raised from its 150% hike in council tax on second homes directly ontackling homelessness. And if taxing weekenders does look to some councils like an easy way of bumping up revenue without actively outraging their own residents, given most of those paying it by definition won’t be local … well, frankly there’s nothing wrong with the idea that putting something back into the community – as second-homers often genuinely say they want to do – should mean more than occasionally popping into the pub.Hampshire has both7,000-odd second-homersin the New Forest and a£312mdeficitin its budget for the education of children with special needs. Dorset council, which is a magnet not only for weekenders but for retirees drawn to its sleepy rural and coastal towns, is struggling with a hefty social care bill and could very much do with the£8m it hopes to raisefrom owners of second homes. It’s only a drop in the ocean of need, but across local government right now every drop counts. This isn’t the politics of envy, but the politics of common sense: one of those rare times when taxes are both the price of living in a civilised society and a small step to a fairer one. That’s enough violins now.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSecond homesOpinionCouncil taxEnglandWalesPropertyLocal governmentHousingcommentShareReuse this content"

The colour washed from her face, and before her filter could kick in she said: “Please don’t.” She corrected herself. “You don’t really want to, do you?” I realised she thought I was unhappy. She thought I regretted it all. She was wrong on both accounts, but I didn’t blame her for coming to such a stark conclusion.That friend was notChappell Roan. But the pop star is being pelted with the internet equivalent of soiled nappies for saying “all [her] friends who have kids are in hell” and “she doesn’t know anyone who’s happy with children at her age”.The Pink Pony Club singer also said on Alex Cooper’s Call Her Daddy podcast that: “I literally have not met anyone [with young kids] who’s happy – anyone who has like light in their eyes, anyone who has slept.”God, what has she done?Chappell Roan: The Giver review – saddle up, there’s a new sheriff in townRead moreBut I owe it to the one person besidesImogen Heapwhose music can put my six-month-old to sleep in the car to mount some sort of defence here. Sure, she might be wrong about the “happy” part. So many parents are knee deep in chaos while being somehow simultaneously over the moon. But if in between winning awards and touring she’s managed a whirlwind trip to her home town, I’m not shocked she’s been left with the thought that her friends with young kids are in hell.I so viscerally remember the fight or flight instinct in my friends’ eyes when I had my first baby and was spiralling. As I whinged, I could see they didn’t get the insane dichotomy that was my postpartum mental state. I was so happy, but so drained. I was elated, but exhausted. I was in love, but crying … again. And I needed to whinge. I would have happily done a Ted Talk on how my kids slept. Those three little dots typing in the mum’s group WhatsApp? Me. There are few things more cathartic for a new parent than a good whinge; an expulsion of what we’re wading through, just to remind ourselves it’s a slog.This could very well be the happiest I’ve ever been. But it’s also tide-marked by moments of absolute, inconceivable hell.Roan’s comments have unsurprisingly made a lot ofmums angry on TikTok. But to me the comments reveal the Grammy-winning artist is simply a good friend who has listened to her friends as they navigate the perils of early parenthood. I so hope she sat on a yoghurt-stained couch while her friends vented about sleepless nights and the cost of blueberries. If she’s been blasted with the timeless tales of parenting – or seen it with her own eyes – and assumed her friends were unhappy, then great. That’s probably an understandable conclusion, even if it might not be the right one. The fact she’s gone a step further and thought “nah, not for me”; well, that’s inspiring.Not only does Roan appear to be a good listener, the comments show a reassuring amount of empathy. Especially for someone who is a role model to young kids. She went on to say she didn’t know why her own parents did it. It took me 29 years – two years longer than Roan at 27 – for the thought to even cross my mind. This is an era where we can and should be able to talk candidly about how tough having kids is; whether you’re a parent or not.I’m four months out from finishing parental leave, and I’m convinced this very well could be the happiest I’ve ever been. But it’s also tide-marked by moments of absolute, inconceivable hell. And the light in my eyes? It wavers from nonexistent to a euphoric glow. The dramatic yo-yos of parenthood feel impossible to describe, but if Chappell ever wants to come over and hear about it, my couch is filthy and waiting.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

To meet these challenges, Labour will finally have to changeTue 1 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 09.51 EDTShareThe prime minister may pretend to “like and respect” Donald Trump, but elsewhere in parliament anti-Americanism is running hot. In a Lords debate on obesity last week, Labour’sLord Brooke suggestedimposing 25% tariffs on “American products which are causing us difficulties – Coca-Cola, Pepsi, KFC, McDonald’s”. The government replied that the US is an “indispensable ally”. That craven attitude may be politic today – right until it fails tomorrow.The outlook for Britain and other countries is bleak. Wednesday is “liberation day”, when Trump’s tariffs will hit a range of goods likely to send global economies tumbling. There is near-zero expectation that Britain’s genuflections will save us from the same punishment as the rest. As for Trump demanding no VAT on US imports to the UK, that’s extorting with menaces a benefit denied to our own producers. Even if kissing the boot did appease, how cheap do we sell national dignity?As this hurricane rages across the Atlantic, the Brexit reset is gathering speed andpublic supportat home, and not just because the Office for Budget Responsibility warned again last week that Brexit is losing us an alarming 15% in EU trade. Before the crucial 19 May EU-UK summit, the signs are good that “the coalition of the willing” is a spirit that flows beyond armies and weapons to trade and youth mobility. Europe rearming doesn’t presage any actual confrontation with Russian armies on the ground, but the symbolism fosters a united front against rogue states to our east and west. Europeans are standing together as guardians of liberal democratic values, as Trump’s McCarthyism-on-speed intimidates institutions, rewrites history and rips up universal principles that value universities, the arts and museums.Look how Trump’s political threats reach all the way into Europe.A letter sentfrom US embassies in Europe last week ordered foreign companies and organisations with US contracts or links to obey Trump’s executive order to “certify that they do not operate any programs promoting DEI” (diversity, equity and inclusion). The French foreign trade ministryreplied brusquelyto that abusive letter: “France and Europe will defend their companies, their consumers and their values.” But many companies are already quietly silencing their environmental, social and governance or DEI schemes for fear of him. The advertising giant WPP is one that hasquietly dropped reference to “DE&I”from its annual report. Nature reports that75% of US scientistsare considering leaving the country as research programmes are axed, fearing the loss of their data and their work. Right across Europe,approval of America is falling. Scientists may not be “huddled masses”, but the land of the free is now this side of the ocean. Though this trust in Europe as freedom’s bastion depends on Europeans not succumbing to sirens of its far-right movements.In Britain the tariffs will land in a harsh week when employers’ national insurance contributions increase, alongside a5% rise in council taxin most places – though a welcome jump in the minimum wage gives3.5 million peoplea well above inflation boost. But Labour supporters are left stricken by that gut-wrenching £5bn cut landing on disabled households. It is only a fraction of the £36bn that Tom Waters of the IFS tells me the Tories cut in all from working age benefitsas they plunged700,000 more children below the poverty line, but that’s almost beside the point. The shock is that a Labour government,a Labour government, would do this. That’s bad timing. As the country and Europe face up to the civilisational threat of naked US thuggery, the values of social justice need defending.As Keir Starmer finds a confident footing in asserting united European principles, Labour needs to rethink its trajectory at home. There the party sits with a stupendous majority, unlikely to be seen again, masters of all it surveys. So long as it doesn’t crash the economy, it has nothing to fear but fear itself. Whatever it does, the old enemy will abuse it. The Telegraph is running out of absurd hyperbole – abyss, Armageddon, apocalypse – to describe “the worst government at the most dangerous possible time”. There’s little to fear from the Tories. Kemi Badenoch’s search for meaning alights unerringly on the wrong side of public opinion: opposing net zero ambitions, praising a flat tax orthinking she’s friends with JD Vance. Fear Nigel Farage? He may have already taken all available Labour voters. The greater risk is losing the disappointed to the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Yet Labour seems too frit to use its untrammelled power.As Trumpism reminds us all that democratic values are in peril, Labour must make urgent repairs in the UK. Speed up genuine reform of the risible Lords. Bring in electoral reform before the system that delivered Labour the least democratic result in history –63% of seats from just 34% of the votes– does the same or worse for some worse party: that has public support. Workers’ rights are a good flagship policy, tilting the balance back from gig economy exploitation: there must be no giving in to intensive lobbying from business. Revise anti-protest laws reminiscent of theTolpuddle martyrera. If Europe is the refuge of freedoms hard-won over the decades, then all countries need to guard against any slippage into Trumpism.Use this exceptional majority to set right a crooked tax system. Unjust council tax has been too politically toxic to touch, leaving Buckingham Palace paying less than a semi in Blackburn. Rebalancing council taxwould cut itfor 70% of people and raise it only for the best-off 30%. Fix those hundreds of tax reliefs, worth billions, which the National Audit Office found completelyuncostedor unchecked for their usefulness. Britain stilltaxes and spendsless than our neighbours. Be brave and issue defence bonds or a levy now, when it’s plain that defence money is needed, as well as funding for social care, the NHS, schools and children. There must be no capitulating to Trump on thedigital service taxthat charges the likes of X, Apple, Meta and Amazon a fair tax on UK profits: that would make Britain lose face as well as money. The public mood is well illustrated by a Lib Dem poster I saw. It shows Elon Musk – “Cutting taxes for him?” – and a schoolchild – “Cutting lunch for her?”“Change”,Labourpromised. All these fixes require Labour to change itself, and to cast aside fear and political strangulation imposed from the top. Labour has little to lose. In these days of deep political mistrust, doing what’s necessary, popular or not, would strike a stronger political note. As Starmer takes Britain into a new closeness with Europe for security and protection, asserting our mutual liberal values is the prime defence against assault from across the Atlantic.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionDonald TrumpTax and spendingTrade policyBrexitElectoral reformcommentShareReuse this content"

A 2018 power-sharing deal between President Salva Kiir and Riek Machar, the first vice-president, put an end to five years of fighting. But last week’s arrest of Mr Machar effectively ended that agreement, his party says. The United Nationswarnsthat his house arrest, along with mounting military clashes and reports of attacks on civilians, has brought a fragile peace closer to collapse, posing a direct threat to millions.The fear is not just of a battle between factions, but ofethnic cleansing and civilian massacres. Political violence in South Sudan has previously descended into intercommunal conflict between the Dinka ethnic group (to which Mr Kiir belongs) and the Nuer (to which Mr Machar belongs).The civil war killed 400,000 people and displaced almost a third of the 11 million population. About two‑thirds live in extreme poverty, and the World Banksaysthat almost all the rest are only one shock away from poverty. Theaxing of US aidand last month’s punishing heatwave have exacerbated this dire situation.The spiralling war in the country’s neighbour, Sudan, had already caused thecollapse of its oil exports, cutting state revenues by about two-thirds and reducing Mr Kiir’s ability to fund his patronage network, as well as resulting in a wave of refugees. Renewed conflict in South Sudan might well merge withthat war. There are suspicions that the Sudanese army may have sent military supplies to Nuer militias, hoping to wrest control of the border area back from its Rapid Support Forces rivals.The rivalry between the president and vice-president never went away. But tensionshave been rising. Elections due to take place last year – which would have been the country’s first national polls – were deferred until 2026. Then, in February, Mr Kiir sacked two other vice-presidents and promoted his adviser Benjamin Bol Mel, who isnow seen as his preferred successor. Some think that the 73-year-old’s priority is keeping Mr Machar from the top spot; others that he hopes disgruntled figures in his own orbit will be unified by turning upon Mr Machar, whom he accuses of trying to depose him.Mr Machar had also accused the army of attacking his forces. Shortly afterwards, the White Army, a Nuer militia aligned with Mr Machar, launched attacks against the country’s army in Upper Nile state. Government counterstrikes, reportedly including theuse of barrel bombs, followed. Several of Mr Machar’s key allies werealso arrested.Uganda, which backs Mr Kiir, recently said it had deployed troops to South Sudan’s capital, Juba, though its governmentdeniesthis. Kenya’s president, William Ruto, is playing a more useful role by attempting to mediate. South Africa and Ethiopia also have a history of interceding, but both are preoccupied at present. The west has shown little interest.The release of Mr Machar, an end to fighting and a recommitment of all parties to the 2018 agreement are needed. Without those steps, the best hope is that the UN peacekeeping force for South Sudan is able to create safe zones to protect civilians. How effective those will prove, if war rages, is hard to say. The African Union’s decision tosend high-level mediatorsis welcome: Mr Ruto cannot fix this problem alone. Others must join him in attempting to end this crisis before it spins out of control.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But This City Is Ours was different, not least because of the number of Scousers on set, theDerry Girlsstar explains. “It wasn’t, like, so serious,” she says. “We had craic off-camera.” However, while it was fun to make the buzzy new BBC crime drama (the female cast members named themselves the Muffia) the end result isn’t fun – although it is gripping. Featuring betrayals, love and a lot of violence, the show stars Sean Bean as a Liverpool drugs boss, while Jackson plays Cheryl Crawford, the wife of one of his underlings.Cheryl is on the periphery, though her voice-of-experience warnings ring loud. “There’s nothing good about our men,” she tells Diana, the partner of a senior gang member. Jackson has lived in Liverpool for a couple of years now – which helped with the accent – and it was a treat to be back in her own bed at the end of a day’s filming. A lot of hair extensions helped with the look. “It was so heavy, so hot, to be under it every day,” she says with a laugh. “Our amazing hair and makeup designer, Adele Firth, really wanted to get the picture across of some girls in Liverpool – they take such pride in themselves. Every occasion is an occasion to really get dolled up.” Jackson found herself intrigued by Cheryl. “I think if, like her, you grow up around these types of people, or they’re adjacent to your family, that can blur the danger for you.”The Irish have a lot of sympathy for other places in the world that have oppressionJackson is speaking from New York, where for the last two weeks she has been rehearsing the off-Broadway comedyIrishtown. After so much TV work, and a small part on the DC superhero filmThe Flash, it feels good to be in the theatre. With film and TV, she says: “You sort of show up ready to go. You’re not working it through together.” The idea of theatre is scary but rewarding: “Being on stage with your cast-mates and being extremely present for cues, because there’s a live audience.”The job that changed Jackson’s life was Derry Girls, the Channel 4 comedy about teenagers in Northern Ireland in the last years of the Troubles. She played the lead, Erin Quinn. The night after it first aired in 2018 – in the days, just about, before streamers and on-demand viewing dominated – Jackson was walking through London on her way to the theatre in which she was appearing in Jez Butterworth’sThe Ferryman, and she was stopped around 10 times by people who recognised her. “I was naive at the time. I just thought that that’s what it was like for everybody after their first TV job. I didn’t realise the gravitas of it.”Was it hard to stay grounded with such early success? “Where I’m from, I don’t think I would ever have the opportunity to be up my own arse, as they say in Derry. I’m aware that being an actor is such a privilege, and also I’m speaking somebody else’s words. I love working with other actors, but I do wholly believe we are like a secondary vehicle to the writers.”Jackson always wanted to be an actor. “I loved hearing adults around me telling stories when I was a kid. A part of Irish culture is storytelling and I knew I really wanted to do it.” The whole family loved films, her grandmother loved theatre, and Jackson was in drama clubs. She describes acting as like an out-of-body experience, which she got hooked on as a child, although it happens less frequently now as an adult. “I loved that feeling of escapism,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘The hair extensions were so heavy, so hot’ … in This City Is Ours.Photograph: James Stack/BBC/Left Bank PicturesJackson is the eldest of three with two younger brothers. The conflict, and British troops, had been like a “backdrop”, she says, “a presence that was always there. We had a barracks at the bottom of our street, an army checkpoint, so it just became day-to-day life.” That was her experience as a child, she points out. “I know it wasn’t like that for the adults around us, but I think everybody did a great job of helping protect us and shield us from the tensions. We would be out playing on the streets and there would be soldiers there. I think my mum always found that really hard. She’s from the south, but we didn’t know any different.”Jackson thinks her generation learned a lot from growing up with it. A child when theGood Friday agreementwas signed, she talks of “the downfalls of division and violence. I definitely think Irish people have a lot of sympathy for other places in the world that have that sort of oppression.”Her parents, who at one time ran a hotel, were always supportive of Jackson’s ambition to become an actor, which fuelled her. “I had this blind faith, and I was always confident, as a child, in myself and what I could do. I think that was bred into me by my parents. It’s sort of crazy looking back on it, but I never thought it wasn’t going to work out.” Even when she was slogging around auditions, it felt “real, even if I was getting a ‘No’ from all those auditions, I still felt like I was getting the opportunity and that it was in reach. I was grateful for it.”View image in fullscreenExaggerated facial expressions … Jackson in Derry Girls.Photograph: Peter Marley/RichesIf there were struggles, they were more internal. Growing up in the 1990s and 2000s, Jackson remembers being bombarded with “diet culture. It was constantly in magazines, calling out celebrities for what size they were, and that definitely had an impact on me and all my friends. It’s something I’ve struggled with. And more so when I did start working in TV – being so aware of yourself and feeling like the world is more responsive to you the thinner you are.”She remembers being on diets “from a really young age. I’m sad for my younger self, and I hope that we’re all moving to a place now where television is more reflective of actual people, so young girls and boys don’t have these hang-ups.” Although she is more concerned with being healthy now, and not getting run down while working, it can still be a struggle. “It’s definitely an inner monologue. I’m trying to learn tools to change that narrative in my head. I do feel like the world’s changing, and I’m just not prepared to be like that any more.”It’s hard to have too much vanity when you’re as gifted in comedy as Jackson is, from her exaggerated facial expressions in Derry Girls, to the hilarious wig (part Joan of Arc, part Shrek’s Lord Farquaad) she wears inThe Decameron, the Netflix comedy in which she plays a medieval servant. “Growing up,” she says, “I never felt like I was the prettiest girl in the room, and I think that’s character-building. If you don’t take yourself seriously, it’s good for you in all aspects of life. You get to play roles where you look glamorous, and those are fun, but there’s something liberating in the parts that are less glamorous.”View image in fullscreen‘I had a wobble going into this play’ … Jackson.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianHer partner, the DJ Denis Sulta, is coming out to New York in a couple of weeks, she says, and surely her mother will be there too – they are often photographed out and about together. “I’m very grateful that we have the relationship that we have. She’s like my accomplice and I just want to spend as much time with her as possible, share all these exciting moments together. I’m sort of amazed at what’s happening around me and amazed at the opportunities I’m getting – and so is my mum.”Jackson’s mum builds her up when she’s nervous, she says, which surprises me because she seems so self-assured. Does she have self-doubt? “Yeah, of course. I think that shows you care and want to learn. I had a lot of doubt going into this play. I had a real wobble of, ‘I’m not as equipped with theatre skills as the rest of the cast.’ It’s humbling to have those moments. I have an amazing cast around me. I’m going to learn a lot from them and I’m going to work as hard as I can.” She still has moments when she thinks she can’t do something. “But,” she says, “it’s such a rewarding feeling when you get to the end of it. I’ve done it.”This City Is Ours is on BBC One and iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV crime dramaDramaDerry GirlsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Director Louise Courvoisier talks about shooting where ‘people are kind of wild’Phil HoadTue 1 Apr 2025 11.10 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 18.02 EDTShareLouise Courvoisier grew up the daughter of farmers in France’s eastern Jura region and, by the time she was 15, was desperate to leave this backwater. So she chose a boarding school 100km away in Besançon that happened to offer a cinema course. “I really needed to get out, for sure,” says the director, now 31. “But after my studies I needed to come back, and I had a new point of view. Leaving let me look at things differently and see what others don’t see. And I think that, without getting that distance on the region, I couldn’t have made this film.”The film in question is Holy Cow, a rough-edged, sharp-tongued but good-hearted tale about one teenager’s quest to make a prize-winning wheel of comté cheese, a Jura speciality. The story appears to be comparable to the likes of The Full Monty or Brassed Off – British underdog comedies that Courvoisier admires for their social conscience.She’s currently trying to get rid of nesting bees in some walls on the farmBut actually it is rawer and more immediate. It is anchored in the predicament of its protagonist, Totone, who is left to provide for his younger sister after their alcoholic father kills himself driving – and the pent-up isolation and frustration of the French countryside press in. Next to Marcel Pagnol nostalgia, the film is a heady huff of diesel oil; its French title, Vingt Dieux, is a local exclamation literally meaning “20 gods!”It was always Courvoisier’s goal to upend the stereotypes visible among what she dismisses as the “annual quota of French rural films”. But bringing a crew into the region to film there was risky. “It was very delicate because people from the Jura are kind of wild, because it’s such a remote region,” she says in a Zoom call, her backdrop the stone wall of the farmhouse she shares with her parents and siblings. “They’re never in contact with people from elsewhere, so there’s this distrust of anything from outside.”Added to that was Holy Cow’s unfiltered approach: it loiters in the sozzled village fetes and demolition derbies that punctuate rural boredom, and focuses on the ne’er-do-wells and marginalised. “I think most people in the region would have preferred if my main character was someone ambitious who takes over a farm and gives a flamboyant image of the countryside,” says Courvoisier. “But instead I decided to talk about those people everyone wants to hide.” In doing so, she joins a recent cadre of French films with a more abrasive and complex take on the countryside, such as those ofAlain Guiraudie, and 2023’s Super-Bourrés (Super Drunk) and Chien de la Casse (Junkyard Dog).View image in fullscreenBest debut award … Louise Courvoisier.Photograph: Arnold Jerocki/WireImageCourvoisier got the Jurassiens onside by involving them as much as possible in the production, most significantly by casting local non-professionals. Lead actor Clément Faveau, whose performance is fantastically irate and determined, is a poultry farm worker in real life. After he initially refused the role, she worked on him until he accepted. “That mixture of violence and fragility that was written on his face, in his eyes, was exactly what I was looking for,” she says. “I think his personality isn’t always easy for him or those around him to handle because he’s really highly strung.”Courvoisier’s attachment to the area isn’t just academic. Like the rest of her family, she divides her time between artistic activities and working on the farm, which produces cereals only using animal labour. With a thick mop of wavy black hair, and wearing a Princeton T-shirt, she has the fresh-faced complexion of someone who doesn’t solely spend their time in editing suites. In mid-March when we talk, the serious labour hasn’t yet begun – but she’s trying to get rid of nesting bees in the walls. “You’re detaching yourself completely from reality when you make cinema,” she says. “So it helps me to have another activity that’s satisfying and concrete.”Furthering the artisanal feel, Courvoisier’s family – her “pack”, as she calls them – were also closely involved with the film. Her parents, who were touring baroque musicians before they were farmers, and one of her brothers composed the score; her other brother and sister did the set design. Despite the artistic background, Courvoisier didn’t have a cinephile upbringing. With the nearest cinema 20km away, the family usually spent DVD evenings in front of commercial Hollywood fodder such as Pirates of the Caribbean and Jaws.A sinner, a killer and a very controversial erection: has director Alain Guiraudie surpassed Stranger By the Lake?Read moreStrangely for a small independent film, blockbusters were what Courvoisier and her cinematographer on Holy Cow often watched for inspiration. Fast and Furious films were a point of reference for the demolition derby scenes. And as a way of getting round the difficulty of filming beds interestingly, she used what she calls the “Magic Mike shot”: a painterly juxtaposition of two lovers’ faces. “My influences aren’t just cinephile or intellectual, but also mainstream,” Courvoisier says. “It’s interesting to work out how certain films attract such large audiences. Even if we’re making something very different, I like to try and have that generosity.”By Jura standards, Holy Cow hit the big time: far surpassing box office expectations, it also earned two César awards, including best debut for Courvoisier. She thinks the film has created an excitement and a sense of pride in seeing the region’s reality up on screen. And she hopes that, by pulling in both urban and rural audiences, it may get the metropolitan networks who control cinema more interested in provincial film-makers and their outlook. In any case, she is staying put. “For now, I have no desire to go elsewhere. I need a mixture of fantasy and real life that I wouldn’t necessarily find outside of the Jura’s borders. It’s my arena of cinema.”Holy Cow is in cinemas in the US and Australia now and released in UK cinemas on 11 AprilExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFranceEuropeFarmingCheesefeaturesShareReuse this content"

For what this is worth, I went with Leo Woodall as Paul, Finn Wolfhard as George, Harry Melling as Ringo and Barry Keoghan as John (though Barry got Ringo in the end). But I like to think that Sam Mendes and his producer Pippa Harris were thinking on more or less the same lines as me. Interestingly, there are no American actors doing Brit accents – just the kind of well-trained British or Irish actors who can fabricate perfect American accents for American roles elsewhere.But wait. No Merseyside actors! Without wishing to get stuck into an identity politics controversy, this could be an issue. So please allow me to suggest a second, concurrent four-film special to run alongside this tetralogy (surely Apple or Netflix can pay for it) which Sam can direct in his spare time, all about four people from the Beatles Cinematic Universe, with a strict Liverpool-only casting rule.Stephen Graham in Jim, the story of Paul McCartney’s dadView image in fullscreenStephen Graham.Photograph: Gavin Bond/The ObserverThere can hardly be a more respected actor anywhere in the world right now thanStephen Graham, who can portray Jim McCartney, father of Paul and Mike (this could be Chris Mason from TV’s Riverdale), a formidable and demanding personality who loved music. This standalone film will show his early manhood playing in a jazz band with Paul’s uncle Jack (played by Paul McGann), his meet-cute with nurse Mary (I’m thinking Amelia Warner) and his encouragement of young Paul – also big scenes such as meeting Princess Margaret (played here by Liverpool actor Emily Fairn) at the premiere of A Hard Day’s Night.Jodie Comer in Mo, the story of Maureen Starkey TigrettView image in fullscreenJodie Comer in The Bikeriders.Photograph: Courtesy of Focus Features/APJodie Comer can pull out the stops here, playing Ringo’s fiery first wife Mo, the convent school-educated manicurist and hairdresser who was a Beatles fan from the Cavern days before she was a Beatles spouse – getting into face-clawing scraps with other jealous Beatles fans. She gets pregnant at 18 and Brian Epstein (a crossover cameo for David Morrissey) arranges for Ringo and Mo to get married. There’s a scene in which Frank Sinatra (played here by Ian Hart) records a special version of The Lady Is a Tramp for Mo’s birthday.David Morrissey in Brian, the story of the Beatles’ troubled manager Brian EpsteinView image in fullscreenBrian Epstein.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesMorrissey can play Brian Epstein, starting in Liverpool where the family had a music shop – and where Jim McCartney once bought a piano (Stephen Graham can have a crossover cameo here).

Before this, a car crash and hospitalisation had meant that he had missed out on introducing Elvis personally on his show and so he was determined to be associated with the Beatles.

One is working class, the other middle class. One is proud of that, the other embarrassed. Between them they like pints, artisan coffee, ballet and meal deals. A folk song about labour will be performed by one while the other will do a French-inspired mime. Which of them feels skint and which is considered carefree?If you’ve begun making assumptions then that’s what Scraps is here to question. Daisy Kennedy and Mia Macleod’s two-hander is a merry-go-round of sketches tussling with class cliches and the cost of living crisis. It’s also about the cost of making a play about these complex issues. The title sums up the ragtag nature of its clowning, dance breaks and DIY multimedia. But it also reflects the fights that break out between the pair and suggests the measly leftovers their generation have been handed by the capitalist machine. Home ownership, job security and what you can buy with an hour’s work at minimum wage are all on the agenda here.Playing versions of themselves, the pair intersperse the routines with rehearsal-esque discussions dissecting them. Is it OK for Mia, who is from Bath, to put on a silly northern accent? Does Daisy make fun of Phoebe Waller-Bridge purely because she’s posh? They pick each other up on different points, going round in circles to satirise strained self-awareness: one daydream of theatrical success ends with them plagued by the hypocrisy of hypothetically sending their imaginary children to private school.View image in fullscreenEat the rich … ScrapsThe pair excel at eat-the-rich lip-syncing using clips such as Rishi Sunak’s reflection on his “mix-and-match” approach to friendships of all classes (“Well, not working class”). Some of the targets are soft and the character comedy scattershot – especially the bros who found an alternative meat company and the vacuous podcast hosts. There are pertinent observations on social comparison and nepotism but the show is strongest when exploring the dynamic between the pair – including what they each gain from the other’s class identity – and could be heightened by focusing more squarely on the impact of Mia’s windfall from a rich uncle. These 75 minutes could be whittled down to a really impactful hour.One of the principal joys is the seemingly innocuous statements that are interrogated to the nth degree, like Mia’s breezy dream to wear a nice frock in a period drama. The early routine in which Daisy endeavours to pronounce the word “nuanced” is a keeper and a beautifully absurd episode arises from a Nigella baked ham recipe.There are no easy answers here but lots of tricky questions in a show that may be scrappy but is sparky and whip-smart too.AtWardrobe theatre, Bristol, until 2 AprilExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreComedy (Stage)Class issuesArts fundingInequalityComedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

On show at St Carthage Hall in Lismore, Waterford, Ireland, the work is a departure from Wermers’ usual interest in the art of “lounging around”. In contrast to her normal languid figures, the subject here is the body when exhausted or taking strenuous exertion.Cruder class dynamics – the contestants were almost by definition down-at-heel and watched by more affluent audiences – hovered in the background of such spectacles. Although they gathered swift momentum as a low-cost form of high-octane, mass entertainment, their exploitations took a toll on their participants and could, in rare cases, lead to injury and death. Dovetailing with the era’s boom in photography and the rise of the American picture magazine, many black and white snapshots attesting to these merciless dancefloors remain in circulation as a sombre archive, showing woozy couples slumped and clutching at each other, holding one another up in the effort to stay in the game and not collapse.The exhausted partners could, on closer inspection, just as well be figures in a boxing match or worn-out raversIn Marathon Dance Relief, Wermers draws from this repository of material (which also spawned a1969 film featuring Jane Fonda) to create both a contemporary update on this phenomenon – a precursor to mainstream reality TV formats such as Survivor, I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!, and even Strictly Come Dancing – and a more timeless monument to vulnerable bodies forced to jostle and perform for others.View image in fullscreenCrude class dynamics … Marathon Dance Relief.Photograph: Nicole WermersIn the form of 10, rectangular grey slabs each featuring a mid-dance couple moulded from air-dried clay and elevated on repurposed bistro tables to create a solid line in the manner of a sculptural frieze, the work combines Wermers’ proficiency in tactile and hand-crafted methods with her fetish for functional objects estranged from their usual utilitarian contexts. Here, the high-shine silver dazzle of a surface more habitually strewn with coffee cups, cigarettes and morning pastries, and folded up to serve as a flat background for a sculptural relief, recalls the artist’s early totem pieces topped with ashtrays; herdouble-ended teaspoonsonce commissioned for the Tate Britain cafe; or her shrewd photographic seriesCroissants and Architecture, which raised the flaky breakfast staple to a worthy artful object.Wermers is best known for her witty sculptural assemblages of bodies out-of-frame or in repose. Balancing voluptuous, plaster-cast female nudes on hotel cleaning carts or stitching feminine fur coats on to industrial steel chairs, her work since the early noughties has provided a sly commentary on the gendered power dynamics that prop up contemporary urban spaces, and the unseen labour shoved into the storage cupboards of art history. Destabilising traditional sculptural models such as the base, pedestal and plinth, a Wermers piece skews perspectives. Often, it will set out to look down on you.View image in fullscreenWermers’ 2015 installation Infrastruktur.Photograph: Anita Russo/Rex ShutterstockShe insists on the streamlined focus of her practice and refuses baggy definitions of her work as being “across media”, emphasising that she is a sculptor first and foremost. Yet she also has a way with words, an ear for a catchy title. Marathon Dance Relief refers both to her new work’s physical format – reminiscent, in some ways, of the classical hangings that ornamented walls in ancient Greece and Rome – and the brief pause or relief granted to the taxed contestants she is tracing, typically 15 minutes every hour, spent on beds summoned to the dancefloor.“Relief” may also evoke the spectator’s moment of expected solace upon entering an exhibition space, but Wermers (as with all her work to date) short-circuits expectations. The piece’s intervention in a former Victorian church hall, complete with a small cluster of stained-glass windows beaming discs of red and blue and yellow coloured light into the building, jars somewhat with the finer details of the delicate clay figures and the urban loucheness of the cafe tables. The work’s positioning on a diagonal axis disrupts the church hall’s traditional harmonious proportions even further, making its curious viewer reassess the arbitrary distinctions between sacred and profane.Marathon Dance Relief’s enlaced, exhausted partners could, on closer inspection, just as well be figures in a boxing match or worn-out, debauched ravers. Not just men and women, some appear as same gender dancers. Their versatility suggests that Wermers’ true subject here is less endurance entertainment competitions than the doomed waltz of the unit of the couple in society more generally, the absolute necessity and disorienting terror of dependency on another person.Classical reliefs traditionally feature robust and triumphal figures in a state of sporting prowess or achievement. This piece, Wermers notes, represents a “dance of failure”. Despite this gamble, we keep watching. We remain hopelessly attached.Marathon Dance Relief is atSt Carthage Hall, Lismore Castle Arts, Lismore, Ireland, until 25 MayExplore more on these topicsArt and designSculptureDanceArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It crowns an arresting arrival toOxford, the city of dreaming spires, the anteater taking its place on this skyline of slender steeples and gurning gargoyles, up there at the summit of the newest – and strangest – spire of them all.“I was thinking, ‘How do you mark Covid in a building?’” says David Kohn, architect of this curious addition to the campus of New College. “We were developing the designs in the middle of the pandemic, when pangolins had been in the limelight for all the wrong reasons.”Near the pangolin, at the top of this striped stone campanile, cling other carved fauna. There’s an octopus, a moth anda golden mole, joining a menagerie of creatures peering from the parapets below, all representing species at risk. “Carvings of animals on buildings used to represent colonial expansion and the novelty of discovery,” says Kohn. “Now, those same animals and territories are under huge pressure.”Climate breakdown and planetary extinction are just two of the many themes threaded through the design ofthe Gradel Quadrangles, a £72m complex of student bedrooms, study space and an auditorium, along with classrooms, an assembly hall and canteen for the adjoining prep school. It is one of the most unusual additions to Oxford’s historic cityscape in living memory, a project as densely packed with meaning and allusion as the medieval quadrangle down the road,where New College first beganin the 1300s.View image in fullscreenClinging on … a pangolin carved by stone mason Fergus Wessel.Photograph: Will PryceCurving its way between a trio of existing Edwardian villas, on a leafy site at the southern fringes of suburban north Oxford, the student flats are a sinuous stone snake of a thing. The curvaceous horseshoe-shaped block wraps around mature trees, framing three new quads, topped with an undulating roof of metal tiles. The eaves billow and bulge as they writhe across the site, culminating in a jaunty arched gatehouse, where the fluted tower rises 21 metres to a curlicued crown. With its rhubarb and custard-coloured stonework, laid in harlequin diamond patterns, its bulbous roof of polygonal scales, and rows of carved creatures, it is a fruity eyeful to behold.“It has been a bit of a Marmite building,” admits the warden of New College, Miles Young, a former ad man who used to head up the global branding giant, Ogilvy and Mather. He is sitting in his panelled study, where carved devils stare down from the ceiling, and stone gargoyles leer from the chapel outside. “When people first saw it, they couldn’t describe it. And if people can’t describe something, they become very uncomfortable.”I ask Kohn how he would describe his building. Pangolin postmodern? Serpentine baroque? “I’m interested in architecture that is open to interpretation and can tell many stories,” he says. Along with tales of pangolins and the pandemic, he talks of how a window at the top of the tower is shaped like proscenium curtains being drawn back, to frame views over the city. Other diamond-shaped windows allude toMelnikov Housein Moscow, a seminal project of the Soviet avant garde.He refers to an essay by Nikolaus Pevsner, written in the 1960s, on“picturesque planning”, in which the historian uses Oxford to illustrate how buildings can animate the streetscape, providing moments of surprise and delight. “It’s a scenographic approach, playing with distance, middle and foreground,” he says. “There’s a sense of theatre to it all.”Kohn was a brave choice for the 646-year-old New College. At the time ofthe design competition in 2015– when he was pitted against the likes of Japanese star Kengo Kuma and several established British firms – he had barely built a thing. In the years since, he has carved out a niche as one of the more distinctive voices in the often beige British architecture scene, revelling in the use of colour, ornament and fun.View image in fullscreenChubby and oversized … the new quadrangle.Photograph: Will PryceHis studios for theGreenwich design districtare a PoMo riot of green glazing bars, plump brick columns and recessed niches for statues. HisRed Housein rural Dorset won the RIBA house of the year in 2022, praised for its “playful eccentricity”. For some, it’s all too outre, veering beyond the bounds of good taste, but the world is better off for his wit.At New College, previous attempts to develop the site had hit the buffers of decorum. There had been a pompously inflated plan in the 1990s, drawn up by one of King Charles’s favourites,Léon Krier. “It looked as if it came out of Nuremberg in the 1930s,” says Young. “We wanted something original, not pastiche.” He cites what he calls “the only two really original buildings in Oxford” – namelyEdwin Lutyens’ Campion HallandWilliam Butterfield’s Keble college. “They are striking intrusions, without being disrespectful. We hope we have now added a third.”Historic England certainly thinks so. In a rare moment of enthusiasm for novelty, its officers declared that Kohn’s design would “bring joy to all those who experienced it”. Oxford’s design review panel even encouraged the architect to make his tower taller, adding to the rhythm created by those of Harris Manchester and Mansfield colleges along the street.View image in fullscreenEchoes of Middle-earth … the rollercoaster roofline.Photograph: Will PryceClinching the competition, Kohn flatteringly drew on New College’s history of “firsts” in his proposal. The venerable institution lays claim to the first purpose-built quad, conceived by its founder William of Wykeham in 1379, a fortified monastic block, its crenelated parapet marking a firm boundary between town and gown. It also boasts the first open-sided courtyard, Garden Quad, finished in 1708 by William Byrd.“I became fascinated by the glacial pace of how the college evolves,” says Kohn. “They build a big project every couple of hundred years, and each phase represents a kind of opening up to the city, gradually embracing the outside world.” His contribution to the half millennium of innovation? Oxford’s first ever curved quad – and the first to channel Tolkien and Gaudí.Entering through the jaunty arched gateway of the porters’ lodge, shaped like a Japanese moon bridge, you find yourself in a world that has the cartoonish, fairytale air of aMiyazaki film. Everything is chubby and a bit oversized, with huge picture windows drifting unevenly across the facades, and mansards and portholes poking through the eaves. Inside, spiral staircases lead to curved corridors of en suite bedrooms and big shared kitchens. The top floor rooms enjoy mezzanine bed platforms, housed beneath the rollercoaster roofline, while ceilings sprayed with fluffy acoustic insulation add to the hallucinatory sense that you might have been swallowed into the belly of a cuddly toy.The students seem delighted with their weird new digs, praising the bright shared study space downstairs and the performance venue buried in the basement. Another sweeping staircase leads to an underground domed rotunda, illuminated by a dangling halo of lights, where mustard yellow walls frame the entrance to a recital hall. The 105-seat auditorium, designed with theatre experts Charcoalblue, is lined with crenelated wooden panelling, another playful allusion to the medieval quad.View image in fullscreenThe students are delighted … a shared kitchen.Photograph: Will PryceFacilities for the adjoining prep school are equally theatrical, with an assembly hall housed in the bulging roof, where the soffit plunges down towards the stage, as if struck by an asteroid. It is fittingly built on the site of the hall where Tolkien first permitted the Hobbit to be performed as a musical in the 1960s, perhaps explaining why the whole place has echoes of Middle-earth. Was that a student, or Bilbo Baggins, peeping from a porthole?If the project has a weakness, it is that the stagey formal gestures sometimes trump functionality. The tower makes a striking marker for the college, and it provides a distinctive home for theGradel Institute of Charity, named, like the quadrangles, after the alumnus-donor hedge fund manager, Chris Gradel. But inside, it turns out to be a bit of a folly, housing a single small office per floor, with the rest of the trefoil-shaped plan taken up by a staircase and lift.The quality of the stonework – by Grants of Shoreditch in London, with carvings by Fergus Wessel – is impeccable. But the interiors betray the design-and-build nature of the construction contract, with clunky handrails and odd junctions giving off a cheaper air than you would expect from the budget. The roof is also clumsy: its reptilian metal plates shimmer from a distance but, up close, they meet at odd angles with yawning gaps, greeting the parapet in ragged rows, like broken teeth. The jarring look of Gaudí-by-algorithm is the result of a design change during construction, when the planned concrete roof was switched to a timber structure – an admirable carbon-saving effort, but one that came with unintended consequences.Still, in the long term, these are small niggles for a project that should otherwise stand the test of time. It is a gutsy contribution to the college that gleefully pushes the limits of its founder’s motto: “Manners makyth man.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureUniversity of OxfordOxfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This interview might change that…Tue 1 Apr 2025 05.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 1 Apr 2025 05.37 EDTShareIn December 1978, Marie Pierre was at No 1 in the UK reggae chart with the lovers rock classic Walk Away, a beautiful tearstained lament on a troubled relationship. Her 1979 debut album Love Affair, powered by another enduring scene song in Choose Me, remained one of Trojan’s best-selling albums well into the 1980s; Pierre, with her crystalline multi-octave voice, seemed destined to follow her contemporary, Silly Games singer Janet Kay, into mainstream pop-reggae success.But in the 46 years since, Pierre has never released another album. A career that promised so much has – despite TV work and successful backing singing gigs with Robert Plant, Donna Summer and Chaka Khan – been one of frustration and thwarted ambition. Misfortune, mistrust and mistreatment, personal and professional, have sidelined her. “I feel as though I’ve been in chains,” she says on a video call. “I’ve been anchored for no good reason.”Pierre (born Marilyn, and now spelling her name Mari’) grew up in Clapham in south London, one of six siblings. Her parents had moved from Guyana in the 1950s, where her “quite strict but lovingly strict” father had been a well-known musician and tap dancer under the stage name Little George. Pierre’s career started without his knowledge: “He felt I was still of a tender age and knew what the music industry might expose me to.”When she was 14, her boyfriend Syd – her soon-to-be husband, whom she had met on the bus in a game of truth or dare – came to pick her up for a date. He was impressed when he heard her singing in the bath. “I didn’t realise he was in the house,” Pierre laughs. “Once we went out, he said: ‘I’ve got to introduce you to my sister’s boyfriend, because he has a band, and they rehearse in a basement.” The sister’s boyfriend was Dennis Bovell, still at school himself but starting the road to his illustrious career as a reggae and dub pioneer with his first band, Matumbi. Bovell became an important figure in Pierre’s life: a musical teacher who “was like a big brother”.Marie Pierre: Walk Away – video“She was like family – very close and very dear to me,” says Bovell. “And she’s always been a very powerful singer.” Pierre would sneak into Bovell’s all-boys school in disguise to lay down tracks in the school studio, including her first key song Cry, released under the name Angelique. “He got me a hat and a jacket and some trousers,” she says. “Nobody knew that I was a girl. He did say to me: ‘Don’t open your mouth!’ We had a good rapport. He got me and I got him. He stretched me: I couldn’t sing like that before him. He protected me, and I felt secure around him.”Pierre was gaining confidence. After a spell rehearsing with Billy Ocean above a bingo hall in Dalston, east London (“Billy used to see me home and stay for dinner – he loved my mum’s cooking”) she joined three-piece vocal group Super Pack, who played American army bases in the UK with the Stylistics and Fontella Bass and spent two years performing in Switzerland. By the time she returned home, she had married Syd: “We were best friends, young sweethearts.” But all wasn’t well. Pierre wrote Walk Away after a fight: Syd had stormed out, leaving her at home with their baby, and she was watching a Bette Davis film. “And she said something that just resonated with me: ‘You were the cause of all of my tears but you never wiped one of them away.’” She scribbled down the lyric, came up with a melody and took it to Bovell, who in turn took Pierre to Trojan Records. “I envisioned it as a soul song. But Dennis converted it to lovers rock.”Bovell was helping pioneer the lovers rock sound, a gentler, more romantic take on British reggae. Love Affair, now enjoying a new reissue for the first time in 30 years, is still considered one of the genre’s high points; Pierre co-wrote several songs to go with Bovell’s tracks and lush production. “A great record”, says Bovell. As the title suggests, many songs are not about romance but infidelity: Syd had had an affair. “They’re all based on true stories,” Pierre says. “[The affair] was damaging, because she was my best friend. I’m no longer sorry. It’s all wisdom. If you don’t live it, you’ll never know it.” Did Syd ever hear the songs? “Oh, he knew, yeah. There was the big guilt trip. But once bitten, twice shy.”Even before the album’s release, issues mounted. Pierre says she was not properly credited by Bovell for some tracks on Love Affair; Bovell says that isn’t true. Pierre says she was also refused permission to release material she had recorded at about the same time: “Everyone was earning theirs, but I was sitting on the sideline faithfully waiting.”Bovell counters: “If they weren’t released, it was because they weren’t ready.”What is clear is that parts of the lovers rock scene itself didn’t treat Pierre well: lacking support and taken advantage of, she has been ripped off by promotors over the years. “At one point she said: why am I doing this?” says Bovell.View image in fullscreenMari’ Pierre: ‘I’m back on the horse.’Photograph: Courtesy: Marie PierreAnd with Bovell’s eclectic career taking off as he worked with a host of artists such as the Pop Group and the Slits, it left Pierre somewhat lost without her mentor. “I just felt that I couldn’t work with anybody else but him,” she says. “Because I trusted him implicitly.”“We kind of grew apart,” Bovell says, admitting that even though he took Pierre to play shows in the US and Japan, he became too busy to record with her. “She didn’t particularly want to work with other producers. And I couldn’t just work with her alone – I had to go and get my career.”The situation knocked not so much Pierre’s confidence, but her trust in the industry. “I haven’t really had any faith in anybody else since,” she says. That goes for romantic relationships, too. She calls Syd: “My first love, and my last. I’ve been out and dated. But wisdom has taught me I don’t want the extra baggage.”After some failed collaborations, Pierre took to backing singing and TV work in the 1980s, including singing the theme tune to Channel 4’s popular sitcom Desmond’s. She also performed gigs as Damaged Daughters, a three-piece that included the 80s soul singer Princess. There were frequent gigs as in-house singer on The Terry Wogan Show and Channel 4’s Club X, where she sang with Donna Summer, Chaka Khan and Randy Crawford.Most notably, she sang on Robert Plant’s 1988 album Now and Zen. She didn’t know who Plant was when she got the call, but did such a good job that Plant sent her a platinum disc as a thank you. “It’s proudly hanging on my wall. And I felt more humbled and well received getting that from Robert Plant because all the years I’ve been in the business, I haven’t received that recognition from my own.”By the time she finished a 12-year run fronting Supremes tribute act the SOS Band, she was disillusioned again, and her only shows over the last decade have been lovers rock reunion nights. “But it’s not what I really want to do. I could be doing that and earning, but why? Unless I’ve got new material?” Pierre has a positive disposition – “I don’t get consumed with bad feelings or malice” – but everything has clearly taken a toll. “I felt those knocks,” she says. “I feel that happiness or joy is only for a moment, because you don’t know who’s waiting around the corner to steal that from you.” She also suffers from arthritis, and is going through an emotionally painful, costly, lengthy probate dispute with some family members. “It’s affecting my creativity. I’m not finding the joy in life.”UK reggae pioneers Steel Pulse: ‘We told punk fans – you can pogo, but please don’t spit at us’Read moreBut it might not be too late. Days later, Pierre rings me to say our interview “just made me think, well, let’s do this”. She contacted Bovell; not only did they “have a heart to heart”, he sent her some tracks, old and new, to work on with a view to releasing an EP.“Because we’re like a family, we can start as we desire,” Bovell says. “I’ve invited her to do her lyrical magic, because she does come with some really good lyrics.” Pierre also got in touch with some old connections: they are planning to go into the studio in the spring. “All I had to do was contact certain people, and, boy, were they ready to go.” She sounds so happy. “So, it’s not the end of Mari’ Pierre,” she says. “I’m back on the horse and willing to ride!”The reissue of Love Affair is out now on Cherry RedExplore more on these topicsReggaePop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Excessive proceeds will generate a tax form that may result in additional taxes for the seller. The rule change stems from legislation in the early months of theBiden administrationthat was phased in to take effect in 2023.It also orders the Federal Trade Commission to work with the attorney general to ensure that competition laws are appropriately enforced and to ensure “price transparency at all stages of the ticket-purchase process”.“Ticket scalpers use bots and other unfair means to acquire large quantities of face-value tickets, then re-sell them at an enormous markup on the secondary market, price-gouging consumers and depriving fans of the opportunity to see their favorite artists without incurring extraordinary expenses,” the fact sheet said, citing reports that some American consumers have paid as much as “70 times the face value of a ticket price to obtain a ticket”.“I didn’t know too much about it, but I checked it out, and this is a big problem,” Trump said during the signing.The issue has been bubbling for years, after several high-profile controversies that have forced fans to pay soaring prices for the chance to see their favorite artists. Perhaps most famously was the debacle surrounding Taylor Swift’s Eras tour sale, which prompted a Senate hearing on the matter and an antitrust probe by the Biden administration.The justice department under Biden eventuallysuedTicketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, accusing the concert promotion and live ticketing giant of operating an “illegal monopoly” that thwarts competition in markets across and drives up the cost of tickets.In the Oval Office on Monday, Kid Rock – wearing a bright red, sparkly rhinestone-studded suit emblazoned with images of the American flag, eagles and stars – noted the cross-partisan appeal of tackling this problem and saidTicketmasterwas “on board” with the change.“I want the fans to have fair ticket prices,” he said. “There’s plenty of money to go around.

The musician then quipped that he was “overpaid” and would rather be “a hero to working-class people” by offering lower-priced tickets to his fans: “I can’t control that right now.”In a statement, Live Nation said it supported the order and “any meaningful resale reforms”, including strengthening enforcement of the 2016 Bots Act, which outlaws the use of bots to purchase tickets and resell them at inflated prices, and caps on resale prices.“Scalpers and bots prevent fans from getting tickets at the prices artists set, and we thank President Trump for taking them head-on,” it said.During the signing ceremony, Trump took a range of questions, many from friendly news outlets, including one from a reporter who asked if the president would ever wear Kid Rock’s red jacket with the American flag motif. (Trump said he was “not sure” he would.) After the lengthy session, Trump realized he hadn’t signed the order yet and quickly scrawled his name in black pen.“You better do well with this,” Trump told Kid Rock, handing him the order. The musician laughed, hoisted up the Sharpie-signed order and declared: “Make America Fun Again.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsTicketmasternewsShareReuse this content"

The film is estimated to have cost $72m to produce, but shelving it allowed Warner Bros to take an estimated $30m tax write-down.The Batgirl you’ll never see: why some films disappear for everRead moreAt the time, Warner Bros called the decision “difficult” and thanked the cast and crew for their work. But the tactic, which followed a change in leadership at Warner Bros after the outbreak of Covid-19,also resulted in an almost completed $90m Batgirl filmand an animated Scooby Doo film being shelved, decisions that were widely disparaged by creatives and fans alike.The film’s star, Forte, called the decision “fucking bullshit”,saying in an interview in February: “It is such a delightful movie. It deserves so much better … it makes my blood boil and thank you for asking me about it because I like talking about the movie.”Oscar-winning film-makers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller saw a screening and described the film as “funny, charming, good physical comedy timing, with a surprising amount of heart”. “I hope several studios go after it so the world can see all the good work people did,”Miller tweeted.Writer-director Brian Duffield also tweeted at the time: “I have seen this movie and it is excellent. It also tested in the high 90s repeatedly. It also had interested buyers. The people working at Warner Bros are anti-art and I hope multiple anvils drop on their heads.”Directed by Dave Green and based on a 1990 New Yorker article by Ian Frazier, Coyote vs Acme follows Wile E Coyote in a lawsuit against Acme Corporation for the many faulty products that failed to catch him the Road Runner. Forte plays Wile E Coyote’s “billboard lawyer” Kevin Avery, who must face off in court against Acme’s intimidating lawyer, played by Cena, who also happens to be his former boss.The film was reportedly test-screened to positive responses before Warner Bros shelved it, withDeadlinereporting at the time that it had scored 14 points above the norm for a family movie.Gareth West, chief executive of Ketchup Entertainment, said the company was “thrilled” by the newdeal, calling Coyote vs Acme “a perfect blend of nostalgia and modern storytelling, capturing the essence of the beloved Looney Tunes characters while introducing them to a new generation”.Ketchup, a distribution company launched in 2012, also recently released another Looney Tunes film jettisoned by Warner Bros – The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie. In three weeks of release, it has grossed US$8.2m in domestic ticket sales.Explore more on these topicsWarner BrosAnimation in filmnewsShareReuse this content"

It might be a twisted spin on Richard Curtis’sFour Weddings and a Funeralexcept the focus is not on a happy family of friends but on the dysfunctional Henderson brood.Eric Henderson, a less than perfect father, dies just before he can tie the knot with his third wife, leaving his children, his ex and the arriving guests in a room filled with bows and balloons.There is his eldest, Laura (Andrea Valls), a new mother cum human rights lawyer who looks more like a Chelsea Sloane and speaks to her hen-pecked husband Charles (Tom Kanji) as if he were an incompetent PA; middle-child Simon (Jonny Weldon), a 35-year-old hypochondriac; and the youngest, Elle (Day), an actor who has made it to Hollywood.They are joined by their less than perfect mother, Esther (Amanda Abbington), to deal with grief, anger over the past and a surprise.It is a spiky scenario but comes – like Curtis’s film – with too many soft edges. Under the direction of Hannah Price, a talented cast is assembled but underused. Abbington is a potent presence but her character, for too long, is given functional lines, flitting on and off stage. Weldon, also a comedian, is entertaining but his character is at the centre of a revelation that is not dealt with in any depth.View image in fullscreenSibling rivalries … Rosie Day, Jonny Weldon and Andrea Valls in (This Is Not a) Happy RoomThe sibling relationships capture crabbiness and switch sweetly to camaraderie but do not reach below the surface of their testiness. A forgetful great-aunt is chucked into the mix for comic effect and so is – conveniently – a psychologist who duly analyses this family. The balance between comedy and darkness tips unevenly to lightness.The theme of toxic family inheritance is an onerous one that has been expertly explored across the ages, from the canonical plays of Tennessee Williams toBeth Steel’s dysfunctional family wedding in Till the Stars Come Down. That legacy hangs heavily over this offering. Day’s writing is sprightly but does not bring enough true conflict or emotional complication. The reference toPhilip Larkin’s poem on family dysfunctionseems too handy, the script’s reflections on mortality too passing. So the play becomes the sum of its wisecracks.A reckoning between Esther and Laura at the end contains a charge missing from the rest of the play. It is the first time the drama’s veneer cracks open to reveal something deeper and more painful beneath.AtKing’s Head theatre, London, until 27 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreAmanda AbbingtonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Welcome to the wholesome 1950s nostalgia of the Sylvanian Families brand. And while other adaptations of toy franchises whack the audience over the head with irony, skateboards and smart alec gags, this film based on the fuzzy woodland creatures stays firmly on-message. It’s very sweet, slightly dull, and such a throwback that if you stumbled across it on a streaming platform you’d be forgiven for thinking it was made in the 1970s.‘Will Freya find a lovely birthday gift for mummy?’: why the Sylvanian Families movie is the anti-BarbieRead moreIt’s set in the bucolically blissful land of Sylvania (though one character pronounces it “Syl-van-ia” so perhaps we’ve all been saying it wrong for years), where bunny Freya is on a mission. It’s her mum’s birthday and Freya wants to give her the perfect present. Each of the film’s chapters takes Freya on a little adventure: first she gets carried off in an autumnal gust while picking flowers to decorate a hat, then she attempts to make her mum a trumpet. The basic animation struggles to get across the highs and low of Freya’s odyssey – it’s such a faithful adaptation the characters look identical to the figures with black bead eyes, and blank faces.Everything is in fact much less adorable than it should be. And even with a cake-baking dad, it’s riddled with gender cliches (the mums all wear pinnies). I can think of a half a dozen shows for under-sixes that do kind gentle and delightful with more fun and whimsy, though it would probably work best for very young children who feel scared by the suspense in most movies. The slo-oo-ow, gentle voice-acting may also have a Temazepam-like effect on parents in need of a 60-minute shut-eye.Sylvanian Families: The Movie is in UK and Irish cinemas from 4 April and Australian cinemas from 8 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFamily filmsToysreviewsShareReuse this content"

The 1980s-90s franchise still holds much affection, cropping up in a forthcomingStranger Thingshomage spin-off,Heroes and Monsters, for one.A new Pushkin Children’s reboot features six pacy titles by one of the most prolific original authors in the series, the lateRA Montgomery: romps such asThe Abominable Snowman, which has 28 possible endings, andJourney Under the Sea. The hope is to lure children back into their imaginations.The concept is brought up to date for our anxious times in Helen Rutter’sThe Boy With Big Decisions(Scholastic). Fred’s helicopter parents run his life, but how long can he go on being a doormat, suppressing his interest in art? On his first day of secondary school , Fred could take the bus to his father’s old alma mater, or he could board one to the lovely school his parents rejected. Less gung ho than the originals, this multi-stranded book nonetheless deal in real-life high stakes.View image in fullscreenJessie Burton, author of Hidden Treasure.Photograph: Lara DownieAnthony McGowan won the Carnegie Medal in 2020 for the climax of his last series,Lark(2019).The Beck(Barrington Stoke) is a new standalone story in an urban setting. Kyle’s grouchy, widowed grandfather lives in Leeds with a newly adopted three-legged dog called Rude Word.But he’s got something else to show Kyle – a stream, or beck, at the bottom of his garden, unprepossessing but home to crayfish and threatened by developers. Kyle has headaches of his own: a poorly mother; emboldened school bullies. When disaster strikes, Kyle must guess and execute his grandad’s cunning plan. The unexpected help of an unlikely ally at the 11th hour speaks to ordinary people’s willingness to do a good turn.I adored Pádraig Kenny’s 2020 book,The Monsters of Rookhaven. His latest is set in a bleak, not-too-distant future in which a tech bro’s sentient machines have turned on their creators. InAfter(Walker), orphaned Jen is looked after by Father, whose “mek” nature must be kept secret lest he be set upon by vengeful survivors; cue shades of C-3PO andBlade Runner. When Jen and Father find asylum in a self-sustaining community, Jen gradually realises that all is not as it seems. In a nail-biting series of plot twists, human and droid loyalties are tested.View image in fullscreen‘Densely packed with sensory details’: Hiba Noor Khan’s The Line They Drew Through Us.Illustration: Hazem AsifThe past, meanwhile, is still alive. InThe Line They Drew Through Us(Andersen), Hiba Noor Khan attempts to convey the enormity of the 1947 partition of India through the fates of three close friends, Jahan, Ravi and Aisha (known as Lakshmi – a Hindu nickname, despite her being Muslim). In a book densely packed with sensory details – food, smells, music, dread – the children bravely foil a deadly riot but can’t outrun history itself. The novel’s central thrusts remain current: that religious and ethnic groups are pitted against each other by the powers that be; that hope and friendship matter.The Thames features inMiniaturistauthorJessie Burton’s third book for children,Hidden Treasure(Bloomsbury), one of two London river novels laced with fantastical elements. While mudlarking, Bo Delafort finds a dazzling, moon-shaped jewel. She could sell it, but the jewel seems to possess strange powers. Bo quickly learns that a desperate man is after it. With the help of her new friend Billy, Bo sets out to decipher old river ballads about the jewel, only to learn of her brother’s death in the first world war. Could the Eclipsing Moon truly bring back the dead?Mudlarks are also on hand to help the plucky Cassia Thorne, the heroine of Zohra Nabi’s new series. InDeep Dark(Simon & Schuster), London’s street urchins are going missing and no one cares – apart from the children’s families, Cassia and her unlikely ally Felix, who together uncover a plot that stretches from the river to the most distant reaches of empire.Nabi’s book is an assured mix of impeccably researched reality – from thieves’ cant to Bartholomew Fair – and supernatural dread. There really is a monster for Cassia to turn and face – one that is, from the grownup view at least, an avatar for the cruelty visited by the greedy and powerful upon the powerless.To order any of these books for a special price click on the titles or go toguardianbookshop.com.

It is adapted from a novella byauthor and screenwriter Jean-Claude Grumberg(who collaborated with Truffaut on The Last Metro), whose own father was murdered in the Nazi death camps.The late Jean-Louis Trintignant has his final credit as the narrator, introducing us to scenes that could, at first glance, be from the Brothers Grimm. We see a dense central European forest … through which a second world war Nazi train is seen speeding through, carrying terrified Jews to Auschwitz. One man, with a wife, young child and a baby makes a desperate decision to throw his baby out on to the snowy hillside in the hope that someone finds it – and someone does.A poor woodcutter’s wife (voiced by Dominique Blanc), in agony after the death of her own child, rescues the baby and brings it home where her grumpy old husband (voiced by Grégory Gadebois) is initially suspicious and filled with antisemitic loathing, having evidently guessed what has happened. (The plausibility of his having guessed this is perhaps the least of the film’s narrative issues.) But just as his old heart is melted by the adorable baby, the anti-Semites close in.The movie is topped off by a twist-ending postwar coda whose enigmatic quality the film whimsically complicates by getting the narrator to announce that yes, this is fiction, and far-fetched fiction at that, but there are plenty of deniers out there who claim that theHolocaustis fiction as well. It’s a strange, muddled equivalence and an odd juxtaposition. The existence of Holocaust deniers does not itself justify a fiction contrived around the Holocaust. This is a rather sentimental bucolic tale, featuring sweet little cartoon birds and rabbits – and the real horror of Nazi death camps. Yet the rebuke to the fascists is sincere enough.The Most Precious of Cargoes is in UK and Irish cinemas from 4 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsSecond world warHolocaustFilm adaptationsMichel HazanaviciusAnimation in filmreviewsShareReuse this content"

The story starts with Anne (Synnove Karlsen, outstanding in a demanding yet slightly underwritten role) waking from a frightening dream and going to join her boyfriend Patrick (Luke Norris) for dinner with another couple, Ryan (George Bukhari) and Jessica (Tessa Parr). The snappy banter between the foursome, which instantly and economically establishes that Patrick is an outright asshole who doesn’t deserve quiet, circumspect Anne, suddenly chills when it’s revealed the two are engaged. Jessica, for one, doesn’t approve, for reasons only revealed later.Nevertheless, Anne and Patrick depart in the titular vehicle, driven by excessively chatty Ian (Nick Frost, also on exceptional form, and credited with contributing additional material to the script). En route, even more awkward revelations tumble out. From here on in, the film is essentially a two-and-a-half-hander, the story carried by Anne and Ian’s conversation, mostly conducted amid glances in the rear-view mirror as Ian drives, especially after Patrick loses consciousness.How and why the latter happens probably ought not be spoiled. But it behoves us to note that there’s also a supernatural element at play here, with lots of talk about the ghost of a woman (Tilly Woodward) killed on a secluded stretch of road just outside the metropolis (presumably London) in which Ian plies his trade. This spectre keeps putting in appearances, sometimes when there’s no musical clue or jump scare to alert the viewer. Consequently, the effect is twice as creepy and also means you have to properly pay attention to the film. As the violence ratchets up and the menace grows, themes such as domestic violence and grief bubble up, although director Bruce Goodison and the cast never entirely turn off the comedy tap.Black Cab is on digital platforms from 7 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsComedy filmsNick FrostComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The hosts, Dr Crippen and his wife, Belle Elmore, had been entertaining their friends, Clara and Paul Martinetti, until the small hours. After some difficulty fetching a cab, the visitors headed home around 1.30am. It was the last time they, or anyone else, would see Elmore alive. When her colleagues at the Music Hall Ladies’ Guild made inquiries about their friend – she was treasurer of the organisation – Crippen told them she had gone off to America to deal with a family crisis. Some weeks later they were informed she had died of double pneumonia in Los Angeles.Thus was sparked an international murder case, one of the most notorious in Britain, later called “the crime of the century”. ButHallie Rubenhold’s engrossing account begins a generation earlier when Hawley Harvey Crippen, a homeopathic doctor, met and married a nurse, Charlotte Bell, in New York. The couple moved west to San Diego, had a son, moved again. In the US of the 1880s, with its burgeoning railroads, you could always change towns, disappear, shed your mistakes along with your creditors, your given name, your dependents. This was the shifty Crippen way, and when Charlotte died of a stroke, aged 33, he was on the move and marrying again. His second wife, a Brooklynite born Kunigunde Mackamotzki, changed her name more than once, eventually settling on Belle Elmore, and after crisscrossing the US the couple emigrated to London, he to peddle his quack remedies for the Drouet Institute, she to pursue a career as an opera singer.This is where the story catches fire, as Rubenhold adroitly conjures a seedy Edwardian era of gaslight, grift and gullibility. As blowsy Elmore turns to music hall and splashes out on jewellery and furs, Crippen continues flogging medicines for the “petty rat swindlers”, and falls for his new typist, 27-year-old Ethel Le Neve. The patina of middle-class respectability begins to tarnish as the doctor desperately tries to run two horses at once, playing along with his childless wife (he supervised an early operation to remove her ovaries) while promising marriage to his young protege. The atmosphere of these pages brings to mind Sickert’s great gloomy paintingEnnui(circa 1914) with its estranged couple confined in a rectangle of domestic discontent: something has to give. Mere weeks after Elmore’s mysterious disappearance, Crippen makes an incredible error in taking Le Neve to a Benevolent Fund ball, where his wife’s friends notice that his new partner is wearing a diamond brooch that belonged to Elmore. By June 1910 she has supplanted the wife altogether, appropriating her home, her clothes, her money and her husband. Every trace of Belle Elmore had been removed – or so Crippen thought.Crippen, for all his mild-mannered blankness, remains the fiendish engine of the story. The mystery here is not who, but whyRubenhold’s energy as a researcher is indefatigable, and admirable. It helped to burnish her award-winning previous bookThe Five, which ingeniously flipped the mythology of Jack the Ripper to focus upon the lives of his victims. She means to repeat the trick here by shifting the centre of gravity from the murderer to the women his shadow crossed, but it doesn’t quite come off. Unlike the Ripper, we know the killer’s identity, and Crippen, for all his mild-mannered blankness, remains the fiendish engine of the story. The mystery here is not who, but why, and the book cannot supply a convincing answer. Time and again, Rubenhold has to admit to the limitations of life-writing when her research meets a dead end: “is unknown”…“is a mystery”… “There is no indication of how” …“is uncertain”…“will never be known”. The truth has receded to some undiscoverable place, a darkness that can only be (partly) illuminated by recourse to another genre – which is fiction.Not thatStory of a Murder:The Wives, the Mistress and Doctor Crippenwants for excitement or intrigue. The discovery of a dismembered corpse beneath the cellar floor at Hilldrop Crescent was the first of two sensational turning points in the tale, the bodily remains bearing traces of hyoscine, a poison that Crippen had recently purchased, alongside a scrap of his own pyjamas. The ineptitude was almost as remarkable as the callousness. Crippen and Le Neve fled to Belgium, the latter disguised as a boy, and then boarded the steamer SSMontroseon a voyage to Canada.In hot pursuit was DCI Walter Dew, who had begun his investigation of Crippen back in London and now worked out a way he could bring the fugitives to justice. Here lay the second startling development: how technology caught a killer. The captain of theMontrose, Henry George Kendall, had identified Crippen and Le Neve onboard, and by means of the new wireless telegraph he alerted the authorities. This allowed Dew to board a faster ship across the Atlantic – the papers called it the “Great Ocean Chase” – and to apprehend the couple as they reached Canada.View image in fullscreenA French magazine depicts the arrest of Dr Crippen and Ethel Le Neve in 1910.Illustration: The Print Collector/AlamyBy now the world had been apprised of the “north London cellar murder”, and the suspects’ return to trial in England had inflamed the popular imagination. But while technology had made bold advances, Edwardian morality was still dragging its feet. Crippen, his wax effigy already on display at Madame Tussaud’s, was tried separately at the Old Bailey, where the prosecution made short work of his lies and evasions. Le Neve, on the other hand, was presented to the court as an innocent dupe, kept ignorant under Crippen’s tight supervision. How could this delicate young lady have connived in such an atrocity? The press bought her story, and so did the jury. Crippen was hanged at Pentonville, and Le Neve walked free. Rubenhold pertinently contrasts this with an incident in London only three weeks after her acquittal. During a suffragette march to Parliament, police and male bystanders brutally set upon the protesters in the streets, blackened eyes, broke limbs and in some cases sexually assaulted them. It became known as Black Friday and served as a reminder to those women who defied the “natural order” – know your place, or suffer the consequences.An astonishing coda closes the book. Rubenhold quotes from different interviews Le Neve gave in the 1920s, designed to exonerate herself but only hardening suspicion of her awareness of the crime, if not her actual complicity. She later married, had a family and died in 1967. Her two children knew nothing of their mother’s past until a true-crime writer contacted them in their middle age. Both were stunned to learn that Ethel Smith was in fact Ethel Le Neve, mistress of Dr Crippen and one-time suspect in a murder case that had gripped the age. Quite an imposture to maintain for more than half a century, but then she had been schooled by a master in the art.The Mouthless Deadby Anthony Quinn is published by AbacusStory of a Murder: The Wives, the Mistress and Doctor Crippenby Hallie Rubenhold is published by Doubleday (£25).

To be able to fish the River Itchen for free is a gift; this is the same river that Frederic Halford and GEM Skues fished more than 100 years ago, starting fly-fishing as we know it today. Shrimp and caddis patterns work best for fly fishing here. It’s rare to see rising trout in these town waters except during the mayfly season so time your fishing trip appropriately if it’s trout you’re after. The mayfly season is not exact but it tends to run between late May and early June here.winchester.gov.ukStroud, GloucestershireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bill BoadenThe stretch of the River Frome which snakes behind Dr Newton’s Way is recovering from an industrial past which saw its waters used to power corn mills, woollen mills and even the production of walking sticks and umbrellas. Today there is fly life present, encouraging brown trout and grayling. Trout tend to be small but there is potential for larger catches and it’s well worth having a go if you’re visiting Stroud. This is classic urban fishing; use a shorter rod to cast between trees and other obstacles but not so short that you can’t roll cast (a useful technique that allows you to flick the fly out without a back cast).stroud.gov.ukLlanidloes, PowysVisitors flock to the small Welsh town of Llanidloes, with its picturesque high street, organic food shops and national collection of antique quilts. To the north of the town’s Long Bridge, however, the River Severn promises a very special (and free) half-mile of fishing. Blessed with brown trout and grayling, it has good hatches of fly. There are wooded and open sections; be prepared for the temperature to drop considerably as you enter the shadier sections. The trout can, at times, be free rising, but late evenings provide excellent angling opportunities during the summer months, or at times of low water. Salmon have been known to put in an appearance as well.fishingwales.netFishing from a kayakRottingdean Cliffs, East SussexView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Tony Watson/AlamyThis is a splendid fishing area, with excellent spinning for pollack, mackerel, bass and garfish. It can be snaggy, with uneven ground and obstacles below the water threatening to ensnare your tackle, so you need to be philosophical about losses. Casting from the lovely shingle beach with Rottingdean Cliffs rearing up behind you is delightful. For kayak fishing, check the water at low tide to find a patch of clean ground to ensure trouble-free entering and exiting. You can lure fish, and float fishing with a prawn may draw up a bass or two, especially in the evening. Park up at the Marine Cliffs car park.Polzeath Beach, CornwallThis wide sandy beach at the mouth of the River Camelis an excellent bass fishery. If you have a sea kayak, it’s a great place to use it but do keep a careful eye on the tides. The beach is exposed to swell (hence its popularity with surfers), so launching is only advisable when the sea is relatively calm but, once out, expect to encounter bass and pollack towards and around Pentire Point. There is also the occasional gilthead bream at the entrance to the Camel. A great place for mackerel fishing in the summer months, park at Polzeath Beach car park. If you do launch a kayak here, expect a bit of a hike at low tide to reach the water’s edge.Loch Ken, Dumfries & GallowayView image in fullscreenPhotograph: James JohnstoneRenowned for marvellous catches of pike, perch, roach, dace and bream, this long, ribbon-like loch stretches for nine miles through the gloriously wild scenery of the Galloway Hills in south-west Scotland. James Murray, a local gamekeeper, famously caught a 72lb pike here in 1774 that was seven feet long. To catch a seven-foot fish on a fly made of bits of peacock feather is a remarkable achievement. These days the loch is home to good-sized wild brown trout, and can be fished from shore or kayak. Alongside the trout, it’s possible to catch bream and perch too. There are a number of car parks around the loch but you can also stay and fish very inexpensively from theLoch Ken Holiday Park.Fishing permit £5 a day fromlochkenholidaypark.co.uk. Two-night camping pitches from£60Fishing from campsitesLoch Awe, ArgyllView image in fullscreenPhotograph: RFPhotography/Ronnie FlemingPicturesque Loch Awe holds a lot of trout, and the mayfly hatch leads to a feeding frenzy, which is unforgettable. There are several places around the loch to cast from but, for ultimate simplicity, book a stay at Loch Awe Camping Pods and you can fish almost from the end of your bed. This cluster of six dog-friendly wooden pods (camping with walls that don’t move in the wind) sits right by the shore in the village of Dalavich, also home to a shop, cafe and a pub.Fishing £7.50,lochawe.net. Pods from £102 for up to three people,pitchup.comOld River Nene, CambridgeshireThis is a delightful spot to camp, with the Old River Nene flowing placidly along at the bottom of the campsite. It’s all about coarse fishing here, and the coarse fishing season closes from the middle of March to the middle of June. However, the rest of the time you can fill your boots with bream, roach, rudd, tench or pike. This is a place for the kind of old school fishing you did as a kid – float fishing with worms or maggots work well, as do sweetcorn or bread pellets. Another place where you can kayak fish, the flow is gentle water means easy paddling.Fishing is free for guests, tent camping from£22 for up to four people,fourwindsleisure.comMonkstone Beach, PembrokeshireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alistair HareIt may be well known among avid rock-poolers (there are beautifully formed pools at either end of the beach), but Monkstone Point is also very good for bass fishing; peeler crabs and fresh sand eels make excellent baits at this location. If you’re visiting for the day, it’s usually possible to park on the verge along the lane to Trevayne Farm campsite, but we recommend staying over. This lovely campsite, on a working farm just up from the beach, maintains a wonderfully simple, back-to-nature ethos but facilities stretch to a farm shop selling local, seasonal produce. The owners also make small-batch knitwear from yarn produced from their own native-breed sheep.Fishing is free, camping from£10pp a night,trevaynefarm.co.ukButtermere, CumbriaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianBook a pitch at Syke Farm Campsite and you have two stretches of water to take advantage of, as well as a tearoom serving home-cooked breakfasts and cakes; packed lunches can also be ordered. Sandwiched in a bucolic dip between Buttermere and Crummock Water, stroll a few minutes’ south-east to Buttermere to fish for trout, char, pike, and perch (there’s a bag limit of 20 char) amid classically rugged Lake District scenery. Or, wander in the opposite direction and you’ll find yourself on the shore of Crummock Water, a magnificent setting for fishing those same quarries.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Sweet, smoked, hot … What’s the difference between the various paprikas? And are there any substitutes?“Paprika brings warmth, it brings colour and it brings another layer of flavour,” says Monika Linton, founder ofBrindisa. “Even just a sprinkling over goat’s cheese on toast, hummus or any kind of dip, along with a bit of olive oil, will bring it to life.” Crucial to both Spanish and Hungarian cuisines, paprika is made by drying peppers (generally speaking, Hungarian varieties are air-dried whereas the Spanish stuff is smoke-dried) and grinding them to a fine powder. The taste, meanwhile, depends on the variety of pepper used, although, as Linton points out, not all tins of paprika specify that.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“Paprika brings a certain richness,” says Jeremy Salamon, author ofSecond Generationand chef/owner of Hungarian restaurantAgi’s Counterin New York. “It has this unique, vegetal, unripe fruit-like quality, and lends itself in different ways to different dishes.” While he generally has sweet (“to use as a flavour base to build on with other spices”) and smoked (“to whip into butters”) to hand, hot paprika always comes out tops: “I like the kick it adds, so I’ll use it in chicken paprikash or in a pimento cheese dip.”Linton, meanwhile, always has four Spanish paprikas, orpimentón, on the go: smoked (ahumado), sweet and mild (dulce), hot (picante) and bittersweet (agridulce). “Unsmoked are fruitier and somehow fresher, so I’d use those for rice dishes, which are generally not a long, slow cook,” she says. “You’re not trying to impregnate everything for hours on end with flavour; instead, you want the feeling of sunshine.” That’s why it could also play a part in eastern Mediterranean-style meze, Linton adds: “They suit a fresher, more tomatoey paprika.”When it comes to smoked paprika, its most high-profile coupling is probably with chorizo. At home, though, remember that a little goes a long way: “It’s such a big flavour, so use it sparingly,” Linton says. It pairs particularly nicely with legumes and chickpeas: “They tend to require quite a long cook, and somehow don’t get overwhelmed.” Slow-cooked meat dishes and stews also thrive in its company, especially if you’re usingpimentón de la vera, which is made from the sweet-smoky agridulce variety of jaraíz pepper, saysJosé Pizarro. “The smokiness is incredible, and really balanced – it lifts all the other flavours,” says the restaurateur, whose new book,The Spanish Pantry, is published in June. He uses it especially in salads, soups and with vegetables (think potatoes): “It’s the taste I grew up with.”Whether you go for hot smoked paprika, though, really comes down to personal taste. Guardian regularRukmini Iyer, for example, punts for the hot stuff in aone-tin curry, combining it with turmeric, ground cumin and ground ginger, then adding grated garlic, yoghurt, oil, onion, paneer, cauliflower florets and some salt in a baking tin before roasting for half an hour. Finish with a squeeze of lemon, plus some chopped coriander and red chilli, and that’s dinner sorted.As for substitutes, you do have some options, though perhaps unsurprisingly they all involve peppers. “Soak a whole dried pepper in water, scrape out the flesh and add it to a sauce, bolognese or whatever it is that you’re cooking,” Linton says. Otherwise, simply drop in the pepper whole: “Let it infuse the dish, like a bouquet garni, then discard it at the end of cooking.” Alternatively, get yourself some pepper paste: “That’s good if you want a lot of pepper flavour,” she says, but for a really deep, savoury hit, it’s much better just to get yourself a pot of paprika.Got a culinary dilemma?
