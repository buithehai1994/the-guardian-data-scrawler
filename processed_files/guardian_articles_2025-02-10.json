The signoff from a high court judge, as well as two doctors, was the centrepiece of the original legislation.I’m changing my bill to ensure people have the right to a dignified death – here’s howRead moreLeadbeater argues the new system will still offer the strongest protections compared with any other country that has legalised assisted dying, and in an amendment she will submit on Tuesday, she will set out how that signoff will be replaced by an expert panel of three, including a senior lawyer such as a king’s counsel or retired judge.Leadbeater, who had previously vowed she would not remove the “judicial element” from the bill, will propose a judge-led commission to oversee the panels and a right to have a panel’s decision reviewed by the high court. She has called the change “judge plus”.The Guardian reported last week that MPs scrutinising the bill believe a considerable number ofMPs are waveringon what they will do in the final vote – which will take place on 25 April.Senior officials in the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) were understood to have had significant concerns about the signoff from a high court judge in the original bill, given lengthy backlogs in the family courts. Two senior judges who gave evidence to MPs on the bill committee have derided thehigh court element as unnecessaryand unworkable.Writing for the Guardian, Leadbeater saidshe was responding to a wide range of evidence heard by the committee about coercive control, hinting those protections had not been strong enough.“I’m now proposing to make my bill even more robust, without making it so difficult to navigate that it would be too much of a burden for people in the last months of their lives to undertake,” she wrote.“The evidence we have heard from other jurisdictions that have already introduced tightly drawn laws like mine is that fears about vulnerable people being put under pressure to asking for an assisted death have rarely, if ever, been borne out in practice.“Family and loved ones are far more likely to try to persuade a person not to do so. But I have promised to do everything I can to ensure my bill has the strongest safeguards [of] anywhere in the world, and this change will meet that promise by making it even more robust than it was already.”Only one other country has a comparable level of scrutiny to the one proposed by Leadbeater – Spain, where requests for an assisted death must be approved by an evaluation commission. In Australia, several states also require a procedural check before an assisted death can be approved.In the US state of Oregon, often held up as a model for the UK, signoff is by two doctors and two witnesses – and referral can be made for psychological evaluation.The bill committee – which includes MPs from all parties plus two ministers – will begin line-by-line scrutiny of the bill this week. More than 300 amendments have already been submitted by dozens of MPs for the committee to consider – including several by Leadbeater.Leadbeater’s new system would mean a referral would be made by two doctors after a request from a terminally ill patient. Then the request would be considered by a panel, chaired by a retired high court judge or king’s counsel, with a psychiatrist and a social worker.The panel would be required to interrogate whether a person’s decision to end their life was a result of pressure or coercion – and whether the person had the required mental capacity to make the decision.The panel could hear from the applicant or from the doctors making the referral or anyone else relevant, the amendment will say.The two ministers on the bill committee – the care minister Stephen Kinnock and the courts minister Sarah Sackman – are neutral on the bill but officials in their departments will offer guidance on workability.MoJ officials are understood to be drafting the amendment to the bill, which will be published this week.A source close to Leadbeater said the change to the judicial element of the bill had been her own policy decision and denied it had been a government demand. They said the MoJ had been prepared to keep the high court judge as part of the package if Leadbeater had decided not to make the change.But several committee members told the Guardian last week they believed the government was uncomfortable with that aspect of the original bill.Sackman and Kinnock wrote to MPs on the committee last week, advising them that a number of amendments had been drafted and would be going down in Leadbeater’s name, which they said were “based on discussions with ministers on the bill’s deliverability and the overall coherence of the statute book”.It added: “The government remains neutral on the principle of the bill, but it is our job to ensure that any bill that passes through parliament is workable and implementable if it gains royal assent.”Leadbeater has also tabled other amendments based on concerns from MPs, which would mean doctors in England and Wales would not be permitted to raise assisted dying with patients without first explaining palliative care and other support options.The change comes amid an escalation in tensions over the bill among Labour MPs. Last week, four Labour MPs sent a mass email to colleagues rebuking Leadbeater for giving what they claimed was a one-sided view of expert evidence.In the email, the MPs said the committee’s evidence was “weighted towards voices that were known to be supportive of the bill” and criticised the lack of expert witnesses on several subjects, including coercive control.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingLabourHealth policyHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The action announced on Monday night ends exemptions granted to certain countries, and increases the duty rate on aluminum.The changes are not due to come into effect until 4 March, however, according to a White House official – raising the prospect of the Trump administration brokering deals with governments seeking reprieve. Countries including Australia have already beenmaking their case.Trumpfirst trailed his latest tariff actions on Sunday, adding that he would also announce a further set of reciprocal tariffs later in the week, drawing warnings of retaliation from trade partners.“The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America’s economic and national security,” Peter Navarro, Trump’s top trade adviser, told reporters.“This isn’t just about trade. It’s about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum.”Why Trump blinked before imposing his ‘beautiful’ tariffs on Canada and MexicoRead moreTrump and his allies, who repeatedly claimed that tariffs could “Make America great again” when fighting to regain the White House, believe that higher taxes on imported steel and aluminum will help shore up US industrial heartlands.The US president said he would announce plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on other countries over the next two days. He signed two proclamations as he spoke to reporters in the Oval Office: one ending waivers granted by Joe Biden to steel and aluminum tariffs instituted during his first term, and the other raising duties on both metals to 25%.He also raised the prospect of future US tariffs on cars, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals from markets across the world.Asked about the possibility of other countries retaliating against US tariffs, Trump said: “I don’t mind.”This latest wave of tariffs is different than the oneimposed by the White House on China last week, which hit all goods traveling from the country to the US with an additional 10% duty. He also threatened Canada and Mexico with the same blanket tariffs, at higher a rate of 25%, only toagree to a one-month delaybefore pulling the trigger.Trump signed proclamations that raised the tariff rate on aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector. His action reinstates a 25% tariff on millions of tonnes of steel imports and aluminum imports that had been entering the US duty-free under quota deals, exemptions and thousands of product exclusions.The proclamations were extensions of Trump’s 2018 section 232 national security tariffs to protect steel and aluminum makers. A White House official said the exemptions had eroded the effectiveness of these measures.What do Trump’s tariffs mean for US-China trade?Read moreAbout a quarter of steel used in the US is from overseas, with Canada, Brazil and Mexico as the top providers. South Korea, Japan and Germany are also key markets.China, hit by a 25% steel tariff during Trump’s first administration that was maintained under Joe Biden, is not a significant exporter of steel to the US. But it is the largest exporter of steel to the world, dominating the global market with typically cheaper products. Some countries then export their own steel products, at higher rates, to markets including the US.Trump’s fixation with tariffs hasalarmed economists, who have warned their imposition may derail his repeated promises to rapidly bring down prices for millions of Americans.But Trump has defended his strategy, claiming they could raise “trillions” of dollars for theUS economy– and that even the mere threat of import duties can prompt countries to bend to his will. “Tariffs are very powerful, both economically and in getting everything else you want,” he said last week.Reuters contributed to this storyExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpInternational tradeUS economyUS politicsSteel industryUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

A second Labour MP, Oliver Ryan, was suspended on Monday after he was revealed to bea member of the group, which also featured misogynistic and classist messages.The Guardian has seen previously undisclosed posts in the WhatsApp group, called Trigger Me Timbers, and can reveal that:Gwynne, the MP for Gorton and Denton, described a constituent as “an illiterate retard” and a fellow councillor as a “fat middle aged useless thicket”.He called neighbouring MP Nav Mishra, a “splitter” for forming a group of leftwing Labour MPs in 2022.A year after the death of Prince Philip, Gwynne’s colleague Claire Reid, a senior Labour official, said her “go-to phrase” was: “You’re so old. You’re like a young Prince Philip”. Gwynne replied: “But less dead.”Ryan, who was elected last July, described leftwing Labour supporters as “marxists [sic] loonies” while more than 100 messages refer to colleagues as “trots”.The cycling campaigner, who did not want to be named, told the Guardian: “I’m shocked and upset, and not just myself [but] my family, my partner, my children, have been profoundly distressed by this.“It’s a death wish. I’m not quite sure where the boundary lies on what the police will see as a hate crime, but … how much more hateful can you get than not just: ‘I wish this person were dead’, but: ‘I’d like them to die a gruesome death.’”Gwynne also said he hoped a 72-year-old woman would soon be dead after she wrote to her local councillor about bin collections, according to the Mail on Sunday. After complaints toGreater Manchesterpolice this weekend in relation to the messages, the force said it had recorded a non-crime hate incident.Gerald Cooney, the former Labour leader of Tameside council in Greater Manchester, said he had told senior party officials multiple times about the WhatsApp group.Cooney said he had informed Labour’s then regional director for north-westEngland, Liam Didsbury, about the group “well over a year ago”.He said he told Didsbury “ages ago” that Gwynne was “leading” the group and said he had reported it “more than once” in recent months to Andy Smith, Labour’s current head of regional governance in the north-west of England.Cooney told the Guardian: “I’ve never been a member of it. I did raise it with the region some time ago … I reported it to Liam Didsbury and I reported it to Andy Smith a good while ago; I also reported it over a month ago to Andy Smith again.”In October last year, Labour HQ announced it was sending in a team to oversee a culture change in Tameside Labour group owing to what it called “unacceptable working practices”.Cooney said he had been forced by senior local officials, including Smith, to step down as council leader that month amid accusations of bullying, which Cooney denies.“I said to [Smith]: ‘You’ve done me in, yet you’re aware of a vile WhatsApp group from Denton [a town in Tameside]’ and he’s not done a thing about it,” he said.Cooney said he was made aware of an offensive exchange in the group in March 2021 when Gwynne allegedly reposted a tweet about Angela Rayner buying Apple AirPods, which read: “I don’t see what the problem is. It’s literally impossible to give [a] blowjob while wearing wired headphones. Anyone with a similar background to Angela would understand this.”He said: “I was shown by someone who was fuming the picture of Angela Rayner with her AirPods. We were aware of that. I wasn’t aware of the other stuff [but] what I was told though is that the [group] is vile, it’s misogynistic … and it’s racist. That’s why I then referred it to Liam Didsbury.”Approached about Cooney’s claims, a Labour source said the party did not receive any formal complaint about the WhatsApp group.Cooney said it was known within Labour circles locally that Gwynne, the MP for Gorton and Denton, and a number of councillors were part of the group.One of the messages involved Gwynne joking about the unnamed cycling campaigner being “mown down” by a lorry while riding his bike, adding: “We couldn’t be that lucky!”The cyclist said on Monday: “I think what’s caused me a lot of distress, and what has caused a lot of active travel campaigners a lot of distress is that … in that group were a whole load of local councillors, many of whom are still in office as local councillors, and not one of them seems to have challenged what he said.”Three senior Labour councillors stepped down from their roles on Tameside council’s cabinet on Monday pending an investigation into the messages. Claire Reid, a senior caseworker in Gwynne’s office and a representative on Labour’s north-west national policy forum, was one of those to step down, alongside Jack Naylor and George Newton.Kaleel Khan, an independent councillor on Tameside borough council, said he had made a hate crime report to police on Sunday after constituents contacted him with concerns about some of the messages. He told the BBC: “What worries me is when you have an elected official mocking women, or mocking black people, Jewish people, and constituents, too.”Greater Manchester police said: “We have received a small number of complaints relating to publicised messages allegedly from a WhatsApp group. A non-crime hate incident has been recorded and we are in contact with our parliamentary liaison as part of our initial inquiries.”Gwynne has apologised in a statement on X for any offence caused by “badly misjudged” comments. Ryan said in a statement that comments he made in the group “were completely unacceptable” and he regretted “not speaking out at the time”.Explore more on these topicsLabourLocal governmentGreater ManchesterNorth of EnglandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The billionaire is leading a consortium of investors that announced it had submitted a bid of $97.4bn for “all assets” of the artificial intelligence company to OpenAI’s board of directors.The startup, which operates ChatGPT, has been working to restructure itself away from its original non-profit status. OpenAI also operates a for-profit subsidiary, and Musk’s unsolicited offer could complicate the company’s plans. TheWall Street Journalfirst reported the proposed bid.“If Sam Altman and the presentOpenAI, Inc. Board of Directors are intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away from it: control over the most transformative technology of our time,” said Marc Toberoff, the attorney representing the investors.Altman posted his reaction onXshortly after the news broke, saying, “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.” Musk famously bought Twitter in 2022 for $44bn and renamed it X. Musk responded to that post, saying, “Swindler.”Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI but left the company in 2019 and started his own AI company called xAI. Over the past several years, he’s tussled with Altman over the direction of the company. He sued OpenAI over the company’s re-structuring plans last year, dropped the suit, then re-filed it.The bid is backed by xAI and several investment firms, including one run by Joe Lonsdale, who co-founded the stealth government contractor Palantir. Ari Emanuel, who’s the CEO of the entertainment company Endeavor, has also joined the group through his investment fund.“At x.AI, we live by the values I was promised OpenAI would follow. We’ve made Grok open source, and we respect the rights of content creators,” Musk said in a statement. “It’s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was. We will make sure that happens.”Toberoff told the Wall Street Journal that Musk’s consortium of investors is ready to match or go higher than any other bids on OpenAI that may arise.OpenAI has maintained that its restructuring is essential to the longevity of the company and being able to access capital. It has said that if it keeps its non-profit structure as is, it won’t be able to keep up in the highly competitive world of AI innovation. OpenAI said it plans for the restructuring to be done by 2026.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He described an incident involving a man shouting an offensive slur and adding: “I just want to see Dolly Parton.”Webb said the incidents had “really opened [his] eyes”.“We’re in such a bubble in this industry. But travelling the country and seeing how many people literally cannot bear to see a gay person depicted on stage – it’s wild.”ATG Entertainment, which runs theManchestervenue, told the BBC it took a “zero tolerance” approach to such incidents.The Opera House said such incidents were rare and that anyone engaging in abusive behaviour would be removed immediately.Directed by Gabriel Barre, the musical comedy features the country music singer appear like a fairy godmotherto give life lessons in song to a stricken fan.Parton, 79, has been a longtime supporter of LGBTQ+ rights and has hosted Gay Days at her theme park, Dollywood, in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.In 2014, she spoke out in favour of gay marriage. “I think everyone should be with who they love,” the singer said. “I don’t want to be controversial or stir up a bunch of trouble but people are going to love who they are going to love. I think gay couples should be allowed to marry.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreLGBTQ+ rightsManchesterEnglandDolly PartonnewsShareReuse this content"

It boasted a pool, spa, gym, wine room, library, cinema, and a “snoring room” designed for peaceful sleep.Days after moving into Horbury Villa, the couple spotted signs of an infestation that would go on to destroy clothing and ruin their wine. They sued the house seller, William Woodward-Fisher, in an attempt to reverse the sale.John McGhee KC, representing the couple in court, said at the peak of the infestation, Hunyak was swatting about 100 of the insects daily.Before buying the property, the couple and their staff visited the house at least 11 times, the court heard.Hunyak, a paediatric dentist who works in Chelsea, told the court that moths were landing on their children’s toothbrushes, cutlery and meals.He said he was forced to tip out glasses of wine after discovering floating moths due to the infestation.On Monday, high court judge Mr Justice Fancourt ruled that Woodward-Fisher, an elite property developer, had given “false” answers about the state of the property in west London and failed “honestly to disclose” the “serious infestation”.Fancourt acknowledged that Woodward-Fisher, who formerly competed for Great Britain as a rower, had not deliberately tried to deceive the purchasers, but added he had “simply wanted to sell the house and move on” and knew disclosure would cause the sale to “go off”.The judge ordered the sale be rescinded, with Woodward-Fisher required to reimburse the purchase price, minus about £6m to recognise the couple’s use of the property.The developer was also ordered to pay the couple an additional £4m in damages for the infestation, including £15,000 for ruined clothes and £3.7m paid in stamp duty.Appearing for the developer, Jonathan Seitler KC said Woodward-Fisher had been honest when dealing with the inquiry about possible previous “vermin infestation”, having told his solicitor that the property had experienced problems with moths only to be assured that “moths were not vermin and therefore not relevant to this inquiry”.Chris Webber, of Squire Patton Boggs, the firm that represented the couple, said: “[The couple] hope the case will serve as a warning to unscrupulous property developers who might seek to take advantage of buyer beware to sell properties by concealing known defects.”The court previously heard that Woodward-Fisher bought the site in 2011 and lived there with his wife, Kerry, an interior designer. The house was extended and radically remodelled before being sold to the Georgian heiress.Patarkatsishvili is the daughter of Badri Patarkatsishvili, a businessman who fell out with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, before coming to the UK in 2000. He died of heart failure eight years later.Explore more on these topicsLondonReal estateInsectsnewsShareReuse this content"

They were not surprised that Gwynne’s inner circle was the subject of the highly damaging leaks, which first emerged in the Mail on Sunday.“You would turn up at an event and they would be slagging off the other side,” said one senior Labour figure inGreater Manchester. “Any time we were in a party setting with Andrew Gwynne and some of those people, they would just be slagging off the people they didn’t like.“You get a bit of that in politics but they were probably the worst at it in terms of the Greater Manchester scene.”The Guardian has seen more than 1,000 pages of WhatsApp messages, spanning 2019 to 2022, in which the sacked minister joked about the death of an elderly voter and a cycling campaigner, who he hoped would be “mown down” by a lorry.He also said someone “sounds too Jewish” and “too militaristic”, apparently from their name alone.In newly disclosed messages, Gwynne described a constituent as “an illiterate retard” and a fellow councillor as a “fat middle-aged useless thicket”. He called neighbouring MP Navendu Mishra, a “splitter” for forming a group of leftwing Labour MPs in 2022.The group, named Trigger Me Timbers, was set up by Gwynne’s office caseworker Claire Reid in January 2019. At its height it had 44 members, most of whom were local councillors and activists.The forum was initially set up to discuss routine party business, such as local events and campaign literature. But it soon turned “nasty”, according to one Labour figure.The group’s ire was reserved for leftwing Labour activists, whom they refer to more than 100 times as “trots”.When Christian Wakeford defected from the Conservatives to Labour in January 2022, Ryan – then a local councillor – joked about “all the trots exploding on socials”.Gwynne said “the nutty wing” of a local party “is going bonkers that we’ve let a Tory have the Labour whip and not Jezza” – a reference to Jeremy Corbyn, who was suspended by the party.Reid, now a senior official on Labour’s national policy forum, said of the party’s leftwing membership: “Aside from anything else today it’s very good for the internal Party! Hopefully they’ll all leave”, to which Gwynne replied: “Yep.”View image in fullscreenAndrew Gwynne and Oliver Ryan.Composite: Chris Thomond/The GuardianWhile Gwynne andRyanare the most high profile to be suspended by Labour, Reid and two other senior councillors – George Newton and Jack Naylor – have stepped down from their cabinet positions on Tameside council amid an investigation by party HQ.Gwynne’s wife, Allison Gwynne, who posted in the group about local children who have “always enjoyed swimming in street rubbish/raw sewage”, is understood to remain in her role as chair of the council’s overview panel – a position she is believed to have been awarded by Labour HQ.Gerald Cooney, who was ousted as Labour leader of Tameside council last October, said he hadtold senior party officialsmultiple times about the “vile” WhatsApp group.A Labour source did not deny that Cooney had alerted senior party officials to the group but said there had been no formal complaint.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The party’s headquarters said last October that it was sending a team to the region to oversee a culture change due to what it called “unacceptable working practices”.Eleanor Wills was installed as the leader of the party following a spate of resignations, including chief executive Sandra Stewart, on the back of a withering report into its children’s services department. Local Tories accused Labour of fighting “like rats in a sack” while presiding over failing services.In Denton, in the heart of Gwynne’s constituency, the MP’s comments have not gone down well with the electorate.“I voted for Labour,” Beryl Ashton, 78, said, but she said she would not vote for the MP again.“Being a senior citizen as well, it’s even worse,” she said.“It’s atrocious, absolutely atrocious,” said another woman who did not want to be named. “It’s a let down.” She added that she thought Gwynne should “absolutely” step down.“I don’t understand it because if you’re an MP you’re meant to be intelligent,” said John Dargan, 80, “and he’s made unintelligent, stupid remarks, knowing somebody else was going to see it. I know better than that.”On Gwynne’s comments about the pensioner who complained about bin collections, Dargan said: “I wouldn’t say that about anybody, I wouldn’t say that about my worst enemy.”“All his constituents are going to think he’s a knobhead,” he added.Another woman who didn’t want to stop and chat, shouted “It’s not good, is it?” as she walked off.And a man who gave his name only as Simon said: “He doesn’t seem to have a very high opinion of his constituents.”“Definitely he should resign,” he said, “and his mate Oliver, and his wife, the whole lot of them, the councillors, anyone involved in that.“In fact, the whole council needs looking at root and branch.”Explore more on these topicsLabourGreater ManchesterWhatsAppLocal governmentBurnleyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But a recent court case over Thames Water’s debts was not concerned with the flow of water and effluent so much as the flow of money.Thames Water stands out amid the turmoil of the privatised water industry inEnglandand Wales. Loaded up with about £19bn in debt, the company sought court approval to borrow as much as £3bn more from a group of existing creditors in a desperate attempt to avoid temporary nationalisation at the end of March.That process, known as special administration, would preserve the supply of water to 16m households and businesses in London and south-east England. Yet it would also create a massive headache for the Labour government and the wider water industry,reversing Margaret Thatcher’s privatisation more than three decades ago.Critics of the latest debt deal haveargued for special administrationfor another reason: they say it would mean more money to fix leaky pipes and sewers, and less for the small army of firms that are racking up extraordinary fees during Thames’s troubles.The scale of the operation was on show in the high court last week, with more than 100 investors, bankers, lawyers and other advisers attending either in two packed courtrooms or via video call.View image in fullscreenThames’s court battle offers a glimpse of just how interlinked English household water bills are with global finance.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA‘Egregious’ interest costsBond markets go unnoticed much of the time by most of the public. But when a company gets into deep financial trouble, as Thames has, legal battles can give a glimpse of just how interlinked English household water bills are with global finance.The court hearingpitted two groups of potential lendersagainst each other. One, holding debt described as “class A”, is offering an interest rate of 9.5%, while the smaller group of “class B” hedge funds claims to have an 8% offer. Theclass A group wants to release the £3bn in tranches: an initial £1.5bn, followed by two lots of £750m.Charlie Maynard, a former investment banker who is now the Liberal Democrat MP for Witney in Oxfordshire, was allowed to intervene in the case for consumers’ interests. He described the class A offer as “ludicrously expensive debt”. Thames’s general counsel, Andy Fraiser, told the court: “You can come up with a plan which is cheaper but is not deliverable.”Maynard’s legal team argued that two-thirds of the £1.5bn would “go into the pockets of debt investors and professional advisers”, including £245m in interest paid to those investors and more than £440m on various fees and discounts.View image in fullscreenThames Water’s Deephams sewage treatment works is the fourth largest in England.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe court case attracted considerable interest from a spectrum of global investors and banks, some of which traded the debt. Online attenders appeared to include the UK banks Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and HSBC, Canada’s Scotiabank, National Australia Bank, plus the US banks JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, as well as France’s BNP Paribas.Hedge funds and other big investors also appeared to be following. They ranged from large, relatively well-known investors such as Pimco, Corebridge and Millennium Management, to hedge funds including the London-headquartered Algebris and Insight Investment and America’s Diameter Capital, Bracebridge Capital and Centerbridge.Attendance does not necessarily mean that the companies have financial exposures to Thames Water, although the class A group also contains hedge funds such as Elliott Investment Management and Silver Point Capital, while the class Bs include Polus Capital and Covalis Capital. Neither creditor group would say which companies were members.Cat Hobbs founded We Own It to campaign for public ownership of public services such as libraries, railways and water. She said the court should reject the debt deal in favour of special administration to limit the flow of money from Thames Water.View image in fullscreenPeople protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice against Thames Water’s application for a £3bn emergency loan.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/SOPA Images/REX/Shutterstock“This is just a ‘money-go-round’, and they want to keep the money-go-round going as long as possible,” she said. “This would be a complete travesty for it to go ahead. The creditors’ interests will come very high up in the restructuring, and they wouldn’t in the special administration.”Armies of advisersThe interest payments may be high, but they do reward risk-taking. However, hundreds of millions of pounds will also flow out of Thames Water in the coming months in the form of fees for all those lawyers, bankers and public relations advisers.Thames has hired the “Magic Circle” law firm Linklaters and the restructuring advice firm Kroll. They were up against the class Bs’ law firm Quinn Emanuel, plus other experts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That could leave the bill at more than £200m for the entire process – a small amount relative to the water company’s gargantuan balance sheet, but a lucrative payday for those involved.Thames Water, the class As and class Bs all declined to detail the fees for the process.Even the regulator, Ofwat, has added to Thames’s fees. It said in its annual report this week that it had made Thames pay back £6m in relation to work on the company during its 2023-24 financial year. Ofwat hashired its own investment bank, Lazard, to advise.Another roundPeople close to Thames Water argue that the company would face criticism from the other direction if it did not hire advisers. Much of that advice will be crucial in determining whether Thames can continue as privately owned, which the company argues will save the taxpayer from having to spend on keeping it going.View image in fullscreenA pipe discharges into the River Thames in Henley, Oxfordshire.Photograph: Maureen McLean/REX/ShutterstockThe company and creditors vehemently deny that the fees will ultimately be paid through bills, saying they will be borne by creditors when they repair the company’s balance sheet.A Thames spokesperson said: “Any suggestion that customers will bear costs from this process is an untrue and misleading claim that risks needlessly worrying our customers. This plan will not lead to any increases in customer bills. Ofwat has already determined the cost of bills for the next five years.“Our plan remains the only implementable solution to putting the business on a firmer financial footing. Its approval will not affect customer bills, but will unlock billions of pounds for investment in our network, fixing pipes, upgrading our sewage treatment works, and maintaining high-quality drinking water.Those billions of pounds – whichcould add up to another £7bn, according to the brokerage firm Jefferies, yet another adviser to the class As – will have to come in a second restructuring later this year. That will mean the fees will keep coming.Teneo, another consultancy, calculated that advisers would charge £98m to line up funding even in the event of a special administration. That would include £63m to run the administration, plus £25m on lawyers and another £10m on merger advisers. Teneo, which could be a contender to run the special administration, has received £5m from Thames for PR and restructuring advice.“All these fees are just ratcheting up, and this is just the first. There’s another fees fest coming down the road,” said,” said Maynard, whose solicitors, Marriott Harrison, and barrister, William Day, worked pro bono.Explore more on these topicsThames WaterWater industryUtilitiesEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One of the most common conditions they treat is vaginal prolapse, which usually happens as a result of childbirth, and occasionally requires reconstructive surgery.Hot flashes and mood swings: why perimenopausal symptoms get misdiagnosed – and how to treat themRead moreFitzgerald says it makes her “angry” that so many people are blindsided by the pelvic floor injuries and complications that can happen during and after childbirth. “We portray motherhood as this beautiful calling, and for some women it is,” Fitzgerald says. “But that doesn’t change the fact that the calling comes with some real costs.”We talked to Fitzgerald about some of the underdiscussed physical ramifications of childbirth, and how patients can get the information and care they need.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.In January, youposted on X: “As a urogynecologist, I cannot emphasize more strongly, literally am begging women to learn about what actually happens and can happen to your body during childbirth before getting pregnant. Don’t be blindsided. Go in prepared, ready, and certain in your choice to be a mother.” What prompted you to post that?I think it’s so important for women to approach their reproductive life strategically. What I focus on is the physical ramifications. People think of the postpartum period as the six weeks after you deliver, but really postpartum is the rest of your life once you’ve had a delivery.The reality of childbirth and how it is portrayed are so wildly different that I can’t help but feel frustrated on behalf of my patients. They’ve been fed this romanticized vision of birth and motherhood. As a result, they think they are the only ones to have a birth injury, and they hide it for as long as they can. By the time they come to see me, they are really scared. For example, if they have [pelvic] prolapse, a lot of times they think they have cancer or something unfixable or they’ve never heard of prolapse. They’re blindsided, which makes me really angry for them because it’s so common. It happens to 50% of women in their lifetime, and yet it’s so taboo that they’ve never heard about it.It’s a fantasy to think that you’re going to shove a person out of a tiny hole … and nothing is going to be differentWe have this idea that birth is no big deal, everyone does it and it’s a natural thing your body was made to do. When it goes “wrong”, so to speak, women think they’re the only one and they don’t want to give the impression that their body couldn’t do it.If patients came to see me sooner, I could intervene sooner and they would have a better outcome. The sooner you treat incontinence, the sooner you treat prolapse, the better chance you have of it getting better. These patients would get years of their life back where they didn’t have to be suffering.What are some of the things that happen during and after childbirth that most surprise your patients?Incontinence is one of them. [Postpartum incontinence happens to roughly 30% of women.] Pain is probably the next biggest one. People are really surprised by all these painful things they’ve never heard of, like pubic symphysis pain (pain in the joint between the left and right pelvic bones) or the way that their sacroiliac joints (the joints that link the pelvis and lower back) change and their back posture changes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It takes 162,335 minutes a year to maintain my health and wellbeingRead moreThey’re also very surprised by how much intercourse can hurt after they deliver. Anywhere from 25 to 50% of women experience this after giving birth. A lot of times that has to do with a birth injury, but sometimes it’s muscular spasms because the muscles, in trying to protect themselves from the injury they’ve just undergone, have overcontracted. In that case, you need to go to physical therapy.The pelvic floor is a miracle. There is no other biological process quite like birth, in terms of how these organs can stretch so far and then go back to normal, or mostly normal. Imagine any other muscle in your body that is stretched to 10 times its natural length, and then it has to snap back into place. Of course that muscle will hurt – it can go into spasm, it can become not very functional. If you over-rotated or overstretched your shoulder, you would go to physical therapy so you can get the coordination of that muscle back. The same is true of your vagina and pelvic floor.What are some of the most common birth injuries?The most common one people think of is tearing. Usually that’s a tear that involves the perineum, the area between the vagina and the rectum. There are grades of tears. A second-degree tear goes into the perineum, a third-degree tear goes into the external anal sphincter, and a fourth-degree tear, which is the worst kind, goes into the internal anal sphincter. The most common is a second-degree tear. Third- and fourth-degree tears are relatively rare, but still happen to 5-8% of women.Patients tend to know about tears the most, because we repair those at the time of delivery. But there are other birth injuries that are not as obvious at the time of delivery. There’s something called a levator avulsion, for example. The muscles of the pelvic floor that go into spasm the most are called the levator ani muscles, and they are attached to the inner surface of the pubic bone. With a levator avulsion, they can tear off the pubic bone. You can’t really fix that at the time, and it’s not an injury that bleeds. That is a very big risk factor for developing prolapse down the line.And there’s other things that can be injured, but more rarely, like a urethral tear. I’ve seen clitoral tears, labial tears, deep side-wall tears in the vagina that go up into the uterus.I’m a woman in my30s, and I’ve had a lot of conversations with friends about whether we want kids. A lot of the calculus seems to be: what would my life look like? How would I afford it? How would it affect my career? How would my partner and I divide the work of parenting? Much more rarely do we discuss the act of childbirth itself, and the long-term physical impacts of that.Your body is really different after. Sometimes it’s not that much, and a lot of the time you heal. The female body is amazing, and a lot of women do really well. But I would challenge you to find any woman who tells you that after birth, things feel or function the same way. They just don’t. It’s a fantasy to think that you’re going to shove a person out of a tiny hole – and through a container of muscle that has your bladder, bowel, uterus, vagina and all the muscles and nerves that run down your legs and connect your pubic bone and back – and nothing is going to be different.I chose to be childfree. I didn’t think I was choosing isolation, tooRead moreA lot of people get mad at me online and say that I’m fearmongering and trying to convince women not to have babies. That is not the case. If the idea that you might leak urine after having a baby is enough to make you not want to be a parent, then you probably don’t want to be a parent in the first place and I’ve done you a favor. For people who really want kids and are committed to parenthood, that information won’t deter them. It will be a gift, because when you can treat your pelvic floor disorders, you can be a better mom – you can run and play with your kids and not sideline yourself because you worry you’re going to have an accident.When you tell the truth, women know that they are not alone. It makes them really think about what they want for their body, what they want for their motherhood journey, and how to find help if they need it. In fact, there is research that shows women who go into birth educated about pelvic floor disorders actually have less anxiety about the process, not more.How can women prepare themselves for some of these potential injuries and complications?There are definitely more resources than there used to be. Just knowing that urogynecology is a specialty in medicine that is dedicated to these issues is a huge part of the battle. It’s rare, but I’ve had patients come to me before they get pregnant to ask for counseling about pelvic floor disorders related to birth. I’m not saying everyone needs to do that.There are a lot of patient-facing resources on the American Urogynecology Society (AUGS)website. [Fitzgerald is a member of AUGS.] There’s an inexpensiveAUGS book– I don’t make any money from it – that is all about pregnancy and postpartum and your pelvic floor. It’s really easy to read, and has information about how to hold your baby so that you protect your back, and other postural and hormonal changes that happen.And just know that pelvic floor therapy is out there. There are a lot of reputable pelvic floor therapists that have a lot of good information about pelvic floor rehabilitation. And talk to your obstetrician, of course.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealth & wellbeingWomen's healthChildbirthinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But it’s also surprisingly moving – and may well leave you in tearsLucy ManganMon 10 Feb 2025 17.00 ESTShareIf Virdee is what we get to mark the naming of Bradford as this year’s city of culture (congratulations, Bradford!) then I’m going to need it to be so anointed until at least 2029. The six-part thriller is an adaptation by Amit Dhand of his own book City of Sinners. It’s the third in a series set in the troubled West Yorkshire town and centred round Detective Harry Virdee and his conflicted personal and professional loyalties, and I am going to need them all.This is a switchbacking ride from the off. We open with a man apparently on the run from the police, until it turns out heisthe police. Virdee (Game of Thrones’ Staz Nair) is in pursuit of the man he suspects can give him the whereabouts of missing teenager Ateeq Farooqi (Yousef Naseer). But, after the eventual arrest, he is taken to task by his brother-in-law Riaz (Vikash Bhai) for not lettinghimhandle the matter “unofficially”. They are on the same side here, he insists to Virdee. A missing kid is bad for business. It is clear that Riaz is a very shady brother-in-law indeed, but neither Virdee the man nor Virdee the show is in the habit of lingering, so with the first of many tantalising set-ups complete, he is off to a friend’s wedding to plunge us into the maelstrom of difficulties that is his private life.Virdee is estranged from his Sikh family after marrying Saima (Aysha Kala), a Muslim woman; their attendance at the wedding is an attempt at rapprochement. Despite his mother’s longing to welcome her son and daughter-in-law back into the fold – via a scene so unexpectedly moving that I was on the verge of tears – his father will not countenance it. The next scene between them, when Virdee takes food to his parents’ house to see if they can be welcomed for Diwali, is so painful it is hard to watch. It is also emblematic of Dhand’s great talent for finding the emotionally universal in the culturally specific. Parental hopes and dreams, however unreasonable, die hard and familial misery knows no bounds.View image in fullscreenQuietly shattering … Staz Nair as Harry Virdee with Aysha Kala as his wife Saima.Photograph: Sam Taylor/BBC/Magical SocietyAgainst this backdrop of quietly shattering scenes and their flipside (the deeply romantic, tender bond between Virdee and Saima that has been forged in the fire) unfurls an incredibly satisfying plot. As the missing boy’s absence stretches into its third week, the detective and his new partner DS Amin (Danyal Ismail) piece together his involvement in the county lines’ drug trade, and his work as an informant while a turf war begins to brew between the two rival gangs wanting control of the city. As the hunt for the child becomes more desperate, Virdee moves ever closer to Riaz’s side of the line. The idea of the conflicted cop is of course one with which we are familiar, but it is given fresh life here – in a situation where corruption begins to seem almost like sheer common sense. Do the bad thing to a bad man and get a good family their boy back. If you can’t fix your own family, at least do what you can to fix theirs.Dhand says he wrote the book first in the form of a screenplay and it shows. There is no waste: everything that happens is punchy and earns its place. He has a gift of an actor in Nair, whose charisma allows Virdee to be ineffably cool and also wholly convincing as a man still struggling to come out from the shadow of his father’s influence and build a life that is properly his own. Dhand’s show is a minor study in masculinity as well as in racial, religious and intra-community divisions, and it does all this with a light but wholly assured touch.And it is, throughout, tremendous fun; the action moves fast and touches on most of the traditional thriller tropes only to give them a fresh new spin as it flies past. I hope Dhand is already hard at work adapting the next book.

Yes, you the foreign-looking one. Get a move on. And you can leave that puffer jacket behind. That wasn’t a present. You were only lent it because you said you were cold.“Hurry up, now. Up the stairs with you. And no more of that ‘chicken nugget bollocks’. You can eat something else where you’re going. Try the lamb kebab.“And you, you can stop loitering at the back. What? Oh, sorry. I didn’t realise you were a security guard. You all look the same with your pixellated faces. Come along. We haven’t got all day.“What’s that? You want a window seat? You’ll take what you’re given. Just count yourself fortunate we’re not sending you Ryanair. Then you really might have a hostile environment to complain about.”Monday was borders and security day. The day when Labour was out to prove it could be every bit as beastly to immigrants asNigel Farage. No need to get competitive with the Tories, as all they had ever managed to do was send four volunteers to Rwanda. But Reform UK was more of a problem. Now the party had more than 200,000 members. Some of whom had voted Labour at the last election.The competition was on – to see who could channel their inner sadism best. There were no votes to be had in compassion. Affording people dignity. That was so last year. Now the fashion was to celebrate human misery. To turn deportation into a spectator sport.See that sucker on the plane? He just spent a fortune getting to the UK and now he’s being sent back. Where to, you ask? Oh, anywhere. Africa, Asia, Europe. Antarctica if necessary. Anywhere will do. Just as long as everyone knows we’re being tough. Manhandle them a bit. Do it when it’s dark. That always makes things look much worse.“We’ve got to be more Reform than Reform,”Yvette Coopertold her team. “We’ve got a good news story here. We’re already deporting 25% more undesirables than the Tories ever did. But no one believes us.“We’ve got to turn it into a reality show. Let the public vote for their top 100 foreigners they would like to see kicked out of the country. So how about a trailer? We shoot afilm noirof people having the worst day of their life and make it into a suspense thriller. To be continued…”So late on Monday afternoon, theHome Officereleased its own soon-not-to-be Oscar nominated short. Two minutes and 46 seconds of torture porn. And somehow they managed to screw it up. By making you wonder what the point of it had been.The film opened with a shot filmed from the top of some steps up to a plane. After a few seconds some blanked-out faces appear. Most of whom are wearing hi-vis jackets. It seems to take four members of Border Force to deport one foreigner.Then we cut to a bus waiting at the bottom of the steps. Another foreigner gets out, followed by four men in hi-vis jackets. Then the same thing happens again. And again. By the end of the film there are five foreigners onboard the plane. We end with a short clip of a plane taking off. We have no idea if it was the same one we saw earlier.And that was it. We were left with no idea of who was being deported or why. They could all just have been extras from Silent Witness. All that was missing was Emilia Fox giving her concentration face in the pathology lab. It was little more than performative cruelty. And for no good reason. Because something like this was never going to appeal to Reform voters anyway. This wasn’t a mass deportation. Just a select handful. So disappointing. Barely an aperitif for the average sadist.Nige would have done this so much better. Would not have bothered pixellating the faces. Would have let us see the suffering. It’s not enough for us to keep our borders secure. Others have to be made miserable in the process. And most of all the video failed on its own terms.Reform voters won’t have watched and thought: “Ah!Labourare serious about immigration. We no longer have to vote Reform.” They will have just realised they had been right to switch to Reform all along. Why vote Labour when you can have the real thing?While Yvette was trying to act like Nige,Keir Starmerand Angela Rayner were out on a walkabout in Cornwall with the king. As good a way to waste time as any. I mean, it wasn’t as if any of them were actually achieving anything much by wandering around a new build, sustainable development. No wonder Charles devotes so much time in an existential meltdown. A helicopter flight just to say “marvellous” over and over again.“I’m called Charles, too,” said one of the locals. What were the chances?As for Keir, he quickly lost interest. He just wanted to build 1.5m homes in the next four and a half years. Charles had barely managed 800 in 10 years. Time to turn the tables. Could he go inside and check some of the houses? To make sure there were no immigrants hiding inside them. Foreigners were tricky bastards. You couldn’t trust them an inch. Some of them were bound to have found their way to Newquay. Even just one would do. Would make the day worthwhile. Yvette would be forever in his debt.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumThe politics sketchKeir StarmerYvette CooperForeign policyHome OfficeLabourNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

I’d build dream homes, cultivate a neighbourhood of weird and wonderful friends and live out a fantasy adult life.So when EA surprise-dropped a rerelease ofThe Sims 1 and 2last weekend to celebrate the series’ 25th anniversary, with all expansions included (my nine-year-old self’s dream) naturally I was compelled to return to my happy place, revisiting my 10-hour pyjama-clad marathon sessions micromanaging the lives of the Newbies, Roomies, and the Goths, and occasionally removing their pool ladders when they were taking a little swim, and only taking a necessary pause for mum’s roast dinner.While the familiar chaos of breezy music, tragic pool accidents, and my own personal french maid delivered a powerful dose of nostalgia, there is something else lurking beneath this game’s quirky and cheerful exterior, something that I wasn’t conscious of when I was a kid. To my surprise, the game now feels less like a chance to live out your dream life, and more like a struggle simulator. (I also forgot how much time my Sims spent playing chess.) Like a Lynchian picket-fence town, I realised, there’s a darkness lurking under suburban sheen.The original Sims games were more dystopian than today’s perky, brightly coloured The Sims 4. The Sims 1 instead offers a desaturated daily grind. The contrast isn’t just the aesthetic – 20 years ago, Sims had no dreams or ambitions. Your virtual families worked long hours for expensive lives, where death – and some of the most gut-wrenching music in game history – lurked behind even mundane everyday tasks.Forget personality, aspirations and tastes. The Sims 1 is a capitalist nightmare where survival trumps self-actualisation.View image in fullscreenMind the spontaneously combusting ovens! … Sims 1 + 2.I forgot how much time the original Sims actually spend working. They do boring, dull jobs for little pay, out of your sight – making the simple message that you get when they are promoted (or passed over) strangely impactful. Put that meagre wage packet towards the cheapest oven on offer, and it’ll probably catch fire and kill you. This is a game that punishes you for being poor. It means that the rich, like the iconic Goth family, in their still-stunning graveyard-edged stone mansion stay, rich – while the poor stay poor. Social mobility in The Sims 1, I learned, is near impossible.And having a social life? Forget it, at least when you’re on the bottom rung of your random career ladder. There’s simply no time to make friends, something I didn’t remember from my days as a Sims-obsessed tween. I now realise that my neighbourhood’s messy EastEnders-level entanglements were largely scripted in my head. Instead, you must chip away at ++ and – – relationship scores until you can finally, anticlimactically ‘Play in bed,’ thanks to the Livin’ it Up expansion pack that provided the world’s most basic sex education to a generation of 11-year-olds. There’s nothing dark about that expansion’s heart-shaped bed. I still want it in real life.Even these moments with the most meaningful loves of my Sims’ lives seemed to offer them nothing – they were transactional, serving nothing more than to unlock new interactions. They are performing for my enjoyment, not theirs.Friendship is also bleakly transactional here: you need a certain number of them to climb the ranks at work. Stay lonely, and you’ll stay poor, and probably die from having a cheap, spontaneously combusting microwave. It’s an especially sad existence for single Sims who live alone. Exhausted from work, if you don’t find time to call your friends on the phone for hours – or they decline to come over – your relationships decay rapidly. Like Black Mirror’s award-winningNosediveepisode, losing social credibility quickly sees things spiral quickly downhill for your Sims.And nothing flips a millennial’s stomach as quick as the music that heralds a terrifying, sudden burglary. It’s still horrifying 25 years later, so just hope that you had the foresight to spend your meagre savings on a burglar alarm. That’s before we even get into visits from the Grim Reaper, and creepy prank calls. These unexpected callers frighten me just as much now as they did then.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m finally living my fantasy adult life – I just didn’t realise it would be less lounging in gothic-mansion dream homes, and more feeling overworked, underpaid and on the verge of a spiralling breakdown. In 2025, an era of economic anxiety and burnout, the grind of The Sims feels brutal.For all its existential dread, The Sims 1 is still an escape. Sure, it presents a kind of capitalist nightmare. But, it is a capitalist nightmare you can control. No matter how hard the daily slog got, you can always type in a cheat code and wipe away financial stress with a click – the ultimate fantasy. It’s also weirdly accurate: just like in real life, external advantages (and cheating the system) are way more likely to lead to success than grinding away and following the rules.Yes, The Sims 1 was and remains a dystopian suburban treadmill, but it also makes room for humour. It’s a world where chaos is funny, failure is temporary, and the worst tragedies could be undone with the click of a mouse.Explore more on these topicsGamesPCSimulation gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Chopping down trees destroys habitats for wildlife, and growing new trees cannot replace the biodiversity ofold-growth forests. There is also a decades-long time lag between the carbon dioxide released from the burning, which fuels the climate crisis now, and the uptake of equivalent carbon from the air by replacement trees.So when the governmentannounced on Monday that it would continue billpayer subsidies for biomass burning at the Drax power station, beyond 2027 when the current payments end, the newsappeared a blow to green campaigners.Coming on the back ofgovernment support for a third runway at Heathrow, an intense row over thefuture of the North Sea that could result in the go-ahead for a vast new oilfield, and delay to regulations that wouldrequire landlords to make rental homes more energy-efficient, the Drax decision was the latest in a series of key tests of Labour’s green intentions.“People have started doubting this government’s commitment to the environment. More subsidies forDraxonly adds fuel to those growing doubts,” said Matt Williams, senior advocate for the Natural Resources Defence Council. “This means more destruction of the world’s forests and the climate. Every single tree burned in a UK power station is one tree too many.”View image in fullscreenThe Drax power station.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverChris Packham, the wildlife campaigner, criticised the decision as “nothing short of absolute madness”.Other experts took a softer view, however. Drax will be hard to replace and the settlement announced on Monday halves its subsidies, limits them to four years, and imposes stringent new conditions on the sustainability of its operations. “Its legacy is high emissions and forest destruction and the sooner Drax is closed down the better,” said Ed Matthew, campaigns director at the E3G thinktank. “This temporary lifeline doesn’t hide the fact that its green credentials lie in tatters, and halving its subsidy is a firm vote of no confidence. Drax’s days are numbered.”Once the biggest coal-fired power station in the UK, the Drax power plant in Yorkshire completed its switch to biomass in 2018, in return for an estimated £11bn in subsidies, on a promise of environmental sustainability thatsoon rang hollow. The company has been found to have misreported data on its wood sourcing, and has fought to keep secret a report that could betray its eligibility for billpayer subsidies.But Drax also provides a hefty slice of the UK’s electricity, somewhere between 4% and 6% of overall power, or about 8% of the “low-carbon” output. It can also generate baseload electricity when the wind is not blowing and the sun not shining.Will Gardner, the chief executive of Drax, said: “Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system. The size, flexibility and location of the power station makes it important for UK energy security and the proposed agreement helps protect the jobs and skills of today and the future.”Although experts have shown that theUK could meet its target of decarbonising electricity by 2030 without Drax, that “could” rests on many ifs: that new offshore and onshore wind, and the grids upgrades they require, are built fast; that electricity storage options are installed in time; that demand management, for instance throughsmart metering, is rolled out imminently.“It would be a brave decision to cut off Drax in 2027 [when its current subsidies run out],” conceded Doug Parr, the chief scientist of Greenpeace. He is firmly opposed to biomass for power, but acknowledges that the government faced the possibility of power shortages if replacement green generation could not be built in time. “There is a potential capacity issue that you might be able to solve without Drax, but might not.”He said the new settlement was “not perfect, but it could have been a lot worse”.Other green analysts agree. Frankie Mayo, of the Ember thinktank, said: “This is good news for consumers, and bad news for Drax. The new subsidies end after four years, are much lower than previously enjoyed, and with far more restrictions. This is one way to reduce consumer bills; in the long term it is important that the government forges ahead with building a modern power system to bring down costs for households for good.”Labour now faces further crunch decisions. The forthcoming comprehensive spending review is likely to be disappointing, as reaching net zero requires some upfront spending of the kind the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, seems set against. There is clamour for more spending on roads, airports and other high-carbon infrastructure that it is claimed will produce jobs and growth. Most controversial of all is the future of the Rosebank oilfield, which some within government are understood to want to go ahead, despite having pledged to end new oil and gas licensing.“There is a ‘growth is king, growth at all costs’ narrative,” said Parr. “There is a fight going on inside government. But this [Drax decision] is not a gung-ho deregulatory decision. It shows that we can get better outcomes. There is everything to play for.”Explore more on these topicsEnergyUtilitiesGreenhouse gas emissionsGreen politicsDraxanalysisShareReuse this content"

Moss tied in thread. Crack? Organic shea butter. Cocaine bricks? Shrink-wrapped foam blocks. Designers reveal the secrets of faking drugs onscreen – from popping sugar pills to snorting vitamin DKate LloydMon 10 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 11.16 ESTShare‘Suitcases of drugs are not exactly something you’d expect to bring to work,” says Paul Cross, who was the production designer ofSupacell,the crime-laced superhero series that launched last year. Cross has had to handle quite a few in his time though, albeit fake. He recently found himself driving around London with a vanload of fake cocaine bricks. “It’s quite an odd feeling,” he says. “Not something you’d do in your day-to-day life.”From hip teen shows to crime dramas, scenes involving drugs are often pivotal in modern TV series – and ensuring these moments are safe, legal and realistic has become so important to producers that thousands of pounds can be spent on getting it right. For every brick of fake cocaine off-loaded into a fake drug den, someone like Cross has spent weeks crafting the perfect powder texture. For every pill taken by an actor, a huge amount of toil has gone into making sure it’s not harmful.We essentially had our own trap house, with six to eight people making baggies – it was like Miami ViceWhen it comes to props that actors snort, smoke or swallow, there are industry standards. Cocaine is often replicated with glucose, B12 or vitamin C powder, although the most common substitute is milk or lactose powder. “It mixes with the water in your nose and basically turns into milk,” explains Philipp Barnett, who worked on Sam Levinson’s messy, cool teen dramaEuphoria, as well asGriselda, the show about Colombian coke-smugglers.Legal weed alternatives are frequently used: plants grown without psychoactive chemicals. “It’s like disappointing weed!” Cross says. Anything else smoked is typically nicotine-free herbal cigarettes. Meanwhile, ecstasy and diazepam are sometimes substituted with sweets, but more often with sugar pills bought from pharmacists specialising in placebo drugs made especially for TV – complete with breakdowns of allergy information. “Placebo companies are extremely expensive,” says Cross. “You could easily spend £1,000 and only get the equivalent amount of the real drug you’d find on the street.”View image in fullscreen‘The entire set was moved to recreate the drug’s effect’ … Zendaya in Euphoria.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyThis means that when drugs are needed on a larger scale – such as to fill a trap house with fake MDMA, crack cocaine, cocaine and weed, as he was doing on Supacell – productions have to get creative. They used organic shea butter for crack which, says Cross, “didn’t break the same way but looked authentic from a distance”. For the weed, they wrapped moss in thread, sprayed it with glue, and rolled it in herbs. Meanwhile, 1,000 blocks of cocaine were created by wrapping the foam blocks used for flower-arranging in shrink wrap. The entire process took about a month.“We had a dedicated area in the art department with about six to eight people focused solely on making and bagging drugs,” Cross says. “We essentially had our own trap house running upstairs. It was like Miami Vice.” How many little plastic baggies did they need? “Thousands.”For Griselda, Barnett and his team employed Styrofoam bricks dusted with milk powder. “In one scene, Griselda captures some product from the competition and ceremoniously sets it ablaze. We had to ensure it could burn without melting into Styrofoam goo. The biggest surprise came when we shot the scene with a drone: the updraft from the fire combined with the drone’s downdraft created a fire vortex, and we almost set the surrounding palm trees on fire.”While TV shows don’t have drug coordinators in the same way that they have intimacy coaches, most British crime dramas do consult with advisers – typically former police officers, who ensure drug-related storylines maintain realism. Some shows go further. John Singleton, the director ofSnowfall, an 80s-set drug-dealing drama, employed ex-convict Avance “Smokey” Smith, who’dgrown upin LA at that time, around “gangs and drugs” and with a parent using crack cocaine, to provide personal insight.Smokey provided input on everything from the clothes and hair of the era to how to make realistic-looking fake crack using the same recipe dealers would use to dupe addicts in LA. “It’s a pill called Pamprin. When you crush it and mix it with vitamin E and baking soda, it makes it clump up.”View image in fullscreenAdvised by a former prisoner … Snowfall.Photograph: Michael Yarish/Michael Yarish/FXRobb Wilson King, Breaking Bad’s production designer, took a similar approach to making sure the crystal meth on the “schoolteacher to drug kingpin” drama was realistic, consulting with both officers from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and dealers he befriended on the streets of Albuquerque, where they were shooting the show.“By operating this way,” King recalls, “we were able to access neighbourhoods and homes used for cooking meth. We even made friends with some of these people.” The chemical smell of the drug being manufactured lingers in his memory. “It was pretty scary. You’re dealing with a real dangerous thing. If it’s done wrong in your presence, you could suffer. But it’s important to feel it and see it – you can translate that to film.” He learned what tools were needed to create “lo-fi” meth in labs constructed from everyday kitchen equipment that “could blow up at any time”.They did “mid-range” cooking as well, he adds, and a DEA consultant was on hand to educate the team about how meth is made, consumed and even how their raids are conducted. “They were also likely there to ensure we didn’t spill too many beans in the show, because there were a lot of secrets involved. You don’t want ‘the cooking family’ to know what the DEA is doing.” The fake meth they created was so realistic, says King, it sometimes got stolen from the set.Fake drugs would also vanish from the set ofSkins, the wild, 2007 teen drama, but that was the least of the team’s concerns while filming the show’s notorious party scenes. Amelia Shankland, production designer, recalls that filling the background with young extras who had no prior TV experience could lead to things getting chaotic. “We’d have parties where people brought their own things in. As you can imagine, when you’re working on a project where everyone is supposed to be absolutely caned, not everyone will be acting. Some will actually be caned. Navigating that line can be quite tricky.”Today, a big issue is convincing actors to consume the fake drugs. “On something likeSkins, it was a young group of actors who were probably a lot more tolerant of things,” says Shankland. “Most actors don’t like smoking herbal cigarettes because they can be rough to inhale. I imagine it’s the same with snorting anything.”View image in fullscreenBrand problems … Sagar Radia as Rishi in druggy financier series Industry.Photograph: Nick Strasburg/BBCActor Jonah Hill has spoken candidly about his experience of snorting vitamin D as faux cocaine in The Wolf of Wall Street. “If you get that much in your lungs, you get very sick,” he revealed. “It sort of clogs your nose up,”Andrew Rannells said of snorting vitamin B12 in Girls. “I do think there’s a tiny bit of placebo effect. You do have energy – but it’s not the best way to take vitamins!”As for scenes where actors are smoking weed, Barnett says: “The biggest challenge is making it look authentic – because most actors aren’t smokers. Holding a cigarette becomes something they might need to practise.”Another difficulty regards brand placement. TV shows will often borrow items like tech, alcohol and clothing from brands to use while filming, under the agreement that they won’t be used in scenes where characters are doing anything that could be damaging to their reputations. Dominic Roberts, who worked on season two of the drug-fuelled investment banker series Industry, said this was a particular challenge on the show. “Where characters are obviously wealthy,” he says, “they’re likely to use top-end phones. Quite frankly, those manufacturers don’t really want to see people snorting cocaine off their phone,” he says. To navigate this, they put phones in cases and replaced premium tech with non-branded alternatives during drug-taking scenes.Oh my God, I’ve met the people who own this house!Another tricky area involves any drug that features a logo, like ecstasy tablets or drug baggies. “We can’t display graphics or photographs that haven’t been cleared,” Roberts explains, meaning permission had to be sought. This necessitated a lot of detective work: “Who designed this little smiley face, or this unicorn on this pill?”However, the most important hurdle in showing drugs on TV often lies in authentically capturing the intensity of a drug-fuelled experience. Skins had the advantage of a young, partying cast and crew. So instead, production designers focused on creating the right setting: houses borrowed for parties looked so trashed that when the cast arrived, it felt like they’d been raving for hours. That meant strewing mess everywhere and even throwing things at the walls. Shankland says: “I was like, ‘Oh my God, I’ve met the people who own this house.’”For Euphoria, designers used elaborate staging to take viewers on a high with the characters. “In the first season,” says Barnett, “whenZendaya, in a drug-fuelled state, climbs a set of stairs and goes through a hallway that becomes unstable, the entire set had to be built on a pivot and then moved to recreate that effect.”When filming wraps up, what happens to all the fake drugs? For Cross, on Supacell, the process was simple: it all got blown up. “There’s a gunfight in the trap house, with puffs of cocaine exploding in the air. We got good value out of it.” On Breaking Bad, meanwhile, the team had created a faux product so authentic-seeming that they were not allowed to hold on to it. “We had to return everything to the DEA,” says King, “so they could destroy it as if it were real. They didn’t want it out there on the streets.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBreaking BadZendayaSkinsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Just don’t expect to see any live action, let alone Gary Linekerpresenting in his underpants.Six months after the current Premier league season began, the state broadcaster, Korean Central Television (KCTV), has started broadcasting matches in January, albeit with the heavy-handed intervention of the Pyongyang regime’s censors, according to the US-based website38 Northin a report on how the reclusive country’s 26 million citizens get their fix of the beautiful game.Using archives of North Korean TV broadcasts received via satellite, and a database of TV programme schedules compiled by South Korea’s unification ministry, the analysis covers the2022 World Cupin Qatar and Women’s Asian Cup in 2023, as well as the Premier League and theChampions League.The coverage is almost certainly a breach of copyright. North Korea does not have the rights to broadcastPremier Leaguefixtures – an arrangement that could be a breach of international sanctions targeting the country’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. “How KCTV gets the footage is a mystery,” the report said.In 2022, North Korean TV broadcast matches from English, German, French, Spanish and Italian leagues, but since 2023 has opted exclusively for the Premier League, the Champions League and World Cup, according to the report.View image in fullscreenNorth Korean TV graphics renamed the South Korean women’s team ‘puppets’ during coverage of the Asian Games.Photograph: Courtesy of 38 NorthThe coverage is far from comprehensive. Typically, a 90-minute match is edited down to an hour, and screen graphics in English are overlaid with ones in Korean. Other logos present on the video are blurred, probably to conceal the name of the original overseas broadcaster. At one stage, censors even masked pitch-side advertising, but have since relented.Coverage of the 2024-25 Premier League season began on 13 January with a match between Ipswich and Liverpool – 150 days after the game was held. The next broadcast, two days later, was also of a match that had been played the previous August.The broadcasts are pundit-free zones, according to one of the report’s authors, Martyn Williams, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center, a thinktank that publishes 38 North. “There is no studio,” he said. “It’s straight into the game, which carries Korean commentary from KCTV over the crowd noise.“Most homes appear to have TV these days and KCTV is the most widely received national network, so most homes are able to watch.”KCTV shows only a fraction of the 380 Premier League matches played in a season, and those that are televised are typically repeated at least three times, the report said. Just 21 matches from the 2023-24 season were shown.Korean Central Television shows North Korea’s team lifting the Under-20 Women’s World Cup last year.Photograph: Courtesy of 38 NorthAnd as in previous years, an incomplete schedule means it is unlikely that North Korean viewers will ever discover the destination of this year’s Premier League title. While KCTV broadcast the final stage of last year’s Champions League, the matches were not shown in chronological order.There were fewer frustrations for fans during coverage of the 2022 World Cup. The state broadcaster showed, with a delay of just a few hours, all of the tournament’s fixtures, with four exceptions: all three of South Korea’s group matches and, possibly for technical reasons, USA v Wales. KCTV lifted its ban on the South’s footballers only to show them being knocked out of the tournament by Brazil. In 2023, North Korean graphics labelled South Korea’s female players “puppets” during a match at the Asian Games in Hangzhou,China.View image in fullscreenWolves forward Hwang Hee-chan.Photograph: Ryan Crockett/Every Second Media/REX/ShutterstockAnimosity towards the South extends to Premier League coverage, to the possible frustration of North Koreans with a soft spot for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Tottenham Hotspur and Brentford. The presence of South Korean players – Hwang Hee-chan, Son Heung-min and Kim Ji-soo, respectively – at those clubs mean they are not considered fit for consumption in the North, whose leader,Kim Jong-un, has labelled the South his country’s “number one hostile state”.Kim’s frequentdemonisation of the westhas not prevented England’s top domestic league from becoming a regular presence on TV in North Korea, a football-obsessed country with a proven pedigree in international competitions.View image in fullscreenSon Heung-min of Tottenham shoots during a EFL Cup semi-final 2nd leg match against Liverpool.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAThe North Korea men’s team famouslyreached the quarter-finalsof the 1966 World Cup, via a shock victory over Italy; last year the country’s female playerswontheir third U-20 Women’s World Cup.“With propaganda making its way into almost every aspect of North Korean television, international sports coverage is one of the few moments each day when state TV is not trying to send an overt or underlying message to its viewers,” the 38 North report said. “That may be sufficient to make it enjoyable.”Explore more on these topicsNorth KoreaAsia PacificPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He begged Pat to help him die, something he could not do. Assisting a suicide currently attracts a sentence of up to14 years in jail. When Pat’s brother contracted the same disease he couldn’t bear the thought of suffering in the same way, so he took his own life. His wife held his hand as he did so. Both she and her daughter, who was also in the house at the time, were then subjected to a months-long police investigation. When Pat’s sister found she had motor neurone disease she was determined to go to Dignitas, and died alone, far from home, without her loved ones to support her.I believe we have a duty to help families like Pat’s and to spare people a horrendous death when no other option is available to them.But we have to do it in a way that protects others from the risk of being coerced or pressured into a decision they wouldn’t otherwise take voluntarily.I’ve paid careful attention to all the evidence we have received, both orally and in writing, which is why I’m now proposing to make my bill even more robust, without making it so difficult to navigate that it would be too much of a burden for people in the last months of their lives to undertake.The advice from a wide range of witnesses, including medical professionals, lawyers, palliative care specialists, and experts in the fields of disability, coercive control and other disciplines, has been to introduce a multidisciplinary layer of protection. What they said to us makes sense, so later this week I’ll be proposing an amendment to create a voluntary assisted dying commission. It would be chaired by a high court judge or a former senior judge, thus retaining the judicial element in my bill. The commission would then authorise expert panels to look at every application for an assisted death. Those panels would have a legal chair, but also include a psychiatrist and a social worker, who will bring their own expertise in assessing mental capacity and identifying any risk of coercion. In short, I’m proposing what could be termed “Judge Plus”.The evidence we have heard from other jurisdictions that have already introduced tightly drawn laws like mine is that fears about vulnerable people being pressured into asking for an assisted death haverarely, if ever, been borne out in practice. Family and loved ones are far more likely to try to persuade a person not to do so. But I have promised to do everything I can to ensure my bill has the strongest safeguards anywhere in the world, and this change will meet that promise by making it even more robust than it was already.So I’m looking forward to the process of line-by-line scrutiny of the legislation that will start this week. But I’m very clear that we must keep at the front of our minds the terminally ill people and bereaved relatives such as Pat Malone who are being failed so abysmally by the legal quagmire they face now.Kim Leadbeater is MP for Spen Valley and sponsor of the assisted dying billDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He hassanctioned the international criminal court. This empowers him to seize any funds belonging to the court or its judges or employees and to ban them from entering the US. He issued a similar sanction, during his previous presidency, but it was overturned by Joe Biden before court challenges to it could be heard. This time it will prevent ICC leaders from entering New York to report to the UN and will end cooperation to provide evidence to ICC prosecutors for action against Russian commanders. The greatest beneficiary of Trump’s sanction will be Vladimir Putin.Australia is one of the 125 state members of the ICC but, inexplicably, it has not yet spoken out against Trump’s puerile initiative. Seventy-nine state members immediately did so, with allies including the UK, Germany and France describing their support for the court’s independence, impartiality and integrity as “unwavering”. They warned that Trump’s decision might imperil the confidentiality and safety of victims of the crimes being investigated.While Trump is moving fast and breaking things, Americans wanting to escape should come to Australia | Julianne SchultzRead moreAustralia should speak out in similar terms. Our judges and our lawyers played a vital part in the Tokyo trials after the second world war, and Australia made a significant contribution to the trials of war criminals in the Balkans and Sierra Leone, and has fully supported the ICC up to this point. Trump’s hostility provides no reason to withdraw from a court which has so much work still to do in Myanmar, Sudan, the Congo and elsewhere, since 20 armed and lethal conflicts continue, in the world, at present.There are some voices loud in the Murdoch press, demanding vengeance on the ICC for issuing an arrest warrant forBenjamin Netanyahu, and this was given by Trump as the reason for his action. This does not necessarily mean that Netanyahu will be incarcerated – like the Kenyan president a few years ago, he will be granted bail. He will have a fair trial, be able to hire the best lawyers, entitled to have the charges thrown out and to have all defence rights in an independent and impartial court where the prosecution will have to prove the charges it brings, beyond reasonable doubt.These allegations cry out to be heard. Using starvation as a tactic of war, if there is sufficient evidence, demands an answer. So does the question of whether indiscriminate bombing (it has killed 45,000 civilians so far, almost half of them children) is a proportionate response to the obscene Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 That attack provided a right to self-defence and to free the hostages but not a licence to kill tens of thousands Gazan citizens, mainly children, by way of indiscriminate bombing of residential areas.Yet Trump’s thinking is shared by millions ofRepublicanswho do not believe that Israel can do any wrong, or that Americans and Israelis should ever be brought to justice in an international court. This “exceptionalist” approach began with Senator Jesse Helms, who promoted the puerile “Hague Invasion” Act, (the American Service-Members’ Protection Act), which is still in force, authorising the president to use military force against the ICC and against the Netherlands should the ICC detain a US official or military personnel.The ICC is not alone. Trump has pulled out of the World Health Organizatin and the Paris climate accords, and his disbandment of USAid is acknowledged as a catastrophe for humanitarian assistance. His contempt for law extends to the law of the US, with his blatantly unconstitutional executive order to deny citizenship rights to many immigrant children “born in the USA”. As for his pardoning of criminals guilty of serious assaults on the police in the January 6 insurrection, perhaps a journalist could ask our own former police officer Peter Dutton how that sits with him.Trump’s attack on the ICC is designed to intimidate and stop it from working against war criminals. But the most damage it will do is to the standing of Americans in general, tarred with the brush of this felon that their fellow citizens have elected to be their president. US international lawyers played a leading role in Nuremberg and beyond, envisioning and building the ICC, but no one bothers to take notice of them now.US diplomats cannot be trusted, and heaven knows what dodgy contributor to his campaign Trump will appoint as his ambassador to Australia. Some readers may be old enough to remember “Mr Ed”, the friend of “LBJ”, widely likened to television’s talking horse. At the end of the day Trump is a problem for Americans – but Australia must speak up with its other allies to express unwavering support of international justice.Geoffrey Robertson AO KC is the author of Crimes Against Humanity, the Struggle for Global Justice, the next edition of which is published by Penguin this monthExplore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyOpinionDonald TrumpInternational criminal courtAustralian politicsIsraelIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahucommentShareReuse this content"

The left must hold on to its valuesZoe WilliamsEven his most ridiculous executive orders have an ugly effect on politics around the world. We can’t just ignore the US president. But nor can we succumb to the momentum of the rightMon 10 Feb 2025 12.46 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 19.06 ESTShareThe problem with Trump’s America is that everything happens so fast, and across too many categories. There are moves so stupid and trivial that you can lose hours wondering whether there is a long game or if it’s all just trolling: renaming the Gulf of Mexico, bringing back plastic straws. There are moves so inhumane, causing so much deliberate suffering, that they are hard to fathom. The cancellation of USAid is so consequential that reaction has almost frozen in place, as the world figures out which immediate humanitarian crisis to prioritise, and waits for some grownup, such as the constitution, to step in. Into that baited silence steps Elon Musk, with ahoax about the agencyhaving been a leftwing money-laundering organisation. Then everyone hares off to react to that, first debunking, then considering, what it might mean, for a man of such wealth and power to have come so completely unstuck from demonstrable reality. This is not an accident – and yet it has no meaning. So why is he doing it? To galvanise a base, or make a public service announcement that observable reality can’t help you now, so get used to having it overwritten by fantasy? It’s an understandable thing to worry about.Then there are the chilling direct legislative moves against sections of US society:banning the use of any pronounsthat are not male or female in government agencies, defunding gender-affirming medical care, signalling aban on transgender people in the militarywith an executive order that says being trans “conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honourable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life”. There’s the assault on immigrant rights, which is vivid and wide-ranging from the resurrection of Guantánamo Bay as a for ever holding-house, to theshackled people deported to Punjab, to thereversal of a conventionthat schools, churches and hospitals would not be raided byImmigration and Customs Enforcement.The sabre-rattling on tariffs throws up its own unstable side-show. Bit-part Republicans such as Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana senator, try to carve out some space in the drama with remarks so bracingly racist –the maternal death rate isn’t as bad if you don’t count black women, apparently – that you’re forced to give him the attention he craves. Ignoring him will not make him go away.There will never be any shortage of things to react to; nothing will ever be inconsequential. Even things that misfire comically or are immediately ruled illegal will have an effect, drive the debate to new lows and foster fear and division. And there will rarely, from outside the US, be any meaningful way to react; whatever ideas about democracy we’ve had to let go of in 2025, it remains bordered.There’s an agenda to that too, of course. If the watching world is constantly responding to things it can’t change or even protest about, that sends spores of impotence far and wide. Events in the US are already debasing our own discourse: Trump cheerleaders springing up with bizarre arguments and the leader of the opposition Kemi Badenoch strategically claiming thatliberalism has been “hacked”by groups focused on“radical green absolutism”. The effect? Everything is pushed rightwards.It might be impossible to blot out the drama, but we have to simultaneously focus on our own debates and our own terms – the threats to trans rights in our own country, the language on immigration in our own parliament, our own burgeoning politics of nastiness and tough-talking. We don’t have to surrender to the momentum of the right by becoming more like them. We don’t have to catch this virus because America sneezed.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But making the choice feels so much easier than keeping up with new releasesMon 10 Feb 2025 17.44 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 17.48 ESTShareIam a voracious reader, but it is easy to feel there are too many books in the world. How do you find the time to keep up with all those new releases? To say nothing of the overwhelm that comes from even stepping in a bookshop. There you’re faced with not only the latest titles but also the classics you’ve missed and the biographies you hadn’t heard of but find yourself drawn to. The library is the same – the masses of books too frequently inspires inertia.But around the corner from my house is the local little street library – a small wooden box with a plastic door, holding the donated books of my neighbourhood.If the books have really been squeezed in there and piled on top of each other, it can maybe fit two-dozen books. In a world filled with overwhelming choice, I love this little whittled-down selection. There may be a book I want to read, there may not. But making that choice feels so much easier.Deciding to read a book a week was the best new year resolution I ever made | Katie CunninghamRead moreThe little library provides a peek inside my middle-class neighbourhood. There is the person, or people, who have been clearing out their collection of diet cookbooks. The person who gets advanced reading copies and gives them away. The person who always drops off their copy of the Monthly, a month or two after it was released. I would love to know who seems to be slowly clearing out their collection of play scripts – and in doing so boosting my own collection. I’m interested in the people who drop off celebrity memoirs, the readers of the seemingly endless supply of sci-fi novels, and I wonder if the children have grown out of these picture books, or simply didn’t like them.Through their selection of books, I feel I’m getting closer to the people in my suburb.When I have only a limited selection to choose from, I often find myself turning over to read the blurb of books I haven’t heard of, books I possibly wouldn’t have chosen to glance at in spaces of more choice.There are people in my neighbourhood with very similar taste in books to me, but they are tapped into different circles. And so I find books which are perfectly suited to me but, somehow, passed me by: books like Cho Nam-Joo’s delightfully weird novelKim Ji-young, Born 1982, about depression and sexism in South Korea; or VV Ganeshananthan’s epic and sweeping, but still small and intimate,Brotherless Night, about the Sri Lankan civil war.I get my hands on the huge books that came out a decade ago which I didn’t read at the time, and then they faded from consciousness. This is how I come to read Donna Tartt’sThe Goldfinch(now one of my favourite novels), Paul Kalanithi’s beautiful memoirWhen Breath Becomes Airand Maggie O’Farrell’s delicateThe Hand That First Held Mine.I’m not looking at your beach body, I just want to know what you’re reading | Jodi WilsonRead moreI’ve read books I would have never thought to pick up from anywhere else. A huge fan of Ann M Martin’s Baby-Sitters Club series when I was young, I love finding the odd copy of the graphic novel adaptations (illustrated by Raina Telgemeier), which I can pick up and read in half an hour, remembering who I was when I loved these stories the first time. Going through a reading slump, I find someone has cleared out a big selection of Jodi Picoult. I haven’t read her in 15 years, and picking up one I haven’t read before is a panacea. (When I go to read a second one, I find I have reached my fill, and turn my attention elsewhere.)Not a huge genre reader, I pick out Richard Osman’sThe Thursday Murder Clubon a whim for an easy plane read. I devour it and am thrilled to see the next book in the series in the little library a few weeks later. I return the copies as I read them, and I imagine the private book club my neighbours and I are having as we read each one in turn.I still buy the latest releases; I still use my library card. But there is something nice in the quietness of the local little library, the way it connects me to my neighbourhood and to books that aren’t front of mind. I drop by every couple of days. I see if the books I’ve contributed have been picked up; I hope there will be something new for me to embrace. More often than not, I don’t pick up anything new. But the books will be waiting for me the next time I stop by, slowly turning over, in this little reflection of where I live.Jane Howard is a Walkley-award winning arts journalist and arts and culture editor at the ConversationExplore more on these topicsBooksOpinionLibrariesCommunitiescommentShareReuse this content"

Doesn’t sound so bad, does it? Don’t be fooledMon 10 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 10.49 ESTShareIn my continued quest for self-optimisation via silly wellness stuff, I was intrigued by a Vogue article on a new morning routine:30/30/30. That’s 30g of protein within 30 minutes of waking, then 30 minutes of “low-intensity” cardio. Apparently, it has “gained serious traction on social media”.Why not try it out? Well, for a start – and in fairness, Vogue mentioned this – it was devised by Gary Brecka, a “biohacker” (sigh) and Make America Healthy Again (Maha) enthusiast, who recently called Robert F Kennedy Jr“a true force of nature”. I suppose he is, like a tornado or a plague of locusts.Another problem became evident when I searched TikTok for more information and found that 30/30/30 mostly appears in one of its grimmest cesspits: weight-loss-Tok. I’m 50 and this disingenuous nonsense makes me feel insecure; it’s far worse for the teenagers it targets (the Disney+ documentary Social Studiesis absolutely chilling on this). Besides, I don’t want to lose weight – have you seen what’s going on out there? This is no time to shed precious fat reserves!However, by this point, I was committed – if ideologically opposed – to the thing, so I tried it out on Friday morning. I instantly discovered the biggest problem with this regime: 30g of protein is an absurd amount –two‑thirds of the recommended daily intakefor the average woman.

Now it’s being silenced by cuts that threaten our cultureWill HaywardLanguage, history and arts are what make us a nation – and they’re at risk when funding isslashed to levels among the lowest in EuropeMon 10 Feb 2025 07.17 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 12.01 ESTShareWhat is a nation? There are several, varying definitions, but ultimately it comes down to the same answer: a large group of people bound together through shared culture, history and language. For us in Cymru, the idea of a Welsh nation is something about which we are pretty sensitive and protective. Our most provocative historian,Gwyn Alf Williams, said that Wales has “from birth … lived with the threat of extinction” and that the survival of Welsh nationhood is “one of the minor miracles of history”.To those of you who mainly knowWalesthrough the occasional holiday, the Six Nations and Gareth Bale, this might sound an odd thing to say. After all, whenever you see Wales or Welsh people represented anywhere they are loudly and unequivocally, well, Welsh.But this is not merely an expression of pride; it is a necessity. Wales is a nation of just over 3 million people bordering a country of 57 million, so there is an ever present risk that we could be swallowed up and amalgamated. Our nation didn’t even have a capital city until Cardiff was named in 1955. This insecurity about our own existence is summed up in the chorus of the songYma o Hyd, which is sung before Welsh international football matches: “Ry’n ni yma o hyd/Er gwaetha pawb a phopeth.”This translates as: “We are still here, in spite of everyone and everything.”Back in 1997, Wales voted for devolution, and the Welsh assembly was created in 1999. This officially became the Welsh parliament (Senedd Cymru) in 2020. One of the overriding motivations for devolution was that it would protect Wales and Welsh nationhood. It came with the promise that the future development of our nation would be in our hands and safeguarded. However, the emptiness of this promise has been laid bare by a system that is in many ways the worst of both worlds. Wales is left with a UK government that feels it can wash its hands of responsibility for us, while successive Welsh governments have seemingly lacked the talent, drive or fiscal levers to make Wales better.If you want an example of this, look no further than the truly awful position of culture within Wales. The numbers are stark. Arecent Senedd committee reportfound that Wales ranks second from bottom, among selected European countries, in terms of cultural services spending for each person. Only Greece was lower. Even from the miserly wider UK perspective, Wales’s cultural spend is pitiful. Cymru spends £69.68 a person for cultural services, compared with the UK’s £91.12. For context, Spain spends about £113, Ireland £149, Belgium £209 and France £237. Iceland tops the table at £691.60. In sport, it is just as bad: Wales spends £5 to £6 a head; by contrast, Ireland spends £27.50.It wasn’t always this way. Welsh cultural budgets have been slashed over the last decade. Between2014/15 and 2024/25, funding for the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales has declined by 34% in real terms. Sport Wales has seen a 9% fall, the Books Council of Wales’s total income has reduced by 20% and revenue funding for the Arts Council of Wales reduced in real terms by 29%. It is heartbreaking to see how these cuts manifest themselves day to day across Cymru. Just last weekend, the National Museum Cardiff announced it wastemporarily closing its doorsbecause of the building’s deteriorating condition.It has since reopened, but still, events tell a story. Only nine months before, the Welsh culture secretary gave assurances the building would remain open.Wales trails behind most European countries in arts and sports funding, report findsRead moreNational Youth Arts Wales, which is an umbrella organisation for the likes of the National Youth Choir and National Youth Theatre (and where Michael Sheen, Matthew Rhys, Ruth Jones and Rakie Ayola started their journeys) has railed against the “shameful” state of youth arts funding in Wales. The situation has become such that Sheen last month funded thelaunch of the Welsh National Theatreafter the National Theatre Wales “ceased to exist” following £1.6m in cuts to its core funding from Arts Council of Wales.There is a wider issue here for Wales because the arts is also a vital way in which the Welsh language is promoted. Going back to that definition of what it is to be a “nation”, a key part of it is shared culture and language. These cuts are not merely tragic because they rob individuals of all the benefits that come with the arts; they are also robbing Wales of a major part of what makes it a nation.That the National Museum Cardiff building was closed because of its dilapidated state encapsulates this very issue. Its construction in 1912 began as part of a huge nation-building programme within Wales. It was about making Wales distinct. At the time, legislation covering England and Wales didn’t say “England and Wales” as it does now; it simply read “England” (this didn’t change till the 1950s). To be a nation and not merely an appendage of England, it was felt you needed a museum. Now, 25 years into devolution, it is crumbling due to lack of funds.The blame for this sorry state of affairs lies in several places. Since the onset of Tory austerity in 2010, successive Welsh Labour governments have had to reallocate money into a struggling health service, which has to contend with a population that is older, sicker and more spread out than in England. But the Welsh Labour government must not be given a pass on this. If they were acting in the theatre, their performance as the stewards of Wales’s culture would have been lampooned and derided for totally lacking in believability. While they have been dealt a tough hand financially, there are failings that they must own.‘I’m bursting with ideas’: Michael Sheen launches new national theatre for WalesRead moreLast weekendI published the contentsof a leaked internal report from within the “cultural division” inside the Welsh government, which surveyed the views of staff. This included condemnation of the alleged lack of “real performance management taking place” within the government, meaning that “managers who may not wish to have difficult conversations can avoid them and therefore staff who are not performing ‘get away’ with it”. It also found that staff felt “there was no sense of strategic long term planning” and there was “a widely held view that ministers’ expectations are not being managed”. It is woeful that this is the department charged with overseeing culture in Wales.When you erode Welsh culture you erode Wales. The arts are not a “nice to have”; they are vital. Urgent change is needed or else the land of song risks being finally silenced.Will Hayward is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsWelsh governmentOpinionArts fundingWelsh politicsArts policyWalesNational Theatre WalescommentShareReuse this content"

Herailedagainst the “unacceptably large profits” Drax has made, said past subsidy arrangements “did not deliver a good enough deal for bill payers” and vowed that that the definition of a “sustainable” wood pellet would be tightened. But the bottom line is that the government has agreed to crank the subsidy handle once again, just at a slower rate.Why? As he didn’t quite put it,Draxhas us over a barrel if we’re not prepared to use more gas to generate electricity. A renewables-heavy system needs firm, reliable power as backup. Transporting wood pellets from North America to burn in Yorkshire is deemed the solution to fill the gap. “The clear evidence is that Drax is important to delivering a secure, value for money power system in the period 2027 to 2031,” he concluded.Secure, yes. But value for money? Really? While Drax’s plant will have a “much more limited role” from 2027, the new financial arrangements must still look splendid from the company’s point of view. Drax gets a contract for difference (CfD) – essentially a guaranteed price for its power output – that is well above the market price. Expressed in 2012 prices (because that’s the way these things are done), the CfD comes in at £113 per megawatt hour, which equates to about £155 in today’s money. At that level, it makes Hinkley Point C, which will get £92.50 in 2012 prices, look a bargain.Add it all up and Drax thinks the power station will make £100m-£200m a year of top-line operating profits from this deal. When the alternative was cancellation of the subsidy show, that’s not a bad outcome. The stock market certainly saw the profit projections as acceptably large – the shares rose 4%. And the bonus on top is that the Yorkshire plant stays alive to chase the next round of subsidies, namely those for installing (as yet unproven) carbon capture technology in the 2030s.Nor have there been serious repercussions fromlast year’s finding that Drax’s controls were not up to scratchwhen it came to checking the sources of wood used from Canada in 2021 and 2022. The £25m fine at the time from Ofgem was loose change. Under the new rules, the portion of “woody biomass” that must come from sustainable sources will rise from 70% to 100%, which leaves one to wonder why it wasn’t 100% in the first place if we are expected to view wood-burning as “sustainable” generation because replacement trees absorb carbon.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its transition out of polluting coal was underwritten by bill payers. Now, when we might reasonably expect the company to compete on price, the subsidies keep rolling because cheaper generating capacity isn’t in place. Shanks blamed “the circumstances left by the previous government”, which is probably fair. Drax has cost bill payers a fortune over the years.

That agreement between the three nations explicitly bans tariff hikes beyond what was agreed. Yet, on his return to the White House, Mr Trump immediately threatened steep levies on goods from Canada and Mexico – the US’s key allies – retreating only after they made tokenconcessionson drugs and illegal immigration. Now, he’s vowing freshsteel and aluminumtariffs, a direct hit on Canada.Mr Trump is exploitingpresidential emergency powersto push these tariffs with no real constraints. The bottom line is the US is breaking its word. Friends, such as the EU and theUK, as well as opponents likeChinaare also under threat. Allies will think twice before signing deals with Washington, fearingfuture betrayals. Yet Mr Trump’s administration doesn’t care – it thrives on defying global norms. Skipping this year’sG20 summit– citing host South Africa’s focus on diversity, equality and climate action, alongside Elon Musk’s fixation on white South African farmers – Mr Trump’s team is mulling an exit from theIMF and World Bank.The US has been the linchpin of postwar order. It controls the world’sfinancial, technological and militarynetworks. While rivalparallelsystems are emerging, nothing yet seriously challenges US dominance. But Mr Trump’s talk of American strength through isolation obfuscates his immediate political objective: to repackage corporate power as economic populism. Mr Trump sells tariffs as a shield against globalisation, claiming to protect workers – while actually boosting Wall Street profits. Most wealthy nations – including the US – usedindustrial policies, export subsidies and tariffs to build their economies before shifting to consumption-driven growth. The US went the furthest in this regard, hollowing out its industries to a far greater extent thanGermany and Japan.Chinahas yet to fully shift toward a consumption-driven economy. Yet Mr Trump has convinced many Americans that globalisation alone fuelled China’s rise at their expense – a deliberate distortion. It is true that imports from China cost3.7mUS jobs, mostly in manufacturing. But that’s a tiny fraction of the 170-million-strong US workforce. Since 1970, USimportsas a share of GDP have risen from 5% to 15%, yet inflation-adjusted per capita GDP hastripled.Globalisation proved a golden age for the few not the many. US labour protections were dismantled and median wages stagnated. Since 1970, the top0.5%doubled their share of US wealth, now controlling 30% of the nation’s total assets. Mr Trump’s biggest first-term policy win was a$1.9tn tax cut– a giveaway to millionaires and corporations. But it was temporary and set to expire this year. Now, theWhite Housewants to make it permanent, at a cost so high – $4.6tn – that nothing else could get done.Since 2016, bothpartiesclaim to back trade policies that help US workers by levelling the playing field. But, so far, Mr Trump’s tariff threats are mostly political theatre. He postures as tough on trade while his main policy goal is to keep funnelling wealth to the elite through pursuing trickle-down economics on steroids. The US didn’t lose to globalisation – it was sabotaged from within. Politicians, especiallyRepublicans, rigged the system to serve capital over labour. Mr Trump blames foreigners to mask the real betrayal – an ongoing con at home.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

More than a decade of normalisation talks have so far been a road to nowhere, stymied principally by Serbia’s refusal to recognise its former territory’s right to the attributes of nationhood. In the country’s four northern Serb-majority municipalities, the deadlock has occasionally turneddeadlyas Kosovo’s prime minister, Albin Kurti, has attempted to enforce sovereignty, resisted by Belgrade-backed rebels.There are tentative grounds for hoping that theoutcomeof Kosovo’s latest election on Sunday, in which Mr Kurti’s ruling party came first but lost its majority, can deliver a route out of this impasse. Mr Kurti’s understandable but sometimes heavy-handed moves to demonstrate Pristina’s control over the north – such as imposing ethnic Albanian mayors after amass election boycottby ethnic Serbs – have been strongly criticised by both the European Union and the US. On the eve of the poll, Richard Grenell, the newly appointed US special envoy for special missions,saidthat relations between Washington and Pristina had “never been lower”.Meanwhile the EU has imposed sanctions that have so far cost one of the poorest and smallest nations in Europe about €150m (£125m). The prospect of a new coalition government in Pristina opens up the possibility of a less intransigent and more pragmatic approach. Both main opposition partiescampaignedon the need to improve relations with western partners, and anxiety over Kosovo’s isolation at a perilous geopolitical moment was one of the election’s major themes. If the new Kurti administration can move beyond sometimes strident nationalist rhetoric and get Brussels and Washington back onside, that will be overwhelmingly in Kosovo’s interest.The goal should be the belated implementation of a 2023 normalisationagreement, which theoretically obliged Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vučić, to recognise Kosovo’s nationhood, in exchange for semi-autonomous powers for ethnic Serbs in the north. But getting there will require Mr Vučić, who has constantly fanned the flames of ethnic tension, to cease playing to his own nationalist gallery and finally sign the deal.Brussels should respond to any conciliatory steps from Pristina with alacrity and generosity. It takes two to create a deadlock, but while one of the tiniest and most vulnerable nations in Europe has been punished by sanctions, its large, bullying and hostile neighbour has not, for reasons of regional realpolitik. Given the obvious and ominous precedent of Ukraine, Mr Kurti’s fears over Belgrade’s ultimate agenda in Kosovo’s north are entirely comprehensible. They will be compounded by the memory of Donald Trump’s previousbacking of a plan which at one stage included Kosovo’s partition.The EU has a new foreign affairs chief in the former Estonian prime ministerKaja Kallas, and a new special envoy for Kosovo and Serbia normalisation in the Danish diplomatPeter Sørensen– a regional specialist. Britain’s new special envoy to the region, Karen Pierce, was ambassador to the US for five years. That offers the opportunity for a fresh start in relation to a country that has established a well-functioning democracy in the most challenging of contexts. Kosovo’s next government needs to be more pragmatic and less driven by Mr Kurti’s “you’re with us or against us” brand of nationalism. But the west must do more than just meet it halfway.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus a letter fromStephanie O’BrienMon 10 Feb 2025 12.02 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 12.04 ESTShareFrances Ryan underestimates the effect of repeated attacks on benefits claimants and the damage that the potential changes being floated would unleash (As Labour touts more brutal cuts to benefits, how is this different from life under the Tories?, 5 February). As a mental health clinician, I cannot emphasise enough how many relapses have been triggered by the relentless media drumbeat about “cracking down” on benefits. This is not just political rhetoric; it lodges in the psyche, feeding precarity and self-doubt.When the government frames itself as the defender of the public purse at the expense of “fraudulent” claimants, it makes nearly all claimants feel like frauds. To combine this with the terrifying reality of what these speculative reforms could mean – sanctions for those too unwell to comply with back-to-work schemes, and the appalling prospect of removing or gutting the limited capability for work and work-related activity (LCWRA) group that overwhelmingly consists of people at substantial risk of mental collapse – is unconscionable.There are countless reforms that could be pursued without targeting society’s most vulnerable, starting with reducing the Department for Work and Pensions’ appalling record ofunderpaymentsand wrongful accusations that push claimants into crisis. A system built on trust rather than suspicion would not only cost less but would also reaffirm Labour’s founding values. It’s not too late for it to prove that it still stands for dignity, not destitution – by protecting, not punishing, those who need support the most.Dr Jay WattsLondonThank you, Frances Ryan, for highlighting a phrase beloved of our government that deeply troubles me: “working people”. Even worse, “working families”. If you are unable to work by virtue of age, ill health or disability, and have the temerity to be single, you are not a priority. You will also be expected to bear the brunt of the nightmare fiscal inheritance from the last government while wealthy individuals and multinationals remain untroubled by suggestions of tax increases. Many who votedLabourwill not do so again, myself included, because we are sickened by the expansion of gross inequality between the poorest and most vulnerable and the super-rich.Stephanie O’BrienLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This showed that all the options to create multiple unitary councils were extremely expensive and disruptive.PwC predicted that the loss of economies of scale at county level would cost billions across the country. With local government already on its knees, spending a fortune on a reorganisation to create a more costly alternative is the last thing we need. Our local council has had to set aside millions to pay for these changes. Who will tell us what benefits offset the extraordinary costs?Richard GilyeadSaffron Walden, EssexA well-run local authority is a pleasing experience. The borough council of King’s Lynn and West Norfolk, where I live, is in my opinion, one such council. The proposal to create a huge unitary authority of Norfolk and Suffolk is not the enhancing devolution experienced by Andy Burnham’s Manchester. Norwich will predominate and the margins will suffer. As a former resident of Cambridgeshire, I would say its elected mayor struggled to show any interest in the poorer rural areas in the north of the county.I am sure theLabourgovernment has an agenda, but this is not devolution. The fact that certain county councils appear to be embracing this possibly speaks more of executives’ and senior officers’ personal ambitions rather than improvements for the majority of residents. I do not want my opportunity to influence to be excised through cancelled elections.Anthony SaundersKing’s Lynn, NorfolkIt is possible that the changes to local government are necessary, and even democratically beneficial. What is not acceptable is delaying local elections in some areas because the new system is not ready to go. By deciding to delay the elections rather than delay the implementation of the new system until the next scheduled election date,Angela Raynerhas chosen to subvert the democratic process and deny millions the opportunity to express their views through the ballot box. Democracy delayed is democracy denied.I would not welcome the predicted increase in voter share by Reform UK, but better that and allow voters their say than deny them their democratic rights. Perhaps voters should be allowed a council tax “holiday” while they are denied any say in how their taxes are spent.Rodney LambertRomsey, HampshireLocal government reorganisation is a double whammy for 5 million people in England (Editorial, 6 February). First, they have been deprived of their right to vote in May and, second, they haven’t been consulted about who represents them in their area. Devolution isn’t just about boosting economic growth, it should also be about listening to and strengthening local communities, and maximising their input into the decisions that affect them. So far, that aspect of devolution has been ignored.Tom BrakeDirector, Unlock DemocracyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

A seriously impressive defence, it was just a pity they weren’t playing. Instead, Marcelo was there so they could pay homage to the full-back, who won 25 trophies with the club, in the week he announced his retirement. The other four had come to join him and support their teammates. None were dressed in white; all are injured.All of which would be bad enough, but it was about to get worse. The following afternoon, having been named in the squad to travel to Manchester, the captain pulled out too. In the past fortnight Lucas Vázquez had missed visits to Valladolid and Leganés as a precaution but eventually he too fell, calling from home after Sunday’s training session to say something wasn’t right in his thigh. He was the backup, a midfielder at full-back, albeit one who has played there for so long now that it has become his default role. There have been 36 injuries at Madrid this season, 26 of them muscular.Real Madrid v Manchester City ‘seems like a clásico’ now, says Carlo AncelottiRead moreThere had been something emotional in the way Carlo Ancelotti talked about those pre-match moments, something vindicatory too. In welcoming his injured players into the dressing room, he had drawn a conclusion and put together a defence of his own. “Before the game I saw Carvajal, Alaba, Militão and Rüdiger greeting their teammates; despite the difficulties we’re doing very well,” he said. By the end of the match, which ended 1-1, Madrid were still top, they are in the semi-final of the Copa del Rey, and they qualified for theChampions Leagueplayoffs, which certainly isn’t bad,considering.Ancelotti has called this a “total emergency”. When he comes to select his defence to faceManchester Cityat the Etihad, he will have two left-backs: Fran García and Ferland Mendy. Apart from that, he only has one actual defender: Raúl Asencio, a 21-year-old academy product in his debut season in the first team, for whom he has already played 19 games.That is according to the coach, anyway. In fact, Ancelotti also has Jesús Vallejo, the strange case of the central defender included in every squad, who sits on the bench every game but never comes on and doesn’t get mentioned by his manager. Vallejo has played once all season, coming on by popular and frankly tongue-in-cheek demand against Alavés with the team 3-0 up in a game they almost let slip, eventually winning 3-2. Before that he hadn’t played for Madrid since a brief, successful cameo at the Etihad two seasons earlier.View image in fullscreenAurélien Tchouaméni has been deployed at centre-back during Real’s defensive injury crisis.Photograph: Rubén Albarrán/ShutterstockThen there is Aurélien Tchouaméni, the central midfielder at centre-back, where he has played 14 of his 29 matches. Two more academy players have also been called up: Jacobo Ramón, who has played twice this season, and Lorenzo Aguado, who has made three appearances as a substitute but is still unlikely to play at right‑back. That will almost certainly be another midfielder: the Uruguayan Fede Valverde. The problem there is not so much having Valverde at full-back asnothaving him in midfield.Seen from Ancelotti’s position particularly – aware he is always the weakest link, the first to fall, and having to manage upwards as well as downwards – it is not surprising he says Madrid are doing well. He knows that not everyone sees it like that – which is one of the reasons why he says so. Last season Madrid lost only twice all year, both times to Atlético; this season, they have lost seven times already. When it has come to the big games, the best opponents, they have not won, and often not competed as they should.OnlyDortmund have been defeated, which took a wild comeback in the second half after a dreadful first, and do they still count? Barcelona put nine past them in two games. Athletic beat them at San Mamés. Liverpool overran them. Milan were superior at the Santiago Bernabéu. They drew both derbies with Atlético. And now they have City.It doesn’t get bigger: these sides have met four times in the past five seasons and on three of those occasions the winner has lifted the trophy. That is the theory, at least. But the fact they are playing each other at all tells a story too. Madrid have been beaten three times in the Champions League. Ancelotti said he would have preferred City to have been knocked out, to have avoided them, saying: “We don’t like it.” If the good news is that City are even worse, that is of limited comfort.This is not solely about injuries, though Ancelotti will look at that list and wish they could have been spread around the pitch. He would probably have preferred to lose a forward than rack up all the absentees in defence. Kylian Mbappé, Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo and Jude Bellingham have scored more than 60 goals between them. After a difficult start, Mbappé has been superb – he collected the award for January’s player of the month on Saturday and has 13 goals in 14 games – and Rodrygo has been outstanding, scoring seven and providing four since the turn of the year.View image in fullscreenReal Madrid players celebrate at the end of their Champions League semi-final win, 6-5 on aggregate, against Manchester City at the Bernabéu in 2022.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APBut the balance has been difficult. Structurally Madrid have suffered. For all those goals and recent improvements, the suspicion remains that against the best it is not enough. At times there has been a kind of 4-2-4, a gap opening in the middle. That makes Tchouaméni’s move to defence, instead of a protective role in front, significant. It makes Valverde playing at full-back even more significant; if there is a player that can cover those wide spaces, plugging endless gaps, it is him. It also leaves Madrid with few central midfield options: Dani Ceballos, Luka Modric and Eduardo Camavinga, who is returning from injury.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He would also like to maintain the talent on the pitch, which is both politically expedient and, well, these are the players that win you games. Why would you leave out footballers this good? Madrid may have the three best players in the world. Nor has the alternative always worked: a midfield four didn’t help at Anfield; at San Mamés, Vinícius was missing but still Athletic poured through them.Earlier in the season, criticised for a lack of control, Ancelotti said he preferred a bit of rock and roll. In a straight fight, an open match with both teams slugging it out, Madrid would assume they have an advantage. When they are under pressure, history shows they can still land the key blow, especially against City. If, that is, they can defend themselves – and that has been Ancelotti’s obsession, both publicly and privately, all season.Containing Real Madrid’s stellar attack ‘impossible’ for whole tie, says GuardiolaRead moreAt the end of the derby, Ancelotti was asked what lessons he could take into the City game. “That the formula can work,” he said. The first half had been poor but the second was much improved; at half-time he had warned them that either they do what they had agreed or he would start hauling players off, whoever they were. He had created four lines, with Bellingham shifted left and Rodrygo right, at least without the ball. Vinícius and Mbappé had been left up front although Ancelotti spent much of the game shouting for the Brazilian to go wide, not inside, and insisted afterwards they had helped press.For Ancelotti the question is more basic. From the very start of the season he has been uneasy; on the opening night he said he felt they lacked commitment, work rate and sacrifice. Although he has been cautious in how he expresses it, that concern remains and is occasionally voiced. But it is natural to hold on to the idea that the message will get through or that this is an issue that solves itself, fixed by the sheer size of the game, its importance, the motivation. If there is a moment to run, to sacrifice, it is in Manchester. If there is a time for the talent to show, that time is now.“I don’t have the idea of seeking balance by taking off one, two, three, four forwards,” Ancelotti said. “I put on four midfielders, I seek balance, I press more … but I don’t score 60 goals. Simple.”Explore more on these topicsReal MadridManchester CityChampions LeagueEuropean club footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

But they have succeeded by challenging outdated ways of thinkingAndrew Lawrencein New OrleansMon 10 Feb 2025 12.39 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 20.04 ESTShareBy now, those who watched Sunday’sSuper Bowlhave most likely forgotten about the house ads promoting racial and cultural unity. That’s no doubt because a much stronger statement was delivered midway through the second quarter when a pass by theKansas City Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes was intercepted and returned for an touchdown by Philadelphia’s Cooper DeJean.DeJean, the first white player to start at cornerback in a Super Bowl in 24 years, has cheekily been described by media figures such as Bomani Jones as the league’s ultimate DEI hire. But while those comments have been made with tongues firmly planted in cheeks, there is some merit in describingthe Eagles’ victoryas a win for diversity, equity and inclusion – something that suddenly finds itself under attack in America.After all, Super Bowl LIX was never going to be just a game, not with the cultural storm brewing around the contest – not least Kendrick Lamar’spolitically charged half-time show. But no force carried more momentum than the Chiefs coming into Sunday. They weren’t just playing for a third successive championship. They were carrying the mantle of America’s team in the second era of Donald Trump, who became the first sitting US president to attend a Super Bowl. At the same time,the NFL removedits longstanding antiracism slogans from the field, perhaps fearing Trump – who left the game early – would make it into yet another DEI issue to grandstand about.Philadelphia Eagles fans celebrate in style after Super Bowl win – in picturesRead moreThere was no question which team the president came to see in New Orleans. Mahomes’smother and brother took pictures with Trump. In the week before the game, the Chiefs’ star tight end Travis Kelcegushed about playingin front of the president despite Trump once writing in all caps that he hated the player’s girlfriend, Taylor Swift, after she threw her support behind Kamala Harris in the presidential election. (During the game he shared video of Swiftbeing booed.) Trump picked Kansas City to three-peat, called Mahomes “a winner” and referred to his wife,accurately, as a “Maga fan.” Trump praised Chiefs fans for voting for him “in record numbers,” even though polling data shows Harrisreceived substantially more votesin Kansas City’s more populous Missouri counties. And yet: from their wantonly offensivetomahawk chop cheerto the kicker who isbesties with Maga senator Josh Hawleyto the fact that the team playsin red, the Chiefs couldn’t appear in more lockstep with a Maga movement that’s hellbent on erasing 60 years of DEI gains. So it’s fitting that the most forceful rejection of this new political normal would come from Philadelphia, a city that hasn’t voted for a Republican presidentsince 1932.Philly sports fans don’t bow down to authority. They buck it.They (allegedly) booed Santa Clausand throw batteries at players they don’t like, whether on the opposite side or on theirs. They’re righteous in their loyalty and committed to their freedom of expression. They flooded downtown streets after the Eagles booked their Super Bowl ticket and climbed light poles that the city greased in advance to deter them. Dressed in their greenest finery on Sunday, Eagles fans descended on downtown New Orleans in the tens of thousands to boo the president, boo Mahomes and bear witness to a football insurrection. That the Eagles happen to be among the most diverse, equitable and inclusive teams in sports just made their upset all the sweeter.DEI is integral to the Eagles, an equal opportunity destroyer of dynasties. They enjoy doing things differently: seven years ago they stopped the New England Patriots from winning a second successive championship partly thanks to a trick play with abackupquarterback who caught the decisive pass. The team’s owner, Jeffrey Lurie, recently produced a film about an undocumented immigrant artist,a story he saidhe was “proud” to portray on screen. After lifting the Lombardi Trophy on Sunday, Lurie made a point of shouting out 200-plus members of the Eagles “support staff you’ll never hear about”. Among them isAutumn Lockwood, an Eagles performance guru who joined the team in 2023, becoming the first Black woman ever to be part of a Super Bowl-winning coaching staff.View image in fullscreenJalen Hurts was named MVP of Sunday’s Super Bowl.Photograph: Mark J Rebilas/USA Today SportsThe DEI – as many joke – cuts both ways. For the better part of two decadesno NFL team featured a white cornerback, as white prospects have historically been stereotyped as too slow and clumsy to play a position that requires lightning speed and agility. But then last year the Eagles bucked convention and drafted DeJean out of Iowa, where he ranked among college football’s most outstanding defenders. By midseason DeJean emerged in the Eagles starting lineup along with safety Reed Blankenship, Philadelphia’s other white defensive back. Any time they make a big play fans cheer the Eagles’ “Exciting Whites,” nodding at the meme photograph of asupermarket wine section signof the same name. DeJean and Blankenship’s suffocating coverage in the Super Bowl was part of a bruising effort that yielded arguably Mahomes’s worst performance as a pro to date. His two garbage-time touchdowns may have raised his final numbers,but they won’t erase the stain.But in the grand scheme, Jalen Hurts is the finest example of the Eagles discarding old ways of thinking. He is a two-time college national champion and Heisman trophy finalist whom many pundits nonetheless believed was unqualified for the job of NFL quarterback. Some experts believed he might be better suited to play running back or receiver, positions Black quarterbacks have been pushed into in the past by talent evaluators who wrongheadedly mistook their athleticism for alack of intelligence. Those same experts continued questioning Hurts’s credentials and ability when he replaced franchise quarterback Carson Wentz, who is white and now Mahomes’s backup on the Chiefs. Race aside, they considered Hurts to be vastly inferior to Mahomes even though he nearly beat him in the Super Bowl two years earlier. The kicker: Hurts entrusted his business affairs to a management teamled entirely by women– and they promptly landed him the richest contract in NFL history at the time he signed it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the image didn’t figure to haunt him for much longer on Sunday. After DeJean’s interception, Hurts threw a touchdown pass to AJ Brown that gave the Eagles a 24-0 lead at halftime. In the third quarter, Hurts connected with DeVonta Smith on a beautiful long pass that pushed the advantage to 34-0. In the end, Hurts’s performance wasn’t as dynamic as it had been two years ago, but it was impressive enough for the Eagles to pull him from the blowout with three minutes left to play so his backup could take the remaining snaps. “I can’t control what these people think,” Hurts said after being voted the game’s MVP. “But if it takes all the hate and all the scrutiny and all the different opinions for me to be a world champion, then keep it coming.”At a time when the guardrailsaround democracy appear to be warpingand snapping under the strain to make DEIthe enemy of everything, the Eagles provide a heartening lesson in resistance. They didn’t give into a script that called for them to acquiesce in advance. They didn’t complain about the game being rigged. They just rolled up their sleeves and administered a good ol’ fashion Broad Street beatdown in front of the world. And when they take over the streets again to parade their championship team through their city with Eagles fans reveling in their rebel spirit, it shouldn’t be soon forgotten that it was DEI that did this, too.Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia EaglesSuper BowlNFLSuper Bowl LIXUS sportsShareReuse this content"

New evidence establishes that athletic disadvantages associated with female body structure and physiology contribute to the performance gap.”Sebastian Coe, the World Athletics president, said the move was designed to “ensure that our guidelines keep up with the latest information available to maintain a fair and level playing field in the female category”. He said: “Preserving the integrity of competition in the female category is a fundamental principle of the sport of athletics and we look forward to this collaborative consultation process with our key stakeholders in this area.”Most significantly, World Athletics wants to adopt what it calls a “pre‑clearance requirement for all elite athletes competing in the female category” – which, in essence, is a one‑time non-invasive cheek swab test.View image in fullscreenThe World Athletics president, Sebastian Coe, has said the new rules will be based on a ‘collaborative consultation process’.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/Reuters“The required test will be for the SRY gene and, if required, testosterone levels, either via cheek swab with any necessary follow-up or via dry blood spot analysis,” World Athletics says in its consultation document. “In this context, the SRY gene, which is almost always on the Y chromosome, is used as a highly accurate proxy for biological sex but makes room for an additional diagnostic process at the athlete’s discretion.”World Athletics says the cheek-test proposal was recommended by the special rapporteur’s report on female eligibility to the UN general assembly in October last year and is supported by many athletes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Few among the Home Park faithful attended both but Griffiths, a proud member of the Green Army since 1953, was there for the 4-0 win on 11 February 1956 in the old Second Division, his beloved club’s previous defeat of Liverpool. As for theFA Cup fourth-round giantkillingon Sunday, when the Championship strugglers sank the Premier League leaders, it was “one of the highlights of my footballing life”.In 1956, Griffiths was a schoolboy at Devonport High school, watching the game from the old “Pop Side” of the old Home Park. “No seats in those days,” he says. “We were opposite the grandstand, and we younger kids would get passed down the front, and we hung on the railings for a closeup view.”Stunned Liverpool sent crashing out of FA Cup in major upset at PlymouthRead moreTheLiverpoolof 1956 was a faded force, relegated in 1954 though still featuring Billy Liddell, the great Scottish winger who had inspired a First Division title in 1947; the club was nicknamed “Liddellpool” after him. Other familiar names featured. The full-back Ronnie Moran became famous as an attack-dog coach under Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley and all further Reds managers until 1998. The left-half Roy Saunders would later father Dean, a future Liverpool striker.Geoff Twentyman, Liverpool’s centre-back, was given a real runaround by Plymouth’s centre-forward Neil Langman. “He scored,” Griffiths says of Langman, whose brother Peter also played at centre-back. “He was a big old lump but quite skilful on the ground and he made a right mess of the Liverpool defence.” Twentyman remains legendary in Liverpool lore after becoming the scout who uncovered the talents of future club greats like Phil Neal, Ian Rush and Alan Hansen.Up front for Liverpool was Alan A’Court, who played in England’s forward line at the 1958 World Cup finals. “They were still one of the famous clubs in the country, and everybody in Plymouth wanted to see the game, the crowd was over 27,000,” Griffiths recalls. These were the times of Stanley Matthews, Tom Finney and the Busby Babes, when photos of the soccer stars of the day were collected on cigarette cards.View image in fullscreenPlymouth Argyle’s Ryan Hardie, who scored the sole goal against Liverpool, looks on with a smile after the win.Photograph: David Klein/Reuters“It was a big occasion, but it was a league match,” Griffiths says, throwing himself forward to Sunday’s heroics where Argyle, rock bottom of the Championship, held off the previously all-conquering 2025-issue Liverpool for their famous victory. “I didn’t expect to win by any means. All I wanted was one goal, even if they lost 6-1 but … Wow.”Now 83, longtime resident in Hertford, Griffiths still works as a self-employed town planner, numbering himself among the 800-strong London branch of the Green Army, taking in local away games as well as regular returns to Home Park.He can now compare schoolboy heroes like the Langman brothers, tough-tackling full-back George Robertson, the flying winger Gordon Astall and the inside-forward George Dews, who also batted right-hand for Worcestershire, to their modern equivalents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The No 9 Ryan Hardie slotted the decisive penalty. Nikola Katic, the recently arrived Bosnian central defender, threw himself at every challenge and then cheerleaded his teammates on to the finish line. For Jack Rowley, Argyle’s manager in 1956, read Miron Muslic, who Griffiths congratulated when they met on Monday. “He’s very calm, very focused, he immediately made a good impression.” The Wayne Rooney misadventure consigned to the past, Argyle now have a fighting chance of Championship survival. “They don’t fanny about at the back,” Griffiths says, approvingly.A first whiff of a possible Sunday shock came when seeing Arne Slot’s Liverpool selection. Ten changes were made, with Mohamed Salah idling back on Merseyside. “I was encouraged. That was disrespecting Argyle. They clearly hadn’t done their homework. Surely they must have known we had brought in a new manager, that they have brought in two amazing defenders. [Muslic]’s got them organised. They must have realised that, surely. Though obviously not. It was disrespectful not to have some of the more accomplished players in the side.”Argyle’s exploits this season,winning at Brentfordin the third round, and taking down Liverpool, have redressed some of the purported lost magic of the FA Cup. For Griffiths, it delivered glorious, golden moments to reward seven decades of loyal support.Explore more on these topicsPlymouth ArgyleLiverpoolFA CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

León has since denied touching Caracas’s crotch or having any intention to do so.“During the match, FC Barcelona player María Pilar León, while jostling with Daniela Caracas, made a gesture with her hand that violated the intimacy of our player,” Espanyol said on Monday in a statement.“Although Caracas was unable to react at the time due to the impact of the situation, later, after assimilating what had happened, she became aware of the seriousness of the gesture, but chose not to react angrily in order to avoid a disciplinary sanction that would harm the team.”In a statement released via Barcelona’s website later on Monday, León, 29, said: “At no time did I, nor was it my intention, infringe upon the intimacy of my fellow professional Daniela Caracas.“As the images show, it was part of a playing action in which she deliberately touches me and I touch her leg saying in reaction to the clash: “what’s up with you”. There is NO contact with her private parts, and certainly no intention. I insist, it was just part of the game that does not warrant the importance that has been attached to it.“The idea of touching the private parts of a colleague would never enter my head, it goes against my principles and I would never do such a thing.”As part of their statement Espanyol condemned “any act that threatens the integrity of footballers on the field” and said they “hope these types of situations are treated with the seriousness they deserve”. The club added that they have made their legal services available to Caracas “in the event that she wish to take legal action”.Since the incident Caracas, 27, has been subject to abuse on social media from “hundreds of profiles”, according to Espanyol, who expressed their concern that media attention of the incident had been “diverted to other issues unrelated to the seriousness of the action”. The statement continued: “We would like to express our rejection of any form of violence, whether physical or verbal, in the world of football.”León said: “I condemn the harassment that Daniela appears to have been suffering on social networks, which has nothing to do with me, and I offer her my most sincere support.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their attention now turns to pushing for promotion from League Two after Palace set up a south London derby with Millwall in the fifth round.An FA Cup shock shouldn’t unhinge Liverpool, but football isn’t logicalRead moreGoals either side of half-time from Daniel Muñoz and Justin Devenny were enough to book Palace’s place in the next round, and Glasner will point to several other positives and reflect on this as a successful night’s work in south Yorkshire.Doncaster played their part in a compelling tie, but there could be no arguments this was the right outcome.With Ben Chilwell making his Palace debut from the bench in the second half and Adam Wharton coming through his first start since October unscathed and looking very much the part, there was lots for Glasner to savour. Then again, the gulf between the two sides in the pyramid – almost 60 places – means the result has to be taken with a pinch of salt.But this night and atmosphere felt ripe for a shock pre-match. That Palace neutralised it and prevented Doncaster from causing an upset means it is another tick in the box for their mid-season upturn. “I’m very pleased with the performance,” Glasner said post-match before turning his attention to the next round. “I could feel the excitement in the dressing room from the staff. It’s a big rivalry [against Millwall] and it’s important for all of us. For me personally it’s too far away, it’s three weeks away.”With so many big Premier League sides exiting already, it feels like Palace are now in the conversation for the Cup.Wharton and his midfield partner Will Hughes were excellent. With Doncaster certainly not holding back and attempting to make a real game of it, the control Wharton and Hughes provided was decisive. They helped add a measure of calm to proceedings which can often go missing on nights like these.The first goal always felt vital. Doncaster had half-chances to get it, with Luke Molyneux coming close. But just after the half-hour mark, a clever free-kick from Palace found Jean-Philippe Mateta unmarked, and while he struck the post, Muñoz was on hand to tap in the rebound  and put the visitors ahead.It was a crucial moment. It didn’t take the wind out of Doncaster – far from it. But with a goal advantage, Glasner was able to introduce Chilwell at the break and he invigorated Palace’s performance. Mateta and Devenny then spurned big chances to double the lead and, as Doncaster began to stir into action again, it was hard not to wonder if there was still life in the tie.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hughes produced an inch-perfect through ball that found Devenny, and he scooped the ball over Teddy Sharman-Lowe to double Palace’s advantage and put the tie beyond doubt. It restored control for the visitors just at a time when things were threatening to get wild.Doncaster didn’t fall away, and they continued to press until the very end. But they must now focus on their endeavours in League Two. “I’m really proud of the players and the performance,” Grant McCann, the Doncaster manager, said. “It was always going to be a difficult game against a very good team. The town can be proud of its players.”Quick GuideFA Cup fifth round drawShowPreston v BurnleyAston Villa v Cardiff CityCrystal Palace v MillwallManchester United v FulhamNewcastle United v BrightonBournemouth v WolvesManchester City v Plymouth ArgyleExeterorNottingham Forest v IpswichTies to be played between 28 Feb – 3 MarchWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Long before full time, the chants from the travelling support – who had unfurled a banner before kickoff letting the FA know how they felt about this tie being played on a Monday evening – about their local rivals had begun.

Central among the defaulters are three rugby clubs –Worcester,WaspsandLondon Irish– who went into administration after being lent £41.6m in public money.England win has fans dreaming again as Borthwick’s plans come together | Robert KitsonRead moreSpeaking in front of the Public Accounts Committee in parliament on Monday, the director general of policy at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), Polly Payne, said the government was now monitoring financial risks not only to clubs but thePremiershipitself, and that concerns over financial viability had grown.Asked by MPs if she anticipated more rugby clubs going into administration in future, Payne said: “We are absolutely reviewing and updating our forecasts. Are we more or less pessimistic than at the time when we gave the loans? I think given everything that has gone on in the sport, we are more pessimistic than we were then. I wouldn’t want to talk about our individual borrowers but absolutely we keep it under review and really care about it.“In rugby when we have been thinking about likely insolvencies and the financial strength of the individual clubs, we have also thought about the financial situation of the Premier League (sic) as a whole,” she continued. “We have not only been taking account of it, we’ve been using the government’s convening power to try and help with the financial sustainability. We take this very seriously.”Payne defended the decision to award a total of £123.8m to Premiership clubs, a quarter of the total amount lent at the time. “It wasn’t that there was any special treatment and we didn’t think about it sport by sport,” she said. “I think it’s worth saying that the [total amount] we could have spent was underspent, so it was not the case that other sports missed out.”Payne also argued that the clubs had shown themselves to be solvent before Covid struck, a key requirement of the loan system. “Unfortunately within the next three years, [those assessments were proven wrong] ... but I have no reason to believe the information given at the time was inaccurate,” she said.DCMS officials also pointed out that money had been retrieved from the three former Premiership clubs, more than £10m to date, and that a further between £7.3m and £11.1m is expected to be recouped from the nine recipients of Covid loans who have become insolvent.Also speaking in front of the committee, the most senior civil servant in the DCMS, the permanent secretary Susannah Storey, defended the Covid loan system, calling it a “relatively solid” approach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve definitely made some improvements as we’ve codified this process.

For hours, the narrow strip of land, extending like the tail of a comma into the waters, gradually disappeared into the ocean.When Canadian scientists on Qikiqtaruk (also known as Herschel Island), off the coast of Canada’s Yukon territory, surveyed the deluge, they saw a grimly comical scene unfold.Staff from the Yukon government, slogging through the water, were rushing to move historic buildings before they could slide into the ocean. It was not the first time water had enveloped old whaling buildings, and despite the team’s efforts to prevent a sliver of history from being reclaimed by nature, it would not be the last.Still, with the building perched on wood cribbing and with the aid of a strong cable, they were able, over a period of days, to move it 8 metres (26ft) inland.“We bought ourselves some time,” says Stephan Biedermann, a conservation carpenter with the government who, for two weeks every year, scrambles with his team to temper the effects of flooding on the buildings. “But these are just short-term solutions. Until we have an idea of what something permanent might look like, we’ll just keep racing to react to these floods.”Aerial video of old single-storey whaling sheds with the sea lapping at the wooden struts supporting them‘We bought ourselves some time,’ says Stephan Biedermann, a conservation carpenter. ‘But these are just short-term solutions’. Video: Chiara NortonTempestuous weather has long been a staple of life for rangers and researchers working on the remote Arctic isle. But the relentless march of ocean waters inland has raised thorny questions about how to preserve vulnerable elements of Qikiqtaruk’s Arctic heritage.“There is a stress you feel in the work, knowing there is a growing sense of urgency. But you know the urgency comes from the fact these places are meaningful to so many people, and so the work has value,” says Biedermann.When Richard Gordon was young, his family made the multi-day trek to Qikiqtaruk from Aklavik in a small boat. He spent summers fishing, camping and running through the remains of weather-beaten buildings.View image in fullscreenIn August 2023, thawing tundra over permafrost on Qikiqtaruk caused a landslide of thousands of square metres of topsoil. Such events are reshaping the landscape. Photograph: Isla Myers-SmithGordon has spent the past two decades as the lead ranger for Herschel Island-Qikiqtaruk territorial park, a witness to thelandslides, permafrost thaw and floods– the ravages of the climate emergency degrading the vulnerable island.“With the floods getting worse, all the talk is about the plans for the historic buildings. Where will they go? What should we do?” he says.“But there is less talk about the heritage sites of the island, theplaces important to the Inuvialuit. There has been no decision on that. Instead, the focus is what do we do with these buildings brought in by newcomers.”The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, and it’s making flooding worseMicah EckertThe island of Qikiqtaruk, a short distance off the Yukon coast in northern Canada, has no trees on the smooth rolling hills that, in a number of places, morph quickly into ragged cliffs and steep canyons.For more than 1,000 years, Qikiqtaruk has been a prized hunting, fishing and camping ground for the Inuvialuit. It occupies an important space in their oral history – and its protected status as Herschel Island-Qikiqtaruk territorial park reflects a hard-won fight to preserve it from outside influence and destruction.In the late 1800s, the island’s sheltered waters, an abundance of whales in the region and an insatiable appetite for oils and baleen prompted a frenzy of whaling in the north. American and European crews built nearly a dozen wooden buildings along a low-lying portion of Pauline Cove to support nearly 1,500 whalers overwintering on their ships.View image in fullscreenRichard Gordon, an Indigenous park ranger on Qikiqtaruk. When he was a child, his family would go to the island to fish and hunt. Photograph: Leyland Cecco/ the GuardianThe remnants of both histories remain scattered on parts of the island. The wooden floor of one building, the Blubber House, is etched with the deep cuts from crews shearing fat from bowhead whales. The Community House is believed to be the oldest wooden-framed building standing in the Yukon. Grave markers of whalers who died a long way from home protrude in a haphazard row in thefields of willows.With no historic written language and a pragmatic and deft way of using the land, the legacy of the Inuvialuit physical presence can easily be missed. Theirsod houses, origluryuaq,once hadcooking hearths and sleeping benches and were hollowed out of the land. What remains of these structures, some of which date back to 1200,appear now as bow-shaped impressions on the land crowned with tundra flowers and grasses.But within the oral history of the Inuvialuit is a deep catalogue of human expertise on how to thrive in the region – including on Qikiqtaruk. For a people whose language and life is braided into the lands and waters, to lose one begets a fraying of the other.“If anything happens to one building, they can easily replace it,” says Gordon. “But you can’t replace a culture and a history. If you let those die out, they’re next to impossible to bring back.”In an effort to underscore the scope of the crisis, researchers have found new ways to bring people – virtually – to the frontlines.On an early August afternoon, Micah Eckert slogs through the mud of thawed permafrost. He scans the area for higher ground, gingerly leapfrogging the gloopy substance to set up a virtual-reality camera.View image in fullscreenCiara Norton, a Team Shrub researcher, touches the exposed permafrost. When this melts, it can no longer support the soil above and a landslide, known as a thaw slump, ensues. Photograph: Isla Myers-SmithRecording a 360-degree vignette of life on the island, Team Shrub – researchers at the University of British Columbia –are working to preserve what they canof a landscape existing on borrowed time. The Qikiqtaruk: Arctic at Risk project aims to show an island teetering on the verge of profound ecological upheaval, hastened by a changing climate.“The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, and it’s making flooding worse, lengthening the ice free season,” says Eckert, a graduate student studying flood mechanics. “Every time we get a flood, which happens more because the coastline is exposed, it is washing away sandy parts of the island, making those same areas more susceptible to the next flood.”The areas include the island’s only airstrip and the collection of whaling buildings used to host research teams from Canada and Europe. Last summer, there were 19 floods during the summer research season, including 11 consecutive days in August, which Team Shrub captured using virtual reality. Half the buildings are sitting on wood cribbing, with others occasionally inundated with sea water.Two photos side by side; one showing a calm sea and one showing slabs of ice in stormy wavesFirst image: the calm before the storm. Just before high winds hit the island, the wind speeds drop and the ocean becomes like glass, reflecting the sea ice and skies. Second image: high winds of up to 60 miles an hour (90km/h) batter the coast during a storm in June. As the periods without ice get longer, waves and wind cause more erosion along permafrost coastlines. Photographs: Alex Beauchemin“Polar heritage sites are among the most at risk on the planet,” says Peter Dawson, head of the anthropology and archaeology departments at the University of Calgary. “It feels like it’s a crime to let these places disappear without making an effort to save them. We can’t stop climate change, but can preserve as best we can the history of the region.”With uncertainty looming over the future of the settlement, Dawson, working alongside the Inuvialuit and computer scientists, has spent the past few years creating ameticulous digital archive of the island’s human structures. Each building is reconstructed using millions of laser data points – known as a point cloud – ensuring the structures live on in perpetuity online, outlasting their real-world counterparts.For the team, the work is particularly important because it gives Inuvialuit residents of Aklavik – the closest community to the island – a chance to revisit the place. Many have strong ties to Qikiqtaruk, either from their youth or through stories from elders. Using the data points, the team has printed out 3D models of the island and its structures.View image in fullscreenPauline Cove and Simpson Point, where a whaling station sprang up in the late 19th century.

You can show these models to an 85-year-old person who used to live there, and bring them back to the place,” says Dawson. “They can hold it in their hands. It does what sketches or photographs can’t.”Self-described as “technicians of remembrance”, the team treads carefully, acknowledging the past injustices committed against the Inuvialuit, and allIndigenous peoplesin Canada, in the name of “preservation”.For decades, outsiders pillaged and plundered First Nations’ homes and villages across what is now Canada. Their art, lives and culture were coveted by outsiders and stolen under the guise of conservation.View image in fullscreenWhen staying on the island, Team Shrub lives together in Signals House, which is dedicated to housing researchers.

It estimates that this will save consumers £170m a year.However, the company said it was targeting underlying profits of £100m to £200m a year over that period, and its shares rose almost 5% before easing slightly to a near 4% rise. Greenpeace said continuing to subsidise biomass imports was a “dirty compromise with past failures”.The energy minister Michael Shanks said in astatement: “We believe that they [subsidies] simply did not deliver a good enough deal for bill payers and enabled Drax to make unacceptably large profits.“This government will do whatever it takes to deliver energy security and protect bill payers now and into the future.”Drax, Britain’s largest renewable power generator by output, has converted four coal units to use biomass, and also runs hydro projects. Its plants account for about 6% of the UK’s electricity supply.The companyshut its final coal plantafter 50 years of coal-fired generation at the site near Selby in 2023.Under the new agreement, the company will have to switch to using 100% woody biomass from sustainable sources, up from the current level of 70%. The government threatened “substantial penalties” if Drax does not comply.Green campaignershad fearedthat ministers would award unrestricted subsidies to the power station, which hasalready received billions in subsidiesdespite strong concerns that burning trees to produce electricity is bad for the environment.The government’s statement said: “Our central projections show that, on the right terms and in a much more limited role than today, biomass generation at Drax is the lowest cost option, including when compared to gas-fired power stations, for bill payers during this period.”Will Gardiner, the chief executive of Drax, said: “Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn’t be left to gamble on schemes like this any more.”Last year, Draxagreed to pay £25mafter the energy industry regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, found it had submitted inaccurate data on the sourcing of wood pellets.The government hopes to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2030. Meeting this target will require a large increase in renewable energy, such as wind and solar, as well as projects that store energy for when there is insufficient wind or sun.The government is also turning to more nuclear power to achieve its carbon goals. Last week, Keir Starmer vowed to “rip up the rules” of the nuclear industry byallowing a new breed of mini reactorsto be built for the first time in the UK.The move to encourage fresh investment in small modular reactors could allow new nuclear projects to spring up across England and Wales – not only on the country’s eight designated nuclear sites.Explore more on these topicsDraxEnergy industryEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

They said the visit was a matter of “show not tell” and the timing was solely down to diaries, rather than linked to any official announcement.A government source said the king wanted to “show off, in the nicest possible way”, the Cornish development.Another said it was “absolutely critical” the public saw that new homes came with supporting infrastructure and public services, as in Nansledan, that would also help develop a sense of community.The prime minister has set up a taskforce to create the next generation of towns as part of his drive to have 1.5m homes built before the next election.The visit is believed to be the first time in recent history that a monarch has been accompanied by senior politicians on a joint engagement, focusing on a royal-inspired project. In 1998, he took John Prescott, then the deputy prime minister,on a tour of his Poundbury developmentin Dorset.Explore more on these topicsMonarchyKing Charles IIIKeir StarmerAngela RaynerCornwallEnglandLabournewsShareReuse this content"

At a time of shrinking demand and high costs, rising protectionism globally, particularly in the US, will stifle our exports and damage over £400m worth of the steel sector’s contribution to the UK’s balance of trade.”Trump tariffs: Gold hits record high as new steel and aluminium tariff announcement rattles markets – live updatesRead moreStace said it would be “deeply disappointing” if Trump decided to target UK steel, given its “relatively small production volumes compared to major steel nations”.He added that there was a danger that other countries could decide to dump steel on the UK market to avoid US tariffs. “The introduction of further US tariffs will inevitably divert global trade flows, with excess steel potentially redirected to the UK market,” he said.UK Steel’s members include Tata, the owner of thevast Port Talbot steelworks, and troubled British Steel,owned by China’s Jingye.Trump is expected to formally announce new tariffs this week. Community, the union for the UK steel industry, said the prospect of fresh duties was extremely concerning and could threaten jobs.Alasdair McDiarmid, the Communityassistant general secretary, said: “For the US it would also be self-defeating as the UK is a leading supplier of specialist steel products required by their defence and aerospace sectors.”The European Commission said: “The EU sees no justification for the imposition of tariffs on its exports. We will react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified measures.”As investors rushed for a haven for their money, the spot price of gold increased by 1.6% to $2,910 an ounce, above the record high set on Friday. Gold has been rising in recent weeks amid concerns over the impact of Trump’s policies. It has gained more than 10% since the start of the year, after ending 2024 at $2,623 an ounce.Iron and steel graphicAluminium prices also rose, as investors worried that the tariffs could lead to supply problems and hit economic growth, which would reduce demand for the metal. The three-month aluminium contract on the London Metal Exchange has gained by 0.3% to $2,635 (£2,122) a tonne.In London, theFTSE100 hit a record high as the dollar strengthened against the pound – reaching 8,770.08 points, three points above the previous intraday high set last week. Most companies on the index are large multinationals that earn their revenues in dollars and report profits in sterling.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 jumped more than 0.5% at the open, with the Dow up 246 at 44,550 points.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cleveland-Cliffs, North America’s largest flat-rolled steel producer, shot up by 16% and Nucor Corporation, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based steelmaker, gained 6%.Speaking to reporters onboard Air Force One, the US president said he would announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, matching the tariff rates levied by other countries. “Very simply, it’s ‘if they charge us, we charge them’,” Trump said.Canada, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Vietnam are the biggest sellers of steel into the US, according to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data, while Canada is the main supplier of imported aluminium.Trump said on Sunday that his administration was examining US treasury debt payments for possible fraud, suggesting that the country could have less debt than thought. According to the US treasury, the US has $36tn of public debt, equal to more than 120% of GDP.Trump said administration officials who had been combing through payment records to identify any wasteful spending had turned their attention to debt payments.“We’re even looking at treasuries,” Trump said. “There could be a problem – you’ve been reading about that – with treasuries, and that could be an interesting problem.”It was not clear whether Trump was referring to debt service or other government payments made by the treasury department.Explore more on these topicsSteel industryInternational tradeGoldEconomicsGlobal economyDonald TrumpCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Campaigners say she was kept in solitary confinement for more than nine months before she was brought before Saudi Arabia’s specialised criminal court.She was initially sentenced to serve three years in prison for the “crime” of using a website to “cause public unrest and destabilise civil and national security”.An appeals court later handed down the new sentence– 34 years in prison followed by a 34-year travel ban – after a public prosecutor asked the court to consider other alleged crimes.Saudi snitching app appears to have been used against jailed Leeds studentRead moreThe additional charges included the allegation that al-Shehab was “assisting those who seek to cause public unrest and destabilise civil and national security by following their Twitter accounts” and by retweeting their tweets.Amnesty International said her “crime” was no more than “posting tweets in support of women’s rights”.Last Marchan open letter was signed by more than 300 academics, students and employees at Leeds Universitycalling for al-Shehab’s immediate release. It said she had been jailed “on the basis of peaceful tweets”.Al-Hathloul said al-Shehab had had a hard time in prison. “It has been difficult for her,” she said. “Not seeing her kids, not knowing whether she could complete her PhD. She was originally sentenced to six years, then it was increased to 34 years and then it was reduced to 27 years and then 4 years. It has been a nightmare really not to even be able to trust the judiciary and its decisions“She is very strong. Salma is a very brave woman. She went on hunger strike to complain about the conditions.”In June 2023 the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (UNWGAD)found her detention to be arbitrary and called for her immediate release.Al-Hathhoul said al-Shehab was not an exception. “She is symbolic of a pattern. She was released because of this pressure but many more others still remain in prison for the same charges.”The battle now was to get al-Shehab’s travel ban lifted so she could return to Leeds where she is a dental student, al-Hathhoul said.“She has a PhD to pursue. She is one of the most brilliant people in her field.”Al-Hathloul, whose sister was imprisoned for campaigning for women’s rights, saidher own family in Saudi Arabia were the subject of a travel banand it was about “making sure everyone lives in constant fear. I can’t really explain to you how much of a weight it is to have this travel ban. It is a constant threat of potential arrest. It is unbearable really, it is very heavy”.Al-Hathloul said at some point while al-Shaheb was in prison, her husband divorced her. “We don’t know all the circumstances around this but it seems like it’s a pattern … women having divorces filed against them and not being informed of it.“It means she is being released under very sad circumstances but it is better than being in prison for 34 years.”Brian Tronic of the US NGO Freedom House described al-Shehab’s case as a “grave miscarriage of justice” and echoed calls for the travel ban to be lifted.“Al-Shehab’s unjust and arbitrary punishment is emblematic of a fundamentally broken Saudi justice system, where trials are not fair, defendants have alarmingly few rights, and allegations of torture and abuse by police and prison officials are commonplace,” he said.Amnesty International’s Middle East researcher, Dana Ahmed, said al-Shehab had been in jail “just because she tweeted in support of women’s rights and retweeted Saudi women’s rights activists.”Saudi Arabia did not immediately acknowledge her release. The Saudi embassy in London has been approached for comment.The Foreign Office said it was monitoring the situation and would continue “to raise issues relating to freedom of speech and human rights all over the world”.Al-Shehab is a member of Saudi Arabia’s Shia Muslim minority, which has long complained of systemic discrimination in the Sunni-ruled kingdom.Explore more on these topicsSaudi ArabiaUniversity of LeedsXSocial mediaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t think these things are paid up quickly and the result is that residents are permanently in the red.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is the absolute archetype of an arrogant, progressive fool who thinks that law is a replacement for politics … They talk about the rule of law but what they want is a rule of lawyers.” He also calledRachel Reeves, the chancellor, a “drone for the Treasury”.Hermer, a friend of Starmer who was given a seat in the House of Lordsin order to become attorney general, has become a prime target of political attacks from inside andoutside the government. Some Labour figures have accused him of slowing down government plans by taking an excessively legalistic approach.View image in fullscreenRichard Hermer, the attorney general.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAThe prime minister’s spokesperson expressed full confidence in Hermer on Monday afternoon and stressed he was the best person for the job.Glasman, who launched BlueLabourin 2010 as an antidote to New Labour, was the only party figure to attend Trump’s presidential inauguration last month. He was reportedly invited by Trump’s vice-president, JD Vance, with whom he has struck up a friendship.Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff and the most powerful figure in his government, has taken an interest in Blue Labour, which champions small-C conservatism as a way of appealing to traditional working-class voters.Glasman expressed his frustration at the direction Starmer’s government was taking but said: “Morgan is one of ours, we love him.”However, he took aim at others in the government. “They’re still going ahead with the Chagos deal, they’re not grasping any form of industrialisation, particularly around Ukraine and defence, where we could go into a really serious position as the leading military power in Europe.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now she’s just a drone for the Treasury. There’s no vision of economic renewal and no idea about how to renew the faraway towns.”A parliamentary Blue Labour caucus has been launched amid fears among Labour MPs about the rising popularity of Reform UK, which is neck and neck with Labour and the Conservatives in opinion polls.At a marathon cabinet meeting last week, the prime minister criticised “progressive liberals” for being “too relaxed” about voters’ concerns about immigration.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsKeir StarmerHouse of LordsLabourMorgan McSweeneyRachel ReevesnewsShareReuse this content"

Their faces blurred, the men are surrounded by Border Force staff.The previously secret process of removals shows each detainee surrounded by up to five guards wearing hi-vis yellow vests. One of the men being removed is shown wearing handcuffs.Home Office sources said it showed a flight of 47 foreign criminals and refused asylum seekers being deported to an unnamed European destination.Accompanying the release of the footage, a press release said the Home Office had “for the first time” shared images of the inner working of the removals process.Lewis said: “Just using harsh and cruel language, or bringing in longer sentences, or filming people being put on to planes, will not solve the problem. Seeking asylum is not a criminal act and filming people who have been refused permission to stay in the UK is cruel.”Lewis added that consecutiveLabourand Conservative governments were in effect “mainstreaming racism” by pandering to the demands of Reform.He said: “The tactical mistake that they are making is that they will never be harsh or cruel enough for those who are utilising this for political gain. We will never go far enough for the Reform party.“The problem is that we will give people in these groups permission to go further and further using more racist rhetoric. It is enabling the mainstreaming of racism.”The Labour peer Shami Chakrabartisaid: “I’m glad these images are anonymised because there’s a fine line between public confidence and humiliation. Whether you are blue, green or sky-blue-pink Labour, you’ll never beat the far right at their own toxic game.”James Wilson, the director of Detention Action, called the footage “an act of performative cruelty” by the government.He said: “Each day, we speak to people facing such flights who have children, families and established lives here in the UK. We are seriously concerned about the risk of children and families watching the removal of their loved ones on TV. Filming people in this way is an appalling violation of their privacy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Sunday, it released footage of immigration raids for illegal workers, prompting Diane Abbott to say: “Trying to present ourselves as Reform-lite is a big mistake.”Between 5 July 2024 and 31 January 2025, a total of 18,987 returns were recorded – an increase of 24%, the Home Office said. Removals of foreign national offenders were up by 21% and illegal working raids up by 38% compared with the same period 12 months previously.There were 5,074 enforced returns of people with no legal right to remain in the UK over this period. This compares with 4,089 enforced returns over the same period 12 months previously – an increase of 24%.Of the total returns since 5 July 2024, 2,925 were of foreign national offenders – an increase of 21%, officials said.Ministers insist that success in ramping up the number of removals is vital for restoring order to the asylum system, alongside breaking the business model of smuggling gangs through tougher law enforcement powers.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, said: “To rebuild public confidence in the immigration system, we need to show the rules are respected and enforced. That’s why, as part of the government’s plan for change, we have put significant additional resource into immigration enforcement and returns, so those who have no right to be here, particularly those who have committed crimes in our country, are removed as swiftly as possible.”The border security, asylum and immigration bill returned for debate in the House of Commons in its second reading on Monday.It aims to introduce a series of offences and powers to crack down on the people-smugglers bringing people across the Channel.“This bill is about restoring order to the immigration and asylum system and rebuilding our border security,” Cooper told the house, rather than “standing on the shoreline just shouting at the sea”.Explore more on these topicsLabourImmigration and asylumClive LewisShami ChakrabartiForeign policyHome OfficeReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

The authority has secured planning permission for a solar farm on part of the land.Howells, 39, said on Monday it had been “quite a surprise” to hear of the closure plan. He said: “It [the council] claimed at the high court that closing the landfill to allow me to search would have a huge detrimental impact on the people of Newport, whilst at the same time they were planning to close the landfill anyway.“I expected it would be closed in the coming years because it’s 80/90% full – but didn’t expect its closure so soon. If Newport city council would be willing, I would potentially be interested in purchasing the landfill site ‘as is’ and have discussed this option with investment partners and it is something that is very much on the table.”When he appeared at Cardiff civil justice centre, represented by lawyers working pro bono, Howells described how in the summer of 2013he accidentally put the hard drivecontaining his bitcoin wallet in a black bag during an office sort-out and left it in the hall of his house. His then partner is said to have mistaken the bag for rubbish and taken it with her on a trip to the dump, where it has been lost.Howells quickly realised the mistake and ever since has been asking the council to help him retrieve the hard drive, even offering to share the money with the authority, to no avail.The council has resisted Howells’ attempts to allow him to search, insisting that the hard drive had become its property when it entered the landfill site.Sitting as a high court judge, Judge Keyser KC said in January that he accepted the council’s argument that Howells was not entitled to try to retrieve it.Newport city council declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsBitcoinWalesCryptocurrenciesnewsShareReuse this content"

She denies the charges.Sam Kerr jury asked to consider difference if she had called a police officer ‘stupid and black’Read moreGrace Forbes, defending Kerr, gave her closing argument on Monday morning. She described the conduct of police on 30 January 2023 as “completely unacceptable” after they failed to take claims by the footballer and her partner, Kristie Mewis about the taxi driver’s alleged dangerous driving and false imprisonment seriously.After a night out, the pair hailed a black cab from central London back to their home in south-west London, the court has heard. During the journey, Kerr felt sick and vomited out of the window, sparking a dispute about paying for cleaning. After this, the couple claim the driver locked the car and began speeding and swerving, prompting Mewis to smash a window with a kick.Unbeknownst to the couple, the taxi driver had rung the police, who told him to drive to Twickenham police station, the court was told. After he parked up, Kerr crawled out of the broken window and opened the car door from the outside to let Mewis out. The pair then approached a marked police car outside the station.Forbes said the first “20 vital minutes” of Kerr and Mewis’ encounter with police were never captured on camera. Bodyworn footage shown to the court begins when Kerr and Mewis are inside Twickenham police station.“Two individuals went straight up to a marked police car looking for help in a state of distress. How and why did we go from that to what was an utterly unproductive, heated, argument?“It seems that no one thought that it was worth putting on their body-worn footage when they saw a woman climbing through a broken window, when they were making allegations of false imprisonment,” said Forbes.She told the jury to treat the “one dimensional image” they had been presented of a “drunk and angry woman” with caution. The prosecution had played footage of Kerr saying “fucking stupid and white” to, in part, “capitalise on the shock factor” and wear them down after “hearing those words time and time again”.Commenting on Kerr’s mention of lawyers in the exchange, Forbes said the footballer felt the “need to front it out” and compared her to “a puffer fish blowing itself up” to feel more secure.Forbes described the conduct of police that night as “completely unacceptable”, saying the police officers “had made no meaningful attempt” to investigate the pair’s claims.“Even if you are drunk, you can still be a victim of crime,” said Forbes. “PC Lovell conceded in evidence that their allegations were capable of amounting to dangerous driving and false imprisonment. Why did he say on the night what she had told him didn’t amount to any offences?“No officer swept the vehicle for a device themselves. No one has ever bothered to take a witness statement from Kristie Mewis. No wonder the police have never heard from the driver again.”She also cast doubt on the extent to which Lovell’s claims he was impacted by being called “stupid and white”, noting that no other officers “in that room claimed to feel impact”.When PC Lovell was on the witness stand, she told the court, “four valiant attempts” were made to emphasise how much he was impacted. She said “the height of his feeling” was “that upset me I guess”.The jury was later sent out to consider its verdict.Explore more on these topicsSam KerrChelsea WomennewsShareReuse this content"

But it’s like the Post Office scandal – it takes the little people to stand up,” she said.An ongoingGuardian investigationhas revealed howdraconian and rigidly enforcedcarer’s allowance rules saddled hundreds of thousands of people with huge debts in recent years.Tucker’s case highlights the controversial issue of “averaging” whereby carers are penalised by the DWP for breaching weekly earnings limits even though their average net earnings over three months or a year are within the rules.Averaging is allowed under social security law – and was once commonly approved by officials to make it easier for people with irregular earnings to work part-time and retain carer’s allowance.However, official guidance introduced in March 2020 massively restricted the circumstances under which averaging could be used. This led to carers breaching earnings rules if they received, for example, one-off Covid payments, holiday pay or performance bonuses.Tucker’splighthas been taken up by her local MP, the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, who raised it at prime minister’s questions last Wednesday. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, has promised to look into the case.Davey,himself an unpaid carerfor his teenage son John, has called on ministers to write off Tucker’s benefit debts and suspend all carer’s allowance overpayment demands until the conclusion of the independent government-commissioned review of the benefit, expected in the summer.“The way DWP treated Andrea and thousands of carers like her makes my blood boil. The government urgently needs to get to the bottom of this and put things right for carers,” Davey told the Guardian.Labour hasvowed to end the scandalthat has seenhundreds of thousandsof unpaid carers like Tucker forced to repay unwittingly accrued overpayments. More than 600 carers have been prosecuted for fraud since 2019.Latest official figures show more than 134,500 unpaid carers are paying back more than £251m after unwittingly falling foul of drastic “cliff-edge” rules on earnings limits. This means a carer who earned £1 more than the current £151 a week threshold for 52 weeks would have to pay back not £52 but £4,258.80.Tucker, 57, of Chessington, Surrey, said she phoned the DWP in July 2019 to report she was taking a part-time job with irregular hours. She was told she would not be penalised if her total earnings, averaged over a 12-month period, did not exceed carer’s allowance earnings limits.The DWP changed its guidance in March 2020 to in effect outlaw the 12-month retrospective arrangements used by Tucker. It did not inform her of this change, she said.Tucker, who will be at a social security tribunal appeal on Tuesday, has prepared detailed figures demonstrating that in each of five successive years her income from paid work did not exceed annual earnings limits. Some months she worked up to six hours for free to ensure she remained within the rules.She is furious that while the DWP is likely to have received electronic alerts showing she had apparently breached earnings limits 16 times between 2019 and 2024, they did not warn her about this. They allowed her to unwittingly accrue £4,600 in overpayments before finally writing to her last year to ask her to repay it.Davey said her treatment was “wholly nonsensical and unfair” and her punishment draconian. “It seems that DWP could and should have been taking Andrea’s average income over the year, as she had been told they would – so she should never have been asked for repayments, let alone being dragged before a tribunal,” he added.A DWP spokesperson said: “This government understands the struggles carers are facing, which is why we have launched our independent review of carer’s allowance to explore how overpayments have occurred and what changes can be made to reduce the risk of them accruing in the future.“We recognise overpayments have caused anxiety for people, that’s why it is important to take the time to independently review these circumstances so we can find out exactly what went wrong and make things right.”Explore more on these topicsCarersCarer's allowance crisisSocial careBenefitsWelfarenewsShareReuse this content"

Trump said in his inauguration address thatthe US will “drill, baby, drill”for oil and gas under his leadership.“I have a good friend on the other side of the ocean saying ‘drill, baby, drill.’ Here, there is no need to drill. It’s plug, baby, plug. Electricity is available,” he said on Monday.Macron added that a European AI strategy, to be unveiled by the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, on Tuesday, would be a “unique opportunity forEuropeto accelerate” in the technology.View image in fullscreenMacron (centre) and European leaders pose during a meeting as part of the Paris AI Action Summit.Photograph: Teresa Suárez/EPA“We have to provide a bigger domestic market to all the startups when they start as Europeans,” he said.Criticism of a draft communique has threatened to overshadow the summit’s final day on Tuesday, when Macron will be joined by von der Leyen as well as the US vice-president, JD Vance, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. Keir Starmeris not attending.With the US reportedly unhappy about the wording, which includes phrases such as “sustainable and inclusive AI”,Politico reportedon Monday that the UK was also minded not to sign the communique.Speaking inParis, the UK tech secretary, Peter Kyle, said the government was “in negotiations” over the statement but “that’s something we don’t comment on while the negotiations unfold”.A government source said they hoped the negotiations would get to a place over the course of the summit where the UK could sign the declaration and said there was still a considerable amount of time left to have those discussions.But the source suggested that the UK was prepared to walk away, saying the joint declaration had to be “squarely in British interests” or it would not get its backing. “We always want to get to a place of agreement but it needs to work for the UK,” they said.View image in fullscreenMacron talks at the event held in the Grand Palais in Paris.Photograph: Mohammed Badra/EPAThe draft statement, seen by the Guardian, also refers to AI technology that is “human rights based, human-centric, ethical, safe, secure and trustworthy”. It places much less emphasis on safetythan the declaration at the inaugural AI summit, held in the UK in 2023, which pointed to the technology’s potential to cause “catastrophic” harm.Max Tegmark,a leading voice in AI safety, urged countries to shun the statement if it was not amended, saying that its lack of focus on risks from powerful AI systems was a “recipe for disaster”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The UNI represents about 20 million workers worldwide in industries including retail, finance and entertainment.“Without worker representation, AI-driven productivity gains risk turning the technology into yet another engine of inequality, further straining our democracies,” she told attenders.On Sunday, Macron promoted the event by posting amontage of deepfake imagesof himself on Instagram, including a video of “him” dancing in a disco with various 1980s hairstyles, in a tongue-in-cheek reference to the technology’s capabilities.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)FranceParisComputingEmmanuel MacronEuropeDonald TrumpShareReuse this content"

The 77-year-old Rushdie was grievously injured in the attack and lost sight in one eye.In opening statements on Monday, the prosecutor Jason Schmidt told jurors in Chautauqua county court that Matar, from Fairview, New Jersey, had “come dangerously close to committing murder” when he assaulted Rushdie with a knife.Matar, Schmidt said, had approached Rushdie in a “direct and rapid manner” as he sat on the stage and began his assault “without hesitation, deliberately, forcefully, efficiently and with speed”.The attack, Schmidt continued, “came so fast and unexpectedly that he [Rushdie] continued to sit in his chair … he didn’t register what was happening”. The assault, Schmidt said, continued after Rushdie got up to run. Members of the audience tackled Matar and held him down until a state trooper patrolling nearby arrived.After a vivid description of the wounds Rushdie had received to his neck, face and abdomen, the prosecutor said the author was rushed to a nearby trauma center where was found to be “losing blood so rapidly he was in hemorrhagic shock from blood loss”.Schmidt said anyone in Rushdie’s condition who had not received level-one trauma care would have died.The long-awaited trial has attracted the world’s media to the small town of Mayville in westernNew Yorkstate. As he entered the courtroom Matar said: “Free Palestine.” The defendant, who was dressed in a blue untucked shirt and trousers, faces a 25-year maximum sentence if convicted.Salman Rushdie set to testify as attempted murder trial gets under wayRead moreThe trial was briefly thrown into question when the defense team revealed that Matar’s lead attorney, Nathaniel Barone, had been hospitalized overnight, but Judge David Foley denied a defense request to delay the start of the trial.Public defender Lynn Schaffer, standing in for Barone, said it was not an open-and-shut case against Matar – and reasonable doubt existed.The case is not a “whodunnit, not an Agatha Christie novel”, Schaffer told the court. “The prosecution will want you to believe this is straightforward … open and shut … this case on video, nothing to see here.”But, she added, referring to Schmidt, “Don’t believe him – it’s not that simple. Nothing is that simple in life.”Schaffer said: “The elements of a crime are more than just something really bad happened. Something bad did happen, something very bad did happen, but the DA has to prove something more than that, and something much more specific than that.”Using the analogy of Sunday’s Super Bowl, Schaffer said it was not possible to know “what’s inside any of those players’ minds” despite the camera angles – an apparent reference to video of the attack the prosecution has said it would show to jurors.Deborah Moore Kushmaul, program director at the Chautauqua Institution and the first witness for the prosecution, said Rushdie had been booked to speak on a theme of “shelter and redefining home”.Moore identified a 10in knife prosecutors say was used by Hatar, and described “more and more commotion” in the amphitheater. She said she could not initially tell if the sound was “laughter or screaming”.Later in her testimony, Moore said she could “see blood, I could see people piled on. The audience, many of whom were very elderly, were screaming. I saw people trying to hold the attacker down, and others trying to help Mr Rushdie.”Rushdie may be called by the prosecution on Tuesday, according to reports.In a jailhouse interview soon after he was detained, Matar told the New York Post he had read only two pages of Rushdie’s novel The Satanic Verses, which initiated a fatwa against the author issued in 1989 by Iran’s then leader, Ayatollah Khomeini.Matar, who haspleaded not guiltyand will betried on federal terrorism-related chargesat a later date, told the outlet that he believed Rushdie had “attacked Islam”.Rushdie, who lived with security protection in London for a decade before moving to New York to live under less constrained circumstances, wrotein Knife, a meditative account of the attack, that he does not regret the earlier novel.“I am proud of the work I’ve done, and that very much includes The Satanic Verses. If anyone’s looking for remorse, you can stop reading right here,” he wrote.But before the incident, he dreamed of being attacked by a gladiator with a spear in a Roman amphitheater. He later said he thought: “Don’t be silly. It’s a dream.”But he also questioned his apparent passivity under the attack.“Why didn’t I fight? Why didn’t I run? I just stood there like a piñata and let him smash me,” Rushdie wrote in Knife. “It didn’t feel dramatic, or particularly awful. It just felt probable … matter-of-fact.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkSalman RushdieUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Ever.”Palmer and Gaiman, who married in 2011 and had a child together in 2015, announced in 2022 that they had decided to divorce.On 15 January, Palmer said in aninitial Instagram statementthat because of ongoing custody and divorce proceedings, she was unable to offer public comment on the allegations. A representative for Palmertold NMEthat she “is profoundly disturbed” by the allegations against Gaiman.The lawsuit states that Pavlovich met Palmer in Auckland in 2020, when Pavlovich was 22, and the two became acquaintances. Pavlovich would sometimes run errands for Palmer, and eventually became the couple’s nanny.The lawsuit alleges that Gaiman repeatedly sexually assaulted Pavlovich while she was working without pay during a “three-week indenture”. At the time, she was “broke and homeless”, and Gaiman and Palmer “intentionally withheld” pay to keep her “trapped, vulnerable, and penniless”, it claims.Pavlovich said when she went to Palmer about the assaults, Palmer told her that other women had previously come to her about abusive sexual encounters with Gaiman.The lawsuit states that Palmer “knowingly approached and procured the services of Scarlett with reckless disregard for the fact that Gaiman would force Scarlett to engage in commercial sex acts” with him.“I thank you all deeply for continuing to respect my recent request for privacy as I navigate this extremely difficult moment”, Palmer wrote in her post on Friday. “I must protect my young child and his right to privacy.”Explore more on these topicsBooksNeil GaimanAmanda PalmernewsShareReuse this content"

The ring gives a glimpse of a more distant galaxy, sitting directly behind NGC 6505, whose starlight has been bent around the foreground galaxy.“This is a beautiful, extraordinary, thrilling and lucky find in our first data,” said Prof Stephen Serjeant, an astronomer at the Open University. “An Einstein ring as perfect as this is extremely rare. We get to see a background galaxy through the warped space and time of a very nearby foreground galaxy.”Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity predicts that light will bend around massive objects in space, meaning that galaxies can act as vast lenses. Einstein rings are a powerful tool for astronomers because they reveal objects that would otherwise be obscured from view and indicate the mass of the intermediate galaxy – including any hidden mass in the form of dark matter.In this case, astronomers estimate that the foreground galaxy comprises roughly 11% dark matter. This is a relatively small fraction given that dark matter is believed to dominate the overall mass content of the universe.View image in fullscreenEinstein ring as captured by Euclid telescopePhotograph: ESAUncovering the secrets of dark matter and dark energy, which together make up 95% of the universe, is the central aim of theEuropean Space Agency’s €1bn (£850m) mission. Ultimately the telescope, which can detect galaxies out to 10bn light years, is aiming to create the largest cosmic 3D map ever made. This will allow astronomers to infer the large-scale distribution of dark matter and reveal the influence of dark energy, a mysterious force that is accelerating the expansion of the universe.The telescope will capture images of objects up to 10bn light years away, but the latest image shows its unmatched ability for razor-sharp observations is revealing new structures in the nearby universe, too. The NGC 6505 galaxy is about 590m light-years from Earth – a stone’s throw away in cosmic terms – and the unnamed background galaxy is 4.42bn light years away.“I find it very intriguing that this ring was observed within a well-known galaxy, which was first discovered in 1884,” said Dr Valeria Pettorino, ESA Euclid project scientist. “The galaxy has been known to astronomers for a very long time. And yet this ring was never observed before. This demonstrates how powerful Euclid is, finding new things even in places we thought we knew well.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean Space AgencyAstronomySpaceAlbert EinsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

Police said they had seized eight books and needed time to investigate further, including reading the books.“They took any book that had a Palestinian icon or Palestinian flag, and tried to translate it using Google Translate,” Morad Muna, brother of Mahmoud, told the Guardian. “They even took a copy of Haaretz [an Israeli newspaper] as part of the search.”View image in fullscreenA screengrab of CCTV footage of the raid.Photograph: CCTVOther books examined by the police included the artist Banksy’s Wall and Piece, Gaza in Crisis by the US academic Noam Chomsky and the Israeli scholar Ilan Pappé, and Love Wins by the Canadian film-maker and photographer Afzal Huda.Rights groups and prominent intellectuals called for the men’s immediate release, describing the arrests as part of a broader attack on Palestinian cultural identity.Protesters gathered outside the courthouse on Monday morning to support the Munas, including the Pulitzer prize-winning author Nathan Thrall, who launched his book A Day in the Life of Abed Salama at the Educational Bookshop.View image in fullscreenNathan Thrall at the protest on Monday.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian“[Israeli authorities] are creating a climate of fear for Palestinians in East Jerusalem,” he said. The arrests were particularly chilling because the bookstore was so well known, he added. “To go after someone who … has all kinds of connections in the diplomatic community and on the Israeli left, will send an even stronger message.”The family-owned shop has been at the heart of cultural life in Jerusalem for more than four decades. Its broad collection of books by Palestinian, Israeli and international authors is popular with residents and tourists, and its cafe hosts regular literary events.It has three branches – two on Salah al-Din Street, the main shopping road in East Jerusalem – which were raided on Sunday.The third is in the American Colony, a Jerusalem hotel popular for decades with visiting leaders and celebrities from Mikhail Gorbachev and Tony Blair to Bob Dylan and Uma Thurman.Diplomats from nine countries, including the UK, Brazil and Switzerland, attended the hearing. Germany’s ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, said he was “concerned”, describing himself as a regular customer of the bookshop.“I know … the Muna family, to be peace-loving proud Palestinian Jerusalemites, open for discussion and intellectual exchange. I am concerned to hear of the raid and their detention in prison,” he said in a statement on X.Mahmoud and Ahmed Muna’s lawyer lodged an appeal to the district court to demand his clients’ immediate release, but it was rejected on Monday afternoon.Nasser Oday described the detentions as an “extremely dangerous” attack on cultural life in the city and warned they would set a new legal precedent.“(The arrests are) part of a new policy followed by Israeli police in Jerusalem to suppress freedom of expression and Palestinian thought, and prevent learning and education,” he told journalists after the hearing.View image in fullscreenProtesters outside court in Jerusalem on Monday.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianHe placed the raid in a long historical line of attacks on books and education in the region, dating back at least to the 13th century Mongol attack on Baghdad.The police came about 3pm and stayed for around an hour, ransacking shelves and the stockroom, Morad Muna said. Mahmoud’s 11-year-old daughter was helping in the shop at the time, and saw her father being taken away.“They want to make us afraid. Not just us, they want to send a message to all Palestinian people,” Morad Muna said. The family decided to reopen the shops as soon as possible, and on Monday afternoon they were packed with new and long-term customers keen to show their support.“I think this is the best reaction that we can do to such a situation,” Muna added.View image in fullscreenMahmoud Muna inside a branch of the Educational Bookshop chain in July 2024.Photograph: Sally Hayden/SOPA Images/ShutterstockA police statement said “detectives encountered numerous books containing inciteful material with nationalist Palestinian themes, including a children’s colouring book titled From the River to the Sea.”View image in fullscreenThe colouring book mentioned by Israeli police in their statement.Photograph: handoutAll prosecutions relating to freedom of speech have to be approved by the attorney general’s office, but police can carry out arrests on suspicion of violations of public order on their own authority.The rights group B’Tselem called for the immediate release of the two men, and an end to the persecution of Palestinian intellectuals. “The attempt to crush the Palestinian people includes the harassment and arrest of intellectuals,” the group said in a statement. “Israel must immediately release [Mahmoud and Ahmed Muna] from detention and stop persecuting Palestinian intellectuals.”Last year policearrested and interrogatedNadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian, a leading Palestinian legal scholar based at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Nonetheless, in a conversation with the Daily Mail, Zül-Qarnain Nantambu – who discusses politics as well as his life as a Muslim in the US on his Open Book Platform channel on YouTube – identified himself as the ejected performer.Nantambu reportedlytoldthe Daily Mail that he had been hired as a participant in Lamar’s show about two weeks before the Super Bowl. He said the Grammy winner had no idea about the demonstration Nantambu was planning – something meant to “show solidarity with the people” victimized by ongoing conflicts in those parts of the world.“We have a life of luxury in comparison to what they’re going through,” said Nantambu, who lists himself as a musician, film-maker, fashion designer and freedom fighter, according to the Daily Mail.A separate statement from an NFL spokesperson, Brian McCarthy, said the ejected performer would be “banned for life from all [league] stadiums and events”.The cast member stood on a car used as a prop forLamar’s performance and held up the flag. He then leapt off the vehicle and the stage when approached by a production crew member, asvideocirculated on social media shows.He subsequently ran around the field while holding up the flag before men in suits who were providing security detained him. Louisiana state police troopers could then be seen escorting the performer out.McCarthy’s statement said the“individual hid the item on his person and unveiled it late in the show”.“No one involved with the production was aware of the individual’s intent,” McCarthy said.Roc Nation, the entertainment company which produced the show, said that the act “was neither planned nor part of the production and was never in any rehearsal”.Lamar completed his performance without interruption. On social media associated with Nantambu, the flag he was holding could be seen briefly on the television broadcast of Lamar’s show while the tennis superstar Serena Williams did what is known as a crip walk – a dance move out of her and the lyricist’s home town of Los Angeles.State troopers at the Superdome on Sunday encountered at least one other person who was accused of doing something that they were not supposed to do.Alec Nguyen, described as a 23-year-old resident of South Amboy, New Jersey, was spotted wearing a fake identification card by security personnel in the Superdome at about 9.25pm on Sunday, state police wrote in court documents that were obtained by the Guardian.Troopers approached Nguyen after he allegedly refused to answer security workers’ questions about the false credential. He allegedly declined to answer troopers’ questions, too, prompting them to arrest Nguyen on counts of criminal trespassing and resisting arrest by refusing to identify himself.According to court documents, troopers who searched Nguyen found “numerous items of audio and visual recording equipment on him”.New Orleans magistrate court judge Jonathan Friedman set Nguyen’s bail Monday at $3,000.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS newsSuper Bowl LIXKendrick LamarUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The president’s order had said that a man identifying as a woman was “not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member”.To that end, the memo from Hegseth on Monday – filed with the US district court in Washington DC – said: “Effective immediately, all new accessions for individuals with a history of gender dysphoria are paused.“All unscheduled, scheduled, or planned medical procedures associated with affirming or facilitating a gender transition for service members are paused.”Trump hints Musk ‘Doge’ team has free rein with Pentagon next in line for cutsRead moreHegseth’s memo added: “The department must ensure it is building ‘one force’ without subgroups defined by anything other than ability or mission adherence. Efforts to split our troops along lines of identity weaken our force and make us vulnerable. Such efforts must not be tolerated or accommodated.”The memo from Hegseth cited Trump’s executive order, stating: “As the president clearly stated … ‘expressing a false “gender identity” divergent from an individual’s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service’.”Hegseth said individuals with gender dysphoria who are already in the military would be “treated with dignity and respect”, and the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness would provide additional details on what this would mean.The military has about 1.3 million active-duty personnel, according to US department of defense data. While transgender rights advocates say there are as many as 15,000 transgender service members, officials say the number is in the low thousands.A poll from Gallup published on Monday said 58% of Americans favored allowing openly transgender individuals serving in the military – but the support had declined from 71% in 2019.A US federal judge recently asked lawyers for Trump’s second presidential administration to ensure that six military members who sued to stop the executive order targeting transgender troops are not removed from service before further court proceedings are held.Civil rights organizations had filed for a temporary restraining order after a service member alleged that she was told she must either be classified as a man or be separated from the military.Miriam Perelson, a 28-year-old female transgender service member based at Fort Jackson in South Carolina, had said she was required to leave the sleeping area for female troops. She was given a cot in an empty classroom and not allowed to use the female restrooms.On Thursday, Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign filed alawsuiton behalf of three senior Naval officers against the Trump administration over his executive order to ban transgender people from the military.In the lawsuit, two of the nation’s largest LGBTQ+ advocacy groups wrote: “Transgender service members take the same oath as every other service member to serve our nation and place themselves in harm’s way – potentially paying the ultimate price – in service of our country. And to be clear, our country needs ready, able, and willing service members to stand up and protect our freedoms.”It added: “But the 2025 military ban turns them away and kicks them out for no legitimate reason. Rather, it baselessly declares all transgender people unfit to serve, insults and demeans them, and cruelly describes every one of them as incapable of ‘an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life’, based solely because they are transgender. These assertions are, of course, false.”Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS militaryLGBTQ+ rightsUS politicsTransgendernewsShareReuse this content"

Ethnicity is a circumstance that the police have taken into account since early in the investigation when assessing a possible motive.” He added: “It is too early to say that there is a specific reason behind the act.”Prosecutors said on Monday they had confirmed the identity of the gunman, widelynamed in the mediaas Rickard Andersson, 35. He is believed to have killed himself along with 10 others when he attacked Campus Risbergska, an adult education centre where he once attended classes.In a televised speech on Sunday night, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said a national one-minute silence would be held on Tuesday at midday, a week on from the attack. “Sweden is a country in mourning,” he said.View image in fullscreenThe Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, delivered a speech to the nation on Sunday.Photograph: Magnus Liljegren Handout/EPAPaying tribute to the victims, seven women and three men aged between 31 and 68, Kristersson said: “They came from different places in the world and had different dreams. They were in school to lay the foundation for the future that has now been taken away from them.”Students at Risbergska, which offers courses including in nursing and the Swedish language, were studying to “realise their ambitions”, he said. “These were people who wanted to do something good, who wanted to contribute to a better society.”Police have not officiallynamed the victims, but among those named in local media are Salim Iskef, 28, who was studying care. The Syrian refugee phoned his fiancee moments before he died to tell her he had been shot and that he loved her.Elsa Teklay, 32, had four children and had been working in schools and in elderly care since she and her family left Eritrea for Sweden. Bassam Al Sheleh, 48, was a baker and father of two from Syria who had been studying to improve his Swedish.Aziza, 68, whose surname has not been reported and who came to Sweden from Kurdistan in the 1990s, was a maths teacher at the education centre. Her family said she had moved to Sweden to be safe and had since helped countless people in their lives to build their careers.In his address, Kristersson, who leads a centre-right coalition supported by the far-right Sweden Democrats, called on the country to rally behind the victims and their grieving families. “When the perpetrator attacked them, he attacked all of us,” he said.“Hate is not defeated by more hate, but by us uniting and uniting behind all that we love in our country, all that we want to protect and build on.”Citing the words of the queen, Silvia, who last week during a visit to the school asked: “Where did the beautiful Sweden go?”, Kristersson said there was “only one Sweden”.“Not us and them. Not young or old. Not born here or born abroad. Not countryside or city. Not right or left,” he said. “We can be different and think differently, but it is our shared responsibility to build this country and to protect it. Especially when so much feels dark.”Magdalena Andersson, the former prime minister and leader of the main opposition party, the Social Democrats, said in a television appearance alongside Kristersson on Sunday night that “words matter’ and that people with immigrant backgrounds who had been left feeling fearful and excluded by the mass shooting had been failed. She said: “We must use this opportunity to create a turning point in our society.”Last week, the governmentannounced plansto strengthen its gun laws, including by restricting access to semi-automatic weapons, after the gunman was found to have had a licence to own four weapons, three of which were found beside him.Explore more on these topicsSwedenEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

From Daria to Endeavour, here are the 10 that came closest – and a few that actually managed itMichael HoganMon 10 Feb 2025 08.28 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 17.38 ESTShareSometimes on TV, the second time’s a charm. If the broadcasting stars align, a spin-off can breathe new life into familiar intellectual property and become beloved in its own right. Or else it can be Joanie Loves Chachi. Or HolbyBlue. Or Baywatch Nights. Or insert any number of best-forgotten flops.Whether it’s a sequel or a prequel, creating something new from a previous hit is a risky business, but it can reap rewards. In the week that theBBC successfully launched Amandaland, an offshoot of Motherland, and the Breaking Bad prequel Better Call Saul celebrated its 10th anniversary, we’ve selected the 10 best TV spin-offs of all time.There’s no room on the list for Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon, which may still become a classic but has yet to truly catch fire. Fear the Walking Dead, The Colbert Report, Lou Grant, Holby City, Beyond Paradise, Mork & Mindy and Melrose Place can also consider themselves unlucky. Post-Friends stinker Joey, however, definitely can’t.Can a small-screen spin-off ever improve on the original? These are the 10 shows that came closest – and, in a few rare cases, actually achieved it …Amandaland (2025)View image in fullscreenA total hoot … Amanda (Lucy Punch) with Mal (Samuel Anderson) in Amandland.Photograph: Natalie Seery/BBC/Merman“I’m actually glad I took the kids out of private school. They’ve got way more chance of getting into Oxbridge from a bog-standard state.” The new sequel to parenting comedy Motherland is far better than many expected, mainly thanks to retaining the original’s bitingly sharp writing team, and lead Lucy Punch is a total hoot. We follow the awful Amanda as she downsizes post-divorce and desperately tries to cling on to alpha mum status. Joanna Lumley steals scenes as her posh, pass-agg mother. A giddy mix of slapstick, class satire and school-gates politics that’s almost as heartfelt as it is hilarious.Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999-present)At 566 episodes and counting, SVU has outlasted and outshone the original Law & Order. Ushered in by a banger of a theme tune, NYPD stalwarts Elliot Stabler and Olivia Benson (terrifically played by Christopher Meloni and Mariska Hargitay) attempt to bring sex offenders to justice. The grimly gripping NBC police procedural remains addictive and remarkably consistent in quality. It’s currently the longest-running live action show on US TV – and will soon overtake Lassie in the all-time list. Woof.Angel (1999-2004)View image in fullscreenGrittier than its mothership show … Angel.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyAfter breaking Buffy’s heart and dodging death, 240-year-old vampire Angel (David Boreanaz) upped sticks to LA in search of redemption. Our brooding antihero became a private detective, hunting demons and “helping the helpless”. A sort of supernatural noir, it was grittier and more mature than its mothership show. A procession of guest stars from the original series provided a reminder of its Sunnydale roots – notably fan favourite Spike (James Marsters), who stayed for a whole series. When the show was unexpectedly axed after five seasons, creator Joss Whedon described it as“Healthy Guy Falls Dead From Heart Attack”.Young Sheldon (2017-2024)A prequel to The Big Bang Theory, this cutely retro sitcom follows Texas child prodigy Sheldon Cooper (Iain Armitage), with Jim Parsons, AKA adult Sheldon, on narration and executive-producing duties. The bow-tied brainiac tries to fit in, despite his precocious intellect and social ineptitude, against a nostalgic 1990s backdrop. Zoe Perry – lookalike daughter of the great Laurie Metcalf – shines as Sheldon’s sardonic mom. The spin-off recently spawned its own spin-off, Georgie and Mandy’s First Marriage. “Bazinga!” indeed.The Good Fight(2017-2022)View image in fullscreenSmart and slick … Audra McDonald, Christine Baranski and Nyambi Nyambi in The Good Fight.Photograph: Elizabeth Fisher/CBSWho doesn’t need more Christine Baranski in their lives?

The gloriously magnetic star was joined by a stellar supporting cast including Rose Leslie, Cush Jumbo and Michael Sheen. It deftly mixed courtroom drama with social commentary and ripped-from-the-headlines political plots, gradually morphing into an audacious howl of protest against Trump’s America.Endeavour(2012-2023)The mighty Inspector Morse had already spawned one spin-off, the serviceable but plodding Lewis. This 60s-set prequel was far superior. Shaun Evans excelled as troubled young DC Endeavour Morse, teamed in Oxford CID with streetwise veteran DI Fred Thursday (the always superb Roger Allam). After being a classy, cosy crime treat for more than a decade, it bowed out with a glimpse of John Thaw’s trademark red Jaguar and a blast of Barrington Pheloung’s Morse theme.Daria (1997-2002)The Simpsons, to our mind, doesn’t quite qualify. Sure, it started as a recurring segment on The Tracey Ullman Show but it grew, rather than spun off. Instead, our animated choice is this MTV cult classic. It’s ironic that one of 90s comedy’s smartest female characters began as a foil to sniggering morons Beavis and Butthead. Daria Morgendorffer’s star vehicle saw the disaffected 16-year-old offer scathingly cynical observations about high school and family life. The New York Times called her “a blend of Dorothy Parker, Fran Lebowitz and Janeane Garofalo”. High praise.Better Call Saul (2015-2022)View image in fullscreenProfound … Bob Odenkirk as Jimmy McGill, left, with Rhea Seehorn as Kim Wexler in Better Call Saul.Photograph: Robert Trachtenberg/APNobody foresaw aprequel series about Walter White’s dodgy lawyer – let’s face it, a pretty left-field pitch – coming close to Breaking Bad. In the event, it arguably bettered it. Creator Vince Gilligan crafted a bold, beautiful tragicomedy about deeply flawed antihero Jimmy McGill, sublimely portrayed by Bob Odenkirk. His origin story traced his journey from slippery Chicago conman to aspiring Albuquerque attorney – ultimately becoming the flamboyant Saul Goodman, shady representative of drug cartels. Slower burning and more cinematic than BB, it was profound, immersive and exceeded all expectations.Torchwood (2006-2011)This anagrammatic Doctor Who spin-off was like “Buffy goes to Cardiff” – sexed-up, post-watershed sci-fi for a teen and twentysomething audience. It was led by John Barrowman as former Tardis companion Captain Jack Harkness. The immortal con artist from the future hired a crack team of bright young things to hunt aliens escaping from the space-time rift beneath the Welsh capital. It became a huge cult favourite (see the outcry when Ianto Jones was killed off) and broke BBC Three ratings records. Fans still hope for a revival, especially now thatTorchwoodcreator Russell T Davies is back at the Whoniverse controls. C’mon, RTD, do it for Ianto.Frasier (1993-present)View image in fullscreenA masterstroke … Kelsey Grammer as Dr Frasier Crane, David Hyde Pierce as Dr Niles Crane, Jane Leeves as Daphne Moon, Peri Gilpin as Roz Doyle in Frasier.Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesPompous psychiatrist DrFrasierCrane occupied a fairly lowly position in the Cheers ensemble. He was originally conceived as the third wheel in a love triangle with leads Sam and Diane. It proved a masterstroke to relocate him to Seattle for his own series, which blossomed into one of the all-time great network sitcoms. A dazzlingly witty, screwball-style comedy was built around the fizzing chemistry between Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce as Frasier’s equally snooty brother Niles. It gobbled up Emmy wins, tossed salads and scrambled eggs for 11 superlative seasons. The patchy 2023 reboot didn’t come close and was recently axed by Paramount+.What have we criminally overlooked?

If I’d moved, everyone would have had an eyeful’Interviews byHannah VerdierMon 10 Feb 2025 09.42 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 18.06 ESTShareBob Stanley, co-writerSt Etienne did a club tour in early 1991 and we were hearing all these dancehits like DJ H featuring Stefy’s I Like Itand(I Wanna Give You) Devotion by Nomad. We thought: “Let’s go home and write something that will work in a club.” We made the song as basic as possible, with a memorable hook.Sarah Cracknell sang on the original demo and Pete Wiggs and I pressed up the white label promo records ourselves and drove around London dropping them off in various shops: City Sounds at Holborn, Black Market Records in Soho and Zoom in Camden. We were stupidly confident about it. We thought it’d be a big hit. That’s about the only time I’ve ever thought that about a record.We’d just pressed a second batch when the track was picked up by Arista, who wanted to sign us, but we couldn’t because we were already on Heavenly and were about to release our first album as St Etienne, Foxbase Alpha.We thought we'd be able to stroll into Top of the Pops – but they wouldn't let us inWe had to re-record the song and the vocals because Sarah was under contract too, so she suggested her friend, Janey Lee Grace, could sing on it. We came up with the alias Cola Boy, but when the song took off we realised we’d have to do personal appearances in clubs to promote it. So I got my mate Andrew Midgley, who I’d met when I was working in Virgin Records in Peterborough, to be Cola Boy. I remember it was released the same time asGypsy Woman (La Da Dee) by Crystal Waters. Mixmag tipped us both as the hot singles of the week.When Cola Boy went on Top of the Pops, Pete and I just assumed we’d be able to stroll in, but they wouldn’t let us into the studio. So we had to watch it at home. It was really odd seeing one of my best mates on TOTP. Me and Pete were both huge fans of theBrill Building pop eraso to do something together, involve our friends and get on TOTP was really exciting. It was like our own hit factory – and far less frightening than having to see yourself on TV.Janey Lee Grace, singerI started my career as a backing singer for Wham! and Mari Wilson, but I was fired from being a “Wilsation” because I wouldn’t cut my hair short and dye it bright yellow. At that time I was trying to do my own stuff. I’d done a cover of Love to Love You Baby with Paul Oakenfold, which got to the very bottom of the dance chart.After Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs of St Etienne called, it took me two hours to get to the session and two hours to get back – and I was only in there for 50 minutes! They just said, “Can you sing, ‘7 Ways to Love’?” then, “Can you ad-lib?” and then, “You’re done.” I was saying: “What about the verse? And the chorus?” But that was it.Andrew and I went straight into doing PAs in the clubs. I know how lucky I was that I got to go to all the raves without being the person driving up and down the country. I’d swan in to all these places, including Ministry of Sound and Heaven, only have to stay for an hour and then I’d get paid. Take That supported us on our first few PAs. They were lovely and asked us for our autographs.When we did a photoshoot for Smash Hits, I told the stylist I liked 60s stuff: feather boas and glamour. So she promised to find me something fabulous. We got to the shoot and she’d brought a worryingly small suitcase containing a mustard rollneck jumper and a below-the-knee tartan kilt. I ended up wearing the photographer’s biker jacket for the photos and the hairdresser pinned up and backcombed my hair as a distraction. That 60s beehive became my look.When we did Top of the Pops, I needed a new outfit because I only had one and I’d already worn it on our first TV appearance onThe Hitman and Her. My manager and I jumped in a cab to a vintage shop in the East End where I found the perfect dress – except it was too tight. I couldn’t really move in it, which is why I’m standing so still and only waving my arms on TV. I had to bin my choreography – because if I’d moved, everyone would have had an eyeful.From Wham! to Woo: A Life on the Mic by Janey Lee Grace is out now. St Etienne’s latest album, The Night, is out now.Explore more on these topicsCultureHow we madePop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

According to my favouriteWikipediawormhole, that’s just one of the many possible ways our universe could bite the bullet some 100 quindecillion (give or take a few septillion) years from now.To me, Wikipedia’s seemingly innocuousTimeline of the far futurepage (along with its existentially harrowing cousin,Ultimate fate of the universe) is the perfect encapsulation of the internet’s inbuilt dissonance: monolithic in meaning but oh-so pedestrian in its presentation. It offers a snapshot of mind-boggling scientific theory wrapped up in a boring, colour-coded spreadsheet, built and tended to by faceless back-end contributors who are probably goosing up Elon Musk’s own Wikipedia page at the same time as they’re casually cataloguing the theoretical extinction of the Y chromosome 5m years from now.A wholesome escape from the housing crisis: the Facebook group dedicated to retro Australian homesRead moreEvery year of human history has its own dedicated Wikipedia page, going back as far as719BC(when apparently not much happened other than Zhou Huan Wang becoming ruler of China). Some years are leaner than others, naturally, but in general these pages offer a useful TL;DR snapshot of major world events, famous births and deaths and astronomical phenomena.As you scroll through the 2020s, though, you’ll notice that the pages keep going: 2026, 2027, 2028 and so on. The reliably dull Wikipedia interface remains unchanged, even as recorded history cedes tospeculativehistory.View image in fullscreenSpectators at a performance of John Cage’s As Slow As Possible – which began in 2001 and is scheduled to conclude in 2640.Photograph: Markus Schreiber/APIt’s possible to surf Wikipedia into the far future, with each page offering a best-guess as to what that year, decade, century or millennium might have in store. In 2029, “The digital time capsule ‘A Message from Earth’ will reach its destination on the planet Gliese 581c.” In 2085, “The ‘secret’ letter of Queen Elizabeth II will be opened in Sydney.” In 2140, “All of the roughly 21 million Bitcoins are expected to be mined.”It’s a heady mix of asteroid near-misses, grim climate catastrophe and bizarre geopolitics until about the 24th century, when things start to get really trippy: a “negative equinoctial paradox” in 2353, every person in Japan having the same surname by 2531, and “the 639-year-long performance of John Cage’s organ work As Slow as Possible” concluding in 2640.View image in fullscreenA still from the film 2012. Will the world end with ‘the Big Freeze, Big Crunch, Big Bounce, Big Rip or, indeed, the Big Slurp?’Photograph: Sony/Sportsphoto/AllstarFrom there, all roads lead to Timeline of the far future, an online abyss that absolutely gazes back at you. Here one can learn about exploding red supergiants visible in the daytime sky, the addition of leap seconds to every day on Earth, planetary collisions, evaporating oceans, spacetime singularities, the erosion of the pyramids, the terraformation of Mars, black holes, Boltzmann brains and the final demise of JavaScript (time of death: 13 September 275,760 CE).The truly adventurous can delve even further into the Ultimate fate of the universe page, which reads like a tasting menu for total annihilation: will it be the Big Freeze, Big Crunch, Big Bounce, Big Rip or, indeed, the Big Slurp?Wikipedia, like any encyclopedia, was never designed to spark emotion – but sometimes the sheer psychic weight of its information can’t help but instil a kind of awe in me. When I read these wholly benign chronicles of “astroengineering projects” and “femtosecond laser-etched nanostructures” I can feel my tiny human brain butting up against the limits of its imagination.Some people describe looking up at the stars on a clear night and feeling reverential and small. I get that same feeling by scrolling these Wikipedia pages, reading history before it’s happened; me at my little desk with my little keyboard doing my little jobs, trying to wrap my head around a world in which future archaeologists identify the “urban stratum” of fossilised coastal cities – just like mine – 100m years from now.

The tour began last year in North America, although that time on the road hasn’t reined in the chaos: the show is all over the place. Along with the incident involving the recorder, Lauper is plagued by technical difficulties, poor sound that buries her voice beneath an admittedly slick band, an uneven setlist, dodgy costumes, and her own garrulous monologues.For anyone else it could be disastrous. But as Lauper begins another anecdote about a breakup with boyfriend and the movie Poltergeist, she wins you over with her charming and squeaky New York drawl. “I’m only talking to you because I don’t want you think that all this is bigger than you and me connecting,” she says.View image in fullscreenGarrulous … Cyndi Lauper.Photograph: Martin Grimes/Getty ImagesWhen things align, the show is excellent: material from She’s So Unusual is a highlight, Lauper’s still impressive voice punching through her fizzy cover of Prince’s When You Were Mine, then delicately caressing the soft, pillowy Time After Time. There’s moving vulnerability in an a cappella take on Fearless, revved-up passion during I Drove All Night, soaring euphoria in the new age strum of Sisters of Avalon, and a poignant performance of True Colors staged alongside a version of artist Daniel Wurtzel’s Air Fountain installation.It’s just enough to distract from the mess – but then again, Lauper has often left slick perfectionism in the hands of her peers. During her final and most famous song, the aim of the night becomes clear: even at 71 years old, this girl just wants to have fun.Atthe O2, London, on 11 February;then touring.Explore more on these topicsCyndi LauperPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

In the US, the one constant is sport and while weekly games might only appeal to an impassioned subset of fans, theSuper Bowl’sbroader appeal makes it the most attractive night of the year to advertisers, their big chance to make an impression with an audience that’s typically over 100 million.Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl half-time show review – game over for DrakeRead moreIt’s also inevitably the most expensive with a30-second spot costing about $8mthis year – a record amount – and so it’s left up to the biggest of the big companies to get involved. On the film side, that translated to just Paramount, Disney, Universal and Warners flashing the cash but was it money well spent?SmurfsIn year that islazily bringing back more franchisesthan ever before from Jurassic World to Final Destination to 28 Days Later to How to Train Your Dragon, why not try once again to make Smurfs work? The characters have moved from Sony to Paramount after two connected films and one reboot and all bets have now been placed on Rihanna as Smurfette, following in the hallowed footsteps of Katy Perry and Demi Lovato. After all that wait, is the new Rihanna album going to be a Smurfs soundtrack?Jurassic WorldRebirthWhile the Jurassic World movies might have failed to reach the lofty heights of Jurassic Park, I’d argue they were mostly more successful than the two films that followed it. That, some hard-to-shake nostalgia and the pairing of Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali make it difficult not to get just a bit excited about the still completely unnecessary Jurassic World Rebirth. The new spot is essentially a remix of therecent trailerbut then that was a remix of everything that came before anyway.Mission: Impossible – The Final ReckoningThere are many, many restarts this summer – Final Destination, Fantastic Four, Jurassic World – but there is one major end. Just don’t tell Tom Cruise. What is now being marketed as the lastMission: Impossible filmwas once supposed to be the second part of the seventh, yet underwhelming box office has changed both title and strategy with Paramount hoping, reportedly against its star’s wishes, to wrap things up. This new spot pushes that selling point hard, a sad goodbye for one of the only consistently enjoyable franchises we have.NovocaineAs audiences prefer to stick with known quantities like Keanu Reeves, Gerard Butler and Jason Statham, Hollywood continues to try out new action stars with mostly middling results. Aaron Taylor-Johnson couldn’t get anyone craving some Kraven the Hunter, Henry Cavill scored two flops back-to-back with Argylle and The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, and this weekend, Ke Huy Quan’s first leading vehicle Love Hurts went nowhere for nobody all at once (it opened to a pitiful $5.8m). Will they warm to Ana de Armas in the John Wick summer spinoff Ballerina or maybe Jack Quaid, best known for Amazon’s The Boys and last month’s Companion, in the gimmicky caper Novocaine? He plays a man incapable of feeling pain whose girlfriend is kidnapped. Given the pricey placement of this new tease, it’s clear that Paramount is hoping for big things from a film that looks like it has a very small budget.How to Train Your DragonMaybe one of the least necessary animated-to-live-action transfers we’ve been lumped with for a while, the How to Train Your Dragon spot doesn’t offer anything we didn’t already expect and haven’t already seen before. It feels like the original wasn’t all that long ago and with the dragon looking essentially the same in both, it’s a struggle to know why we’re here again.Lilo & StitchDisney deserves some reluctant credit here for creating aSuper Bowlad that doesn’t just resemble a condensed trailer, turning something eye-rollingly predictable (a live-action Lilo & Stitch) into an advert we’re actually surprised by. The 30-second spot has the once-animated, now CG monster invade the pitch, helping to kick off a campaign that will most likely make the most of all Fox and Disney channels in the next few months.ThunderboltsDisney also teased its other big summer bet Thunderbolts with a 30-second version of a brand new trailer that’s just been released online. “The Avengers are not coming,” says Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s Wario-ed Nick Fury at the start of the preview for the sorta antiheroes assemble caper (technically not true given that a new Avengers film has been given the green light) before a series of quips, explosions and an ironically used 80s pop song are trotted out to hopefully lure Deadpool fans to their local cinema this May.F1The big Super Bowl spot forBrad Pitt’sF1, one of the summer’s biggest question marks, continues the good work done by last year’s first trailer, focusing on multi-sense immersion. It’s set to be the most authentic racing film we’ve ever seen, made in collaboration with the governing body behind Formula One and filmed during actual events over the last couple of years, and the stripped-back new ad highlights such authenticity. Hopes are high with a giant budget and its backer, Apple, still waiting for its first genuine box office hit, but if anyone can make this kind of unlikely magic happen, it’s Joseph Kosinski, who also steered Top Gun: Maverick from curio to blockbuster.Explore more on these topicsFilmSuper Bowl LIXBrad PittFlorence PughMarvelWalt Disney CompanyTom CruisefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Men and women alike wore shrunken T-shirts and silver earrings, handbags jammed under one arm like a skateboard as they loped along, baggy jeans dragging over scuffed trainers.To make fashion that speaks to the moment, “you have to talk to the younger generation”, said designer Stuart Vevers after the show. “Actually, it’s not about talking to them, it’s about listening to them. What I hear most from them is about self-expression. People being who they want to be and using fashion to give them that confidence.”Vevers, who has worked with the American brand since 2013 and was awarded an OBE last year for services to fashion and to “UK/US creative relations” layered generation Z’s favourite silhouette with references from his own 90s youth such as David Lynch and Larry Clark’s 1995 film, Kids.

It was the fastest rising name on the most recent quarterly index released by Lyst, which ranks brand “heat” based on sales and social media, using data from 200 million consumers.With demand up 332% year on year, Coach leapfrogged Alaïa, Gucci and Bottega Veneta to become the fifth hottest brand after Miu Miu, Saint Laurent, Prada and Loewe.

In the 1940s, co-founders Lillian and Miles Cahn took inspiration from the way a baseball glove improves and softens as it is used, developing a new tanning process that created supple leather less prone to cracking.Explore more on these topicsNew York fashion weekFashion weeksnewsShareReuse this content"

Competition is extreme, it’s slim pickings for good roles that suit my skillset, and employer expectations are through the roof,” he said.Hoghton-Carter was amongpeople from across the country who shared with the Guardian that they had never struggled as much in the past to secure a job. Their responses painted a picture of a job market where hundreds of candidates vied for every role, highly trained graduates struggled to find well-paid work and applicants were routinely rejectedfor roles they were qualified for and those they were overqualified for.Meanwhile, research released on Monday showed vacancies were at their weakest level in January since August 2020, during the pandemic. Employer demand for permanent staff has contracted for the last 17 months, the research by KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation said.It’s a race to the bottom by organisations and businesses desperate to save money or prioritising their profit marginsDavid Hoghton-CarterEchoing the views of many other respondents, Hoghton-Carter felt UK employers were expecting more for less pay and were not prepared to invest in training.“Salaries rarely meet current living costs,” he said. “It’s a race to the bottom by organisations and businesses either desperate to save money or prioritising their profit margins.”Many of those looking for work noted a sharp downturn in advertised jobs and responses to applications since last summer, particularly for roles in design, entertainment, marketing, HR and IT.Several blamed the dramatic drop in opportunities on the economic uncertainty, as well asincreased costs for employers since Rachel Reeves’s budgetlast October. They also said AI had reduced the value of various jobs that had previously required professional expertise.Owen Winn, a graphic designer from Slough, Berkshire, used to work in senior in-house design positions for companies such as O2. He said his previous roles appeared to have been replaced by AI in many companies, meaning vacancies have dwindled dramatically.It feels like being on the scrap heap at 44Owen Winn“It has been very difficult to find stable employment as a creative,” he said. “I have applied for hundreds of jobs.“I have a body of work that spans 20 years for some of the most well-known brands in the world and yet it’s still not enough. It feels like being on the scrap heap at 44.”In his search for permanent positions matching his seniority level, Winn has primarily come across vaguely definedpiecemeal work opportunities on a freelance basisand in much more junior positions.One recent freelance job offer, he said, came from a company with a website where all the graphic design had been AI-generated. “I fear that in this rush to embrace this kind of technology, we are going to overlook experienced creative talent,” he added.View image in fullscreenOwen Winn, 44, from Slough.Photograph: Owen Winn/Guardian CommunityDespite hopes that gaining a degree would lead to well-paid work, many graduates said they had been forced to take low-paying or part-time positions.Lufty, 29, who lives in Manchester, was among many highly skilled people who got in touch who were underemployed: working in low-pay jobs they are vastly overqualified for, and often only part-time. Despite gaining a first in biology and a master’s degree with distinction in medical microbiology from Russell Group universities, he has been working in pubs, making about £24,000 a year.Four out of eight staff members at the pub, Lufty said, had master’s degrees.“I’ve been applying for entry-level jobs in science and healthcare, especially for lab assistant positions with the NHS, since I was 23. I’m lucky if I get one interview a year.“These are band 2 entry level positions, offering less money than I make at the pub. They only require GCSEs or A-levels to apply and I have two degrees. I tick absolutely every box on the job descriptions. You have to assume it is so competitive that they’re automatically filtering out many applications because of the sheer volume. Or is there some rubbish AI sifting through these applications that keeps spitting mine out?”View image in fullscreenLufty, from Manchester, feels stuck in his job as a duty manager at a pub despite having two degrees with top grades from prestigious universities.Photograph: Lufty/Guardian CommunityLufty, who borrowed £60,000 to obtain his degrees, was among many who believed that opportunities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) were drying up, contrary to government and employer messaging that more graduates with Stem degrees were needed in the economy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This time, I’ve been actively looking for a new role for almost four months and there are barely any openings. For every job there are 500-1,600 applicants you need to compete with. There justaren’t enough roles to go around.”Employees also reported that their hours had been cut as bosses attempted to reduce labour costs without cutting headcounts.Violeta Munteanu, 27, a product assistant from the West Midlands, said: “My working hours were reduced due to current budget [constraints]. Many of my friends had their working hours cut to reduce [costs].”Scores of respondents reported that they were even unable to find low-skilled jobs in areas such as hospitality and retail to tide them over.“I haven’t had a job in four years,” said Richard from Hull. “I’ve applied for about 1,500 jobs. I’m qualified in various things. I’ve applied for everything from being a cleaner in a factory to things associated with my degree..”“I’m worried about my future,” said a 25-year-old woman from Yorkshire, who was made redundant when a shop closed. “I should be able to support myself financially, but I’m stuck in a village and live with my parents, so I have to claim universal credit. It feels impossible to get a job.”Having studied illustration at university during the pandemic, she said she was hoping to find a job that would allow her to work from home.Several jobseekers pointed to a mismatch between expectations and the needs of workers and those of employers, saying they were only considering fully remote, hybrid or more flexible positions.Such people said unaffordable living costs in areas close to workplaces, and problems in securing suitable and affordable childcare, were among the reasons why attending an office full-time was difficult.With scores of people with university degrees and years of experience describing their struggles as “ridiculous”, “exhausting”, “humiliating” and “demoralising”, young people and school leavers without further qualifications reported feeling entirely chanceless.“It’s miserable,” said 20-year-old Sam from Brighton, East Sussex. “No replies on any online job applications despite tailoring CV to the job requirements – for instance, for my Subway application, I put forward my previous McDonald’s work as qualifications instead of my A-levels.”The economy has certainly changedMarinaMarina, 26, from Wanstead, east London, said she had been finding it impossible to find any permanent employment for the past six months.Although she noticed that offered wages for short-term jobs in hospitality or admin were increasing,often for ad hoc shifts, she felt it was still not enough to make ends meet.“There’s pressure to upskill or gain additional qualifications and experience, but then there are no permanent jobs offered, only [temporary contracts]. I wonder whether what employers are looking for in people has changed … the economy certainly has.”Explore more on these topicsJob huntingUnemploymentWorking from homeArtificial intelligence (AI)Economic growth (GDP)Work & careersUK cost of living crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is the part of us that comes alive when we feel we have nothing leftMoya SarnerMon 10 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTShareIn 2023, I was in the top 0.05% of Spotify listeners of Manic Street Preachers. It was one song on repeat. I would bet good money that there is no one in the world who has listened to their cover of Burt Bacharach’s and Hal David’sRaindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Headas much as me.No one except my daughter, who was also there as it played through the night, and through every nap, too, for the first 15 months of her life. Some babies need white noise to soothe them to sleep; mine needed my arms and James Dean Bradfield’s voice. Astonishingly, despite this, I do not now hate the song – in fact, I quite like hearing it. If this column ever makes its way to you, James: thank you.My child chose this song as some pick a favourite teddy. She was crying, being comforted by my husband, who was playing one of his (many, many) Manics albums, when the track changed; on came Raindrops. Within a few notes, she had stopped crying and started listening. My husband called me over and we stood in silence, amazed and a little giddy. As struggling new parents with a tiny baby who cried a lot, we were so relieved to find this gift that seemed to bring her a profound sense of consolation, that helped to bring her back to herself and to us.We sang it a lot. I changed some of the words – our daughter’s feet were too small for her bed, rather than too big – and I think the lyrics give crying a bad name. But, with some minor amends, this song became the soundtrack to her infancy and our early parenthood. After listening to it so many times, I came to hear within it some valuable indications for the building of a better life.It’s a simple melody, which could easily be saccharine in the wrong hands, but the Manics’ cover has something special about it. I think it’s because this recording embodies the subject of the song. The lyrics tell of a person who keeps getting caught in the rain, who refuses to let that defeat him and who finds freedom in the knowledge that happiness will return. But this song is not simplyaboutthat; itisthat – the very sound of that freedom.Raindrops was one of the first songs the Manics recorded after the disappearance of their dear friend and bandmate Richey Edwards, 30 years ago this month. I read that, in theaftermath of this traumatic loss, for a time, the band felt that they could not continue. But with the blessing of Edwards’ family, and to the anger of some of their fans, they decided to keep making music.This song was a radical act of survival. Bradfield’s singing is the sound of growth through pain. I hear in it a refusal to lose oneself in the dark; music as an active choice of creativity and life amid devastation and grief. When you listen to it, even without knowing this backstory, it touches you – even my infant daughter felt something.Some babies need white noise to soothe them to sleep; mine needed my arms and James Dean Bradfield’s voiceWhat I learned from my psychotherapy training, and again in early motherhood, is that every developmental leap is a grasping for freedom out of the pain of loss. The psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion understood that our very capacity to think in infancy grows out of our need to make sense of the loss of our mother’s breast or our bottle at the end of every feed, and to bear that sense of separateness and aloneness. When we are drinking milk, there is no need to think. We can just enjoy feeling sated and merged; we have everything we need. But when we are hungry, we are driven to think of the breast or bottle that is no longer there. It is this difficult experience of longing for something we no longer have, this coming to tolerate the pain of separation, that necessitates the use of thought, propelling our minds into development.I was recently lying in bed awake in the early hours, listening to Radio 4. The programmeSomething to Declarecame on, about the Finnish concept ofsisu, which the behavioural scientist Emilia Elisabet Lahti expresses as “life force in times of adversity”. I understood this to be a more profound concept than resilience, which is often spoken of as a muscle we can train (snore).Sisuis the part of us that comes alive when we feel as if we have nothing left, when we think we cannot go on, but we do.It struck me that this part of ourselves may well not exist prior to being necessitated into existence – like a thought, it is a capacity that grows in the moment of being needed. I think that’s what happened to me when my daughter was born: out of the traumatic birth and the traumatic sleep deprivation and the traumatic everything else grew new capacities for survival and growth and love that I did not previously possess.A better life won’t always be a happier life. It will necessarily involve periods of extreme unhappiness and difficulty. That’s the cost of doing business; sometimes it rains. A better life is not sitting there waiting for you to find it in an exercise routine or a therapist or a self-help book; it comes from living and loving and losing in freedom and in hope. If we can do that, there’s no knowing when life’s most meaningful moments might grace us. We might hear it in a few words of a radio programme in the lonely darkness of a sleepless night, or in a simple melody with the surprising power to console a crying baby, like light refracting through raindrops.Moya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author ofWhen I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of AdulthoodDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I first experienced this feeling as a teenager, when my aunt gave me a film camera for my 16th birthday. At the time, it felt like an antique. I left it in a drawer, overlooked, while I relied on my phone for photos – quick snaps that were shared but rarely revisited.Like most teenagers growing up in the digital age, I was obsessed with curating the perfect Instagram feed. My profile was a polished collection of photos intended to impress my peers, designed to fit an idealised version of reality. Each image was meticulously selected, cropped and edited. But something began to shift.The transition from sharing images for validation to capturing memories for myself wasn’t immediate. It began with a simple act: flipping through family photo albums at my grandmother’s house. Unlike many people, who might cringe at the awkwardness of old photos, I found myself captivated by the images from my family’s past, before war and displacement reshaped their lives. They weren’t polished, but they held stories that words often couldn’t convey – of birthdays in Sweden, bridal hennaceremonies in the Netherlands, family portraits in Somalia. Some of the photos had travelled across the globe, arriving from Canada and the US in envelopes filled with pictures of new additions to the family.View image in fullscreen‘If the images are flawed, that just makes them feel more alive, more real.’Photograph: Sundus AbdiI spent hours poring over those albums, fascinated by the posed and proud faces of relatives I had never met. In those photographs, I saw resilience and connection. I realised that every image was a piece of something larger: a history that had been passed down, a story of survival, of migration, of home. These images weren’t just photographs; they were keepsakes of a life lived.It was this realisation that led me to pick up my film camera. Why, in an era dominated by instant digital technology, would anyone choose something so old-fashioned? The answer lay in the nature of film itself. With just 36 exposures per roll, each photo required intention, a slowing down to see the world around me. There was no instant gratification, no delete or edit button to fix mistakes. If a picture didn’t turn out as I had hoped, it didn’t matter. The imperfections became part of the story.‘Mistakes are romantic’: the revival of point-and-shoot camerasRead moreI now take photos of the things that matter most: friends’ weddings, holidays, small moments of joy. When I flip through my collection, the photos ensure those moments stay with me, long after they’ve passed. They weren’t meant for likes or comments – they were meant for me, for family and friends, for those quiet moments of nostalgia.The joy of analogue photography is in the waiting – the days, weeks, or even months between taking a photo and seeing how it turned out. There’s a sense of rediscovery when I finally open an envelope of developed prints. I’m transported back to those moments, some of which I had already let go of. If the images are flawed – blurry, overexposed or scratched – that just makes them feel more alive, more real. And in that sense, my shift to film photography feels like a quiet rebellion against the digital age, a desire to reclaim the permanence and intimacy that comes with holding a memory in your hands.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There were 1.08m fly-tipping incidents in England in 2022-23, with clearance costing councils £13.2m.Disgusting. What is to be done?The time has come, says the Conservative peer Sayeeda Warsi, “to start taking much more draconian action” against all illegal dumpers.All? Even ordinary litterers?The difference between littering and fly-tipping lies chiefly in amounts. The most common size of fly-tipping incident councils dealt with in 2022-23 was the “small vanload”.‘It’s like solving a murder’: who dumped 30 tonnes of rubbish on Lichfield?Read morePhew! So this isn’t about someone just hanging a dog-poo bag in a tree.Have you done that?I was coming back for it!The two crimes are definitely related, but Lady Warsi has likened attempts to tackle the country’s litter problem while fly-tipping goes unpunished to “mopping whilst the tap is on”.I agree: go after the big fish, not someone who sometimes leaves perfectly nice furniture on the pavement for people to take fornothing.That’s known as “middle-class fly-tipping”.It’s more of a public service when you think about it.It’s still putting rubbish in the street.It’s not rubbish! It just doesn’t go with the new carpet.People do get fined for that, but we’re more concerned with repeat offenders dumping construction waste in laybys.Good. How do we catch them?Increasingly, we shall know them by their number plates: the campaign group Clean Up Britain has already installed 87 cameras in fly-tipping hotspots across 19 counties.And how do we punish them?Warsi believes that in addition to other fines, fly-tippers and litterers could be given three penalty points on their driving licences.Harsh.She even suggests that number-plate recognition could be used to trace discarded packaging back to the people who threw it from their cars.I like this idea– itmakes a distinction between people who use vehicles in the commission of their reprehensible dumping, and those of us who innocently leave out the odd ironing boardor the occasional occasional table.What do you do if no one takes it? Just leave it there to rot?Of course not. I have a neighbour with a van who carts it all away for20 quid.And what does he do with it?Best not to ask, I find.That figures.Do say:“The stewardship of our shared environment is everyone’s responsibility.”Don’t say:“Free to take: child’s swing, DVDs, half-tonne damaged drywall, six mattresses, assorted rubble.”Explore more on these topicsWastePass notesCrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the Philadelphia Eagles led 24-0 over the Kansas City Chiefs, a pair of jeans worn by the American rapper and Pulitzer prize winnerKendrick Lamarfor his half-time performance commanded their own crowd online.Variously identified as bootcut, flared and bell-bottomed, the pair of blue-wash jeans were the object of derision and lust. “Kendrick wearing bootcut jeans was so special,” said the writer and comedian Sophia Benoit on social media. “I could not take my eyes off his hems,” said another user.As one TikTok user wrote: “Anyone know the brand of these jeans? The fit? Amazing. The flare? Immaculate. About to order them. Best ad for jeans I’ve seen in a while.”They were also, in some commenters’ eyes, a noteworthy and moment-enhancing choice for aperformance that was hailed as history-making: Samuel L Jackson was dressed in homage to Uncle Sam; backing dancers wore red, white and blue and stood in an American flag formation, andSerena Williams crip walked.The performance, which went out to the 65,000 fans in the Superdome in New Orleans, including Donald Trump, and millions more at home, was also seen as a victory in his feud with the Canadian rapper Drake.As the cultural critic Hunter Harris wrote online: “And he did all that in KICK FLARES!”The jeans, which pooled around a pair of Nike Air Max 96s, were the work of luxury fashion label Celine and were originally designed as part of the womenswear spring/summer 2024 collection.Low-rise, made in Japan and costing £830, they also come with a “raw hem” on the back, which gives the impression of a too-long jean that has been scuffed as it is trodden on – a look that teenagers in the noughties will be all too familiar with.While Dylan Kelly, an editor at Hypebeast, a magazine for men’s contemporary fashion and streetwear, said he personally enjoyed a bootcut jean, he didn’t think the average American was ready to see their favourite rapper in them. “And the discourse surrounding his outfit is proof of that,” he said.Whether the sight of these jeans on such a historic world stage will galvanise a moment for bootcut jeans depends on who you talk to. Arguably for some they are already there: trends in denim are divisive, labyrinthine, constantly evolving and, as with so many things, generational. Gen Z are finding a lot to love in 2000s styles and pop culture, including the cut of the era’s jeans. On the other hand, those who perhaps wore them first time around, accessorised with a trucker cap, seem less likely to have been enamoured.On the men’s catwalks, things have been pivoting back to more “indie sleaze” inspired skinny jeans. But bootcut styles are for the moment reportedly still popular with luxury shoppers: on menswear site Mr Porter, customer searches for bootcut jeans have increased by 346% in the past six months. On secondhand resale site Depop, popular with younger generations, “the popularity of the bootcut jean has been quietly bubbling under the radar over the last few months”, according to a spokesperson. Searches have increased by 47% since December, with Diesel and Levi’s particularly popular brands, “but this super high-profile endorsement looks to accelerate it back to centre-stage once again”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How do you muzzle Doge?World’s richest man has unleashed a flurry of moves ranging from compromising Americans’ private data to nearly upending USAid. Where does it stop?Ben MakuchMon 10 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 11.37 ESTShareIn 2022, the Pentagonproudly announceda committee on diversity and inclusion, with a marine veteran and senior director at Tesla, serving as a member. The same person, who spent nearly six years at Tesla, also helped push Elon Musk to makeJuneteenth a company-wide holiday. But Musk is anotorious recipient of lucrative government contractsand changes with the winds of presidential administrations.Now in 2025, as a “special government employee” heading up the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), Musk is going to war with those kinds of government diversity and inclusion programs and slashing whatever he sees as a “waste” of public coffers.But legal resistance is mounting, as Doge faces countless lawsuitsalleging everything from privacy concernstofree speechviolations, which all leads to one important question: is any of this even legal?Laurence Tribe, one of the nation’s leading and preeminent constitutional scholars and a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, has already argued that much of Trump’s blitzkrieg of executive orders on the day of his inaugurationdisregards the US constitution. He told the Guardian he saw Musk’s actions as furthering that culture.On whether Doge and Musk can legally have this much power over an array of government departments, Tribe was emphatic: “NO.”Trump hints Musk ‘Doge’ team has free rein with Pentagon next in line for cutsRead moreMusk has applied a buckshot method across the government,offering CIA agentswalking papers whileappraising the Department of Education– all at the same time.Tribe said the lack of guardrails being placed on Doge’s maverick initiatives, raises “both” questions of illegality and ethical wrongdoing that can be challenged in court. As for Musk’s status as a federal contractor (such as hisStarLink work with the Pentagon) and now a government employee, Tribe sees it as “absolutely” a legal conflict of interest.Musk is certainly facing roadblocks: protests at the buildings of USAid – another target of Doge he called a “radical-left political psy op”on X– have brought in hundreds and attracted broader Democratic backlash. But Doge continues unabated, honoring Trump’s campaign promise to rid the federal government of the “woke” Biden era.On Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders went further,telling CNN: “What Musk is doing is illegal and unconstitutional.”Sanders explained how outright deleting an agency like USAid, which was itself a creation of Congress, requires congressional approval.“You can’t do it unilaterally,” he said.But with a Republican supreme court supermajority that almost always sides with the Trump administration, any of these lawsuits that do end up being tested in the highest US court risks rulings in favor of Musk and Doge. Many of these Doge-related lawsuits will go on for months and be heard by benches stacked withTrump appointees from his first presidency. Musk has alsobegun publicly chastising lower court judgeswho go against the spirit of the administration.On some level it boils down to the world’s richest man … trying to consolidate control over as much of the state apparatus as possibleEd Ongweso JrDoge, nonetheless, will continue to be sued.It took onlyminutes after Trump was sworn infor a Maryland-based public interest law firm to file a 30-page lawsuit alleging Musk’s Doge should be considered a “federal advisory committee”, which makes it subject to government transparency laws and public scrutiny, which includes note keeping and meeting records, as required by law.So far, Musk has reportedly employed a team of very young programmers who brazenly took control of the treasury department payment system, which gave them access to the addresses, social security numbers and bank account information of Americans.Tribe says that act alone raises, “serious issues of privacy”. Doge is indeed already facing legal action for thattreasury fiasco, with a judge approving atemporary hold on Dogefrom fully accessing the payment system, whileanother judgeordered a freeze on the deadline for federal workers to accept a buyout.Ultimately, the only real guardrails on Musk and Doge will be in the hands of the courts. Even if Doge is found to be violating labor laws, national security statutes or constitutional rights – cases will inevitably be gummed up in the legal process, which could allow enough time for some of these federal workers to relent and take buyouts.Elon Musk reinstates ‘Doge’ worker linked to openly racist social media accountRead more“Obviously what Musk is doing is illegal,” saidEd Ongweso Jr, a senior researcher atSecurity in Context, an international project of scholars housed at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. “And on some level it boils down to the world’s richest man – a child of apartheid who surrounds himself with sycophantic phrenologists – trying to consolidate control over as much of the state apparatus as possible.”Ongweso has been following the rise of the tech-bro class and its cozying up to presidential administrations. Musk’s Doge takeover is the latest iteration.“For years, both parties have fetishized Silicon Valley to varying degrees, eagerly swallowing the sector’s gibberish about making governance efficient via algorithmic rule via privatization,” he said.Ongweso pointed out that Musk is a veteran of the mass layoff and knows they come with lawsuits. But it hasn’t stopped him before.At Tesla’s Fremont, California, plant a Black former employeewas awarded $3.2min a racial harassment case, while the plant itself has been sued multiple times onracial discrimination and labor law grounds.“Learning that a key Doge staffer was askull measuring eugenicistshould come as no surprise given the rampant racism (slurs, swastikas, a hanging noose, etc) at Musk’s Fremont Tesla factory,” he said.And when it comes to laying off workers, Musk has the same recycled playbook.“He’s been sued for failing to provide advance notice for 2024 mass layoffs at Tesla and for 2022 Twitter layoffs that were a transparent attempt to get out of severance pay,” explained Ongweso.“It’s obvious lawsuits aren’t a deterrent for the world’s richest man – why would he stop mass layoffs, slashing and burning operations, or recruiting racists when it’s worked out so well for him that he’s now in firm control of America’s administrative state?”Explore more on these topicsUS newsElon MuskTrump administrationUS politicsLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

An ice castle is under construction. And there is no shortage of ice and snow – 142in have fallen this year.The lake is dotted with the small tents of ice fisherman and snow-mobilers roar up and down the road. But the trial will bring memories of the August day when Mayville’s lakeside summer was abruptly disturbed by the sirens of emergency vehicles racing to the scene of the alleged crime.“This a beautiful area and all the world’s problems came to visit but not for the right reasons,” said Nicole Kryniski at the Webb hotel, one of several along the lakefront.Rick Newell, 75, owner of the Lakeview Hotel where snow-mobilers seemed intent on drinking the premises dry on Saturday night, said the incident had shocked the community.“People from all over the world come to speak or perform at the institution,” he said. “I can’t remember anything like this happening before. There was never any security there, so it was just a free-for-all. It shook everyone up, people were stunned, and started being more careful.”Rebecca Magnuson, owner of She Sings cafe and an activist against domestic abuse, said Chautauquans had never had any reason to be concerned about security, but after the incident “everything changed a little bit.”For the wrong reasons, it had made Rushdie well-known in the area, and many said they had read Knife, his published account of the attack and his recovery.Rushdie recalled his thoughts as the attack unfolded: “Surely, the world had moved on, and the subject was closed. Yet here, approaching me fast, was a sort of time traveler, a murderous ghost from the past,” he wrote.Prosecutors in the case against Matar have said jurors are unlikely to hear about the fatwa because they probably won’t have to show motive to get a conviction on the state charges.“From my standpoint, this is a localized event. It’s a stabbing event. It’s fairly straightforward,” the Chautauqua county DA, Jason Schmidt, has said. “I don’t really see a need to get into motive evidence.”But Matar’s defence lawyer Nathaniel Barone said jurors in the trial should be screened for prejudice.Mac Service, sitting in the Lakeside Hotel bar, said he had read Rushdie’s The Ground Beneath Her Feet and Knife. “Rushdie celebrated love over hate. He had a choice to make, and he took the high road,” he said. “I hope the man gets justice.”Service, a county employee, said it was sad the incident took place in such a peaceful area and at an arts institution founded on intellectual, spiritual and religious tolerance.“It was upsetting to me what happened. Rushdie didn’t hide in a cave when the fatwa was issued, and he’s always been a presence in the literary world. I’d never read that kind of post-modern literature. It opened new doors for me.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsSalman RushdieNew YorkUS crimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The membership included staffers of US regulatory and policy agencies, executives from the world’s largest agrochemical companies and their lobbyists, academics and others.Revealed: the US government-funded ‘private social network’ attacking pesticide criticsRead moreThe profiling was one element of a push to downplay pesticide dangers, discredit opponents and undermine international policymaking, according to court records,emails and other documentsobtained by the non-profit newsroom Lighthouse Reports.Lighthouse collaborated with the Guardian, the New Lede, Le Monde,AfricaUncensored, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and other international media partners on the September 2024 publication of the investigation.News of the profiling and the private web portal sparked outrage and threats of litigation by some of the people and organizations profiled.London research professor Michael Antoniou, who was profiled on the portal with derogatory information about his personal life and family members, said he fears the actions to take down the profiles may be “too little too late”.“Those of us who were profiled still do not know who accessed the information and how it was used,” he said. “Did it hinder us in our careers or close doors that otherwise may have been open to us? The fact that v-Fluence and the industries it serves resorted to these underhand methods shows that they were unable to win on the level of the science.”v-Fluence says it not only has eliminated the profiling, but also has made “significant staff cuts” after the public exposure, according to Jay Byrne, the former Monsanto public relations executive who founded and heads the company. Byrne blamed the company’s struggles on “rising costs from continued litigator and activist harassment of our staff, partners, and clients with threats and misrepresentations”.He said the articles published about the company’s profiling and private web portal were part of a “smear campaign” which was based on “false and misleading misrepresentations” that were “not supported by any facts or evidence”.Adding to the company’s troubles, several corporate backers and industry organizations have cancelled contracts with v-Fluence, according apost in a publication for agriculture professionals.‘Intelligence gathering’Since its launch in 2001, v-Fluence has worked with the world’s largest pesticide makers and providedself-described servicesthat include “intelligence gathering”, “proprietary data mining” and “risk communications”.One client of more than 20 years is Syngenta, a Chinese government enterprise-owned company currently being sued by thousands of people in the US and Canada who allege they developed the incurable brain disease Parkinson’s from using Syngenta’s paraquat weed killers. The first US trial is scheduled to get under way in March. Several others are scheduled over the following months.Byrne and v-Fluence are named as co-defendants in one of the cases against Syngenta. They are accused of helping Syngenta suppress information about risks that the company’s paraquat could cause Parkinson’s disease, and of helping “neutralize” its critics. (Syngentadeniesthere’s a proven causal link between paraquat and Parkinson’s.) Byrne has denied the allegations in the lawsuit, citing “numerous incorrect and factually false claims”, made by plaintiffs.v-Fluence, which also had the former agrochemical firm Monsantoas a client, secured some funding from the US government as part of a contract with a third party. Public spending records show the US Agency for International Development (USAid) contracted with a separate non-governmental organization that manages a government initiative to promote GM crops in African and Asian countries.That organization, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), then paid v-Fluence a little more than $400,000 from roughly 2013 through 2019 for services that included counteracting critics of “modern agriculture approaches” in Africa and Asia.Revealed: The secret push to bury a weedkiller’s link to Parkinson’s diseaseRead moreThe “private social network portal” set up by v-Fluence was part of the contract, and was supposed to provide, among other things, “tactical support” for efforts to gain acceptance for theGM crops.A separate contract signed by the USDA in the final months ofDonald Trump’s first term also provided government employees with access to the portal, including the “stakeholder backgrounders” on scientists and activists which v-Fluence says it has now removed.The stakeholder backgrounders included profiles on Kennedy, as well as Mehmet Oz, Trump’s nominee to oversee Medicare.Kennedy’s profile described him as “an anti-vaccine, anti-GMO and anti-pesticide activist litigator who espouses various health and environmental conspiracy claims”.Legal questionsAfter the operations were made public in articles by the Guardian and media partners, v-Fluence engaged a law firm to conduct an independent review of whether or not the profiling may have violated the European Union’sGeneral Data Protection Regulation(GDPR). The regulation is intended to protect an individual’s right over collection and use of their personal data.The analysis found that v-Fluence was “not subject to the GDPR”, but recommended v-Fluence handle “EU personal data consistent with the requirements of the GDPR in the event the Regulation is deemed to apply”, the companysaid in a statement. One of the recommendations was removing the profiles, the company said.v-Fluence will continue to “offer stakeholder research with updated guidelines to avoid future misinterpretations of our work product”, according to the company statement.Wendy Wagner, a law professor at the University of Texas with expertise in the regulation of toxic substances, said there seemed to be little good reason to maintain such a database other than to use it for harassing opponents.“I’m quite familiar with corporate harassment of scientists who produce unwelcome research, and sometimes this includes dredging up personal information on the scientist to make their work look less credible,” Wagner said. “But I have not encountered the use of larger databases that track personal details of numerous critics of a corporation [including independent scientists and journalists]. It is hard to see the relevance of personal details short of use as harassment.”This story is co-published withthe New Lede,a journalism project of the Environmental Working GroupExplore more on these topicsFarmingAmerica's dirty divideUSAidParkinson's diseaseHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The signatures are still there amid the debris and layers of ash – most of the remains of the place that once housed three generations of their family.View image in fullscreenThe signatures of Johnny Kamon’s parents.Photograph: Courtesy of Johnny Kamon“I used to be the one that said our house will never burn down,” said Johnny, 37. “Which is why I lost everything.”The Kamons are one of the many Japanese American families in Altadena where the wildfires have become the latest blow to a community already battling a slow-drip decline in connection. Many of these families rebuilt their lives after the trauma ofsecond world war incarcerationand created a tight-knit safety net of cultural and religious institutions that for years affirmed their identities and fostered a sense of belonging.Over time, that social fabric frayed. Friends moved away. Gatherings dwindled. Children lost interest. In the aftermath of the fires, an existential unease lingers. Could Altadena’s dwindling Japanese American community survive yet another upheaval? This anxiety lives as an unwelcome guest in Johnny’s already crowded mind.He worries about what could be lost.“And the potential for this history to one day truly just be history,” Johnny said quietly.‘I give it all to Altadena’:a refuge for the marginalizedAltadena, as described in Naomi Hirahara’s 2004 bookThe Summer of the Big Bachi,has a “slight wildness to it” that sharply contrasts with its manicured neighboring cities. Here, many residential streets lack sidewalks, but backyard chickens are common.Altadena also has a long history of being a refuge for marginalized people.In 1944, amid heightened anti-Japanese sentiment inflamed by the second world war, an Altadena family welcomedEsther Takei Nishio, a second-generation Japanese American, into their home so she could leave anArizona prison campand attend college.After Japan’s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed an executive order calling for the forced removal of Japanese Americans from the west coast. The US government built 10 main prison camps to incarcerate more than 125,000 Japanese Americans in remote locations. Takei Nishio’s presence was atest caseto prepare the community for the return of Japanese American friends and neighbors.Years later, whendiscriminatory housing practiceswere de rigueur, Altadena and a swath of north-west Pasadena – its neighboring city – were among the few areas where people of color could live, buy property and cultivate arich history.View image in fullscreenNaomi Hirahara (right) as a young girl with a friend in Altadena.Photograph: Courtesy of Naomi HiraharaAltadena was the kind of place where Japanese Americans played basketball in local leagues and ran for the high school track-and-field teams under the watchful eyes of Coach Mack Robinson, an Olympic silver medalist and brother of the legendary Major League Baseball player Jackie Robinson.Hirahara, 62, immortalized Altadena in her writing because this was where her parents set their roots in the 1960s after surviving the Hiroshima atomic bombing. Altadena was where a fourth-grade teacher planted a seed for her future career by encouraging her to become a writer.“In terms of my literary development,” said Hirahara. “I give it all to Altadena.”In 1956, about 1,600 Japanese American adults and businesses were recorded in Pasadena, and 125 in Altadena, according to a Japanese American business directory. To resettle in the area after the second world war, the burgeoning Japanese American community established cultural and religious centers like thePasadena Buddhist Temple, thePasadena Japanese Cultural Instituteand theFirst Presbyterian Church of Altadenato create spaces for joy and community for the mushrooming Japanese American population.“We went there because there was nowhere else to go,” said Bryan Takeda about the cultural and religious institutions that provided safety for Japanese Americans still reckoning with how they were treated during the war.For Takeda, 69, the landscape of his childhood memories is outlined by Altadena and Pasadena’s undulating mountain backdrop. In this community where he progressed from taking kendo classes to serving on the board of directors of cultural institutions, he has noticed a troubling trend – dwindling interest.Younger generations of Japanese Americans are not joining these monoethnic cultural institutions, said Takeda, the founder and CEO of Hikari Japanese Academy: “They don’t need to in the ways we did.”Then, the fire tore through.Echoes of displacementFor some, the fear and sudden dislocation caused by last month’s wildfires felt eerily familiar.“The thought has crossed my mind as we’re using the word ‘evacuation’,” said Jane Kawahara, 85. “You know, I’ve been evacuated before.”Kawahara was not yet three years old when she and her family were ordered to take only what they could carry to live behind barbed wire atPoston– one of the 10 main concentration camps the US government built during the second world war.Last month, as smoke filled her Altadena house, Kawahara evacuated with less than she could carry. She only took the essentials: a toothbrush, medication, clothes and her sweetheart. She patted a framed black-and-white photo of her husband, Harry Kawahara, who died last year at 92 years old.“I love Altadena for its diversity,” said Kawahara, a retired school nurse. The Mediterranean-style house she has lived in for 50 years still stands, but Kawahara cannot move back in until the smoke and ash damage is remediated. On visits back, she’s picked up precious relics initially forgotten in the evacuation frenzy, including her mom’s hand-carved wooden bird pin – a memento from Poston.View image in fullscreenJane Kawahara holds her Poston bird pin and a photo of her husband, Harry.Photograph: Lynda Lin GrigsbyIn quiet moments, she has thought about moving to a different home – maybe even a different city – but she quickly batted the thought away. Altadena is where Kawahara raised her family and poured decades of work into the Greater Pasadena Japanese American Citizens League chapter, a civil rights organization.Her generation’s leaders marched in countless protests and fought for many social issues including ethnic studies. It’s time to take a backseat, she said, as supporters for the next generations.Kawahara turned the bird pin over slowly in her hands as she wrestled with an uncomfortable question: what happens if not enough people step into vacated leadership roles?The fires forced everyone to reconsider the value of everyday objects, places and even institutions – what deserves to be saved, and what happens when all is lost?“I think the Japanese American community – all ethnic communities – are precious,” Kawahara said. “Their culture is precious.”A fragile futureAfter the fires, the physical structures of Altadena and Pasadena’s Japanese American institutions remained intact. But their future stands at a crossroads.At the Pasadena Buddhist Temple, the fires consumed the homes of seven members, said the temple co-president Jeannie Toshima. “Many more have been impacted.”On a January morning after the ominous black smoke cleared, the temple buzzed with life. Volunteers distributed and delivered essential supplies and bento lunches to those affected by the fires.View image in fullscreenA Buddha statue in the back yard of Johnny Kamon’s home.Photograph: Courtesy of Johnny KamonRon Toshima, 73, pointed to a black-and-white photo of the temple’s 1958 dedication where a crowd stretched the width of two buildings. Subsequent photos show a steady decline of faces.Now, a Sunday service attracting 20 people is considered big, said Ron, adding: “Even without the fire, the future of the temple would have been in jeopardy.”For now, temple members can only hope that new and existing members will eventually fall into formation with them.“With these institutions, people kind of took them for granted like they would always be there,” Hirahara said. “Maybe there will be more thought that these things aren’t going to just magically continue.”Historically, adversity has bonded the Japanese American community. But the fires have scattered residents and temple members to other areas for temporary refuge – including Johnny Kamon. His return date, he said, is still unknown.He’s visited the ruins of his home. Amid the devastation, one object stands unscathed – his back yard marble Buddha statue. It reminds Johnny of a Japanese phrase,shogyō mujō,the importance of embracing impermanence.All things come to an end.“Instead of clinging to the past,” Johnny said, “I focus on what lies ahead, which makes me hopeful and excited for the future.”Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresCaliforniaWest CoastWildfiresRaceSecond world warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One of the cars made it, the other was bombed and they were burned alive,” she says.“None of them survived.”So whenDonald Trump, standing alongsideBenjamin Netanyahu, suggested last week that Palestinians in the devastatedGazaStrip leave their homes and that it beturned into a “riviera”for “the people of the world”, comments he has since doubled down on, Jadallah was livid.“The president of the United States calling for ethnic cleansing and the continued genocide of Palestinians,” she says.Welcome to Trumpworld, where the developer-in-chief sees dollar signs in the rubble of GazaRead more“It’s outrageous.”For many Palestinian American residents of Dearborn such as Jadallah, the responses to the US president’s proposals follow a similar line: defiance, anger, but not much in the way of surprise.“He has a history of being loyal to the Zionist movement of genocide and colonizing [of the] the Palestinian people,” she says.“It wasn’t surprising, but it was outrageous.”A photo on the front cover of the Dearborn-publishedArab American News’s1 February edition portrays thousands of Palestinians walking along a sea front to their destroyed homes in northern Gaza. The caption reads: “The Great March of Return”.“Gaza’s history is one of both pain and pride,” reads the newspaper’s lead article on the topic.It continues: “It stretches back to ancient civilizations and includes great resistance against invasion, such as the three-month siege by Alexander the Great and his Macedonian army in 332 BCE.”Trump’s announcement upended decades of international consensus and threatened fragile talks to extend a delicate ceasefire in Gaza. It was met with glee by much of the Israeli prime minister’s ruling coalition and other far-right elements inIsrael.More than half of Dearborn’s 110,000 residents are of Arab heritage, making it home to one of the largest Arab communities outside the Middle East. Many Palestinian American residents have lost family members during Israel’s onslaught on the Gaza Strip, which killed more than 46,000 people.“Nobody is really shocked. Everybody is disgusted,” says Amer Zahr, a Palestinian American comedian and activist whose family was displaced from Nazareth, Jaffa and Akka (Acre) during the Nakba.“I’m really angry at the notion that we’re talking about the thing that Trump said on Tuesday like it’s new or novel or unique. It is not,” he says.“It is the policy of Israel to ethnically cleanse Palestinians, and that policy has been fully supported and funded by the United States.”He also finds that it’s only when Trump makes such comments that liberals and the Democratic party “finally reject the notion of the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians”.‘This time, we stay’: the Palestinian families vowing not to leave GazaRead more“I guess it has a different ring to it when Trump says it.”Trump won more votes in November’s presidential election in Dearborn than the Democratic party’sKamala Harrisor Green party candidate Jill Stein, the first time a Republican party candidate won the city in 24 years.While Harris declined to campaign in Dearborn, Trump had lunch at the Great Commoner, a café owned by an Arab American businessperson, just days before the election.“A lot of people [in Dearborn] voted for him secretly,” Zahr says. “They are the ones who have gone silent now.” Zahr voted for Stein.But some are doubling down on their support, not inclined to take Trump’s words at face value. Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian American born and raised in Jerusalem, campaigned extensively inMichiganand other swing states through the group formerly called Arab Americans for Trump. (The group changed its name last week to Arab Americans for Peace.) He says Trump’s comments were just a “testing of the waters”.“I think the president threw out this idea as a trial balloon. There can never be a displacement of Palestinians from their homeland. It’s counterproductive,” he says.While members of his family were forced to flee Jerusalem during the Nakba in 1948, and he himself has since been banned from living in the city of his birth, Bahbah continues to believe peace in the Middle East is Trump’s main goal.“I know the president wants a legacy of peace and wants to be known as a peacemaker. For him to do that, the only path is a two-state solution which he told me he would support.”He says he has faced a backlash for supporting Trump that has included “messages on X that could be interpreted as death threats”, but that he’s been told by Trump’s advisers that Trump did not mean to suggest that Palestinians in Gaza be forcibly removed from their homes and land.Palestinians in Gaza on Trump’s plan: ‘We would rather die here than leave’Read more“I believe that the president will come to the conclusion that what he said publicly is just not workable,” he says. He says the rebrand of his group to Arab Americans for Peace, announced hours after Trump’s comments, had been in the works for months.For Jadallah, Trump’s alleged plans for Israel to turn over the Gaza Strip to the US are an obvious contradiction to what he campaigned for president on.“It really shows his intention to serve a foreign government before the American people, right?” she says.“Because if he wants an America first agenda, he would talk about how we can spend our hard-earned tax dollars to improve our healthcare systems and our schools.”She says the resilience Palestinians in Gaza have shown following 15 months of bombardments and continued displacement lead her to believe that it’s highly unlikely that Trump’s plan to remove people from Gaza would succeed.“They’ve endured genocide, hunger, been displaced multiple times from the north to the south,” she says.“There’s still 2 million people residing in Gaza and they’ve told us that they don’t want to leave because they are the rightful owners of the land.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsTrump administrationUS immigrationDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Foreigners arriving at its airport last year in the prime holiday month of December were up 3.7% from 2023 to more than 160,000, most of them tourists.In November, a group of residentsprotestedoutside the Bo-Kaap Museum, which is housed in one of the area’s oldest homes. They carried signs reading: “No buses in Bo-Kaap” and “Stop exploiting Bo-Kaap”.View image in fullscreenBo-Kaap has become a popular destination for tourists.Photograph: Nic Bothma/EPA“Tourism has become an attraction in Bo-Kaap, but … it’s a double-edged sword. It brings some money into Bo-Kaap, but very little,” said Osman Shaboodien, the chair of the Bo-Kaap Civic and Ratepayers Association and one of the protest organisers.“Bo-Kaap has a tourist problem. First, it’s over-tourism. There’s too many of them that come up here. Secondly … it has very narrow streets and it can’t accommodate these buses. And, thirdly, there are no places for them to park.”Bo-Kaap, meaning “above the Cape” in Afrikaans, hugs the slopes of Signal Hill, with Cape Town’s downtown just below. It is one of the city’s oldest residential areas, the first houses having been built in the 1760s.Descendants of Muslim enslaved people brought to the Cape by the Dutch from Indonesia and Malaysia, who became known as Cape Malays, lived alongside European, African and Asian immigrants.Plans to raze Bo-Kaap, like the nearby District Six area, during the apartheid era were stopped with the help of ID du Plessis, an official who had studied Cape Malay culture, according toThe Story of Bo-Kaap podcast. However, its designation as a Cape Malay-only area in 1957 meant other residents were evicted, most to the Cape Flats townships on the edge of the city.Today, there are seven mosques in an area just 2km long and 500m at its widest point, with another four mosques just outside it. Many houses are emblazoned with pro-Palestine murals.View image in fullscreenAuwal Mosque, South Africa’s oldest mosque, was built in Bo-Kaap in 1794.Photograph: Rachel Savage/The GuardianAmong residents’ fears is that outsiders moving into the area will lodge successful noise complaints about the calls to prayer and that new businesses will be awarded alcohol licences.“I know I can’t stop [gentrification]. My job really is to try to preserve the story of Bo-Kaap that underpins our identity and the identity, the national heritage, of this country,” said Zaki Harris, atour guidefrom Bo-Kaap, who wants authorities to educate guides from outside the area about its history and to provide more opportunities for residents.“Locals need to participate in the tourism economy, otherwise they’re out,” said Harris, who also chairs the Bo-Kaap Tourism Association, in an interview at the Bo-Kaap Deli, a cafe run by a local family.View image in fullscreenZaki Harris, a tour guide, outside the Bo-Kaap Deli cafe.Photograph: Rachel Savage/The GuardianTour guiding is regulated nationally, said James Vos, the mayoral committee member for economic growth. He added that the city funds Cape Town Tourism to provide “training and development for its nearly 1,000 members, many of whom reside in Bo-Kaap”.Shaboodien and the ratepayers’ association are fighting against a proposed six-storey, serviced apartment building they say will tower over the minaret of the nearby Auwal Mosque, South Africa’s first mosque, built in 1794.Flyt Property Investment, the developer of the site, a disused carpark, did not reply to interview requests. Ittold the Cape Times newspaperit had redesigned the original nine-storey proposal after a “public participation process”. A final planning decision is due by 21 April.View image in fullscreenOsman Shaboodien outside the Auwal Mosque.Photograph: Rachel Savage/The Guardian“You can consult the community as much as you want, but if you already intend to build what you want to build, then the consultation becomes a tick box,” said Shaboodien. “We [are] not against this construction. The architecture must fit into the [area].”The deputy mayor, Eddie Andrews, said: “Whilst the city understands the community’s concerns, all development applications are assessed against the requirements of the municipal planning by-law and relevant city policies before a decision is made.”He noted Bo-Kaap was protected as a heritage protection overlay zone. “The city must ensure least possible impact on heritage while also considering social and economic benefits,” he said.View image in fullscreenMurals painted on a home in Bo-Kaap.Photograph: Rachel Savage/The GuardianIn her parents’ plum-coloured house on a quiet courtyard, Nurahn Essop runs a cafe and helps her mother, Faeeza,teach tourists how to cook Cape Malay food. “We’ve made the most of it,” she said, of the influx of visitors. “Had we not, I don’t think our parents would be able to afford to live here.”Essop has moved to an area 20 minutes’ drive away with her children, where she is paying lower property taxes on a house that is 10 times bigger than her childhood home. She said she worried what would happen once her parents died.“Bo-Kaap is more than just the pretty houses and the colour. It’s also about the people and the history of the neighbourhood.

But some staff at the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) say its leaders appear divorced from that reality, using public moneyfor executive training retreats in Franceand networking over fine wine and steak.The CCRC is in the spotlight again as it is due to consider adossier of new expert evidencein the Lucy Letby case. While it faces a decision in one of the most high-profile potential miscarriages of justice in decades, its leadership is in a state of disarray.CCRC chief spent public funds on luxury hotels for business courses in FranceRead moreIts chair, Helen Pitcher, resigned last month after an independent panel decided she was no longer fit to stay in post. Pitcher responded by saying she had been “scapegoated” over the case of Andrew Malkinson, who spent 17 years in jail for a 2003 rape he did not commit after the CCRC missed multiple opportunities to help.Sources claim there is rising frustration within the organisation that thinly stretched staff who care about uncovering miscarriages of justice have been poorly represented by its leaders, who they say “haven’t got a clue”.Sources said Pitcher “would conduct Teams meetings from the balcony of her villa in the sunshine” in Montenegro and boast about her jetset life in weekly memos to staff.Meanwhile, Karen Kneller, who remains chief executive, has been given the nickname “Karen Invisible” by staff. She is described by some of those working for her as “absent”, with her “finger off the pulse”.In December last year, Kneller wrote what had become a familiar message in her weekly update to staff: “I am away doing some training but I’ll be staying in touch.”She was at Insead, Europe’s answer to Harvard Business School, staying in a luxury room at its four-star on-campus hotel in Fontainebleu.View image in fullscreenThe Insead campus in Fontainebleau, France.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyPitcher, alongside chairing the CCRC, has held several roles with the gold-plated business school, whose courses Kneller has attended regularly since Pitcher was appointed chair in 2018.Pitcher’s spokesperson said the Ministry of Justice approved the business case for Kneller to attend Insead and that she “fully declared” her interests with the business school.According to Kneller’s LinkedIn page, she has completed a 10-day director’s courseadvertisedas costing more than £21,000 over three trips as well as a “leading from the chair course”, the fees for which are listed as £7,500.In November 2023, three months after Malkinson’s exoneration, Kneller told staff she had spent another week at Insead on a “digital disruption and innovation” course, which she said “was fascinating and exhausting in equal measure”, adding that she “logged on during the week and stayed in touch with the team including two or three meetings”.A government source said the spending “does not reflect the new government’s expectations of the best use of the CCRC’s funding”.Kneller was director of casework when the CCRC undertook what Chris Henley KC described in his review as“very poor”work on Malkinson’s first application to overturn his conviction in 2009. She has been in full-time leadership roles at the organisation for nearly 20 years and Malkinson has previously said that “if accountability means anything”, she“has to go”.One staff member said that under Pitcher and Kneller, an “us-and-them culture” had been allowed to grow within the organisation, with commissioners – the arbiters of cases – staying at top hotelswhen staff were summoned to Birmingham for meetings, while others stayed at budget accommodation.Fine wines, lobster dishes and post-dinner brandies featured while Pitcher held court at top restaurants with commissioners at their twice-yearly meetings. One source recalled: “It was The Ivy; it was never McDonald’s. It was always the posh restaurant.”Pitcher said she never claimed expenses in her role and that any staff or commissioner spending on food or drink that went beyond civil service allowances was paid out of their pockets.Sources said Pitcher lacked self-awareness and that “insensitive” emails misjudged her audience of overworked public sector staff.She would use weekly emails to name-drop the figures in the justice system whom she planned to meet for meals at top restaurants or her private member’s club in London. One all-staff memo said she was “meeting Ruth Runciman (Lady) for lunch”, while another remarked: “I have a summer party to attend at Inner Temple on the lawns, so let’s hope the weather is good.”A source recalled: “It was jarring … The CCRC’s staff are very hardworking, under the cosh, have had their budget stripped and stripped away, and they would not demonstrate the kind of life that the CCRC staff were feeling.”Pitcher’s spokesperson said she “argued consistently for greater resources for the commission and better reward for its hardworking staff, reaching out to the key decision-makers in politics and law with influence over the commission”.“Staff surveys were invariably positive [under Pitcher’s tenure], other than the responses of a small group known to the CEO and her top team,” they said.Pitcher wasrevealed by the Guardianas having being pictured barefoot in Montenegro promoting her property business while refusing to apologise to Malkinson or give interviews after his conviction was overturned by the appeal court.She is understood at the time to have proposed explaining more about her property portfolio and of failing to see how it might look. One insider said she wanted to stress “that I was actually just out in Montenegro dealing with my property business, which is my children’s inheritance”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why are you just not bloody apologising?”The justice select committee is so concerned about Pitcher’s work that it has made a formal request that the next chair should be subject to pre-appointment scrutiny by its members.Its chair, the Labour MP Andy Slaughter, wrote in aletter last month to the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, that “action must be taken to rebuild the reputation of the CCRC and repair some of the damage to public trust in the organisation that has been done during Ms Pitcher’s time as chair”.The letter also questioned Pitcher’s suitability to remain as chair of the judicial appointments commission, saying: “Given your conclusion that Ms Pitcher was unfit to chair the CCRC, it would seem inconsistent for questions not to be raised about her fitness to continue as chair of the JAC.”CEO of watchdog accused of attempt to ‘sanitise’ review of Andrew Malkinson caseRead moreBoth Pitcher and Kneller have been keen toportray the mishandling of the Malkinson case as an outlier, but there have been serious concerns for several years about the way the body has been run. One source said Pitcher had “surrounded herself with ‘yes people’” at the CCRC, with Kneller cited as a prime example.AWestminster commmission on miscarriages of justicefound in 2021 that “a target-driven culture prioritises speed over thoroughness” and that while it recognised “some excellent investigative work”, it found that “financial constraints and an increased caseload have compromised the CCRC’s ability to carry out its role effectively in all cases”.Pitcher is credited with pushing to make the organisation remote-first since the Covid-19 pandemic, despite moves to get the wider civil service back in the office. The majority of staff now work from home and come to the office twice a year for meetings. The rationale was that the flexibility would attract a better calibre of candidate, but some staff said it made casework more challenging. One said: “As a remote worker, it’s quite difficult because you can’t just walk over to someone and say: ‘What do you think about this?’”It is an arrangement that is likely to have suited Pitcher, who is based in north London and enjoys managing her property portfolio in Montenegro.With staff hired on remote contracts, they are now scattered across the UK and any travel to the office is funded by the CCRC’s already tight budget. And those living in Scotland, Newcastle or Cornwall are unlikely to be persuaded to relocate to Birmingham.A spokesperson for Pitcher said the CCRC was forced to introduce remote working “like almost every other public body” and that this had remained in place as it had in much of the civil service. “There isn’t space at the CCRC office for every employee to work on-site and most of the staff are widely dispersed around the UK,” they said.The organisation is also hampered by a shortage of commissioners,who ultimately decide whether to refer cases back to the court of appeal. This means the backlog of cases where an investigation is concluded but needs a final decision continues to be high.There should be 12 commissioners but only nine are in post. “The decision queue is ridiculous because we now don’t have enough commissioners,” one insider said.It is understood that there were more than 200 investigated cases waiting on a decision at the end of last year before a concerted effort was made to bring them down to the high-100s, with commissioners working overtime.The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the time commitment for commissioners has been reduced to just one day a week of remote working. Pitcher lobbied successfully to increase commissioners’ pay to improve the quality of candidates but this has further delayed the process of recruiting replacements.Meanwhile, replacing Pitcher is expected to take even longer. Staff have been told it will be at least six weeks, and probably several months, before an interim chair is appointed.In summer 2023, during a crescendo of calls for Pitcher to apologise to Malkinson, she sent a memo to staff saying it was “super to see how supportive and aligned we all are”.That support from staff of the remaining leadership, if it was ever as effusive as Pitcher assumed, can no longer be relied on.Explore more on these topicsCriminal Cases Review CommissionUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

Over the years it has provided moments of great spectacle: Prince playing Purple Rain in the rain, Rihanna announcing her pregnancy flanked by hundreds of sperm-looking dancers in duvet drip – but it’s never been a site of serious artistry. Its biggest controversies – Janet Jackson’s nip slip, MIA’s middle finger – have been teenage in their puerility.Could that change with the arrival to the Super Bowl stage of Lamar, one of this decade’s great public intellectuals – a Pulitzer prize-winning rapper who has transformed the possibilities of hip-hop? It’s an unlikely match for the NFL in an ordinary year, but performing in front of a president who has attacked intellectualism, Black activism and the communities in which Lamar was raised, it felt momentous before it even began.But Lamar was not necessarily looking to make a statement. He’s in the most mischievous part of his career and at the crest of his mainstream popularity: in 2024 he released a series of dueling diss tracks with Drake, which culminated in Not Like Us – a song that spent the summer atop the Billboard 200 and repeatedly and specifically calls Drake a paedophile. It’s a joyous song of defiance, but one with a churlish undertone that doesn’t fit with the Super Bowl’s inclusivity. So which Kendrick would be arriving in New Orleans? The prophet or the provocateur?In the end we got flavours of both, with an uneven but ambitious set that was arguably the most esoteric in the Super Bowl’s history, perhaps at the expense of landing a knockout blow. It began with Samuel L Jackson as Uncle Sam, playing the American machine that berated Lamar: “It’s your Uncle Sam, and this is the great American game!”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jamie Squire/Getty ImagesLamar began the show atop a 1987 Buick Grand National GNX, the rare car for which his album is named. He performed an unreleased and unnamed track, known on theKendrick Lamar subredditas Bodies, an early sign that he wasn’t in New Orleans to play crowd pleasers. His outfit also spoke to a sense of self-possession: he wore a varsity jacket by the British designer Martine Rose and the most incredible pair of boot cut jeans – something straight off the rack from mid-00s American Eagle.The set warmed up with Squabble Up and Humble as dancers flooded the stage dressed in red, white and blue tracksuits, a nod both to the Americana of the occasion and potentially a moment of unity between Compton’s two rival gangs. When the all-Black dance cast started to interplay to form the American flag, it was a moment that felt weighted with significance as Trump looked on (and was rumoured to have left shortly after).As Uncle Sam Jackson yelled at Lamar that he was “too loud, too reckless, too ghetto” (perhaps in a precursor to how this set will be reviewed in red states), Lamar moved into an expansive set that resembled a tarmac Compton street corner, another impressive set that was reminiscent of Es Devlin’s Compton street corner that Lamar performed on with Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg and Eminem at the Super Bowl two years ago.It felt at times more like a Lincoln Center play than a half-time show, with dense layered flows and an interplay of dance, Jackson’s spoken-word moments and Lamar album tracks that didn’t always combine to make an obvious point. Lamar is able to deploy one of the greatest flows in the history of rap, but the onslaught of complex verses didn’t always work in this arena and you occasionally longed for a rousing anthem like Alright or Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe.But things changed halfway through the set when he teased Not Like Us, in a funny interplay with four female dancers. As the opening bars of the song played over the PA, Kendrick joked: “I want to perform their favorite song, but you know they love to sue,” a reference to Drake’s ongoing defamation lawsuit against the pair’s shared record label, Universal Music. In the week leading up to the Super Bowl there were some rumours that the lawsuit would prevent the song being performed.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: George Walker IV/APAnd for a moment it seemed like it might be. Instead of launching into it, he played Luther and All the Stars, his pair of songs withSZA, whose soaring vocal gave the set a more layered atmosphere and useful counterbalance. Jackson even acknowledged that these more melodic numbers would appease doubting sports fans at home: “That’s what America wants – nice and calm,” he shouted.But then Kendrick slammed on the brakes and swerved in the opposite direction, finally unleashing Not Like Us and it felt euphoric. He revealed a maniacal grin, looking straight down the camera as he said: “Hey Drake”, before launching into his ruinous screed. He did tone down some of the harshest blows – self-censoring the word “paedophile”, likely at both his lawyers’ and censors’ request – but still screeched the devastating lyric: “Tryna strike a chord and it’s probably A minor”, flanked by huge flags that showed small children pointing to a lower-case A. As a final jibe, Serena Williams, an ex-girlfriend of Drake, was seen crip-walking by a lamp post. The Chiefs might have been losing by 27 points at half-time, but it was Drake at that moment who was the biggest loser in North America.Kendrick himself has always seen himself more as an eyewitness than an activist – or as he put it on Family Ties: “I been duckin’ the social gimmicks / I been duckin’ the overnight activists.” This was a classy, intelligent set that chose artistry over easily meme-able moments. Instead the most obvious protest was not seen on TV but in the stadium, assomeone managed to join the throng and raise a Palestinian and Sudanese flag atop Kendrick’s GNX. One of the most intriguing things about Lamar is you’ll never know if the protester was storming the stage or a planned part of the set.Explore more on these topicsKendrick LamarSuper Bowl LIXRapSZAHip-hopSuper BowlUS sportsreviewsShareReuse this content"

They crossed under the towering iron gates and barbed wire at the edge of the Damascus complex after thefall of Bashar al-Assadand headed immediately to the squalid cells just a few feet wide where they had spent years huddled in the dark, staring at the back of the heavy metal doors and drawing on the walls.Mahmoud Chtawi said that when he entered he lifted his head to gaze up at the 10-storey concrete building just to prove to himself that he could. For decades, anyone passing the facility run by military intelligence was terrified to even steal a glance. He headed to find cell number 15, firing off rounds of bullets in celebration when he did. He then decided to spend the night inside his former cell to “process the memories” of his time there.“When I stepped into the cell, I was thinking that finally this is justice,” he said.View image in fullscreenMarkings inside the solitary confinement cells in the basement prison of the Palestine branch in Damascus.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianA few feet away, Ibrahim Younis re-entered cell number nine and sat there for 10 minutes, musing on his promises to former prisoners during his time employed and later imprisoned in the Palestine branch that he would one day help free those unfairly detained.Chtawi, Younis and his cousin Mahmoud Younis are among a band of fighters from the Islamist militant group Ahrar al-Sham – one of the groups that overran the detention sites that were a hallmark of Assad’s regime – standing guard outside the infamous facility in whose freezing cells they were once imprisoned and abused. The Palestine branch, also known as branch 235, was named for its role in the surveillance of Palestinian groups, but its name had been synonymous with torture for several decades.All those outside said they hoped Syria’s new leadership would seek to transform the prison into a “place of justice” despite its past. Civilians including more former detainees filed in to its courtyard to report thefts and carjackings, or to sign up to work for Syria’s caretaker government. Many approached with some caution, warmly greeting the new guards, but unable to overlook their memories of what took place inside.Ibrahim Younis was particularly pleased that people from the surrounding Damascus neighbourhood were arriving to report crimes. Projecting a business-like confidence despite the horrors he endured while detained, he has returned to his former job as an investigator two decades after he first started work there during Assad’s rule.View image in fullscreenMahmoud Chtawi (right), a former Palestine branch prisoner, jumps out of a pickup where he now stands guard.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianHe had always liked solving crimes, he said, and first signed up to work as an investigator at the Palestine branch in 2005. This meant learning the details of interrogation techniques routinely used at the facility, witnessing officers hang detainees by a tyre to beat them, forcing them into stress positions or suspending them by their wrists.Younis said he only ever observed the torture, but he fought back tears as he recalled looking into the eyes of one of his neighbours who was beaten to death. Then 24, he had started to recognise dozens of those being brought into the facility as the Assad regime cracked down on protests against his rule.“They beat him to get the names of other demonstrators,” he said. “I watched him die right in front of my eyes from this torture. It taught me that the state wasn’t there to protect people, but just to keep its grip on power.”The incident spurred Younis to pass information to demonstrators in his neighbourhood to help the anti-Assad movement. But his co-workers caught him, and by 2012 Younis and his cousin Mahmoud had been dragged into the Palestine branch and locked away in cells directly underneath his former office.Mahmoud has not been able to forget what happened next. “I still have the scars on my body,” he said.Long periods in solitary confinement were broken only when they were gathered in a room to await torture, sometimes made to crouch together naked as additional humiliation. Mahmoud recalled being intermittently given electric shocks or doused with filthy water, seeing dead bodies laying on the prison floor, and fearing that wounds from torture would fester enough to warrant a trip to a military hospital, where the doctors also harmed their patients.View image in fullscreenIbrahim Younis outside the solitary confinement cells where he was imprisoned.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianHundreds were held at a time in the filthy underground prison, including foreign nationals such as the Canadian Maher Arar, who was brought thereunder the CIA’s extraordinary rendition programme. Arardescribedbeing beaten with a two-inch thick electrical cable, and being forced to listen to others being abused until his jailers extracted a confession from him about visiting Afghanistan, a place where he had never set foot.Among the charred rooms of the investigations department was one containing a dentist’s chair and equipment, which were likely to have been used for torture. On the prison floor an overturned cardboard box disgorged hundreds of packets of medication used to treat heart attacks, allowing staff to keep prisoners alive long enough to be abused again.View image in fullscreenA dentist’s chair at the intelligence headquarters above the Palestine branch prison.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianMahmoud and Ibrahim were released after almost two years in the facility. Both immediately defected to opposition militias before fleeing to rebel-held pockets in the north of the country.“Every night before the fall of the Assad regime I had nightmares that they would re-arrest me and bring me back here,” said Mahmoud. “This place itself is a nightmare.”The cavernous interior of the deserted facility is now silent, save for investigators from Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham who came to rifle through a room full of papers. Other rooms that once contained wall-to-wall filing cabinets filled with details about the Assad regime’s suffocating surveillance have been reduced to nothing more than heaps of grey ash.Members of Ahrar al-Sham accused another militia of torching key evidence at the facility in the hours after Assad’s officers had fled. The building’s upper floors that once housed the luxurious sleeping quarters of those in charge were coated in broken glass after being looted. Several of the cell doors still had heavy metal chains attached from when the prisoners inside were freed, the fetid smell of body odour lingering in the air.View image in fullscreenA room in the intelligence headquarters of the Palestine branch.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianElsewhere reams of papers detailed how the branch surveilled its own citizens, down to precise details of rosary beads they carried when arrested, accusations that detainees had provided medical care to demonstrators or given details about their own family to a nephew. One document detailed a complaint about the branch’s ageing surveillance cameras, which lay on the ground after being ripped from the walls.“People were slaughtered here, and there were acts of unimaginable psychological abuse. They threatened my family,” said Ahmad al-Homsi, who described how he lost 50kg (110lb) during his two years held in the Palestine branch.“They could teach Satan about abuse here.” The torture had created rage within him that he said he was still struggling to manage, he said.Syria’s revolution hangs in the balance. The west must lift sanctions now | Simon TisdallRead moreStanding under the towering iron gates of the facility for the first time as a free man, however, Homsi saw opportunity. He had just returned to Damascus from Turkey, he said, and had immediately headed to the former site of his suffering to volunteer.“I want to do whatever I can to help the new government,” he said. As for what should happen to the hulking facility, he said he wanted those responsible for killing his two brothers in detention to be taken there.Ibrahim Younis and the other militants were divided on what should happen to the Palestine branch. Chtawi thought it should be converted into a university building or hospital, arguing that a facility once known for abusing civilians should be symbolically transformed into a place of public service.Younis was more cautious. He would never condone the branch being used for torture, he said, but felt that even the new Syria needed some form of intelligence services.“We can keep this place for the general intelligence service, but like you see here, it should be a place that returns citizens’ rights,” he said, gesturing at the groups of people showing up to report thefts and other crimes. “It should be a place of justice, not one of injustice.”Explore more on these topicsSyriaBashar al-AssadMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Lauren Aratani reportsIn the immediate aftermath of January’s Potomac River tragedy, the deadliest US air disaster since 9/11, few might have expectedDonald Trumpto point so quickly to one alleged culprit: DEI policies. But as the Guardian US reporterLauren Arataniexplains, Trump’s comments were just the latest chapter in the long fight against diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.Lauren tellsHelen Piddthat DEI policies were born in the 1960s as part of an effort by employers to broadly address injustice and exclusion. Today they are based on actively considering a person’s identity (race, gender, sexuality, disability, class etc) when engaging with them, and they arguably reached their peak in the flurry of corporate announcements that emerged after the 2020 killing of George Floyd.But, as Lauren explains, for decades conservative opposition to DEI has been growing, arguing instead for “colour blindness” over what is seen as “anti-meritocractic reverse discrimination”. This backlash has been spearheaded by activists, such as Edward Blum, making successful legal challenges to affirmative action policies within college admissions, as well as a growing cultural movement that blames more and more of the US’s problems on the push for diversity.Lauren explores whether the second Trump presidency will finally mean the end for DEI and its particular approach to equality and fairness.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationToday in FocusUS politicsDonald TrumpUS work & careersWork & careersRaceGender"

The Ivan Bohun military high school – one of three such establishments inUkraine– is home to hundreds of teenagers.The lives of the cadets, who stay at the facility for two years before they turn 18, are strictly choreographed, according to Dmytro Yermolenko, the deputy head. He says the teenagers are given systematic military training and learn strict discipline.One of the recruits is 16-year-old Yevhen, whose childhood dream was to join the school. His grandfather, a decorated general, had set the example. Generations of the family have served as artillerymen, submariners and intelligence officers but Yevhen wants to become a fighter pilot. “It’s a very necessary job right now,” he explains. If Yevhen is successful, he could be trainingon Dutch or Danish F-16s by next year.View image in fullscreenCadets prepare for physical exercise. The school competes against teams from other military institutions across Ukraine.View image in fullscreenYevhen, 16, does pull-ups on a bar in a rare moment of free time.School days run from 6.50am to 9.30pm with the cadets taking classes on topics including maths, physics and history as well as firearms, gas attacks and battlefield strategy. Their day starts and ends with exercise. Between classes, cadets line up for checks by their commanders before they march in step to their next activity. On Sundays, they can go where they want. They venture into the city, visit their families or stay at the school to spend free time with their friends. About 50 of the 600 students are female.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenCadets hand in their phones at the start of the school day. Mobile devices are banned during lessons.

The school also takes in foster children and orphans, some of whom have lost their parents either killed in combat or by Russian airstrikes.View image in fullscreenA Muslim cadet prays during a break from class.After graduating, more than 90% of the cadets enrol in military universities or join armed forces units around the country.

Prosecutors claim the video incited public disorder and damaged the reputation of the president and his wife.Multiple requests for bail for Hunt, a single mother of three children, have been refused. On 28 December, she appeared ina videoapologising to the president and first lady and said she was being treated well and that the police had handled everything professionally.However, her daughter and human rights activists believe this was a forced confession and that she may be facing physical abuse while being held in Pademba Road prison in Freetown, Sierra Leone’s capital.Alicia Hunt, 20, who lives in Calgary inCanada, said she had been allowed to speak to her mother only while prison guards were present.Woman killed at opposition party HQ during Sierra Leone electionsRead moreHunt told her there were bedbug infestations and a mosquito problem and that she was given limited food – a piece of buttered bread in the morning and half a cup of rice with a small portion of fish in the evening. Alicia said: “My mother said all the food there makes everyone sick. People would rather starve than eat it.”She added: “I whispered to her one time on the call, ‘Are you being abused in any way?’ And she said, ‘Oh yeah, we are regularly hit in here, but that’s justAfrica, that’s how they do things.’ There should be no reason why they are laying hands on my mother or anyone.”Alicia believes her mother’s arrest is politically motivated. She said her mother and Fatima Maada Bio went to school together and had engaged online before. “I do think it was planned, this arrest,” she said. “Once they heard she was going to be on House of Stars, I think they saw it as an opportunity to [arrest her] live on a nationally known show to make an example of her and incite fear in people speaking out about the government.”Amnesty Internationalhas called for the releaseof Hunt and for guarantees to a fair trial.

Over the weekend, the presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda – Félix Tshisekedi and Paul Kagame – were among thosewho took part in a regional summitaimed at ending the resurgent violence in eastern DRC. The summit ended with a call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. But while there wasa lull in the fighting yesterday, many fear that a ceasefire is less likely than escalation to a wider regional war.Rwanda does not officially admit to its involvement in the latest episode of the long-running and devastating conflict in eastern DRC. But M23, an armed group with Rwanda’s tacit and practical support, has taken the capital of North Kivu province, Goma, and is now moving south to expand the territory under its control. At stake is control of a mineral-rich region of crucial strategic significance, and the fate of civilians there who are frequently the subject of ethnically targeted attacks – but also the question of whether national borders can act as any sort of constraint.For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Murithi Mutiga,Africaprogram director at the International Crisis Group. Here are the headlines.Five big storiesArms trade| Britain’s system for controlling arms exports is broken, subject to political manipulation and has seen conduct that crossed the threshold into complicity with war crimes,a former UK diplomat has claimed.

Late last month, they seized Goma, the capital of North Kivu state. Last week, M23 quickly broke a ceasefire pledge and launched a new offensive towards South Kivu’s capital of Bukavu.Asthe horrifying newsthat hundreds of female inmates at Goma’s prison were raped and burned alive after a mass jailbreak last week makes clear, the humanitarian consequences of this violence are profound. Sexual violence as a weapon of war is rife, children are often forced to fight and millions have been displaced over the long history of the conflict – which, all told, has killed about 6 million people. Almost 3,000 have been killed in the most recent fighting, the UN says, a number that is expected to rise – andmore than 700,000 have been displaced, adding to 3 million who fled their homes last year.What is the background to the conflict?The new spate of violence is the latest episode of a decades-long conflict that has its roots in the 1994 genocide in neighbouring Rwanda, when an estimated 800,000 people from the minority Tutsi ethnic group were slaughtered by the majority Hutus. As the genocide ended, about a million Hutus fearing reprisals fled to eastern DRC, then called Zaire. Rwanda and its new Tutsi-led government sought to exert influence in the region.After years of relative quiet, M23 – largely drawn from North Kivu’s Tutsi minority population – re-emerged as a regional force in 2021; then, ahead of elections in 2023, president Félix Tshisekedi promised an offensive aimed at quashing the rebellion. That effort quickly ran aground, and M23 – with the support of Rwandan forces – seized new territory again.As well as longstanding ethnic tensions and the struggle between Rwanda and DRC for influence over the region, the presence of valuable mineral resources is a central factor.Who are the M23 militia?The March 23 movement, known as M23, takes its name from a peace agreement signed on that date in 2009, which the rebels say that the DRC government reneged on. They were formed in 2012 from the remnants of a predecessor Tutsi rebel group, which had integrated into the Congolese army.M23 say that they aim to protect their fellow Tutsis in the region – amid increasing ethnic violence against them – and to secure the recognition of Tutsi refugees forced to flee to Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi as DRC citizens. The DRC government asserts that this cause is a front for Rwandan inference on its sovereign territory. Meanwhile, the rebels say that any peace deal must feature a general amnesty for their members and their reintegration into the DRC army.Crucially, M23 no longer casts itself as a solely Tutsi group, Mutiga said. “They describe themselves as part of a broader Congolese movement. They are now under the umbrella of an organisation they call the Congo River Alliance, and they recruit outside of their existing community boundaries.”While M23 have vowed to march across DRC to Kinshasa, a more realistic goal appears to be dominance of the east. “They and Kigali appear to have a long term plan for de facto control beyond the conflict, and when it comes time for negotiations, the M23 aim to secure a form of federalism which grants them a degree of autonomy, a prospect Kinshasa will be loath to entertain.”M23 has been blamed for many of the atrocities committed during the fighting.This pieceby Mark Townsend describes indiscriminate killing and torture; staggering sexual violence; and the execution of children to intimidate civilians.What role is Rwanda playing in the war?Officially, the Rwanda government continues to deny any involvement in DRC. But NGOs and the UN say that Rwandan troops have played a critical role.This reportby Mark Townsend and Michela Wrong on Friday sets out the compelling evidence that hundreds of Rwandans have died in the fighting.The tone of official statements has now shifted away from outright denial. “It was implausible for Rwanda to keep insisting they were not present on the ground,” Mutiga said. “But it also indicates how badly relations between Kinshasa and Kigali have deteriorated. Kigali is sending a message: we are the dominant military actor here, and you cannot ignore us.”Rwanda says that its priority for the region is to take on Hutu militias, which it says pose a genocidal threat against Tutsis. The most prominent of these are the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, or FDLR.But eastern DRC’s mineral resources are also a crucial strategic concern: in 2023, DRC produced about40% of the world’s coltan, crucial for the manufacture of smartphones. Rwanda – which has limited natural resources of its own – is a regional trade hub for coltan and other minerals extracted from eastern DRC.“Kigali’s approach is fuelled by a sense that history gives it the right to a stake there,” Mutiga said, with many “Rwandophones” – Hutus and Tutsis alike who speak the Rwandan national language, Kinyarwanda – in the region. The border imposed by European colonists split the ancient Rwandan kingdom, denying Kigali access to what in its telling would have been the bulk of its natural resources.“They have a sense of grievance because of that,” Mutiga said. “But you also have to ask where it would stop if African countries started revisiting colonial borders. The ripple effects could be very dangerous – and there is no question there will be alarm in Africa and beyond that this is creating an exceedingly worrying precedent.”What is the position of the DRC government?The failure of Tshisekedi’s offensive has caused public unrest in Kinshasa, about 1,000 miles west of Goma – partly because of the weakness of DRC’s army.There has also been significant anger at Rwanda, bordering Uganda – accused of tolerating militants in the region – and western powers viewed as having failed to intervene. The Rwandan and Ugandan embassies in Kinshasa were sacked in January, and the US and French embassies also came under attack.There is meanwhile a growing distrust of Tshisekedi himself, who is trying to change the country’s constitution so that he does not have to step down because of term limits in 2028. He has promised a “vigorous and coordinated response” to the rebel advance.“Holding talks with M23 would be intensely unpopular in the capital and other parts of DRC,” Mutiga said. “Kinshasa has doubled down and says that it will not negotiate. But when there is little prospect of turning the tide in the conflict without significant bloodshed, that becomes increasingly unsustainable.”What are the prospects for a return to negotiations?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But few expect the same thing to happen again.“Rwanda has skilfully tried to make itself useful to external partners, particularly the European Union,” Mutiga said. “Its forces are deployed in Mozambique, where they have had success in pushing back militants who threatened an important French Total gas development. The state is seen as an example of somewhere that foreign aid is used efficiently.”“It is a formidably difficult situation,” he added. “M23 appears very dug in in the areas they have taken. DRC’s army is weak, and they would need the support of external partners to succeed in fighting back.

Foreigners arriving at its airport last year in the prime holiday month of December were up 3.7% from 2023 to more than 160,000, most of them tourists.In November, a group of residentsprotestedoutside the Bo-Kaap Museum, which is housed in one of the area’s oldest homes. They carried signs reading: “No buses in Bo-Kaap” and “Stop exploiting Bo-Kaap”.View image in fullscreenBo-Kaap has become a popular destination for tourists.Photograph: Nic Bothma/EPA“Tourism has become an attraction in Bo-Kaap, but … it’s a double-edged sword. It brings some money into Bo-Kaap, but very little,” said Osman Shaboodien, the chair of the Bo-Kaap Civic and Ratepayers Association and one of the protest organisers.“Bo-Kaap has a tourist problem. First, it’s over-tourism. There’s too many of them that come up here. Secondly … it has very narrow streets and it can’t accommodate these buses. And, thirdly, there are no places for them to park.”Bo-Kaap, meaning “above the Cape” in Afrikaans, hugs the slopes of Signal Hill, with Cape Town’s downtown just below. It is one of the city’s oldest residential areas, the first houses having been built in the 1760s.Descendants of Muslim enslaved people brought to the Cape by the Dutch from Indonesia and Malaysia, who became known as Cape Malays, lived alongside European, African and Asian immigrants.Plans to raze Bo-Kaap, like the nearby District Six area, during the apartheid era were stopped with the help of ID du Plessis, an official who had studied Cape Malay culture, according toThe Story of Bo-Kaap podcast. However, its designation as a Cape Malay-only area in 1957 meant other residents were evicted, most to the Cape Flats townships on the edge of the city.Today, there are seven mosques in an area just 2km long and 500m at its widest point, with another four mosques just outside it. Many houses are emblazoned with pro-Palestine murals.View image in fullscreenAuwal Mosque, South Africa’s oldest mosque, was built in Bo-Kaap in 1794.Photograph: Rachel Savage/The GuardianAmong residents’ fears is that outsiders moving into the area will lodge successful noise complaints about the calls to prayer and that new businesses will be awarded alcohol licences.“I know I can’t stop [gentrification]. My job really is to try to preserve the story of Bo-Kaap that underpins our identity and the identity, the national heritage, of this country,” said Zaki Harris, atour guidefrom Bo-Kaap, who wants authorities to educate guides from outside the area about its history and to provide more opportunities for residents.“Locals need to participate in the tourism economy, otherwise they’re out,” said Harris, who also chairs the Bo-Kaap Tourism Association, in an interview at the Bo-Kaap Deli, a cafe run by a local family.View image in fullscreenZaki Harris, a tour guide, outside the Bo-Kaap Deli cafe.Photograph: Rachel Savage/The GuardianTour guiding is regulated nationally, said James Vos, the mayoral committee member for economic growth. He added that the city funds Cape Town Tourism to provide “training and development for its nearly 1,000 members, many of whom reside in Bo-Kaap”.Shaboodien and the ratepayers’ association are fighting against a proposed six-storey, serviced apartment building they say will tower over the minaret of the nearby Auwal Mosque, South Africa’s first mosque, built in 1794.Flyt Property Investment, the developer of the site, a disused carpark, did not reply to interview requests. Ittold the Cape Times newspaperit had redesigned the original nine-storey proposal after a “public participation process”. A final planning decision is due by 21 April.View image in fullscreenOsman Shaboodien outside the Auwal Mosque.Photograph: Rachel Savage/The Guardian“You can consult the community as much as you want, but if you already intend to build what you want to build, then the consultation becomes a tick box,” said Shaboodien. “We [are] not against this construction. The architecture must fit into the [area].”The deputy mayor, Eddie Andrews, said: “Whilst the city understands the community’s concerns, all development applications are assessed against the requirements of the municipal planning by-law and relevant city policies before a decision is made.”He noted Bo-Kaap was protected as a heritage protection overlay zone. “The city must ensure least possible impact on heritage while also considering social and economic benefits,” he said.View image in fullscreenMurals painted on a home in Bo-Kaap.Photograph: Rachel Savage/The GuardianIn her parents’ plum-coloured house on a quiet courtyard, Nurahn Essop runs a cafe and helps her mother, Faeeza,teach tourists how to cook Cape Malay food. “We’ve made the most of it,” she said, of the influx of visitors. “Had we not, I don’t think our parents would be able to afford to live here.”Essop has moved to an area 20 minutes’ drive away with her children, where she is paying lower property taxes on a house that is 10 times bigger than her childhood home. She said she worried what would happen once her parents died.“Bo-Kaap is more than just the pretty houses and the colour. It’s also about the people and the history of the neighbourhood.

It was traveling into the capital from the town of San Agustín Acasaguastlán when it plunged approximately 20 metres (66ft) from Puente Belice, a highway bridge that crosses over a road and creek.Fifty-three people were found dead at the scene, while two others died after they were admitted to the hospital, officials said.Images shared by the fire department on social media showed the bus partially submerged in wastewater surrounded by victims’ bodies.Guatemala’s president, Bernardo Arévalo, declared three days of national mourning and deployed the country’s army and disaster agency to assist response efforts.“I stand in solidarity with the families of the victims who today woke up to heartbreaking news. Their pain is my pain,” Arévalo said on social media.The fire department said the driver lost control of the bus and collided with several small vehicles before plunging over the precipice.“The bus kept going, broke through a metal railing, and fell into a ravine about 20 metres deep until it reached the sewage-contaminated river,” Hernández told reporters.AFPTV images showed lines of firefighters passing bodies pulled from the murky waters, which were filled with trash, up the slope on stretchers.The communications minister, Miguel Ángel Díaz, said an initial investigation showed that the bus was 30 years old but still had a license to operate.He said that the cause of the early morning accident was still unknown and that investigators were looking into whether the bus was overloaded with passengers.Road accidents leading to dozens of fatalities are common in Central and South America.With reporting by Reuters and Agence France-PressExplore more on these topicsGuatemalaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He also thanked the voters. He said: “Thank you for the hope and the courage to believe again that this country can be different. Now, let’s keep fighting.”In April, Noboa and González will repeat the 2023 runoff election. In that contest, the then little-known congressman trailed González in the first round but defeated her in the final vote.According to the National Electoral Council, this weekend’s election day in Ecuadorpassed without significant incidents. Several international observers monitored the vote, including representatives from the EU and the Organization of American States. Turnout was 83.4% – in Ecuador voting is mandatory for citizens aged 18 to 65.Noboa and González were shadowed at public events by a phalanx of special forces, hoping to avoid a repeat of the 2023 election, when a leading candidate was assassinated.The election once again highlighted the polarisation betweenCorreísmo– named after former leftist president Rafael Correa, who governed from 2007 to 2017 and backs González’s candidacy – and theanti-Correísmocamp, in which Noboa is the leading figure. Despite there being 16 candidates, votes were primarily concentrated between Noboa and González – the third-place candidate received only 5%.The heir to a banana fortune, Noboa, 37, became Ecuador’s youngest president in 2023 afterunexpectedly winning a snap electionto complete the term of former president Guillermo Lasso, who had dissolved congress and resigned to avoid impeachment.In January 2024,Noboa declared an “internal armed conflict”and placed the military at the heart of his security policy, tackling criminal gangs – primarily drug-trafficking groups – that had turned one of Latin America’s most peaceful countries into one of its most violent in just a few years.Although Ecuador does not produce cocaine, it has become a major exporter – mainly through the port of its largest city, Guayaquil – of the drug, which is produced in Colombia and Peru, to the US and Europe.Although Noboa won a plebiscite last April in which most of the population endorsed his security measures, reports of human rights violations began to pile up – including thekilling of four black boys from Guayaquilafter they were detained by the air force.While crime rates fell initially, they soon returned to previous levels, andexperts have deemed Noboa’s approach ineffectivein reducing violence in the long term. Other crimes, such as abductions and kidnappings, continued to rise.Noboa’s presidency has also been marred by anenergy crisis, which has caused scheduled blackouts of up to 14 hours, and repeated violations of the constitution – including astandoff with his vice-president, Verónica Abad, whom he barred from assuming office while he took leave.In 2024 alone, the country was under a state of emergency for 250 days, allowing measures such as warrantless home searches and bans on public gatherings, which he defended as necessary in the fight against organised crime.Noboa alsorefused to comply with electoral rulesrequiring candidates to step down for the 30-day campaign period, which led González to tell the press , after casting her vote, that “Noboa has violated the law and the constitution”.Explore more on these topicsEcuadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

We therefore view the Cook Islands as having failed to properly consult New Zealand with respect to any agreements it plans to sign this coming week inChina.”New Zealand prime minister Christopher Luxon told media on Monday the relationship between the nations was close but transparency was important.“In this case, there hasn’t been [transparency], and that’s all we’re asking for,” he said.Luxon said he is waiting to see what the China agreement contains before committing to any action over the matter.Brown has defended his decision not reveal the details of the agreement to New Zealand, addingthe deal does not include security matters. Peters had also been assured there would be no impact on the relationship between New Zealand and the Cook Islands,Brown told RNZ Pacific.“There is no need for New Zealand to sit in the room with us while we are going through our comprehensive agreement with China,” Brown said.“We have advised them on the matter, but as far as being consulted and to the level of detail that they were requiring, I think that’s not a requirement.”Brown indicated the agreement with China was looking at cooperation on infrastructure and research into deep sea mining – the details of which would be announced once it is signed.The Guardian has contacted Brown’s office for comment.The tense exchange over the China deal follows last week’s announcement that Brown wasditching a controversial proposalto introduce a separate Cook Islands passport, after New Zealand warned it would require holders to renounce their New Zealand one.The incident is also the second row between New Zealand and a Pacific country in recent weeks. Last month, Peters announced he was reviewing development aid to Kiribati, after a lack of political engagement with the nation’s president Taneti Maamau.‘Resurgence’ in China aid to Pacific amid tussle with US for influenceRead moreMeanwhile, tensions over the Cook Islands deal comes amid concern held by western countries over Beijing’s push to build economic, military and strategicinfluence in the Pacific.Anna Powles, associate professor in the centre for defence and security studies at Massey University,told RNZthat China’s role in the Pacific has increased significantly since New Zealand and the Cook Islands signed their joint declaration 24 years ago.The relationship between the two nations during this geopolitical juncture was “incredibly important” and New Zealand would do well manage it – and its Pacific relationships – with care, Powles said.“[Cook Islands] could be seen as something of a barometer for how New Zealand engages with its other Pacific partners – this is something New Zealand needs to gets right.”Explore more on these topicsCook IslandsChinaNew ZealandAsia PacificPacific islandsnewsShareReuse this content"

We will react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified measures,” the bloc’s executive body said.In general, the imposition of tariffs “would be unlawful and economically counterproductive”, it said, adding: “Tariffs are essentially taxes. By imposing tariffs, the US would be taxing its own citizens, raising costs for business, and fuelling inflation.”A European Commission spokesperson later added that the reciprocal tariffs Washington was proposing were also unjustified. “We believe that none of the potential measures outlined by the US administration to date are justified,” they said.Trump’s move, if carried out, would mirror his action in his first term when he imposed 25% tariffs on steel from many countries as well as 10% tariffs on aluminium. For the EU, that covered about €6.4bn (£5.3bn) worth of exports.The bloc responded then with tariffs on €2.8bn of US goods including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, bourbon whiskey and denim jeans. Plans to apply tariffs to a further €3.6bn of US goods after three years were dropped when Joe Biden was elected president.Graphic illustration showing top exporters of iron, steel and aluminium to the USCanada and Mexico – which Trump has already threatened with tariffs – are the biggest steel exporters to the US along with Brazil, according to US trade data. South Korea is also big steel providers. It is estimated that about 25% of European steel exports go to the US.The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, echoed the European Commission’s words on Monday, saying that since nothing is yet official “we can only say with great caution but great clarity: anyone who imposes tariffs must expect counter-tariffs”.On Sunday night, Scholz said during an election debate with his probable successor as chancellor, Friedrich Merz, that Germany would suffer particularly heavily from new tariffs but EU was “prepared” to respond and “ready to act within one hour”.Trump has long complained about the EU’s 10% tariffs on imports of US vehicles being much higher than the America levy of 2.5% on cars from the bloc, frequently observing that Europe “won’t take our cars” but ships millions of its vehicles – many of them German – to the US every year.Scholz’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, also said on Monday that the EU was ready to respond. “Europe must and can only react unitedly and decisively to unilateral trade restrictions. And we are prepared for this,” Habeck said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is it what your people want? I’m not so sure,” Macron said.A spokesperson for the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the British government had not seen details of Trump’s proposed steel and aluminium tariffs and would continue to engage with the US administration as appropriate.They said it was not possible to speculate on the impact of tariffs without seeing details, but Britain was prepared for all developments. The industry body UK Steel said any tariffs would be a “devastating blow” to the sector.The UK exports about 200,000 tonnes of steel a year to the US, worth more than £400m.

The defence minister, Guido Crosetto, on Monday said he would submit a legal complaint after his voice was cloned and used in at least one of the calls.At least one of the targets is known to have fallen for the scam and was duped into making two transfers totalling €1m to an account in Hong Kong after falsely believing they would be reimbursed by the Bank of Italy.Crosetto revealed the scam in a social media post after receiving a call last week from a well-known entrepreneur who had transferred a large sum of money to an account after what he was convinced was a conversation with the minister. Then two more people contacted him. He said he chose to make the case public “so that no one runs the risk of falling into the trap”.Others were targeted by calls claiming to be from Crosetto’s staff, which were made to appear as though they were coming from the defence ministry in Rome.As of Monday, the legal complaints submitted include one from a member of the Aleotti family, which heads the Menarini pharmaceutical firm, and one from a member of the family that owns the Esselunga supermarket chain. A complaint is also expected to be submitted by Giorgio Armani, whose staff were contacted by the scammers, according to reports in the Italian press.The first person to file a legal complaint was Moratti, the former football boss and chair of Saras Group, an multinational energy company. “It all seemed real, they were good, it could happen to anyone,” he told La Repubblica.Lucia Aleotti, a Menarini board member, said the company was saved from the scam by a savvy personal assistant called Chiara. “We receive suspicious phone calls all the time,” she told Corriere della Sera. “Once they tried to sell us a Caravaggio and even a Leonardo. This was certainly not the most difficult scam for our assistant, who is alert and attentive, to recognise.”Aleotti said the caller had presented himself as a “Dr Giovanni Montalbano”, who claimed to be from the defence ministry and wanted to urgently speak to the company bosses regarding a national security matter.“The self-styled Montalbano insisted, saying that the minister was at the Nato offices. He left a foreign number to call him back on the same day. The phone call immediately made Chiara suspicious.”Others targeted by the elaborate scam include the owner of Tod’s, Diego Della Valle, and the executive vice-chair of Pirelli, Marco Tronchetti Provera.“They are professional scammers who clearly have both the technology and ability to identify targets,” Crosetto told a TV show on Sunday. “In this case, they identified major Italian entrepreneurs, people who, at the request of a minister, would perhaps be ready to make a bank transfer because of their love of Italy.”The case comes amid a rise in Italy of telephone scams using voices cloned by artificial intelligence. An elderly woman was last week defrauded of €30,000 after receiving a call from someone she believed to be her daughter, who told her that her husband had injured a mother and her child in a car accident and immediately needed the money to pay a lawyer.Explore more on these topicsItalyArtificial intelligence (AI)The super-richScamsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Sustainable development of the technology would be on the agenda, she added.The general secretary of the UNI Global Union, Christy Hoffman, warned that without worker involvement in the use of AI, the technology risked increasing inequality. The UNI represents about 20 million workers worldwide in industries including retail, finance and entertainment.“Without worker representation, AI-driven productivity gains risk turning the technology into yet another engine of inequality, further straining our democracies,” she told attenders.On Sunday, Macron promoted the event by posting a montage ofdeepfake images of himself on Instagram, including a video of “him” dancing in a disco with various 1980s hairstyles, in a tongue-in-cheek reference to the technology’s capabilities.View image in fullscreenMacron deepfakes on Instagram.Composite: Instagram/Guardian CompositeAlthough safety has been downplayed on the conference agenda, some in attendance were concerned about the pace of development.Max Tegmark, the scientist behind a 2023 letter calling for a pause in producing powerful AI systems, cautioned that governments and tech companies were inadvertently re-enacting the ending of the Netflix climate crisis satireDon’t Look Up.The film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence uses a looming comet, and the refusal by the political and media establishment to acknowledge the existential threat, as a metaphor for the climate emergency – with the meteor ultimately wiping out the planet.“I feel like I have been living that movie,” Tegmark told the Guardian in an interview. “But now it feels l like we‘ve reached the part of the film where you can see the asteroid in the sky. And people are still saying that it doesn’t exist. It really feels like life imitating art.”Tegmark said the promising work at the inaugural summit at Bletchley Park in the UK in November 2023 had been partly undone. “Basically, asteroid denial is back in full swing,” he said.The Paris gathering has been badged as the AI action summit,whereas its UK cousinwas the AI safety summit. Macron is co-chairing the summit with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The US vice-president, JD Vance, and Chinese vice-premier, Zhang Guoqing, are among the other political attenders, although the UK prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, isnot attending.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Estimates of when, and if, AGI will be reached vary but Tegmark said based on statements from industry figures “the asteroid is going to strike … somewhere between one and five years from now.Developments in AI have accelerated since 2023, with theemergence of so-called reasoning modelspushing the capabilities of systems even further. The release of a freely available reasoning model by the Chinese company DeepSeek has also intensified the competitive rivalry between China and the US, which has led AI breakthroughs.The head of Google’s AI efforts, Demis Hassabis, said on Sunday the tech industry was “perhaps five years away” from achieving AGI and safety conversations needed to continue. “Society needs to get ready for that and … the implications that will have.”Speaking in Paris before the summit, Hassabis added that AGI carried “inherent risk”, particularly in the field of autonomous “agents”, which carry out tasks without human intervention, but those concerns could be assuaged.“I’m a big believer in human ingenuity. I think if we put the best brains on it, and with enough time and enough care … then I think we’ll get it right.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingClimate crisisFranceWork & careersEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Afterwards, officers said he was carrying a copy of the Qur’an, three knives and two mobile phones.At the opening of the trial, the presiding judge, Christophe Petiteau, asked the defendant to confirm his name. Aouissaoui, speaking through an interpreter, did so but was unable to respond when asked to give the name of his lawyer and said he did not remember anything.“I don’t remember what happened. I have nothing to say because I remember nothing,” he told the court.According to the anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office there were “many indications that at the time he left Tunisia … the accused intended to carry out an attack in France”.The investigating magistrate said Aouissaoui had described France as “a country of miscreants and dogs”.Aouissaoui is being tried for three murders and six attempted murders.A national day of mourning was held forNadine Devillers, 60, whose husband, Joffrey, completed and published theautobiographyshe was writing at the time of her killing,Vincent Loqués, 55, a devout Catholic who worked at the church, who had his throat cut inside the church, andSimone Barreto Silva, 44, a Franco-Brazilian care worker, who was repeatedly stabbed inside the Notre-Dame basilica.The killings came two weeks after the history-geography teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded near his secondary school north-west of Paris by an 18-year-old Chechen refugee angered at reports he had shown pupils caricatures of the prophet Muhammad in a lesson on freedom of speech.Aouissaoui had crossed the Mediterranean from Tunisia to Italy a month before the attack and then entered France overland.Medical examinations have revealed no brain damage from the injuries caused during his arrest and the psychiatric assessment concluded his judgment was not impaired at the time of the attack.The prosecution claimed his telephone conversations in prison suggested his amnesia was “at the very least exaggerated”.The trial continues until 26 February.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

If this failed and the president was also unable to broker a compromise, a new election would be inevitable, he said.Kurti had hinted before the vote that he would prefer to sit in opposition if his party was unable to form a majority government, but changed his tune as the votes were counted. “Without hesitation, we will form a government,” he told supporters overnight, congratulating them on their “victory”.Leart Hoxha, a political analyst, said VV would be in no rush to form a coalition, instead remaining in charge as a caretaker government while the other parties squabbled. “This will be a year that will be wasted; it will be a government that will not be able to push for major projects,” he said, adding that this would be likely to lead to political and social crises.Election officials said turnout for the vote was about 40%.Twenty seats in parliament are reserved for minority parties, including 10 for Kosovo’s ethnic Serbs, who are vastly outnumbered by ethnic Albanians.The Serb List party said it had won all 10 seats, which if confirmed could put it in the position of kingmaker – even though the party has often boycotted parliament and is regarded by Kosovan authorities as the armed wing of Serbia.“We thank our President Aleksandar Vučić for his congratulations and support, not only today but during all these years,” the party’s leader, Zlatan Elek, told a news conference, referring to Serbia’s president. “We have only one country and one president.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tensions spiked after EU- and US-backed negotiations between Kosovo and Serbia all but collapsed in March 2023. In the aftermath, Nato peacekeeperswere assaulted by rioting Serbswhile adeadly armed standoff in the northsent regional tensions soaring.Kurti also launched a concerted effort to dismantle the remaining Serbian institutions operating on Kosovan soil by shuttering Belgrade-backed banks and post and tax offices along with banning the Serbian currency and car registration plates.Throughout the unrest, Kurti has remained unwavering, even if it meant running afoul of Kosovo’s allies in the US andEurope.Explore more on these topicsKosovoEuropeSerbianewsShareReuse this content"

The army has cancelled all leave for soldiers in theGazadivision, the Kan news outlet reported, in another sign that Israeli authorities are preparing for the resumption of war.Late on Monday,Hamassaid the “door remains open” for the next hostage-prisoner exchange, due to take place on Saturday.In a statement, the militant group said it had “intentionally made this announcement five days before the scheduled prisoner handover, allowing mediators ample time to pressure [Israel] towards fulfilling its obligations”. It added: “The door remains open for the prisoner exchange batch to proceed as planned, once the occupation complies.”Relatives and supporters of Israelis held hostage in Gaza said they have contacted the negotiators – who are fromQatar, Egypt and the US – asking for urgent help to “restore and implement” an agreement that took more than a year to seal.Although a Hamas spokesperson cited past Israeli violations for halting the exchanges, the decision comes against a backdrop of US and Israeli leaders taking increasingly hardline positions about the long-term future of the strip.Donald Trump hasrepeatedly called for a Gaza without Palestinians. Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly praised Trump’s “fresh idea” for the territory and privately insists the war will only end if Hamas agrees to “cease to exist”, Israeli media reported.Trump says Palestinians will have no right of return to Gaza under his planRead moreThe militant group treats its Israeli hostages as leverage and was releasing them partly to secure prisoner releases but mostly in order to have a role in determining the future of a postwar Gaza, even though it is widely accepted it will no longer govern there.But the group no longer believes US guarantees for the ceasefire will hold and it does not think Israel is serious about implementing the plan, Reuters reported.Qatar had warned Israeli officials at the weekend that even the first stage of the ceasefire deal was being put in jeopardy by provocative statements from Netanyahu and by his government’s approach to talks on a second stage,Haaretz reported. Qatari diplomats sent angry messages to Israeli counterparts, reminding them that as hosts, key mediators and guarantors of the deal’s implementation, they too have a stake in its survival, an Israeli source said.The Qatari foreign ministry, which usually tries to stay scrupulously neutral, had also issued a rare public condemnation of Israel after Netanyahu suggested Saudi Arabia should provide land for a Palestinian state. It described the Israeli leader’s comments as “a flagrant violation of international law” in a statement that urged the international community to “decisively address Israel’s provocations”.In public remarks, Abu Obeida, a spokesperson for Hamas’s military wing, accused Israel of delaying the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza, blocking the arrival of aid and attacking civilians. There would be no more hostage releases until Israel “complies and compensates for the past weeks”, he said.The next exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and detainees had been set for this Saturday and would have been the sixth under the six-week-long first stage of the ceasefire deal.The skeletal appearance of three hostages released on Saturdayshocked many Israelis, and increased pressure on the government to reach a deal to bring home those still trapped. Several recently returned hostages have said they fear those still inside Gaza will struggle to survive much longer.In Tel Aviv, protesters blocked streets on Monday night, demanding the return of all hostages, as some relatives accused their government of sabotaging the deal and endangering their loved ones.“Abu Obeida’s statement is a direct result of Netanyahu’s irresponsible behaviour,” said Einav Zangauker, the mother of Matan Zangauker, who is a hostage in Gaza and not listed for release under the first stage of the deal. “[Netanyahu’s] deliberate procrastination and unnecessary provocative statements disrupted the implementation of the agreement.”Hamas is due to release 33 hostages during the first stage of the deal, although eight of them are dead. The list of those who will be released includes women – civilians and soldiers – children, the sick and older men. Israel has agreed to release about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.Sixteen Israelis have been released so far, all alive, and Hamas alsoreleased five Thai citizens last week. They had not been included in the negotiations.The second stage of the ceasefire deal is intended to bring the return of all living hostages and the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, under a framework agreed days before Trump’s inauguration in January. Negotiations on the details of that stage were always expected to be even more challenging than agreeing the initial ceasefire.Netanyahu’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said he would quit the coalition if the war did not restart after the return of 33 hostages, which could force the Israeli leader to choose between his government and the deal.Talks officially began at a meeting Netanyahu held in Washington with Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, but there have been no substantial negotiations yet. The Israeli prime minister has only authorised his team to discuss technical issues related to implementing and extending the first stage. His office had said earlier on Monday that an Israeli delegation of negotiators had returned from Doha, Israeli media reported, without giving further details.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelHamasGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaQatarnewsShareReuse this content"

The allegation is raising urgent questions about how Paragon’s government clients are using the powerful hacking tool.Three people – an Italian journalist namedFrancesco Cancellato; the high-profile Italian founder of an NGO that aids immigrants namedLuca Casarini; and a Libyan activist based in Sweden namedHusam El Gomati– announced they were among the 90 people whose mobile phones had probably been compromised last year.WhatsApp says journalists and civil society members were targets of Israeli spywareRead moreMore is likely to be known soon, when researchers at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which investigates digital threats against civil society and has worked closely with WhatsApp, is expected to release a new technical report on the breach.Like NSO Group, Paragon licenses its spyware, which is called Graphite, to government agencies. If it is deployed successfully, it can hack any phone without a mobile phone user’s knowledge, giving the operator of the spyware the ability to intercept phone calls, access photographs, and read encrypted messages. Its purpose, Paragon said, was in line with US policy, which calls for such spyware to only be used to assist governments in “national security missions, including counterterrorism, counter-narcotics, and counter-intelligence”.In a statement to the Guardian, a Paragon representative said the company had “a zero-tolerance policy for violations of our terms of service”. “We require all users of our technology to adhere to terms and conditions that preclude the illicit targeting of journalists and other civil society leaders,” the representative said.The company does appear to have acted swiftly in response to the cases that have emerged so far. The Guardian reported last week thatParagon had terminated its contract with Italyfor violating the terms of its contract with the group. Italy had – hours before the Guardian’s story broke – denied any knowledge of or involvement in the targeting of the journalist and activists, and said it would investigate the matter.David Kaye, who previously served from 2014 to 2020 as a special rapporteur on freedom of expression and opinion said the marketing of military-grade surveillance products, such as the kind made by Paragon, comes with “extraordinary risks of abuse”.“Like the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, it is easy for governments easily to avoid basic principles of rule of law. Though not all the details are known, we are seeing the likelihood of scandalous abuse in the case of Italy, just as we have seen that in other contexts across Europe, Mexico and elsewhere,” Kaye said.The issue seems particularly relevant in the US. In 2019, during the first Donald Trump administration, theFBI acquired a limited license to test NSO Group’s Pegasus. The FBI said the spyware was never used in a domestic investigation and there is no evidence that either the Trump or Joe Biden administrations used spyware domestically.In the face of increasing reports of abuse, including use of NSO’s spyware against American diplomats abroad, the Biden administrationput NSO on a blacklist in 2021, saying the company’s tools had enabled foreign governments to conduct transnational repression and represented a threat to national security.Biden also signed an executive order in 2023 that discouraged the use of spyware by the federal government and allowed it to be used in limited circumstances.It was therefore a surprise when it wasreported by Wiredlast year that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency had – under the Biden administration – signed a $2m one-year contract with Paragon. The contract was reportedly paused after the news became public and its current status is unclear. Ice did not respond to a request for comment.Italian founder of migrant rescue group ‘targeted with spyware’Read moreA Paragon representative said the company was “deeply committed to following all US laws and regulations” and that it was fully compliant with the 2023 executive order signed by Biden. The person also pointed out that Paragon was now a US-owned company, following its takeover by AE Industrial Partners. It also has a US subsidiary based in Virginia, which is headed by John Fleming, a longtime veteran of the CIA who serves as executive chair.Unlike its predecessor, however, the new US administration has publicly stated that it will seek to use the levers of government against Trump’sperceived political enemies. Trump has repeatedly said he would try to use the military to take on “the enemy from within”. He has also singled out career prosecutors who have investigated him, members of the military, members of Congress, intelligence agents and former officials who have been critical of him, for potential prosecution. He has never explicitly stated that he would use spyware against these perceived rivals.Researchers like those at Citizen Lab and Amnesty Tech are considered the leading experts in detecting illegitimate surveillance against members of civil society, which have occurred in a number of democracies, including India, Mexico and Hungary.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsCybercrimeIsraelWhatsAppTrump administrationDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It would be a beautiful piece of land. No big money spent.”On Sunday, the head of the UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Navi Pillay, told Politico, a news website, that Trump’s plan for the “forcible displacement of an occupied group is an international crime, and amounts to ethnic cleansing”.“There is no way under the law that Trump could carry out the threat to dislocate Palestinians from their land,” Pillay said.More than 1.5 million Palestinians and their descendants who lost their homes during the 1948 Arab–Israeli war currently live in refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpGazaUS foreign policyPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Campaigners say she was kept in solitary confinement for more than nine months before she was brought before Saudi Arabia’s specialised criminal court.She was initially sentenced to serve three years in prison for the “crime” of using a website to “cause public unrest and destabilise civil and national security”.An appeals court later handed down the new sentence– 34 years in prison followed by a 34-year travel ban – after a public prosecutor asked the court to consider other alleged crimes.Saudi snitching app appears to have been used against jailed Leeds studentRead moreThe additional charges included the allegation that al-Shehab was “assisting those who seek to cause public unrest and destabilise civil and national security by following their Twitter accounts” and by retweeting their tweets.Amnesty International said her “crime” was no more than “posting tweets in support of women’s rights”.Last Marchan open letter was signed by more than 300 academics, students and employees at Leeds Universitycalling for al-Shehab’s immediate release. It said she had been jailed “on the basis of peaceful tweets”.Al-Hathloul said al-Shehab had had a hard time in prison. “It has been difficult for her,” she said. “Not seeing her kids, not knowing whether she could complete her PhD. She was originally sentenced to six years, then it was increased to 34 years and then it was reduced to 27 years and then 4 years. It has been a nightmare really not to even be able to trust the judiciary and its decisions“She is very strong. Salma is a very brave woman. She went on hunger strike to complain about the conditions.”In June 2023 the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (UNWGAD)found her detention to be arbitrary and called for her immediate release.Al-Hathhoul said al-Shehab was not an exception. “She is symbolic of a pattern. She was released because of this pressure but many more others still remain in prison for the same charges.”The battle now was to get al-Shehab’s travel ban lifted so she could return to Leeds where she is a dental student, al-Hathhoul said.“She has a PhD to pursue. She is one of the most brilliant people in her field.”Al-Hathloul, whose sister was imprisoned for campaigning for women’s rights, saidher own family in Saudi Arabia were the subject of a travel banand it was about “making sure everyone lives in constant fear. I can’t really explain to you how much of a weight it is to have this travel ban. It is a constant threat of potential arrest. It is unbearable really, it is very heavy”.Al-Hathloul said at some point while al-Shaheb was in prison, her husband divorced her. “We don’t know all the circumstances around this but it seems like it’s a pattern … women having divorces filed against them and not being informed of it.“It means she is being released under very sad circumstances but it is better than being in prison for 34 years.”Brian Tronic of the US NGO Freedom House described al-Shehab’s case as a “grave miscarriage of justice” and echoed calls for the travel ban to be lifted.“Al-Shehab’s unjust and arbitrary punishment is emblematic of a fundamentally broken Saudi justice system, where trials are not fair, defendants have alarmingly few rights, and allegations of torture and abuse by police and prison officials are commonplace,” he said.Amnesty International’s Middle East researcher, Dana Ahmed, said al-Shehab had been in jail “just because she tweeted in support of women’s rights and retweeted Saudi women’s rights activists.”Saudi Arabia did not immediately acknowledge her release. The Saudi embassy in London has been approached for comment.The Foreign Office said it was monitoring the situation and would continue “to raise issues relating to freedom of speech and human rights all over the world”.Al-Shehab is a member of Saudi Arabia’s Shia Muslim minority, which has long complained of systemic discrimination in the Sunni-ruled kingdom.Explore more on these topicsSaudi ArabiaUniversity of LeedsXSocial mediaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Police said they had seized eight books and needed time to investigate further, including reading the books.“They took any book that had a Palestinian icon or Palestinian flag, and tried to translate it using Google Translate,” Morad Muna, brother of Mahmoud, told the Guardian. “They even took a copy of Haaretz [an Israeli newspaper] as part of the search.”View image in fullscreenA screengrab of CCTV footage of the raid.Photograph: CCTVOther books examined by the police included the artist Banksy’s Wall and Piece, Gaza in Crisis by the US academic Noam Chomsky and the Israeli scholar Ilan Pappé, and Love Wins by the Canadian film-maker and photographer Afzal Huda.Rights groups and prominent intellectuals called for the men’s immediate release, describing the arrests as part of a broader attack on Palestinian cultural identity.Protesters gathered outside the courthouse on Monday morning to support the Munas, including the Pulitzer prize-winning author Nathan Thrall, who launched his book A Day in the Life of Abed Salama at the Educational Bookshop.View image in fullscreenNathan Thrall at the protest on Monday.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian“[Israeli authorities] are creating a climate of fear for Palestinians in East Jerusalem,” he said. The arrests were particularly chilling because the bookstore was so well known, he added. “To go after someone who … has all kinds of connections in the diplomatic community and on the Israeli left, will send an even stronger message.”The family-owned shop has been at the heart of cultural life in Jerusalem for more than four decades. Its broad collection of books by Palestinian, Israeli and international authors is popular with residents and tourists, and its cafe hosts regular literary events.It has three branches – two on Salah al-Din Street, the main shopping road in East Jerusalem – which were raided on Sunday.The third is in the American Colony, a Jerusalem hotel popular for decades with visiting leaders and celebrities from Mikhail Gorbachev and Tony Blair to Bob Dylan and Uma Thurman.Diplomats from nine countries, including the UK, Brazil and Switzerland, attended the hearing. Germany’s ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, said he was “concerned”, describing himself as a regular customer of the bookshop.“I know … the Muna family, to be peace-loving proud Palestinian Jerusalemites, open for discussion and intellectual exchange. I am concerned to hear of the raid and their detention in prison,” he said in a statement on X.Mahmoud and Ahmed Muna’s lawyer lodged an appeal to the district court to demand his clients’ immediate release, but it was rejected on Monday afternoon.Nasser Oday described the detentions as an “extremely dangerous” attack on cultural life in the city and warned they would set a new legal precedent.“(The arrests are) part of a new policy followed by Israeli police in Jerusalem to suppress freedom of expression and Palestinian thought, and prevent learning and education,” he told journalists after the hearing.View image in fullscreenProtesters outside court in Jerusalem on Monday.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianHe placed the raid in a long historical line of attacks on books and education in the region, dating back at least to the 13th century Mongol attack on Baghdad.The police came about 3pm and stayed for around an hour, ransacking shelves and the stockroom, Morad Muna said. Mahmoud’s 11-year-old daughter was helping in the shop at the time, and saw her father being taken away.“They want to make us afraid. Not just us, they want to send a message to all Palestinian people,” Morad Muna said. The family decided to reopen the shops as soon as possible, and on Monday afternoon they were packed with new and long-term customers keen to show their support.“I think this is the best reaction that we can do to such a situation,” Muna added.View image in fullscreenMahmoud Muna inside a branch of the Educational Bookshop chain in July 2024.Photograph: Sally Hayden/SOPA Images/ShutterstockA police statement said “detectives encountered numerous books containing inciteful material with nationalist Palestinian themes, including a children’s colouring book titled From the River to the Sea.”View image in fullscreenThe colouring book mentioned by Israeli police in their statement.Photograph: handoutAll prosecutions relating to freedom of speech have to be approved by the attorney general’s office, but police can carry out arrests on suspicion of violations of public order on their own authority.The rights group B’Tselem called for the immediate release of the two men, and an end to the persecution of Palestinian intellectuals. “The attempt to crush the Palestinian people includes the harassment and arrest of intellectuals,” the group said in a statement. “Israel must immediately release [Mahmoud and Ahmed Muna] from detention and stop persecuting Palestinian intellectuals.”Last year policearrested and interrogatedNadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian, a leading Palestinian legal scholar based at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

That is the reason he was asked to vacate the place.”But Sheeran, who is known for performing in unexpected places, insisted later on his Instagram account that he did have permission to perform Shape of You, which was the first song to reach 3bn streams on Spotify.He wrote: “We had permission to busk, by the way.

While some areas regained electricity within hours, many households without generators remained in the dark well into the night.On social media, Sri Lankans likened the incident to a slapstick comedy, while others highlighted the fragility of Sri Lanka’s power grid. “One monkey = total chaos. Time to rethink infrastructure?” one user wrote. “Only in Sri Lanka can a monkey knock out the entire nation’s electricity,” another joked.Beyond the internet memes, the outage underscored Sri Lanka’s ongoing struggles with energy security. Experts have long warned that the country’s power grid is outdated and vulnerable to disruptions.“The national power grid is in such a weakened state that frequent island-wide power outages may be expected if there is a disturbance in one of our lines,” an unnamed senior engineer was quoted as saying by the Daily Mirror.Sri Lanka is no stranger to power shortages. In 2022, amid a deep economic crisis, rolling blackouts became a grim reality as fuel shortages forced authorities to ration electricity for up to 13 hours a day.The Ceylon Electricity Board issued an apology for the Sunday blackout but did not explain how one incident could have had such widespread repercussions. There was no word on the fate of the monkey.Monkeys have become an increasing problem in Sri Lanka due to their booming numbers. As humans encroach on forested areas, the animals raid villages in search of food and destroy crops. The endemic toque macaque is estimated to number between 2 and 3 million on the island.Explore more on these topicsSri LankaWildlifeAnimalsSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Every year, olive ridley turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) gather off India’s coast to breed. Female turtles come ashore to the beaches where they hatched to lay their own eggs, while the males remain in the water. Typically, between 100 and 150 turtles nest on Chennai’s beaches annually, so the stranding of more than 1,000 turtles is surprising, Sivakumar said.Chennai resident Rajiv Rai said he had spotted about 80 dead turtles on a 2km (1.24 mile) stretch of beach near his home. He said he alerted the state’s forest department, whose staff bury the carcasses, although the burials are now lagging.An initial necropsy of one carcass revealed lung lesions; many dead turtles had bulging eyes. Both observations indicate the turtles are likely to have died from suffocation and drowning, Yuvan Aves, a Chennai-based environmental activist said. The official postmortem report has not yet been made public.Aves said he had also observed an unusually large number of male carcasses on the beach.The reasons for the mass deaths are unclear. However, Sivakumar said both male and female turtles could have gathered near nesting beaches to breed. If there was net fishing in the area, the turtles, which need to surface to breathe, may have become entangled and drowned.If that were the case, Sivakumar said, it was difficult to say whether the turtles got caught in fishing nets near Chennai or further away, then ended up off Chennai due to winds or currents.View image in fullscreenThe carcass of an olive ridley turtle washed ashore at Marina beach in Chennai, 22 January 2025.Photograph: R Satish Babu/AFP/Getty ImagesAves said commercial fishing vessels operating in Chennai’s waters often do not abide by local laws, which was likely to have contributed to deaths. Tamil Nadu, for example, has banned trawlers within five nautical miles (9km) from shore, but the law is not typically enforced. Trawler nets must also have turtle excluder devices installed, but “notoriously, nobody has it,” Aves said.‘It’s nice to help a life to live’: meet Sri Lanka’s turtle guardiansRead moreAfter media coverage of the crisis, the Tamil Nadu governmentcaught 24 trawler boatsoperating illegally in Chennai’s waters, and has created a special taskforce in response. The government said in areleasethat a joint patrol team is now monitoring boats and ships in the area.Manish Meena, Chennai’s wildlife warden, said that “night patrols have been intensified to protect hatchlings”.The scale of death of a species that was once endangered and has only partly recovered due to conservation efforts “exceeds one’s capacity of feeling,” Aves said. “You can stand on the coast right now anywhere in Chennai and every few strides, you can see bulge-eyed turtles till the horizon.”This story was originallypublished by MongabayExplore more on these topicsMarine lifeThe age of extinctionWildlifeOceansFishingIndiaAnimalsConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t think these things are paid up quickly and the result is that residents are permanently in the red.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The signoff from a high court judge, as well as two doctors, was the centrepiece of the original legislation.I’m changing my bill to ensure people have the right to a dignified death – here’s howRead moreLeadbeater argues the new system will still offer the strongest protections compared with any other country that has legalised assisted dying, and in an amendment she will submit on Tuesday, she will set out how that signoff will be replaced by an expert panel of three, including a senior lawyer such as a king’s counsel or retired judge.Leadbeater, who had previously vowed she would not remove the “judicial element” from the bill, will propose a judge-led commission to oversee the panels and a right to have a panel’s decision reviewed by the high court. She has called the change “judge plus”.The Guardian reported last week that MPs scrutinising the bill believe a considerable number ofMPs are waveringon what they will do in the final vote – which will take place on 25 April.Senior officials in the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) were understood to have had significant concerns about the signoff from a high court judge in the original bill, given lengthy backlogs in the family courts. Two senior judges who gave evidence to MPs on the bill committee have derided thehigh court element as unnecessaryand unworkable.Writing for the Guardian, Leadbeater saidshe was responding to a wide range of evidence heard by the committee about coercive control, hinting those protections had not been strong enough.“I’m now proposing to make my bill even more robust, without making it so difficult to navigate that it would be too much of a burden for people in the last months of their lives to undertake,” she wrote.“The evidence we have heard from other jurisdictions that have already introduced tightly drawn laws like mine is that fears about vulnerable people being put under pressure to asking for an assisted death have rarely, if ever, been borne out in practice.“Family and loved ones are far more likely to try to persuade a person not to do so. But I have promised to do everything I can to ensure my bill has the strongest safeguards [of] anywhere in the world, and this change will meet that promise by making it even more robust than it was already.”Only one other country has a comparable level of scrutiny to the one proposed by Leadbeater – Spain, where requests for an assisted death must be approved by an evaluation commission. In Australia, several states also require a procedural check before an assisted death can be approved.In the US state of Oregon, often held up as a model for the UK, signoff is by two doctors and two witnesses – and referral can be made for psychological evaluation.The bill committee – which includes MPs from all parties plus two ministers – will begin line-by-line scrutiny of the bill this week. More than 300 amendments have already been submitted by dozens of MPs for the committee to consider – including several by Leadbeater.Leadbeater’s new system would mean a referral would be made by two doctors after a request from a terminally ill patient. Then the request would be considered by a panel, chaired by a retired high court judge or king’s counsel, with a psychiatrist and a social worker.The panel would be required to interrogate whether a person’s decision to end their life was a result of pressure or coercion – and whether the person had the required mental capacity to make the decision.The panel could hear from the applicant or from the doctors making the referral or anyone else relevant, the amendment will say.The two ministers on the bill committee – the care minister Stephen Kinnock and the courts minister Sarah Sackman – are neutral on the bill but officials in their departments will offer guidance on workability.MoJ officials are understood to be drafting the amendment to the bill, which will be published this week.A source close to Leadbeater said the change to the judicial element of the bill had been her own policy decision and denied it had been a government demand. They said the MoJ had been prepared to keep the high court judge as part of the package if Leadbeater had decided not to make the change.But several committee members told the Guardian last week they believed the government was uncomfortable with that aspect of the original bill.Sackman and Kinnock wrote to MPs on the committee last week, advising them that a number of amendments had been drafted and would be going down in Leadbeater’s name, which they said were “based on discussions with ministers on the bill’s deliverability and the overall coherence of the statute book”.It added: “The government remains neutral on the principle of the bill, but it is our job to ensure that any bill that passes through parliament is workable and implementable if it gains royal assent.”Leadbeater has also tabled other amendments based on concerns from MPs, which would mean doctors in England and Wales would not be permitted to raise assisted dying with patients without first explaining palliative care and other support options.The change comes amid an escalation in tensions over the bill among Labour MPs. Last week, four Labour MPs sent a mass email to colleagues rebuking Leadbeater for giving what they claimed was a one-sided view of expert evidence.In the email, the MPs said the committee’s evidence was “weighted towards voices that were known to be supportive of the bill” and criticised the lack of expert witnesses on several subjects, including coercive control.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingLabourHealth policyHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The action announced on Monday night ends exemptions granted to certain countries, and increases the duty rate on aluminum.The changes are not due to come into effect until 4 March, however, according to a White House official – raising the prospect of the Trump administration brokering deals with governments seeking reprieve. Countries including Australia have already beenmaking their case.Trumpfirst trailed his latest tariff actions on Sunday, adding that he would also announce a further set of reciprocal tariffs later in the week, drawing warnings of retaliation from trade partners.“The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America’s economic and national security,” Peter Navarro, Trump’s top trade adviser, told reporters.“This isn’t just about trade. It’s about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum.”Why Trump blinked before imposing his ‘beautiful’ tariffs on Canada and MexicoRead moreTrump and his allies, who repeatedly claimed that tariffs could “Make America great again” when fighting to regain the White House, believe that higher taxes on imported steel and aluminum will help shore up US industrial heartlands.The US president said he would announce plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on other countries over the next two days. He signed two proclamations as he spoke to reporters in the Oval Office: one ending waivers granted by Joe Biden to steel and aluminum tariffs instituted during his first term, and the other raising duties on both metals to 25%.He also raised the prospect of future US tariffs on cars, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals from markets across the world.Asked about the possibility of other countries retaliating against US tariffs, Trump said: “I don’t mind.”This latest wave of tariffs is different than the oneimposed by the White House on China last week, which hit all goods traveling from the country to the US with an additional 10% duty. He also threatened Canada and Mexico with the same blanket tariffs, at higher a rate of 25%, only toagree to a one-month delaybefore pulling the trigger.Trump signed proclamations that raised the tariff rate on aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector. His action reinstates a 25% tariff on millions of tonnes of steel imports and aluminum imports that had been entering the US duty-free under quota deals, exemptions and thousands of product exclusions.The proclamations were extensions of Trump’s 2018 section 232 national security tariffs to protect steel and aluminum makers. A White House official said the exemptions had eroded the effectiveness of these measures.What do Trump’s tariffs mean for US-China trade?Read moreAbout a quarter of steel used in the US is from overseas, with Canada, Brazil and Mexico as the top providers. South Korea, Japan and Germany are also key markets.China, hit by a 25% steel tariff during Trump’s first administration that was maintained under Joe Biden, is not a significant exporter of steel to the US. But it is the largest exporter of steel to the world, dominating the global market with typically cheaper products. Some countries then export their own steel products, at higher rates, to markets including the US.Trump’s fixation with tariffs hasalarmed economists, who have warned their imposition may derail his repeated promises to rapidly bring down prices for millions of Americans.But Trump has defended his strategy, claiming they could raise “trillions” of dollars for theUS economy– and that even the mere threat of import duties can prompt countries to bend to his will. “Tariffs are very powerful, both economically and in getting everything else you want,” he said last week.Reuters contributed to this storyExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpInternational tradeUS economyUS politicsSteel industryUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The billionaire is leading a consortium of investors that announced it had submitted a bid of $97.4bn for “all assets” of the artificial intelligence company to OpenAI’s board of directors.The startup, which operates ChatGPT, has been working to restructure itself away from its original non-profit status. OpenAI also operates a for-profit subsidiary, and Musk’s unsolicited offer could complicate the company’s plans. TheWall Street Journalfirst reported the proposed bid.“If Sam Altman and the presentOpenAI, Inc. Board of Directors are intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away from it: control over the most transformative technology of our time,” said Marc Toberoff, the attorney representing the investors.Altman posted his reaction onXshortly after the news broke, saying, “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.” Musk famously bought Twitter in 2022 for $44bn and renamed it X. Musk responded to that post, saying, “Swindler.”Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI but left the company in 2019 and started his own AI company called xAI. Over the past several years, he’s tussled with Altman over the direction of the company. He sued OpenAI over the company’s re-structuring plans last year, dropped the suit, then re-filed it.The bid is backed by xAI and several investment firms, including one run by Joe Lonsdale, who co-founded the stealth government contractor Palantir. Ari Emanuel, who’s the CEO of the entertainment company Endeavor, has also joined the group through his investment fund.“At x.AI, we live by the values I was promised OpenAI would follow. We’ve made Grok open source, and we respect the rights of content creators,” Musk said in a statement. “It’s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was. We will make sure that happens.”Toberoff told the Wall Street Journal that Musk’s consortium of investors is ready to match or go higher than any other bids on OpenAI that may arise.OpenAI has maintained that its restructuring is essential to the longevity of the company and being able to access capital. It has said that if it keeps its non-profit structure as is, it won’t be able to keep up in the highly competitive world of AI innovation. OpenAI said it plans for the restructuring to be done by 2026.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The secretaries specifically called into questionElon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, and the appointees that Musk has installed within agencies, including the treasury department.“While the significant privacy, cybersecurity and national security threats are gravely concerning, the constitutional issues are perhaps even more alarming,” the former secretaries wrote. “We take the extraordinary step of writing this piece because we are alarmed about the risks of arbitrary and capricious political control of federal payments, which would be unlawful and corrosive to our democracy.”Trump tells treasury to end ‘wasteful’ production of penniesRead moreThe secretaries warned that the payment system’s “critical infrastructure” was at risk of failure if the code that underwrites it was “not handled with due care”.The op-ed’s authors are Robert Rubin, Lawrence Summers,Timothy Geithner, Jacob Lew and Janet Yellen – all former treasury secretaries who served under Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden.SinceDonald Trumphas taken office, the president has given Musk complete freedom to carry out his plans to purge what Musk sees as government waste.This has wreaked chaos in Washington, where federal employees weregiven offers of buyoutsand warned that they could be at risk of layoffs, all federal grants and loanswere frozenand Dogeattempted to shut downUSAid, the federal agency that is responsible for distributing global humanitarian aid.So far, many of Doge’s attempts at overhauling the federal government have been temporarilyblockedbymultiple federal judges, making the future viability of Musk’s plans unclear.Musk has also come under criticism for trying to give people who have worked for his private companies, including Tesla, the Boring Company and xAI,rolesin the federal government that include access to sensitive data, including social security numbers and bank account information for many Americans.Steve Davis, Musk’s longtime lieutenant and the current president of the Boring Company, has been trying to help Musk get rid ofUSAid. Meanwhile, Amanda Scales, another former Musk employee, was appointed chief of staff of the office of personnel management, the federal government’s human resources arm. Musk also reportedly hired agroup of engineersfresh out of high school and college toaid his takeover.Trump largely seems to be content with Musk’s action, telling reporters on 7 February that Musk was “doing a great job” and was “finding tremendous fraud and corruption and waste”.While the former treasury secretaries do not mention Musk by name, they argue that Doge’s actions have been unconstitutional, as the role of the executive branch is to carry out laws that were passed in Congress.Tracking Trump – updates on the presidency’s first 100 daysRead more“The legislative branch has the sole authority to pass laws that determine where and how federal dollars are spent,” they wrote. “It is not for the Treasury Department or the administration to decide which of our congressionally approved commitments to fulfill and which to cast aside.”They noted that millions of Americans depend on the treasury department’s “faithful disbursement of federal funds”, including social security checks, veteran benefits, payments to Medicare providers and the salaries of federal workers.Disruption of payments would cause a “breach of trust” among Americans and would amount to a “form of default”, they wrote, noting that “our credibility, once lost, will prove difficult to regain”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsUS economyEconomicsElon MuskJanet YellenNew York TimesnewsShareReuse this content"

The entrepreneur has joined a list that includes the pharmaceuticals fraudsterMartin ShkreliandFTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison.The strength of the Forbes “curse” will be tested this week in New York as Javice, 31, goes on trial on four counts of fraud relating to the $175m (£141m) sale of Frank, a student financial aid application assistance company she founded aged 24, to JP Morgan Chase. The deal quickly soured, and has descended into a legal wrangle that has been compared to the case ofTheranos founder Elizabeth Holmes.Frank’s premise was simple – to help steer students through the complexity of applying for student loans. In 2021, four years after the New Yorker started the business, she sold up toJP Morgan. She was installed as JP Morgan’s head of student solutions, was paid a $300,000 annual salary and pocketed $21m in stock proceeds, and was awarded a $20m retention bonus.30 under 30-year sentences: why so many of Forbes’ young heroes face jailRead moreJust over a year later, the banking company sued her, claiming that the database of users reported by Frank was largely a fabrication. In 2023, federal prosecutors filed criminal charges accusing Javice of repeatedly making up claims that Frank had lined up 4.25 million student customers, when in fact she had data for only about 300,000, to “fraudulently induce” the bank to buy the company.The government contends that Javice had first asked Frank’s director of engineering to create an artificially generated, or synthetic, dataset of the company’s users. When the director questioned the legality of the request, her co-defendant Olivier Amar said: “Yes, it’s legal. We don’t want to end up in orange jumpsuits.”According to the indictment,JP Morgan discovered the alleged fraud after receiving only a few responses when it emailed out new customer marketing materials to Frank’s list of names. After Javice was fired she sued JP Morgan for legal expenses related to an internal investigation and for letting her go soon before she was eligible for the $20m retention bonus.Jamie Dimon, the JP Morgan chief executive and one of the world’s most powerful bankers, later described the acquisition of the financial wellness platform as a “huge mistake”. In early 2023, JP Morgan shut Frank down.The criminal case now coming before a jury carries echoes of the prosecution of Holmes, whose Silicon Valley startup claimed to perform hundreds of blood tests using a pinprick of blood. Holmes is serving an 11-year prison sentence for defrauding investors.Javice’s case is also reminiscent of the failed prosecution of the British tech tycoon Mike Lynch –who died along with his daughter Hannah and four other passengers, in a tragic boating accident last summer– on fraud charges in connection with the $11.1bn acquisition of Autonomy by Hewlett-Packard in 2011. HP is continuing the lawsuit against Lynch’s estate.In all three cases, competing claims of fraud and buyers’ remorse run alongside civil and criminal actions.But last week, the US district trial judge, Alvin Hellerstein, ruled that prosecutors could not introduce a pair of WhatsApp messages between Javice and Amar, in which JavicedescribedHolmes’s defrauded investors as “sophisticated assholes”, and that “investors should be blamed”.“Investors should be blamed on letting a 19-year-old go rogue,” Javice commiserated with Amar in the messages, referring to Holmes.Juda Engelmayer, a spokesperson for Javice, said the only similarities with Holmes are that both are “young, good-looking and savvy, and that’s the only comparison”.“This is a case of due diligence. JP Morgan knew what they were getting into and buyer’s remorse once they got into it. There was no misrepresentation because there’s a difference between people who passed through the website and people who actually signed on to the website to get information.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They weren’t going into [it] for altruistic reasons to help young people get student loans,” Engelmayer added.According to the governance expert Charles Elson, JP Morgan had a due diligence obligation to look before leaping into the deal. “Either they did their due diligence and the truth was hidden from them, or they may have done their due diligence, and were given full access to the open and honest books but interpreted the results wrong,” he said.At a pretrial hearing, prosecutors revealed that Amar plans to testify against Javice at trial and will argue that she “concealed information and deceived him”.According to prosecutors, Javice contends that this turns Amar into a“second prosecutor”, and requested that the trials be separated. Javice’s attorneys have also petitioned against a pause ina separate Securities and Exchange Commission’s civil lawsuit,claiming that a delay deprives her of “exculpatory evidence”.Outside the legal framework, the trial may provide, as the FTX case did, further insights into the go-go nature of tech entrepreneurship which had emerged when the business was founded. Javice and Amar had raised $20m from investors including Marc Rowan, a co-founder and the chief executive of Apollo Global Management and Gingerbread Capital, a firm specialising in female-led businesses.Javice told Business Insiderin 2021 that she divided her time between Miami and New York, starting her days with a run and a pilates class and ending them with sunset yoga and a swim. She would often take a mid-afternoon screen break to “go out into the wild” to ask people about their student loans, she said.“If you see an opportunity, don’t be afraid to jump,” she said. “My impatience to achieve my goals helped me see past that ‘conventional wisdom’ to take a risk that landed me where I am today.”In November 2022, Javice was on theForbes 30 Under 30list, and a year later, the magazine placed her into its “Hall of Shame”.Explore more on these topicsEntrepreneursJP MorganBankingTechnology sectorSmall businessCorporate governanceLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Sustainable development of the technology would be on the agenda, she added.The general secretary of the UNI Global Union, Christy Hoffman, warned that without worker involvement in the use of AI, the technology risked increasing inequality. The UNI represents about 20 million workers worldwide in industries including retail, finance and entertainment.“Without worker representation, AI-driven productivity gains risk turning the technology into yet another engine of inequality, further straining our democracies,” she told attenders.On Sunday, Macron promoted the event by posting a montage ofdeepfake images of himself on Instagram, including a video of “him” dancing in a disco with various 1980s hairstyles, in a tongue-in-cheek reference to the technology’s capabilities.View image in fullscreenMacron deepfakes on Instagram.Composite: Instagram/Guardian CompositeAlthough safety has been downplayed on the conference agenda, some in attendance were concerned about the pace of development.Max Tegmark, the scientist behind a 2023 letter calling for a pause in producing powerful AI systems, cautioned that governments and tech companies were inadvertently re-enacting the ending of the Netflix climate crisis satireDon’t Look Up.The film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence uses a looming comet, and the refusal by the political and media establishment to acknowledge the existential threat, as a metaphor for the climate emergency – with the meteor ultimately wiping out the planet.“I feel like I have been living that movie,” Tegmark told the Guardian in an interview. “But now it feels l like we‘ve reached the part of the film where you can see the asteroid in the sky. And people are still saying that it doesn’t exist. It really feels like life imitating art.”Tegmark said the promising work at the inaugural summit at Bletchley Park in the UK in November 2023 had been partly undone. “Basically, asteroid denial is back in full swing,” he said.The Paris gathering has been badged as the AI action summit,whereas its UK cousinwas the AI safety summit. Macron is co-chairing the summit with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The US vice-president, JD Vance, and Chinese vice-premier, Zhang Guoqing, are among the other political attenders, although the UK prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, isnot attending.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Estimates of when, and if, AGI will be reached vary but Tegmark said based on statements from industry figures “the asteroid is going to strike … somewhere between one and five years from now.Developments in AI have accelerated since 2023, with theemergence of so-called reasoning modelspushing the capabilities of systems even further. The release of a freely available reasoning model by the Chinese company DeepSeek has also intensified the competitive rivalry between China and the US, which has led AI breakthroughs.The head of Google’s AI efforts, Demis Hassabis, said on Sunday the tech industry was “perhaps five years away” from achieving AGI and safety conversations needed to continue. “Society needs to get ready for that and … the implications that will have.”Speaking in Paris before the summit, Hassabis added that AGI carried “inherent risk”, particularly in the field of autonomous “agents”, which carry out tasks without human intervention, but those concerns could be assuaged.“I’m a big believer in human ingenuity. I think if we put the best brains on it, and with enough time and enough care … then I think we’ll get it right.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingClimate crisisFranceWork & careersEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Trump said in his inauguration address thatthe US will “drill, baby, drill”for oil and gas under his leadership.“I have a good friend on the other side of the ocean saying ‘drill, baby, drill.’ Here, there is no need to drill. It’s plug, baby, plug. Electricity is available,” he said on Monday.Macron added that a European AI strategy, to be unveiled by the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, on Tuesday, would be a “unique opportunity forEuropeto accelerate” in the technology.View image in fullscreenMacron (centre) and European leaders pose during a meeting as part of the Paris AI Action Summit.Photograph: Teresa Suárez/EPA“We have to provide a bigger domestic market to all the startups when they start as Europeans,” he said.Criticism of a draft communique has threatened to overshadow the summit’s final day on Tuesday, when Macron will be joined by von der Leyen as well as the US vice-president, JD Vance, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. Keir Starmeris not attending.With the US reportedly unhappy about the wording, which includes phrases such as “sustainable and inclusive AI”,Politico reportedon Monday that the UK was also minded not to sign the communique.Speaking inParis, the UK tech secretary, Peter Kyle, said the government was “in negotiations” over the statement but “that’s something we don’t comment on while the negotiations unfold”.A government source said they hoped the negotiations would get to a place over the course of the summit where the UK could sign the declaration and said there was still a considerable amount of time left to have those discussions.But the source suggested that the UK was prepared to walk away, saying the joint declaration had to be “squarely in British interests” or it would not get its backing. “We always want to get to a place of agreement but it needs to work for the UK,” they said.View image in fullscreenMacron talks at the event held in the Grand Palais in Paris.Photograph: Mohammed Badra/EPAThe draft statement, seen by the Guardian, also refers to AI technology that is “human rights based, human-centric, ethical, safe, secure and trustworthy”. It places much less emphasis on safetythan the declaration at the inaugural AI summit, held in the UK in 2023, which pointed to the technology’s potential to cause “catastrophic” harm.Max Tegmark,a leading voice in AI safety, urged countries to shun the statement if it was not amended, saying that its lack of focus on risks from powerful AI systems was a “recipe for disaster”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Centuries later her story is a novelRead moreThe PBO costings flagged several “uncertainties” with the costings, including the potential for billionaires to deploy “sophisticated strategies” to reduce their wealth liability, thus reducing the amount of revenue raised.Billionaires could also launch legal challenges to the tax or reduce investment in Australia, the PBO warned.The Greens will push on regardless, viewing the prospect of a hung parliament after the next election as a “once-in-a-generation” chance to legislate a billionaires tax.Labor and the Coalition rejectedthe Greens’ other Robin Hood-style taxes on gas companies and corporate super profits announced last year.The Greens are aiming to hold the balance of power in a hung parliament and remain optimistic about their prospects of picking up seats despite another poor electoral showing –this time at the Prahran byelection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Late in the third quarter, the Eagles held a 34-0 lead, the largest lead in aSuper Bowlsince 2014. The Eagles were dunking Gatorade on their head coach Nick Sirianni while the Chiefs were still trying to find a way into the game.

The quarterback who routinely pulls off the unthinkable had led his team into a 10-0 ditch.

He took the snap, scrambled to his right to evade pressure, and then threw across his body into thewaiting hands of Eagles corner Cooper DeJean, who returned the ball for a touchdown. That made it 17-0 to the Eagles; the refs may as well have called ballgame.The Chiefs could never get rolling on offense. By the end of the first half, they had run only 20 plays and gained 23 yards – the kind of distance Mahomes usually gets on a single throw. Mahomes hit on just six of his 14 pass attempts, and the team struggled to cross midfield. The Eagles drained the clock, put together long scoring drives, then quickly won the ball back as the Chiefs offense imploded. AsKendrick Lamar was taking a dig at Drake, the Chiefs were less concerned with their three-peat as scraping together three points.This was a game decided in the trenches, as Super Bowls often are. The Eagles shattered the Chiefs’ offensive line and the ripple effect swallowed everyone and everything in Andy Reid’s offense, including Mahomes. Scared of running the ball against Philly’s enormous defensive front, Reid bailed on the rushing game altogether. That left the ball in Mahomes’ hands, facing a hellacious Eagles pass rush that sacked the quarterback six times and pressured him on over half of his dropbacks. The pressure came quickly and was sustained. On every play, it felt like two or three Eagles were greeting Mahomes in the backfield. For large chunks of the game, it was as if the Eagles’ defense had 15 players on the field. The pass-rushers came in all shapes and attacked from all angles, forcing Mahomes to scramble around for his life.The Eagles pass-rush was the story of the game, but Mahomes should not be absolved of blame. He turned down throws, moved into pressure and made panicked decisions in key spots. From the first drive, he looked skittish, as though he knew his offensive line wouldn’t be able to hold. By the second quarter, his fears confirmed, he looked downright lost, tossing up wayward picks to Zack Baun and DeJean. Rarely has Mahomes, typically the coolest guy in the building on the biggest stage, looked so frazzled. He ended the game with three turnovers, including a strip-sack on the first play after the Chiefs had scored their first touchdown to cut the Eagles lead to 37-6.The seeds for this defeat were planted all year. When they needed to raise their game most, season-long concerns came back to bite the Chiefs: the flaky offensive line, the one-dimensional offense, the lack of a vertical passing game and a slow, ineffective Travis Kelce.View image in fullscreenPatrick Mahomes leaves the field after Sunday’s loss.Photograph: Abbie Parr/APAnd it’s not as if the team’s defense did not hold their side of the bargain. They slowed Saquon Barkley and the Eagles all-conquering run game down early and often, forcing quarterback Jalen Hurts into tough, clutch third-down throws to keep the Eagles ticking along. It was the Chiefs’ offense that was their undoing – for what is only the second time during their five Super Bowl trips in six seasons. They could not put sustained drives together or bank on Mahomes to cover up for struggles elsewhere, as he has so often before.Entering Sunday, the Chiefs were hardly a free-rolling contender. Of all their Super Bowl teams, this was the most flawed. But they were able to cover up deficiencies with masterful coaching, high-end talent and their quarterback always finding a way.The Chiefs relied on eking out tight,one-score games this season.They entered Sunday winning 17 one-score games in a row and had ripped off 12 come-from-behind, one-score wins.Was it skill or luck?When teams close out tight victories, we like to ascribe them all kinds of virtues. They wanted it more. They’re smarter. Mahomes is magic in the clutch. Two of those, with the Chiefs at least, are true. But there was plenty of luck along the way for the Chiefs this year: A blocked punt to end a game against the Denver Broncos, some favorable flags against the Cincinnati Bengals and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.The talent and luck ran out in Louisiana.This, ultimately, will be remembered as Mahomes’ most significant defeat. It feels almost cruel that one game will take on such outsized importance in the arc of his career. But when you’re chasing the ghost of Tom Brady, being waxed in a Super Bowl matters. This isn’t Mahomes’ first blowout defeat in the final game of the season; he has now quarterbacked two teams in the last five years to lose by more than 20 points. The defeat on Sunday was shockingly similar to thedefeat to Tampa in Super Bowl LV. In both a four-man pass-rush smothered Mahomes, he panicked, and made ill-considered decisions. Mahomes has three rings to Brady’s seven. But Brady, calling the game rather than playing it these days has opened up further distance on his chief rival for GOAT status. Brady’s three Super Bowl losses with the Patriots came by a combined losing margin of 16 points. Mahomes is up to a combined losing margin of 40 in his two defeats.After Mahomes got clobbered in the Chiefs’ first Super Bowl loss, general manager Brett Veach raced down to the field to tell Mahomes he would not let the quarterback get wrecked in a pivotal game again. He asked Mahomes to trust him, that he would rebuild the team’s offensive line so that the quarterback always had a chance. That rebuild lasted for two seasons. Now, Mahomes will have to trust Veach to again reboot his offensive line in the offseason, to give the Chiefs and their quarterback a chance to put right a crushing loss.And the Chiefs should expect to be back. For all the concerns along the offensive line and offense in general, the Chiefs have a ton of young talent. Outside Kelce, all the key architects of their dynastic run are expected to return. They still have the best coaching staff in the league. They defense is still loaded with talent. And they still have Mahomes.So, the Chiefs and Mahomes may well make it back to the big dance next season. But this loss will be etched into their legacy. The potential three-peaters did clinch immortality, in a sense, but in a way that will scar their dynastic run.Explore more on these topicsPatrick MahomesNFLUS sportsSuper BowlKansas City ChiefsPhiladelphia EaglesSuper Bowl LIXfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they have succeeded by challenging outdated ways of thinkingAndrew Lawrencein New OrleansMon 10 Feb 2025 12.39 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 20.04 ESTShareBy now, those who watched Sunday’sSuper Bowlhave most likely forgotten about the house ads promoting racial and cultural unity. That’s no doubt because a much stronger statement was delivered midway through the second quarter when a pass by theKansas City Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes was intercepted and returned for an touchdown by Philadelphia’s Cooper DeJean.DeJean, the first white player to start at cornerback in a Super Bowl in 24 years, has cheekily been described by media figures such as Bomani Jones as the league’s ultimate DEI hire. But while those comments have been made with tongues firmly planted in cheeks, there is some merit in describingthe Eagles’ victoryas a win for diversity, equity and inclusion – something that suddenly finds itself under attack in America.After all, Super Bowl LIX was never going to be just a game, not with the cultural storm brewing around the contest – not least Kendrick Lamar’spolitically charged half-time show. But no force carried more momentum than the Chiefs coming into Sunday. They weren’t just playing for a third successive championship. They were carrying the mantle of America’s team in the second era of Donald Trump, who became the first sitting US president to attend a Super Bowl. At the same time,the NFL removedits longstanding antiracism slogans from the field, perhaps fearing Trump – who left the game early – would make it into yet another DEI issue to grandstand about.Philadelphia Eagles fans celebrate in style after Super Bowl win – in picturesRead moreThere was no question which team the president came to see in New Orleans. Mahomes’smother and brother took pictures with Trump. In the week before the game, the Chiefs’ star tight end Travis Kelcegushed about playingin front of the president despite Trump once writing in all caps that he hated the player’s girlfriend, Taylor Swift, after she threw her support behind Kamala Harris in the presidential election. (During the game he shared video of Swiftbeing booed.) Trump picked Kansas City to three-peat, called Mahomes “a winner” and referred to his wife,accurately, as a “Maga fan.” Trump praised Chiefs fans for voting for him “in record numbers,” even though polling data shows Harrisreceived substantially more votesin Kansas City’s more populous Missouri counties. And yet: from their wantonly offensivetomahawk chop cheerto the kicker who isbesties with Maga senator Josh Hawleyto the fact that the team playsin red, the Chiefs couldn’t appear in more lockstep with a Maga movement that’s hellbent on erasing 60 years of DEI gains. So it’s fitting that the most forceful rejection of this new political normal would come from Philadelphia, a city that hasn’t voted for a Republican presidentsince 1932.Philly sports fans don’t bow down to authority. They buck it.They (allegedly) booed Santa Clausand throw batteries at players they don’t like, whether on the opposite side or on theirs. They’re righteous in their loyalty and committed to their freedom of expression. They flooded downtown streets after the Eagles booked their Super Bowl ticket and climbed light poles that the city greased in advance to deter them. Dressed in their greenest finery on Sunday, Eagles fans descended on downtown New Orleans in the tens of thousands to boo the president, boo Mahomes and bear witness to a football insurrection. That the Eagles happen to be among the most diverse, equitable and inclusive teams in sports just made their upset all the sweeter.DEI is integral to the Eagles, an equal opportunity destroyer of dynasties. They enjoy doing things differently: seven years ago they stopped the New England Patriots from winning a second successive championship partly thanks to a trick play with abackupquarterback who caught the decisive pass. The team’s owner, Jeffrey Lurie, recently produced a film about an undocumented immigrant artist,a story he saidhe was “proud” to portray on screen. After lifting the Lombardi Trophy on Sunday, Lurie made a point of shouting out 200-plus members of the Eagles “support staff you’ll never hear about”. Among them isAutumn Lockwood, an Eagles performance guru who joined the team in 2023, becoming the first Black woman ever to be part of a Super Bowl-winning coaching staff.View image in fullscreenJalen Hurts was named MVP of Sunday’s Super Bowl.Photograph: Mark J Rebilas/USA Today SportsThe DEI – as many joke – cuts both ways. For the better part of two decadesno NFL team featured a white cornerback, as white prospects have historically been stereotyped as too slow and clumsy to play a position that requires lightning speed and agility. But then last year the Eagles bucked convention and drafted DeJean out of Iowa, where he ranked among college football’s most outstanding defenders. By midseason DeJean emerged in the Eagles starting lineup along with safety Reed Blankenship, Philadelphia’s other white defensive back. Any time they make a big play fans cheer the Eagles’ “Exciting Whites,” nodding at the meme photograph of asupermarket wine section signof the same name. DeJean and Blankenship’s suffocating coverage in the Super Bowl was part of a bruising effort that yielded arguably Mahomes’s worst performance as a pro to date. His two garbage-time touchdowns may have raised his final numbers,but they won’t erase the stain.But in the grand scheme, Jalen Hurts is the finest example of the Eagles discarding old ways of thinking. He is a two-time college national champion and Heisman trophy finalist whom many pundits nonetheless believed was unqualified for the job of NFL quarterback. Some experts believed he might be better suited to play running back or receiver, positions Black quarterbacks have been pushed into in the past by talent evaluators who wrongheadedly mistook their athleticism for alack of intelligence. Those same experts continued questioning Hurts’s credentials and ability when he replaced franchise quarterback Carson Wentz, who is white and now Mahomes’s backup on the Chiefs. Race aside, they considered Hurts to be vastly inferior to Mahomes even though he nearly beat him in the Super Bowl two years earlier. The kicker: Hurts entrusted his business affairs to a management teamled entirely by women– and they promptly landed him the richest contract in NFL history at the time he signed it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the image didn’t figure to haunt him for much longer on Sunday. After DeJean’s interception, Hurts threw a touchdown pass to AJ Brown that gave the Eagles a 24-0 lead at halftime. In the third quarter, Hurts connected with DeVonta Smith on a beautiful long pass that pushed the advantage to 34-0. In the end, Hurts’s performance wasn’t as dynamic as it had been two years ago, but it was impressive enough for the Eagles to pull him from the blowout with three minutes left to play so his backup could take the remaining snaps. “I can’t control what these people think,” Hurts said after being voted the game’s MVP. “But if it takes all the hate and all the scrutiny and all the different opinions for me to be a world champion, then keep it coming.”At a time when the guardrailsaround democracy appear to be warpingand snapping under the strain to make DEIthe enemy of everything, the Eagles provide a heartening lesson in resistance. They didn’t give into a script that called for them to acquiesce in advance. They didn’t complain about the game being rigged. They just rolled up their sleeves and administered a good ol’ fashion Broad Street beatdown in front of the world. And when they take over the streets again to parade their championship team through their city with Eagles fans reveling in their rebel spirit, it shouldn’t be soon forgotten that it was DEI that did this, too.Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia EaglesSuper BowlNFLSuper Bowl LIXUS sportsShareReuse this content"

León has since denied touching Caracas’s crotch or having any intention to do so.“During the match, FC Barcelona player María Pilar León, while jostling with Daniela Caracas, made a gesture with her hand that violated the intimacy of our player,” Espanyol said on Monday in a statement.“Although Caracas was unable to react at the time due to the impact of the situation, later, after assimilating what had happened, she became aware of the seriousness of the gesture, but chose not to react angrily in order to avoid a disciplinary sanction that would harm the team.”In a statement released via Barcelona’s website later on Monday, León, 29, said: “At no time did I, nor was it my intention, infringe upon the intimacy of my fellow professional Daniela Caracas.“As the images show, it was part of a playing action in which she deliberately touches me and I touch her leg saying in reaction to the clash: “what’s up with you”. There is NO contact with her private parts, and certainly no intention. I insist, it was just part of the game that does not warrant the importance that has been attached to it.“The idea of touching the private parts of a colleague would never enter my head, it goes against my principles and I would never do such a thing.”As part of their statement Espanyol condemned “any act that threatens the integrity of footballers on the field” and said they “hope these types of situations are treated with the seriousness they deserve”. The club added that they have made their legal services available to Caracas “in the event that she wish to take legal action”.Since the incident Caracas, 27, has been subject to abuse on social media from “hundreds of profiles”, according to Espanyol, who expressed their concern that media attention of the incident had been “diverted to other issues unrelated to the seriousness of the action”. The statement continued: “We would like to express our rejection of any form of violence, whether physical or verbal, in the world of football.”León said: “I condemn the harassment that Daniela appears to have been suffering on social networks, which has nothing to do with me, and I offer her my most sincere support.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A seriously impressive defence, it was just a pity they weren’t playing. Instead, Marcelo was there so they could pay homage to the full-back, who won 25 trophies with the club, in the week he announced his retirement. The other four had come to join him and support their teammates. None were dressed in white; all are injured.All of which would be bad enough, but it was about to get worse. The following afternoon, having been named in the squad to travel to Manchester, the captain pulled out too. In the past fortnight Lucas Vázquez had missed visits to Valladolid and Leganés as a precaution but eventually he too fell, calling from home after Sunday’s training session to say something wasn’t right in his thigh. He was the backup, a midfielder at full-back, albeit one who has played there for so long now that it has become his default role. There have been 36 injuries at Madrid this season, 26 of them muscular.Real Madrid v Manchester City ‘seems like a clásico’ now, says Carlo AncelottiRead moreThere had been something emotional in the way Carlo Ancelotti talked about those pre-match moments, something vindicatory too. In welcoming his injured players into the dressing room, he had drawn a conclusion and put together a defence of his own. “Before the game I saw Carvajal, Alaba, Militão and Rüdiger greeting their teammates; despite the difficulties we’re doing very well,” he said. By the end of the match, which ended 1-1, Madrid were still top, they are in the semi-final of the Copa del Rey, and they qualified for theChampions Leagueplayoffs, which certainly isn’t bad,considering.Ancelotti has called this a “total emergency”. When he comes to select his defence to faceManchester Cityat the Etihad, he will have two left-backs: Fran García and Ferland Mendy. Apart from that, he only has one actual defender: Raúl Asencio, a 21-year-old academy product in his debut season in the first team, for whom he has already played 19 games.That is according to the coach, anyway. In fact, Ancelotti also has Jesús Vallejo, the strange case of the central defender included in every squad, who sits on the bench every game but never comes on and doesn’t get mentioned by his manager. Vallejo has played once all season, coming on by popular and frankly tongue-in-cheek demand against Alavés with the team 3-0 up in a game they almost let slip, eventually winning 3-2. Before that he hadn’t played for Madrid since a brief, successful cameo at the Etihad two seasons earlier.View image in fullscreenAurélien Tchouaméni has been deployed at centre-back during Real’s defensive injury crisis.Photograph: Rubén Albarrán/ShutterstockThen there is Aurélien Tchouaméni, the central midfielder at centre-back, where he has played 14 of his 29 matches. Two more academy players have also been called up: Jacobo Ramón, who has played twice this season, and Lorenzo Aguado, who has made three appearances as a substitute but is still unlikely to play at right‑back. That will almost certainly be another midfielder: the Uruguayan Fede Valverde. The problem there is not so much having Valverde at full-back asnothaving him in midfield.Seen from Ancelotti’s position particularly – aware he is always the weakest link, the first to fall, and having to manage upwards as well as downwards – it is not surprising he says Madrid are doing well. He knows that not everyone sees it like that – which is one of the reasons why he says so. Last season Madrid lost only twice all year, both times to Atlético; this season, they have lost seven times already. When it has come to the big games, the best opponents, they have not won, and often not competed as they should.OnlyDortmund have been defeated, which took a wild comeback in the second half after a dreadful first, and do they still count? Barcelona put nine past them in two games. Athletic beat them at San Mamés. Liverpool overran them. Milan were superior at the Santiago Bernabéu. They drew both derbies with Atlético. And now they have City.It doesn’t get bigger: these sides have met four times in the past five seasons and on three of those occasions the winner has lifted the trophy. That is the theory, at least. But the fact they are playing each other at all tells a story too. Madrid have been beaten three times in the Champions League. Ancelotti said he would have preferred City to have been knocked out, to have avoided them, saying: “We don’t like it.” If the good news is that City are even worse, that is of limited comfort.This is not solely about injuries, though Ancelotti will look at that list and wish they could have been spread around the pitch. He would probably have preferred to lose a forward than rack up all the absentees in defence. Kylian Mbappé, Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo and Jude Bellingham have scored more than 60 goals between them. After a difficult start, Mbappé has been superb – he collected the award for January’s player of the month on Saturday and has 13 goals in 14 games – and Rodrygo has been outstanding, scoring seven and providing four since the turn of the year.View image in fullscreenReal Madrid players celebrate at the end of their Champions League semi-final win, 6-5 on aggregate, against Manchester City at the Bernabéu in 2022.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APBut the balance has been difficult. Structurally Madrid have suffered. For all those goals and recent improvements, the suspicion remains that against the best it is not enough. At times there has been a kind of 4-2-4, a gap opening in the middle. That makes Tchouaméni’s move to defence, instead of a protective role in front, significant. It makes Valverde playing at full-back even more significant; if there is a player that can cover those wide spaces, plugging endless gaps, it is him. It also leaves Madrid with few central midfield options: Dani Ceballos, Luka Modric and Eduardo Camavinga, who is returning from injury.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIt has been hard to avoid the feeling that the coach would prefer to add an extra man, or men, in midfield as he continues to seek a solution. He would also like to maintain the talent on the pitch, which is both politically expedient and, well, these are the players that win you games. Why would you leave out footballers this good? Madrid may have the three best players in the world. Nor has the alternative always worked: a midfield four didn’t help at Anfield; at San Mamés, Vinícius was missing but still Athletic poured through them.Earlier in the season, criticised for a lack of control, Ancelotti said he preferred a bit of rock and roll. In a straight fight, an open match with both teams slugging it out, Madrid would assume they have an advantage. When they are under pressure, history shows they can still land the key blow, especially against City. If, that is, they can defend themselves – and that has been Ancelotti’s obsession, both publicly and privately, all season.Containing Real Madrid’s stellar attack ‘impossible’ for whole tie, says GuardiolaRead moreAt the end of the derby, Ancelotti was asked what lessons he could take into the City game. “That the formula can work,” he said. The first half had been poor but the second was much improved; at half-time he had warned them that either they do what they had agreed or he would start hauling players off, whoever they were. He had created four lines, with Bellingham shifted left and Rodrygo right, at least without the ball. Vinícius and Mbappé had been left up front although Ancelotti spent much of the game shouting for the Brazilian to go wide, not inside, and insisted afterwards they had helped press.For Ancelotti the question is more basic. From the very start of the season he has been uneasy; on the opening night he said he felt they lacked commitment, work rate and sacrifice. Although he has been cautious in how he expresses it, that concern remains and is occasionally voiced. But it is natural to hold on to the idea that the message will get through or that this is an issue that solves itself, fixed by the sheer size of the game, its importance, the motivation. If there is a moment to run, to sacrifice, it is in Manchester. If there is a time for the talent to show, that time is now.“I don’t have the idea of seeking balance by taking off one, two, three, four forwards,” Ancelotti said. “I put on four midfielders, I seek balance, I press more … but I don’t score 60 goals. Simple.”Explore more on these topicsReal MadridManchester CityChampions LeagueEuropean club footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

She told the Associated Press last month that her injury was “a millimeter from pretty catastrophic.”Shiffrin also had a high-speed crash in a downhill race in Italy last season that kept her out for six weeks. She has discussed her fears with a psychologist, said Megan Harrod, Shiffrin’s spokeswoman.On Instagram, Shiffrin wrote: “Honestly, I really didn’t anticipate experiencing so much of this kind of mental/PTSD struggle in GS from my injury.”Shiffrin won gold in giant slalom at the last worlds in France two years agoThe women’s giant slalom at the worlds is scheduled for Thursday and Shiffrin said it was “soul crushing” not to be able to defend her title.“Two years ago I was at my top level I’ve ever skied in GS. It was the most fun I ever had skiing GS,” Shiffrin said. “To be here now and not even be able to start, that’s pretty heartbreaking.”Shiffrin returned to action last month when she placed 10th in a slalom in Courchevel, France, and is still planning to race the slalom – her best event – at worlds on Saturday. The speeds in slalom are lower than those in giant slalom, so risks of injury are not as high.By abandoning the giant slalom, Shiffrin has decided to enter the new team combined event at worlds on Tuesday and will pair with freshly crowneddownhill gold medalist Breezy Johnson. The combined event entails one racer competing in a downhill run and another in a slalom run, with their two times added up to determine the final results.“I’m not at full capacity, not in giant slalom and not in slalom either,” Shiffrin said. “But I feel good enough in slalom.”The other US teams for the event are super-G bronze medalist Lauren Macuga and Paula Moltzan; Lindsey Vonn and AJ Hurt; and Jacqueline Wiles and Katie Hensien.Vonn had campaigned to race with Shiffrin in a “dream team” featuring the two most successful female World Cup skiers of all time. But the US coaching staff selected the pairings based on “season-best results” in both events.“Why am I not surprised?” Vonn wrote on the social media platform X with a shrug emoji before erasing her posting. She then added a new post on X that said: “Always been a team player and I support my team no matter what. I’m not surprised by the decisions made but at least now it’s clear that it’s not my decision. I have always been supportive and respectful and that will never change,” Vonn said, concluding with a USA flag emoji.Explore more on these topicsMikaela ShiffrinSkiingUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

New evidence establishes that athletic disadvantages associated with female body structure and physiology contribute to the performance gap.”Sebastian Coe, the World Athletics president, said the move was designed to “ensure that our guidelines keep up with the latest information available to maintain a fair and level playing field in the female category”. He said: “Preserving the integrity of competition in the female category is a fundamental principle of the sport of athletics and we look forward to this collaborative consultation process with our key stakeholders in this area.”Most significantly, World Athletics wants to adopt what it calls a “pre‑clearance requirement for all elite athletes competing in the female category” – which, in essence, is a one‑time non-invasive cheek swab test.View image in fullscreenThe World Athletics president, Sebastian Coe, has said the new rules will be based on a ‘collaborative consultation process’.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/Reuters“The required test will be for the SRY gene and, if required, testosterone levels, either via cheek swab with any necessary follow-up or via dry blood spot analysis,” World Athletics says in its consultation document. “In this context, the SRY gene, which is almost always on the Y chromosome, is used as a highly accurate proxy for biological sex but makes room for an additional diagnostic process at the athlete’s discretion.”World Athletics says the cheek-test proposal was recommended by the special rapporteur’s report on female eligibility to the UN general assembly in October last year and is supported by many athletes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those athletes,including Caster Semenya, have undergone male puberty but were reported as female at birth.World Athletics, however, now proposes that there should be the same rules for DSD and transgender athletes as “new evidence has also clarified that testosterone suppression in 46XY DSD and 46XY transgender individuals can only ever partly mitigate the overall male advantage in the sport of athletics”.The recommendations have been sent out to stakeholders for consultation but are expected to be implemented later this year.Explore more on these topicsWorld AthleticsTransgendernewsShareReuse this content"

Could thePhiladelphia Eaglesneutralize the golden arm ofPatrick Mahomes? Would Travis Kelce commitelder abuseagainstKansas City Chiefscoach Andy Reid again? How would the crowd react to the presence of the first sitting presidentto attend a Super Bowl? Might half-time show headlinerKendrick Lamaruse the big stage to provide further insight into the content of Drake’s character? And would Sunday night cap the successful conclusion of Tom Brady’s years-long search for a personality, or would he remain the same on-screen plank who’s shout-talked his way through his first season as Fox’s top football analyst?As ever, however, a bigger question hung over these small opportunities for speculation: would it be any good? As a game, as a spectacle, as a raw demonstration of American ingenuity and might, wouldSuper Bowl LIXhave the juice?Well, now we have the answer: it would not. A non-entity as a contest and a televisual flop, this Super Bowl will live long in the memory of no one but fans of the Eagles. This was a Super Bowl so galactically bad that even Donald Trump – whose appearance at the event took on the sheen of a victory lap after a years-long culture war with the NFL essentiallyended with the league’s surrender, and who drew cheers whenever he was shown on the screens inside Caesars Superdome – left early to beat the traffic. The president, perhaps embarrassed by his pre-game selection of the Chiefs as likeliest victors, exited the building on the stroke of half-time, conveniently missing the pointedly “political” performance thatLamar dished upduring the intermission.Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl half-time show review – game over for DrakeRead moreThis was no less than the NFL deserved for its abject decision to cave in on most of its differences with Trump. During the president’s first administration, the league became an unlikely bulwark of resistance against the Maga tide of insensitivity and hate. Now there’s been a reversal of course. Ahead of this game the NFLannouncedthat the “End Racism” sign that has adorned the end zones for the past four Super Bowls would be replaced by “Choose Love” at one end and “It Takes All of Us” at the other. While the “End Racism” sign – a response to the post-George Floyd eruption of popular outrage across the US over police brutality and racial injustice – could be criticized as mere performance, its replacement by a sign preaching love seemed cynically hypocritical in light of the NFL’s new embrace of a president hell-bent on doing the exact opposite. Choose love! Unless you happen to be trans, undocumented, foreign, liberal, progressive, a member of the left, a government worker, anyone relying on food stamps or Medicaid for their survival, anyone who supports diversity, equity and inclusion, anyone who believes the ethnic cleansing of Gaza is bad, or anyone who didn’t vote for Trump, in which case: womp-womp, cry harder cuck, you are now an enemy of the nation.In this bumbling superpower all the pomp and trappings of empire now seem irredeemably tacky, and last night the Trump-NFL alliance did everything within its authority to demonstrate how quickly things in this country are deteriorating. The night got off to a fittingly shitty start with a pre-game flyover by US fighter jets that could not be seen by anyone inside the domed stadium: a charming metaphor for the blithe stupidity of an America in chronic decline. Jon Batiste sang the national anthem as a pleasantly slinky low-impact cabaret number, like he was a hotel lobby piano man setting the background mood for a bunch of afternoon business meetings. Trump, who actively avoided military service himself, gave the anthem a salute as if he was a veteran.The president’s presence in the crowd was always going to bring a strange energy to this game, and a sense of something broken or torn or not quite right suffused events last night. A hellish mashup of Trumpism, the Super Bowl’s traditional jingoism and fetishization of the military (the anthem, the super-abundance of flags and uniformed personnel, the pre-game flyover), and celebrity culture (Anne Hathaway bopping in the crowd, Paul McCartney chatting it up with Adam Sandler, Kevin Costner absorbed in conversation with Pete Davidson), this Super Bowl felt like a harbinger of the end times, a party to ring in the apocalypse. Royals (Serena Williams, Taylor Swift), tyrants (Trump, Gianni Infantino) and cheesesteak-flipping line cooks (Bradley Cooper) all get to let their hair down in pre-apocalyptic America: the new DEI in action. Lamar bravely attempted to infuse his half-time show with political critique, but the energy in the stadium seemed low, and the “message” may have been lost amid the Trumpy myopia of the night. Was this a sly comment on America’s descent into fascism, or Lamar ambling up and down the stage in dad jeans? Possibly it was both.1:41MVP Jalen Hurts credits defense, says last Super Bowl loss 'lit a great flame' – videoOn the field, Kansas City’s hopes cracked almost as quickly as Jon Hamm’s voice did when he was introducing the team to the stadium before kickoff. Fox did its best to match the Chiefs’ on-field woes by getting most of the big broadcasting calls wrong. The network’s panel of sideline elders and wiseheads seemed almost bored by their obligation to comment on the game, and rules guru Mike Pereira frequently appeared to be asleep when called on to offer insight into various contentious officiating decisions, such was his delay in replying. Meanwhile the Fox scorebug – which displays the score, game time, and the offensive team’s progress up the field – was the “graphic design is my passion”memecome to life, a distressingly ugly collection of jumbo-font boxes and chaotically assembled data points that looked like it was produced by someone whose entire knowledge of visual culture came from a single afternoon “learning Photoshop” in 1998.But this night, whatever the impact of Trump or Mahomes or Lamar, was always going to be about one man: Brady. Fox’s No 1 jaw popped up next to Kevin Burkhardt on Fox’s Bourbon Street set, beaming vacantly in a shiny suit like a man about to sell you a sofa. Throughout the evening the star Fox gameday duo, who’ve had six months to work together but still seem like they’re strangers waiting in the line for coffee whenever they have to exchange words, kept taking their jackets off then putting them back on again: the jackets were on for the pregame bits, off for most of the second quarter, back on for half-time analysis, off again for some reason, then back in place for the home stretch once the Eagles’ victory seemed assured. What fun! This frantic series of pointless costume changes visualized some of the despair that must now be gripping the Fox C-suite overtheir decision to spend $375mand lock Brady in as the network’s main game analyst for the next decade.This was the biggest test yet in Brady’s fledgling TV career, and the results were not pretty. Brady’s early stylings here bore all his emerging signatures as a broadcaster: the weird absence of volume control; the unconvincing attempts at jocularity (“$8m for 30 seconds of advertising time, you’d need to save a lot of pennies for that!”); the statements of the obvious (“The question the Chiefs will be asking themselves is, ‘How can we find enough time for Patrick to make some throws downfield?’”); the sentences that begin with great confidence then trail off once it becomes clear to their creator that they do not contain sufficiently compelling intellectual content to justify their conclusion (“Patrick has that fear factor, everybody in this building knows it, everybody who watches football knows it, I’m really interested to see …”). Many of Brady’s throws to Pereira, prompted by dissatisfaction with some on-field call, were delivered with the deflationary intonation of a man who just missed out on the last slice of his favorite pizza at the local slice joint: “Oh, I don’t like that one bit. What do you think Mike?”As the night wore on Fox’s star boy became increasingly squeaky, resorting in the game’s final quarter to a volley of desperately uninteresting anecdotes about his own career as a champion player. It was impossible not to feel a little sorry for the guy: though richly talented as a player, Brady has all the on-screen charisma of stagnant water and is clearly never going to rise beyond the mundane as a broadcaster. But more sympathy should be reserved for America’s viewers, who will be forced to mute Brady’s games for nine more seasons. And the most should go to Burkhardt, who used last night to debut what is, I believe, a new weapon in his game-calling armory: a strangled, hybrid sob-laugh that served the dual purpose of responding to Brady’s on-air inanities and signaling to viewers at home his deep distress at the next nine years.After two Eagles players, with the championship assured, drenched Nick Sirianni in the ritual Gatorade shower administered to all victoriousSuper Bowlcoaches, Brady monotoned, “That’s got to be a slimy, sticky shower. But who cares?” This had all of the big man’s customary head-scratching vacuity (what exactly does this comment add to the viewer’s appreciation of the action?) but was unintentionally a neat summary of the night. In the end, “Who cares?” may be the most fitting epitaph for the most forgettable Super Bowl in recent history. If the point of televised sports is to make the viewer at home feel as if they’re at the game, Fox last night pulled off a masterclass.But hey, at least we got to seeSeal as a seal.Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlSuper Bowl LIXNFLUS televisionTelevisionUS sportsTom BradyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Few among the Home Park faithful attended both but Griffiths, a proud member of the Green Army since 1953, was there for the 4-0 win on 11 February 1956 in the old Second Division, his beloved club’s previous defeat of Liverpool. As for theFA Cup fourth-round giantkillingon Sunday, when the Championship strugglers sank the Premier League leaders, it was “one of the highlights of my footballing life”.In 1956, Griffiths was a schoolboy at Devonport High school, watching the game from the old “Pop Side” of the old Home Park. “No seats in those days,” he says. “We were opposite the grandstand, and we younger kids would get passed down the front, and we hung on the railings for a closeup view.”Stunned Liverpool sent crashing out of FA Cup in major upset at PlymouthRead moreTheLiverpoolof 1956 was a faded force, relegated in 1954 though still featuring Billy Liddell, the great Scottish winger who had inspired a First Division title in 1947; the club was nicknamed “Liddellpool” after him. Other familiar names featured. The full-back Ronnie Moran became famous as an attack-dog coach under Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley and all further Reds managers until 1998. The left-half Roy Saunders would later father Dean, a future Liverpool striker.Geoff Twentyman, Liverpool’s centre-back, was given a real runaround by Plymouth’s centre-forward Neil Langman. “He scored,” Griffiths says of Langman, whose brother Peter also played at centre-back. “He was a big old lump but quite skilful on the ground and he made a right mess of the Liverpool defence.” Twentyman remains legendary in Liverpool lore after becoming the scout who uncovered the talents of future club greats like Phil Neal, Ian Rush and Alan Hansen.Up front for Liverpool was Alan A’Court, who played in England’s forward line at the 1958 World Cup finals. “They were still one of the famous clubs in the country, and everybody in Plymouth wanted to see the game, the crowd was over 27,000,” Griffiths recalls. These were the times of Stanley Matthews, Tom Finney and the Busby Babes, when photos of the soccer stars of the day were collected on cigarette cards.View image in fullscreenPlymouth Argyle’s Ryan Hardie, who scored the sole goal against Liverpool, looks on with a smile after the win.Photograph: David Klein/Reuters“It was a big occasion, but it was a league match,” Griffiths says, throwing himself forward to Sunday’s heroics where Argyle, rock bottom of the Championship, held off the previously all-conquering 2025-issue Liverpool for their famous victory. “I didn’t expect to win by any means. All I wanted was one goal, even if they lost 6-1 but … Wow.”Now 83, longtime resident in Hertford, Griffiths still works as a self-employed town planner, numbering himself among the 800-strong London branch of the Green Army, taking in local away games as well as regular returns to Home Park.He can now compare schoolboy heroes like the Langman brothers, tough-tackling full-back George Robertson, the flying winger Gordon Astall and the inside-forward George Dews, who also batted right-hand for Worcestershire, to their modern equivalents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The No 9 Ryan Hardie slotted the decisive penalty. Nikola Katic, the recently arrived Bosnian central defender, threw himself at every challenge and then cheerleaded his teammates on to the finish line. For Jack Rowley, Argyle’s manager in 1956, read Miron Muslic, who Griffiths congratulated when they met on Monday. “He’s very calm, very focused, he immediately made a good impression.” The Wayne Rooney misadventure consigned to the past, Argyle now have a fighting chance of Championship survival. “They don’t fanny about at the back,” Griffiths says, approvingly.A first whiff of a possible Sunday shock came when seeing Arne Slot’s Liverpool selection. Ten changes were made, with Mohamed Salah idling back on Merseyside. “I was encouraged. That was disrespecting Argyle. They clearly hadn’t done their homework. Surely they must have known we had brought in a new manager, that they have brought in two amazing defenders. [Muslic]’s got them organised. They must have realised that, surely. Though obviously not. It was disrespectful not to have some of the more accomplished players in the side.”Argyle’s exploits this season,winning at Brentfordin the third round, and taking down Liverpool, have redressed some of the purported lost magic of the FA Cup. For Griffiths, it delivered glorious, golden moments to reward seven decades of loyal support.Explore more on these topicsPlymouth ArgyleLiverpoolFA CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their attention now turns to pushing for promotion from League Two after Palace set up a south London derby with Millwall in the fifth round.An FA Cup shock shouldn’t unhinge Liverpool, but football isn’t logicalRead moreGoals either side of half-time from Daniel Muñoz and Justin Devenny were enough to book Palace’s place in the next round, and Glasner will point to several other positives and reflect on this as a successful night’s work in south Yorkshire.Doncaster played their part in a compelling tie, but there could be no arguments this was the right outcome.With Ben Chilwell making his Palace debut from the bench in the second half and Adam Wharton coming through his first start since October unscathed and looking very much the part, there was lots for Glasner to savour. Then again, the gulf between the two sides in the pyramid – almost 60 places – means the result has to be taken with a pinch of salt.But this night and atmosphere felt ripe for a shock pre-match. That Palace neutralised it and prevented Doncaster from causing an upset means it is another tick in the box for their mid-season upturn. “I’m very pleased with the performance,” Glasner said post-match before turning his attention to the next round. “I could feel the excitement in the dressing room from the staff. It’s a big rivalry [against Millwall] and it’s important for all of us. For me personally it’s too far away, it’s three weeks away.”With so many big Premier League sides exiting already, it feels like Palace are now in the conversation for the Cup.Wharton and his midfield partner Will Hughes were excellent. With Doncaster certainly not holding back and attempting to make a real game of it, the control Wharton and Hughes provided was decisive. They helped add a measure of calm to proceedings which can often go missing on nights like these.The first goal always felt vital. Doncaster had half-chances to get it, with Luke Molyneux coming close. But just after the half-hour mark, a clever free-kick from Palace found Jean-Philippe Mateta unmarked, and while he struck the post, Muñoz was on hand to tap in the rebound  and put the visitors ahead.It was a crucial moment. It didn’t take the wind out of Doncaster – far from it. But with a goal advantage, Glasner was able to introduce Chilwell at the break and he invigorated Palace’s performance. Mateta and Devenny then spurned big chances to double the lead and, as Doncaster began to stir into action again, it was hard not to wonder if there was still life in the tie.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hughes produced an inch-perfect through ball that found Devenny, and he scooped the ball over Teddy Sharman-Lowe to double Palace’s advantage and put the tie beyond doubt. It restored control for the visitors just at a time when things were threatening to get wild.Doncaster didn’t fall away, and they continued to press until the very end. But they must now focus on their endeavours in League Two. “I’m really proud of the players and the performance,” Grant McCann, the Doncaster manager, said. “It was always going to be a difficult game against a very good team. The town can be proud of its players.”Quick GuideFA Cup fifth round drawShowPreston v BurnleyAston Villa v Cardiff CityCrystal Palace v MillwallManchester United v FulhamNewcastle United v BrightonBournemouth v WolvesManchester City v Plymouth ArgyleExeterorNottingham Forest v IpswichTies to be played between 28 Feb – 3 MarchWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Long before full time, the chants from the travelling support – who had unfurled a banner before kickoff letting the FA know how they felt about this tie being played on a Monday evening – about their local rivals had begun.

The Lancashire club were 18th in the Championship at the time, but this term are challenging for a playoff spot and sit in sixth place.Speaking on Sunday, Eustace said he wanted to talk to the Rovers ownership after Derby’s approach was made. When asked if he would be seeking assurances that he would continue to be well supported by the club, he said: “Of course.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 25-year-old hit back after his club called in the police over discriminatory posts aimed at him and his family in the wake of the Magpies’2-1 Premier League defeat by Fulhamon 1 February.Willock, who described those responsible as “lowlifes”, told the Newcastle Chronicle: “It’s happened to me many times. It was the severity of it. That’s why I had to put it out there. If you are not only coming for my race, but threatening my family, wishing bad things on them, that’s when I have to put it out there and report it. You could actually endanger someone if you have that hatred. I had to do it.”Willock, who praised his club’s strong response to the incident and the support they have provided since, urged social media companies to take stronger action against offenders in an effort to tackle the issue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She denies the charges.Sam Kerr jury asked to consider difference if she had called a police officer ‘stupid and black’Read moreGrace Forbes, defending Kerr, gave her closing argument on Monday morning. She described the conduct of police on 30 January 2023 as “completely unacceptable” after they failed to take claims by the footballer and her partner, Kristie Mewis about the taxi driver’s alleged dangerous driving and false imprisonment seriously.After a night out, the pair hailed a black cab from central London back to their home in south-west London, the court has heard. During the journey, Kerr felt sick and vomited out of the window, sparking a dispute about paying for cleaning. After this, the couple claim the driver locked the car and began speeding and swerving, prompting Mewis to smash a window with a kick.Unbeknownst to the couple, the taxi driver had rung the police, who told him to drive to Twickenham police station, the court was told. After he parked up, Kerr crawled out of the broken window and opened the car door from the outside to let Mewis out. The pair then approached a marked police car outside the station.Forbes said the first “20 vital minutes” of Kerr and Mewis’ encounter with police were never captured on camera. Bodyworn footage shown to the court begins when Kerr and Mewis are inside Twickenham police station.“Two individuals went straight up to a marked police car looking for help in a state of distress. How and why did we go from that to what was an utterly unproductive, heated, argument?“It seems that no one thought that it was worth putting on their body-worn footage when they saw a woman climbing through a broken window, when they were making allegations of false imprisonment,” said Forbes.She told the jury to treat the “one dimensional image” they had been presented of a “drunk and angry woman” with caution. The prosecution had played footage of Kerr saying “fucking stupid and white” to, in part, “capitalise on the shock factor” and wear them down after “hearing those words time and time again”.Commenting on Kerr’s mention of lawyers in the exchange, Forbes said the footballer felt the “need to front it out” and compared her to “a puffer fish blowing itself up” to feel more secure.Forbes described the conduct of police that night as “completely unacceptable”, saying the police officers “had made no meaningful attempt” to investigate the pair’s claims.“Even if you are drunk, you can still be a victim of crime,” said Forbes. “PC Lovell conceded in evidence that their allegations were capable of amounting to dangerous driving and false imprisonment. Why did he say on the night what she had told him didn’t amount to any offences?“No officer swept the vehicle for a device themselves. No one has ever bothered to take a witness statement from Kristie Mewis. No wonder the police have never heard from the driver again.”She also cast doubt on the extent to which Lovell’s claims he was impacted by being called “stupid and white”, noting that no other officers “in that room claimed to feel impact”.When PC Lovell was on the witness stand, she told the court, “four valiant attempts” were made to emphasise how much he was impacted. She said “the height of his feeling” was “that upset me I guess”.The jury was later sent out to consider its verdict.Explore more on these topicsSam KerrChelsea WomennewsShareReuse this content"

In the final minutes before Athletic Club faced Girona on Saturday afternoon, Ernesto Valverde was asked who would take the penalties and gave an answer almost as loaded as the question: “Only one thing’s certain,” the coach said, “it won’t be me.” Less than an hour later, it had actually happened, which maybe it had to, another man standing before a screen invitingthat guyback into their lives. So now here they were again, Iñaki Williams on the spot with the ball under his arm, Girona’s goalkeeper a few yards away wearing a look so knowing, it had a PhD.Oh, he knew. They all did: the 48,261 people in San Mamés stands, the 22 on the pitch, everyone on the bench. Williams, especially. The last time he had faced Gazzaniga, four months earlier, had hit him hard, the striker insisting he felt responsible for a 2-1 defeat. “This can’t happen,” he said, but it had. At 1-1, Gazzaniga had saved his penalty and that wasn’t the half of it: he had already stopped Álex Berenguer’s penalty and when he was spotted off the line this time, Athletic allowed to try for a third time, Williams asked Ander Herrera to take it instead – so Gazzaniga saved that too, a unique hat-trick completed before Cristhian Stuani scored Girona’s 99th-minute winner.European football: Barça close in on leaders after thrashing SevillaRead moreWith a penalty.This time, Williams wasn’t actually taking it; Oihan Sancet was. “I’m first on the list, I knew it would be me,” Sancet said after. In Girona, he had given the first to Berenguer because his teammate had wanted it, the confidence flooding through him and right out again. By the time they had been given the second and the third, Williams missing before the retake offered a shot at redemption that Herrera passed up with a penalty so poor it didn’t so much need saving as scooping off the floor, Sancet had gone off again.Yet if the kick was handed over with a little more conviction than in Girona, if Williams taking the ball was a ploy, protection, designed to distract and reduce the pressure, everyone still felt it. Gazzaniga’s presence alone had turned their legs to jelly then, Berenguer, Williams and Herrera unable to function properly, and now he was smiling, the bastard. He had already made a brilliant save from Williams and Montilivi was on every mind, as Williams stepped away and Sancet stood there alone. This, said commentator José Sanchís, was like the final battle with a video game monster, probably not intending to conjure up images of the Duck onChuckie Egg. Hitchcock had written it, one Bilbao paper said.Sancet took two slow steps left, four fast steps forward and ... smashed it into the top right corner. No pissing about. All that buildup blown away, all these words gone with the wind. This was Indiana Jones watching the swordsman twirl his scimitar before shooting him, El Correo wrote – a scene, by the way, that had more to do with dysentery than scriptwriting, Harrison Ford unable to stay away from the toilet for long. “I’m happy, and all the more so after what happened in Girona,” Sancet said. Catharsis, they called it. Ghosts exorcised, heart mended, time to move on. And so they did, and how.“The goal hurt them,” Valverde said; it also made Athletic Athletic. Suddenly, they were everywhere, someone opening the Volta Dam. The ball had smashed into the net on 41.02. It was back in play for 29 seconds before Gazzaniga had to reach to stop the ball squeezing under the bar and 34 more when he made an astonishing save from Óscar de Marcos. Another catch, another corner, another cross, and Girona were being swept away, the fouls desperate, a way to breathe if only for a second. This was relentless.On 45.42, into added time at the end of the first half, Athletic scored a second, Berenguer standing up a perfect cross for Sancet to head in, and still they didn’t stop. Girona kicked off and within 11 seconds, Yangel Herrera had been caught. Within 16, Williams’ shot screeched past the post, a big, deephuuuyroaring round. It was all Girona could do to get to half-time at all, they had only been playing again for 47 seconds when Adama Boiro’s shot was blocked, and if the storm did eventually ease, there was no way back. With 12 minutes left, Athletic scored, Sancet neatly dinking the ball over Gazzaniga, the man who completed a hat-trick four months ago conceding one now.View image in fullscreenPaulo Gazzaniga saved three penalties in Girona’s 2-1 win against Athletic Club last October.Photograph: Bagu Blanco/Pressinphoto/ShutterstockThe goals were a perfect portrait of Athletic, a pack that win the ball more often and higher up than anyone else inLa Liga, all intent and purpose. “We risked a lot going very high to press them in their own area, but I think it’s good for us to be there; and whether we’re very high or very low, we have to go together,” Valverde said.For the first goal, Williams had stretched to cut out the keeper’s throw, Mikel Jauregizar had taken it off Miguel Gutiérrez, dashed into the area and been brought down, the VAR finally awarding the penalty. For the second, they cornered Girona and mugged them, one, two, three, four, five players closed down by their own penalty area before Berenguer lifted it to Sancet. For the third, it was Jhon Solís they hunted. Almost before he realised what had happened, took down the number of that bus, the ball was in the net: two touches, too fast to stop, and Sancet turned superbly, a gorgeous subtle touch in the storm, to provide the finish.Sancet was withdrawn late to a standing ovation, his name chanted. There has always been something a bit special about him, a skinny, skilful kid who joined the club’s academy from Osasuna in 2015. “He’s decisive for us, when he’s right,” Valverde said. He had missed 11 games this season through injury, four of them in the league – when he has played, he has often done so through pain in his ankle – and they have missed him. He may not get noticed outside Bilbao and – a bit like with Berenguer, who has nine assists – there are others who grab the attention but Athletic are a different team with him. The technique is special, the timing even better, arriving from behind the forwards.The man who scored in theCopa del Rey final last year, made his debut five seasons ago, and has racked up over 150 games inprimera, Sancet is still only 24. This was his third hat-trick for Athletic:since Lionel Messi departed, no one in Spain has scored more. Only one player currently in La Liga ever has, and that’s Antoine Griezmann. At Athletic only two players have as many in half a century: Aritz Aduriz and Julen Guerrero. These three goals took him to 11 in the league this season, already his best total – and more than any Spaniard – and kept Athletic in a Champions League place, four points off Barcelona. “With Sancet, the party is guaranteed,” ran the headline in AS, which may have been just a little pointed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It had been the perfect night, Valverde said. A big, convincing win against a Champions League team, and a symbolic one too, entirely deserved and done their way. By the end, Athletic had taken 23 shots, Girona three. They had introduced two more debutants as well, the 37th and 38th under Valverde, going back to the day he gaveAndoni Iraolahis first game.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowRayo Vallecano 1-0 Real ValladolidCelta Vigo 3-2 Real BetisAthletic Bilbao 3-0 GironaLas Palmas 1-2 VillarrealReal Madrid 1-1 Atlético MadridAlavés 0-1 GetafeValencia 2-0 LeganésReal Sociedad 2-1 EspanyolSevilla 1-4 BarcelonaReal Mallorca v Osasuna (Monday, 8pm GMT)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Here it was Endika Buján and Maroan Sannadi, the latter signed from Alavés via Barakaldo where he was on loan and going straight from the third tier to the first where he left quite an impact, fascinating everyone: 6ft 4in, shoulders so wide you could spell out his name and still leave room for aKapow!which would fit nicely. Or maybe they could add his nicknames: the Elephant, or the Emperor. He set up Sancet for what could have been the hat-trick before it actually arrived, there was a run that brought to mind Jonah Lomu marauding along with a family full of Underwoods hanging off him, and he just couldn’t stop smiling. “My life flashed before my eyes; I’ve waited the whole of it for a moment like this,” Sannadi said.As for the rest of them, they had waited for this too, if not quite so long, and it was big. Athletic were recently knocked out of the Copa del Rey, losing their first single-legged tie in five years, and that really hurt, but they finished second in the Europa League table, level with Lazio at the top, their eyes on a final that will be held at San Mamés. And while that has had an impact domestically – they have won just one of eight league games the weekend after playing in Europe – they are also fourth, which would be their highest finish in over a decade, their joint-highest this century.They have beaten Real Madrid and Real Sociedad, have a fortnight without midweek games, currently occupy a Champions League place and on the weekend whena draw in the Madrid derbyopened up the title race for Barcelona, leaving the top three on 50, 49, and 48 points, might even have been entitled to ask:What about us? They are as close to Barcelona – four points – as Villarreal are to them. “A lo bajini,” Williams likes to say: they’re going quietly, under the radar, but they are there. No one in La Liga has gone as long without being beaten, after all: it’s 15 games now, a run that goes all the way back to October and the last time Paulo Gazzaniga stood smiling before them.PosTeamPGDPts1Real Madrid2329502Atletico Madrid2323493Barcelona2339484Athletic Bilbao2316445Villarreal2312406Rayo Vallecano233357Real Sociedad230318Girona23-2319Osasuna22-43010Mallorca22-93011Real Betis23-42912Celta Vigo23-32813Sevilla23-92814Getafe2312715Las Palmas23-102316Espanyol23-132317Leganes23-132318Valencia23-132219Alaves23-102120Valladolid23-3315Explore more on these topicsLa LigaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The fact that Arne Slot had spared almost all of his big-name heavy artillery the long trip to Devon was immediately raised, although we can only guess if the presence of Alisson, Mo Salah, Cody Gakpo, Virgil van Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ryan Gravenberch, Dominik Szoboszlai, Alexis Mac Allister and Ibrahima Konaté in their side might have led to a more impressive Liverpool performance. You can only beat what’s in front of you and while it’s true that Liverpool’s line-up certainly had an early pre-season friendly feel about it, the atmosphere at Home Park did not and could only have been more febrile if a visiting Scouser had been caught putting jam on their half-time scone before the clotted cream.While the seismic nature of Plymouth’s giant-killing has been the subject ofsome tedious and unnecessary debate, there were no such curmudgeonly mutterings about an upset almost 500 miles away that could scarcely have registered higher on the Fitba-Richter scale. Making the short trip to Ibrox from the 52,000-capacity Hampden Park home to which they attract an average crowd of 1,798, second-tier side Queen’s Park scored with their only shot of the game toknock Rangers out of the Scottish Cupfor the first time in 143 years. An amateur side as recently as 2019, Queen’s last reached the last 16 of the Scottish Cup 42 years ago, before any of their current squad were born and travelled to Ibrox with their ranks severely depleted by injuries. While home fans could have been forgiven for expecting to see their side run out easy winners, they instead bore witness to the unthinkable and made no secret of their displeasure as their players trudged off on the back of a crushing humiliation.“The ball just came to me and I done my ting, innit?” said Queen’s elated substitute Seb Drozd, as he forensically analysed the excruciating minutiae of his fine match-winning strike for the benefit of a post-match interviewer. While Rangers huffed and puffed, raining shot after shot on their visitors’ goal, a combination of blocks, goal-line clearances and the quite remarkable heroics of Queen’s goalkeeper Calum Ferrie kept the home side at bay until they were thrown the lifeline of a potentially blush-sparing penalty in the seventh minute of added time. Up stepped James Tavernier, only to be denied by Ferrie, who then had to endure the anguish of a lengthy VAR check while the curtain-twitchers of McStockley Park made sure he hadn’t left his goal-line before the spot-kick was taken.“We had 30 chances but no goals,” fumed Rangers boss Philippe Clement during a post-mortem that could scarcely have been more uncomfortable if somebody in a lab coat had actually set about him with a scalpel. “Thirty chances is nothing to do with tactics. It is unacceptable to lose this. They built credit back the last weeks and months; today they lost all of that credit.” With his own reserves of kudos among Rangers fans already snakebelly low before this seismic embarrassment, Clement may well be ushered out the Ibrox door, even if those of a Celtic persuasion will be extremely sorry to see him go.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoinThe One ShowNiall McVeigh at 7pm GMT for updates on theFA Cupfifth-round draw – and then John Brewin will be on hand at 7.45pm for Doncaster 1-3 Crystal Palace.QUOTE OF THE DAYHow KCTV gets the footage is a mystery … there is no studio.

He returned to the theme repeatedly through his final few months in the job, highlighting how few domestic players were even starting up front for the nation’s top clubs. “It makes things difficult for us,” he said. “Let’s hope it’s not an irreversible phenomenon.”Luciano Spalletti has not dwelled on this subject since he succeeded Mancini in the role, but plenty of others were ready to say it for him asItaly crashed out early from Euro 2024. Starting up front in their last-16 defeat to Switzerland was Gianluca Scamacca, making his 20th appearance for Italy and yet to score his second goal. The only other recognised No 9 in the squad was Mateo Retegui, who had struck a modest seven times in his first Serie A season with Genoa.Dortmund’s season is spiralling out of control after own goals on and off pitch | Andy BrassellRead moreHow surprising it is to look at that division’s scoring charts eight months later and see two Italians leading the way. Retegui is first with more goals (20) than starts (18). Moise Kean is next on 15. According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, this is the first time since 2014 that the top two spots have been held by Italian players so late into a campaign.What changed? Neither player was a hot pick to becomecapocannonierebefore this season began, not even after Retegui secured a late August move to Atalanta – signed as emergency cover for the injured Scamacca. Lautaro Martínez, Dusan Vlahovic and Marcus Thuram were the bookies’ favourites but so far only the latter has cracked double figures. Only Thuram, on 13 goals, has a hope of catching the two Italians on present form.Quick GuideSerie A: Inter earn quick revenge on FiorentinaShowInter secured a 2-1 home win over Fiorentina on Monday, with Marko Arnautovic's header putting them one point behind Serie A leaders Napoli.Simone Inzaghi's side were hosting Fiorentina just four days after their previous Serie A clash, where La Viola completed a 3-0 victory. That match was replayed, having been suspended in the 17th minute on 1 December after Edoardo Bove suffered a cardiac arrest  on the pitch. The Fiorentina midfielder had recovered enough to attend last week's game at Stadio Artemio Franchi.Inter dominated the first half at San Siro and broke the deadlock thanks to an own goal from Fiorentina's Marin Pongracic, who headed the ball into his own net from a corner in the 28th minute. The visitors were able to level against the run if play just before half time, Rolando Mandragora converting a penalty spot after Matteo Darmian handled a cross.Arnautovic [pictured], who came on for Marcus Thuram just before Inter took the lead, headed the hosts back in front from close range just seven minutes after the restart. The Austrian was then substituted for Mehdi Taremi in the 77th minute as Inter held on for a victory that boosts their title defence hopes.ReutersPhotograph: Spada/Rex FeaturesWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Retegui added four goals to his tally on Saturday, leading Atalanta in a 5-0 demolition of Verona. He was aided by some woeful defending, but the chances were ruthlessly taken. Three were scored with a first touch, Retegui twice forcing home rebounds and another time finishing nonchalantly across goal from Marten de Roon’s cross. For his second goal, Retegui wrong-footed defenders on a drag-back turn and buried the ball into the bottom corner.He was writing his name into Atalanta’s record books as he went: the first player in their history to score a first-half hat-trick in Serie A. “In the Netherlands we have a word ‘Retegoed’ which means ‘pretty damn good’,”wrote De Roon on Instagram. “I think I’m going to start a petition to change Retegui’s name in Retegoed.”View image in fullscreenMateo Retegui calmly finishes past Verona goalkeeper Lorenzo Montipò in Atalanta’s 5-0 win.Photograph: Alberto Lingria/ReutersKean’s performance for Fiorentina against Internazionale on Thursday might have been even more impressive. Although he ‘only’ scored twice, he had tormented the defending champions long before he finally beat Yann Sommer with a header midway through the second half. Kean had twice almost broken the deadlock before the interval, the first time with a close-range header of his own, aimed too close to the keeper, and the second time by releasing Dodô for a one-on-one that the Brazilian fired wide.It was Luca Ranieri who eventually grabbed the first goal from a corner, but Kean’s header doubled Fiorentina’s advantage. He then punished a sloppy pass to steal in for another, completing a shocking 3-0 rout over Inter.European trade: 10 January transfers you might have missedRead moreThis game had technically started on 2 December, before being suspended in the 17th minute followingthe cardiac arrest suffered by Edoardo Bove. After waiting two months for the resumption, it will be fascinating to see what adjustments Inter and Atalanta make in the four-day gap leading into their return match in Milan on Monday night.It will be intriguing too, to see how Spalletti uses Retegui and Kean for a two-legged Nations League quarter-final against Germany next month. The Italy manager offered a thoughtful analysis of both players’ development in an interview with Gazzetta over the weekend, observing that they remained very different models of centre-forward – the first a penalty-box striker, then second more free roaming, but that each had made clear progress in rounding out their games.Asked if their prolific seasons were the result of finding teams and managers that suited their talents, Spalletti replied that there was “no doubt”. Retegui, who onlymoved to Italy in 2023 from Argentina, where he was born, gets far better service on a title-challenging Atalanta side than he ever received at Genoa. Kean, after years as an impact sub at Juventus, has finally been given the chance to start regularly again for a Fiorentina side thatprizes his explosiveness in the transitions.View image in fullscreenLuciano Spalletti has stressed that Mateo Retegui and Moise Kean are two very different weapons for Italy’s attack.Photograph: Alfredo Falcone/LaPresse/ShutterstockBut Spalletti also sought to redirect credit to the players themselves for working on the things that they needed to improve. “Inside the area [Retegui] is still a marksman: he controls the ball, he turns and he shoots. But he has grown with his back to goal, the way he offers for his teammates, gives them an option for the one-two, comes toward and helps the team. He still holds his position, but he’s more mobile, and gives opponents fewer reference points.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A pure centre-forward’s goal. He went in front of the defender first, to let them see him, then slipped off to ‘hide’, then he squirted out again to go score. It’s the first thing you need to know how to do as an attacker: hide. Because the defender is comfortable when they can see their man and the ball. This is only the broad principle, but it often works.”After such a dismal chapter in the recent history of the national team – who have failed to qualify for the last two World Cups – few will be getting ahead of themselves. Retegui and Kean have both had their moments playing for theAzzurribut their combined return of 11 goals in 37 games is hardly overwhelming.Quick GuideSerie A resultsShowFiorentina 3-0 InterComo 1-2 JuventusVerona 0-5 AtalantaEmpoli 0-2 MilanTorino 1-1 GenoaVenezia 0-1 RomaLazio 5-1 MonzaNapoli 1-1 UdineseLecce 0-0 BolognaCagliari 2-1 ParmaInter 2-1 FiorentinaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There are still few signals of any wider wave of goalscoring talent coming through. Lorenzo Lucca is having a strong season at Udinese, his nine goals almost a third of the team’s total, and the 24-year-old certainly catches the eye at 6ft 7in. But a look back at the data for 2024 shows that only three Italians – Retegui, Kean and Bologna winger Riccardo Orsolini – scored into double figures across any of Europe’s top five leagues. Comparisons with France (10 players in double figures), England (nine), Germany (nine) and Spain (five) are all unfavourable.Asked whether the attack was now the least of Italy’s problems, Spalletti kept things in context. “At the moment that’s how it is,” he said. “And it is always good to stress that ‘at the moment’.”Atalanta’s win, combined with another draw for Napoli, brought them back to within five points of first place. Fiorentina are three points outside the Champions League places heading into Monday night’s rematch with Inter. At the moment, Atalanta are in contention for the Scudetto and Fiorentina a top-four finish. Serie A’s two most prolific players are a big part of the reason why.PosTeamPGDPts1Napoli2422552Inter Milan2334513Atalanta2428504Lazio2413455Juventus2420436Fiorentina2317427AC Milan2311388Bologna238389Roma2463410Udinese24-83011Torino24-32812Genoa24-112713Cagliari24-132414Lecce24-232415Verona24-272316Como24-122217Empoli24-132118Parma24-142019Venezia24-171620Monza24-1813Explore more on these topicsSerie AEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Waldemar Anton can’t have relished changing ends at half-time on Saturday. The performance of Borussia Dortmund’s big summer purchase had already captured the defender’s time so far in Nord-Rhine Westphalia in microcosm, as his blind backpass led to former teammate Deniz Undav going one-on-one with Gregor Kobel. Only a swift intervention from Emre Can prevented Anton’s error from leading to a Stuttgart goal.When BVB moved from defending the Südtribune in the second period, it became even more uncomfortable for Anton. He was that bit physically closer to the awayStuttgartfans in the north-eastern corner of Signal Iduna Park and their jeers and boos became more audible. They had been furious when the Uzbek-born centre-back had left, not so long after Anton had extended his contract and spoken of his pride at becoming Stuttgart’s captain. If the move north had come with a hefty bump in pay and status for Anton, it has so far been far from a resounding success and in a game in which Stuttgart created little of substance, his next inadvertent intervention felt almost inevitable.European football: Barça close in on leaders after thrashing SevillaRead moreFive minutes into the second half Chris Führich crossed from the right and Anton slid to block, but the ball skewed from his challenge and inside Kobel’s near post, giving Stuttgart the lead. In that corner the travelling fans, on their way to enjoying their fifth straight win over Dortmund, revelled in their former captain’s discomfort.There was worse to come for Anton, and for Dortmund. Ten minutes later the ball dropped in Dortmund’s penalty area at the feet at Serhou Guirassy, who like Anton made a lucrative move from last season’sBundesligarunners-up to BVB. The striker had time to clear but took too long, was dispossessed and eventually Jamie Leweling found a pass for Jeff Chabot of all people – Anton’s replacement – to rattle in his first Stuttgart goal, which turned out to be the winner after Julian Brandt later pulled one back for the hosts. Months after Stuttgart were faced with the prospect of rebuilding without the two totems of their epochal season, Anton’s and Guirassy’s new club is tasked with a far more daunting reconstruction project.The symbolism of it was important because although this was another damaging result, it wasn’t really about this, but about everything that led Dortmund to this point. This was the first game in charge for Niko Kovac, Nuri Sahin’s replacement, who became the first BVB head coach not to win on his debut since Thomas Doll in March 2007. Kovac, like Doll, might privately wonder what he was reasonably expected to do on such short notice. His first steps in charge of his fourth Bundesliga club were broadly positive despite the result, with BVB looking more engaged, intense and compact. “We controlled the game,” Kovac told Sky. “We just had to score. We shouldn’t have left the pitch as losers.” Yet as so often in the recent past, a lack of poise at both ends of the field cost Dortmund.View image in fullscreenNiko Kovac watches on as Dortmund fell behind in the race for Champions League qualification.Photograph: Action Press/ShutterstockIt is tempting to suggest that no clarity in the boardroom means precious little on the pitch. Kovac should have been the headline here but he was overshadowed not only by the misadventures of Anton and Guirassy but by the midweek exit of Sven Mislintat, the transfer guru whose presence has stoked discord almost from the moment he returned to the club for a second spell. The internal relief at Mislintat’s departure was made clear with BVB’s official statement last Thursday, 29 words of text that you would struggle to match for curtness.Those on-edge vibes will not end with Mislintat’s exit, as the ostentatious billboard advertising for controversial club sponsor Rheinmetall underlined. Six points behind Stuttgart with 13 games to go should not be fatal in itself to hopes of returning to the Champions League. But there is nothing in the ether to suggest BVB are capable of summoning the consistency to hunt their rivals down (and not just Stuttgart – Sunday’s win for RB Leipzig against St Pauli putting them into fourth, a further point ahead).Quick GuideBundesliga resultsShowBayern Munich 3-0 Werder BremenBorussia Dortmund 1-2 StuttgartMainz 0-0 AugsburgFreiburg 1-0 HeidenheimHoffenheim 0-4 Union BerlinWolfsburg 0-0 Bayer LeverkusenBorussia Mönchengladbach 1-1 Eintracht FrankfurtHolstein Kiel 2-2 BochumRB Leipzig 2-0 St PauliWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Stuttgart are a useful yardstick, though. This is also a huge club with a storied past that lived in administrative chaos for years, and is showing that reorganisation is a clear route to improved performance, whatever the budget. They get past the departure of key players because the approach, upstairs and downstairs (with the excellent Sebastian Hoeness on the bench) is consistent. Dortmund’s stars, be it Guirassy with his goals this season or Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham in the recent past, merely paper over the cracks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIf Kovac can lift the mood and make Dortmund competitive again, in the Bundesliga and with a Champions League playoff against Sporting on the horizon, it would be quite the achievement. It will be hard, with the schedule against the new coach as much as the situation. “Because we play every three or four days, we have a lot of video study ahead of us,” Kovac underlined. He is a coach who is good at getting his players to focus on the basics, which is all that can be done now to try and arrest a season which has spiralled out of control.Talking pointsThe dynamics of next week’s huge face-off between Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich changed with this weekend’s results; Bayern winning 3-0 against Werder Bremen on Friday night with a pair of Harry Kane penalties and Leverkusen only managing a goalless draw at Wolfsburg means that the gap at the top is now eight points. Leverkusen couldn’t really afford to lose before and now, perhaps, they have a near obligation to win.The schedule is the X-factor here, with Bayern facing a Champions League trip to Celtic on Wednesday. Leverkusen’s own midweek exertions were clear in an uncharacteristically flat performance at Wolfsburg after Wednesday’s effort in the Pokal quarter-final comeback against second-tier rivals Köln, with a trademark 96th-minute Patrik Schick leveller and an extra-time winner by Victor Boniface needed to seal the deal. A record-equalling run of 27 unbeaten away games was scant consolation after Florian Wirtz missed a sitter to score the winner in stoppage time (which, in fairness, he brilliantly created for himself). Xabi Alonso defended his decision to use Wirtz only as a substitute after his 120 minutes against Köln. “I take full responsibility,” said the Spaniard.Hoffenheim must be thrilled with BVB’s struggles as they overshadow their own status as the league’s crisis club. Head coach Christian Ilzer has seen his team win one out of 10 Bundesliga games, also exiting the Pokal and Europe. The league is the main worry, though, now. They are just four points above the relegation playoff spot, and morale is on the floor. “If we play the way we did today,” warned Marius Bülter after the 4-0 home hammering by Union Berlin, “we won’t win another game this season.”PosTeamPGDPts1Bayern Munich2146542Bayer Leverkusen2122463Eintracht Frankfurt2118394RB Leipzig217365Stuttgart218356Freiburg21-8337Mainz219328Borussia M'gladbach212319Wolfsburg2183010Werder Bremen21-53011Borussia Dortmund2112912Augsburg21-112713Union Berlin21-72414St Pauli21-62115Hoffenheim21-181816Heidenheim21-181417Holstein Kiel21-211318VfL Bochum21-2711Explore more on these topicsBundesligaEuropean club footballBorussia DortmundStuttgartfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Central among the defaulters are three rugby clubs –Worcester,WaspsandLondon Irish– who went into administration after being lent £41.6m in public money.England win has fans dreaming again as Borthwick’s plans come together | Robert KitsonRead moreSpeaking in front of the Public Accounts Committee in parliament on Monday, the director general of policy at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), Polly Payne, said the government was now monitoring financial risks not only to clubs but thePremiershipitself, and that concerns over financial viability had grown.Asked by MPs if she anticipated more rugby clubs going into administration in future, Payne said: “We are absolutely reviewing and updating our forecasts. Are we more or less pessimistic than at the time when we gave the loans? I think given everything that has gone on in the sport, we are more pessimistic than we were then. I wouldn’t want to talk about our individual borrowers but absolutely we keep it under review and really care about it.“In rugby when we have been thinking about likely insolvencies and the financial strength of the individual clubs, we have also thought about the financial situation of the Premier League (sic) as a whole,” she continued. “We have not only been taking account of it, we’ve been using the government’s convening power to try and help with the financial sustainability. We take this very seriously.”Payne defended the decision to award a total of £123.8m to Premiership clubs, a quarter of the total amount lent at the time. “It wasn’t that there was any special treatment and we didn’t think about it sport by sport,” she said. “I think it’s worth saying that the [total amount] we could have spent was underspent, so it was not the case that other sports missed out.”Payne also argued that the clubs had shown themselves to be solvent before Covid struck, a key requirement of the loan system. “Unfortunately within the next three years, [those assessments were proven wrong] ... but I have no reason to believe the information given at the time was inaccurate,” she said.DCMS officials also pointed out that money had been retrieved from the three former Premiership clubs, more than £10m to date, and that a further between £7.3m and £11.1m is expected to be recouped from the nine recipients of Covid loans who have become insolvent.Also speaking in front of the committee, the most senior civil servant in the DCMS, the permanent secretary Susannah Storey, defended the Covid loan system, calling it a “relatively solid” approach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve definitely made some improvements as we’ve codified this process.

While the Spanish and English champions have each previously progressed twice, Ancelotti was clear about how he rates encounters between them.“It seems like it’s aclásicobecause we have played each other a lot of times in this competition,” the Italian said. “It will depend a lot on the attitude and confidence of the teams.

Yet Ancelotti believes Pep Guardiola’s side is the hardest foe they could have drawn. “They are one of the best teams in Europe, they have the best manager out there so its the most difficult game we can face regardless of form.”Ancelotti praised Guardiola. “It’s a nightmare preparing against him because he always has ideas that make you think. He has always tried to play well, brought a great deal to football in terms of attacking play, bringing the ball out from the back and he has been an innovator and continues to be.”Ancelotti has to negotiate a defensive crisis after Lucas Vázquez, the makeshift right-back, joined Antonio Rüdiger, David Alaba, Éder Militão and Dani Carvajal on the injured list when sustaining a foot injury inthe weekend 1-1 drawagainst Atlético Madrid. Fede Valverde, a midfielder, is poised to start at right-back and Fran García on the other flank with the 21-year-old defender Raúl Asencio and the France midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni in the middle of defence. “I think we can be competitive despite the crisis we have,” he said.The Spanish clubboycotted the Ballon d’Or ceremonyin Paris last year in protest over Rodri winning the award over Vinícius Junior. Ancelotti insisted this was correct. “I don’t think it was the wrong decision,” the 65-year-old coach said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of the 11 players who began Sunday’s FA Cup fourth-round match at Plymouth Argyle, only Luis Díaz had made more than 10 league starts this season and only three others had made more than five. Even allowing for that,Plymouth’s victoryregisters as one of the great shocks of recent times, only the fourth time the leader of the Premier League has ever gone out of the competition to lower-division opposition.As their quietly charismatic 42-year-old Bosnian coach Miron Muslić pointed out afterward, it was a day that will go down in Plymouth’s history, that will be recalled for generations, as a one-off result more impressive than anything they achieved in reaching the semi-final in 1983-84. It was Liverpool’s ninth defeat to lower-league opposition this century but, in terms of the scale of the shock, it felt perhaps most akin to their exit against non-league Worcester City in 1959 when they were a second-flight club, a defeat that precipitated the decline that led to Phil Taylor making way for the great Bill Shankly.Liverpool, in fact, tend to come out of embarrassments well. It was their shock exit to Watford in 1970 that convinced Shankly to start afresh and rebuild, winning the league three years later and laying the foundations for their subsequent domination. Even when they lost to Burnley in 2005 (when Rafa Benítez admitted he underestimated the threat Championship sides could pose; Arne Slot perhaps was guilty of something similar) it was an early pratfall in the greater narrative of their Champions League success in Istanbul later that season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionMiron Muslic: ‘Real life is a lot more difficult than playing a football game’Read moreThat such history is even being discussed suggests how important Plymouth’s win was for theFA Cup, a competition that constantly has to fight for relevance. This may not be the glory of old – there was uproar in 1959 when Billy Liddell, one star, let alone an entire team, was spared the icy pitch at Worcester – but a certain magic remains. The past two rounds had seen a number of giants having to battle to see off minnows, but the competition needed a defining shock and now it has it.For Liverpool there are awful imagined futures: documentaries produced 20, 30 years from now in which the narrator breathily intones, “For Slot, this was the moment at which it all began to go wrong.” But it really shouldn’t be. Sunday was one defeat in an otherwise almost impeccable season with an almost unrecognisable side against opponents who, as they had proved against Brentford in the previous round, are nowhere near as porous as their league record under Wayne Rooney had suggested. Plymouth may still be bottom of the Championship but they are a far more robust unit now than they were in conceding 25 goals in the seven league games before Rooney was sacked.Still, the doubt will be there, at least until Wednesday’s rearranged game against Everton, thelast Merseyside derby at Goodison. The decision to prioritise that game and last Thursday’s Carabao Cup semi-final against Tottenham is readily understandable, but what if some vital momentum has been lost? What if this is the moment at which, the Quadruple unexpectedly rendered impossible, they glance down and realise there is nothing actually sustaining them? What if the gods of football are outraged by the implied disrespect to the oldest Cup competition in the world? It’s not particularly rational to think Liverpool will suddenly collapse, but a lot in football isn’t; superstition lurks always just under the surface.Slot himself, as he had done all season, seemed admirably unruffled. He took his medicine and was gracious in defeat. One of his great strengths has been how fresh Liverpool seem. To criticise him now for his team selection would be an extremely abrupt volte face. And yet at the same time, before Sunday’s game it had still seemed possible that he might wander into English football and in his unflustered, slightly dislocated way – forever having to point out when he has made a joke – walk away with an unprecedented Quadruple. And now that dream, however unrealistic, is gone.‘Maybe they deserve to be a bit lucky’: Slot defends lineup after Plymouth lossRead moreIt shouldn’t matter. Indeed, there’s an argument that going out of the Cup will create space in the calendar, but squads can be delicate things. Liverpool have now failed to win five of their last 11 games: that run that admittedly includes the first leg of a tie they ultimately won comfortably and a Champions League dead rubber, but they are not quite the implacable machine of the autumn. Everton, rejuvenated under David Moyes, will be a major test.But this shouldn’t really be about ramifications in the league. Sunday was a great day for the FA Cup.On this day…View image in fullscreenIvano Bonetti during his days with Juventus.Photograph: Juventus FC/Archive/Getty ImagesIvano Bonetti was a prodigiously talented midfielder but one whose work-rate and attitude toward his defensive responsibilities regularly irritated managers. He had gone through seven Italian clubs, two of them twice, when aged 30, his career seemed to have come to an end at Torino. A deal was struck with Grimsby, then in the second flight, but it involved paying £100,000 to a US company who owned his rights. Bonetti paid half himself and Grimsby fans cobbled together the other £50,000. At first it worked. At the end of November, Grimsby were second in the league. That month, Bonetti had scored the winner at West Brom and torn Tranmere apart.But Grimsby hit a poor run. A 3-2 defeat at Luton on 10 February 1996 meant they had gone 10 league games in a row without a win. As the player-manager Brian Laws, who had worked under Brian Clough at Nottingham Forest, raged about Bonetti’s performance, an incident occurred that left the Italian with a fractured cheekbone, reportedly after Laws threw a plate of chicken wings at him (although the precise details have never been made clear). Bonetti left Grimsby at the end of the season, while Laws was dismissed early in the following campaign.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Behind a MVP performance from quarterback Jalen Hurts and a defensive masterclass that harried, hit and harassed Patrick Mahomes into one of the worst games of his career, the Eagles steamrolled to a 40-22 victory over theKansas City Chiefson Sunday night in New Orleans that wasn’t as narrow as the scoreline suggests.The 59thSuper Bowlwas the second meeting in three years between Philadelphia and Kansas City on the NFL’s biggest stage, with the Eagles still nursing the scars of the first installment: a heart-stopping 38-35 Chiefs win in Arizona in which a hobbled Mahomes orchestrated a near-perfect second half to overturn a 10-point deficit thaterased Hurts’ career-best performance. This one went the other way – and wasn’t nearly as close.Hurts threw for 221 yards and two touchdowns, running for 72 yards and adding a third score on aTush Push– the result more than making up for a stat line that wasn’t quite as flashy as two years ago. But it was a commanding defensive performance including a pick-six by rookie cornerback Cooper DeJean on his 22nd birthday and six sacks from the ravenous Josh Sweat, Milton Williams, Jordan Davis and Jalyx Hunt that sparked a first-half avalanche and helped ensure Philadelphia could weather a rare ordinary day from star running back Saquon Barkley.1:57Philadelphia Eagles dismantle Kansas City Chiefs to win Super Bowl – video“We had a special group this year, we were able to learn from the past,” said Hurts. “Defense wins championships. We saw how [our defense] played today. We saw the difference they made in the game. They gave us opportunities, gave us short fields. And we’re able to do what we do.”Patrick Mahomes was chasing Super Bowl history. He left humbled and harassedRead moreA mere 13 months after thewildest in-season unravellingin NFL history, Nick Sirianni’s team, built on physicality, a relentless ground attack and a swarming defense, finally delivered the knockout blow to a Kansas City dynasty that had been eyeing an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl title. It was a milestone so difficult that no team had managed to even come within 60 minutes of it until Kansas City this year. Maybe the weight was too much for these Chiefs, who looked mentally and physically taxed from as early as the first quarter while making one uncharacteristically wasteful mistake after another. Or Vic Fangio’s defense was justthatgood. Whatever the case, Sunday’s game was effectively put to bed long before Kendrick Lamar took the stage for the half-time show.“This is the ultimate team game. You can’t be great without the greatness of others. Great performance by everybody – offense, defense, special teams,” Sirianni said. “We didn’t really ever care what anyone thought about how we won, or their opinions. All we want to do is win.”The Eagles’ gameplan was simple: pound the rock with Barkley, keep things simple for Hurts and shut down Travis Kelce, Mahomes’ favorite target. They achieved them all. Barkley was denied the home-run touchdown burst he’d become expected to break but kept the Kansas City defense honest with 25 carries for 57 yards, enough to eclipse Terrell Davis’s record for yards rushing in a season including the playoffs. Hurts ran Kellen Moore’s offense to near-perfection. And by the time Kelce made his first catch, the Eagles led by 31 points with three minutes left in the third quarter.Ahead by 10-0 after Jake Elliott’s 48-yard field goal, Sweat and Hunt sacked Mahomes on consecutive plays – the first time Philadelphia managed to bring him down in five and a half quarters of Super Bowl gameplay stretching back to the start of their first meeting. Mahomes then rolled out and misfired on a throw that was picked by DeJean, who curled across the field and ran it back 38 yards for a 17-0 lead. Thesurprise All-Pro linebacker Zack Baunmade a lunging interception of Mahomes late in the second quarter and Hurts connected with AJ Brown on a 12-yard touchdown pass for a 24-0 lead. The Eagles made it 34-0 late in the third when Hurts fired a note-perfect 46-yard pass to DeVonta Smith, who became the fifth player to win a national championship, a Heisman Trophy and a Super Bowl.But it was a Philadelphia defense completely reinvented under Fangio, including eight new starters from the 2022 team, that turned Sunday’s game into a laugher. Mahomes was sacked a career-high six times by the first Eagles team to rank No 1 in total defense sinceBud Carson’s epochal 1991 unit.View image in fullscreenJalen Hurts and Nick Sirianni with the Vince Lombardi Trophy.Photograph: Matt Slocum/APOn Sunday, they delivered their masterpiece as Fangio broke an 0-8 hoodoo against Mahomes, the gifted 29-year-old quarterback who had already been crowned the NFL’s best ever. Two years after becoming only the secondSuper Bowlteam in history (along with the 1974 Steelers) to lead the NFL in sacks but fail to record one in the big game, Fangio all but copied the blueprint of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ win over Mahomes and the Chiefs in Super Bowl LV, leaning on their defensive line for constant four-man rushes while maintaining max coverage behind them.There have been seven comeback wins from double-digit deficits and Mahomes was responsible for three of them, but the Chiefs’ nightmarish first half was a bridge too far. When Kansas City’s drive to open the second half quickly stalled and the Eagles responded with a 12-play, 69-yard scoring drive capped by an Elliott field goal, even the most fatalistic Philadelphia fan could finally exhale.“Today was a rough day all around. Nothing went right. I didn’t coach well. Proud of our guys for fighting. We will learn from this,” the Chiefs head coach, Andy Reid, said. “Too many turnovers, too many penalties. Against a good football team, can’t do that.”By the time Mahomes found DeAndre Hopkins and Xavier Worthy for a couple of cosmetic touchdowns in the final three minutes that made it 44-20, steady trickles of Kansas City fans were making beelines for the concourses while chants of E-A-G-L-E-S cascaded down from the mezzanine. Before long, Philadelphia and their rabid supporters wereNFLchampions for a fifth time – and the second in the Super Bowl era – after previous wins in 1948, 1949, 1960 and 2017.Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlSuper Bowl LIXKansas City ChiefsPhiladelphia EaglesNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sustainable development of the technology would be on the agenda, she added.The general secretary of the UNI Global Union, Christy Hoffman, warned that without worker involvement in the use of AI, the technology risked increasing inequality. The UNI represents about 20 million workers worldwide in industries including retail, finance and entertainment.“Without worker representation, AI-driven productivity gains risk turning the technology into yet another engine of inequality, further straining our democracies,” she told attenders.On Sunday, Macron promoted the event by posting a montage ofdeepfake images of himself on Instagram, including a video of “him” dancing in a disco with various 1980s hairstyles, in a tongue-in-cheek reference to the technology’s capabilities.View image in fullscreenMacron deepfakes on Instagram.Composite: Instagram/Guardian CompositeAlthough safety has been downplayed on the conference agenda, some in attendance were concerned about the pace of development.Max Tegmark, the scientist behind a 2023 letter calling for a pause in producing powerful AI systems, cautioned that governments and tech companies were inadvertently re-enacting the ending of the Netflix climate crisis satireDon’t Look Up.The film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence uses a looming comet, and the refusal by the political and media establishment to acknowledge the existential threat, as a metaphor for the climate emergency – with the meteor ultimately wiping out the planet.“I feel like I have been living that movie,” Tegmark told the Guardian in an interview. “But now it feels l like we‘ve reached the part of the film where you can see the asteroid in the sky. And people are still saying that it doesn’t exist. It really feels like life imitating art.”Tegmark said the promising work at the inaugural summit at Bletchley Park in the UK in November 2023 had been partly undone. “Basically, asteroid denial is back in full swing,” he said.The Paris gathering has been badged as the AI action summit,whereas its UK cousinwas the AI safety summit. Macron is co-chairing the summit with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The US vice-president, JD Vance, and Chinese vice-premier, Zhang Guoqing, are among the other political attenders, although the UK prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, isnot attending.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Estimates of when, and if, AGI will be reached vary but Tegmark said based on statements from industry figures “the asteroid is going to strike … somewhere between one and five years from now.Developments in AI have accelerated since 2023, with theemergence of so-called reasoning modelspushing the capabilities of systems even further. The release of a freely available reasoning model by the Chinese company DeepSeek has also intensified the competitive rivalry between China and the US, which has led AI breakthroughs.The head of Google’s AI efforts, Demis Hassabis, said on Sunday the tech industry was “perhaps five years away” from achieving AGI and safety conversations needed to continue. “Society needs to get ready for that and … the implications that will have.”Speaking in Paris before the summit, Hassabis added that AGI carried “inherent risk”, particularly in the field of autonomous “agents”, which carry out tasks without human intervention, but those concerns could be assuaged.“I’m a big believer in human ingenuity. I think if we put the best brains on it, and with enough time and enough care … then I think we’ll get it right.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingClimate crisisFranceWork & careersEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Without urgent action to address skyrocketing energy costs and planning delays, the UK risks losing its position as a global leader in tech innovation and adoption.”He added: “A forward-thinking strategy that makes energy affordable, accelerates planning and boosts green energy investment is essential to securing our future as an AI superpower.”The support for zonal pricing from the SMF and its tech company clients has emerged amid a government consultation on the future of the electricity market, which has divided opinion in the industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The billionaire is leading a consortium of investors that announced it had submitted a bid of $97.4bn for “all assets” of the artificial intelligence company to OpenAI’s board of directors.The startup, which operates ChatGPT, has been working to restructure itself away from its original non-profit status. OpenAI also operates a for-profit subsidiary, and Musk’s unsolicited offer could complicate the company’s plans. TheWall Street Journalfirst reported the proposed bid.“If Sam Altman and the presentOpenAI, Inc. Board of Directors are intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away from it: control over the most transformative technology of our time,” said Marc Toberoff, the attorney representing the investors.Altman posted his reaction onXshortly after the news broke, saying, “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.” Musk famously bought Twitter in 2022 for $44bn and renamed it X. Musk responded to that post, saying, “Swindler.”Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI but left the company in 2019 and started his own AI company called xAI. Over the past several years, he’s tussled with Altman over the direction of the company. He sued OpenAI over the company’s re-structuring plans last year, dropped the suit, then re-filed it.The bid is backed by xAI and several investment firms, including one run by Joe Lonsdale, who co-founded the stealth government contractor Palantir. Ari Emanuel, who’s the CEO of the entertainment company Endeavor, has also joined the group through his investment fund.“At x.AI, we live by the values I was promised OpenAI would follow. We’ve made Grok open source, and we respect the rights of content creators,” Musk said in a statement. “It’s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was. We will make sure that happens.”Toberoff told the Wall Street Journal that Musk’s consortium of investors is ready to match or go higher than any other bids on OpenAI that may arise.OpenAI has maintained that its restructuring is essential to the longevity of the company and being able to access capital. It has said that if it keeps its non-profit structure as is, it won’t be able to keep up in the highly competitive world of AI innovation. OpenAI said it plans for the restructuring to be done by 2026.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These models, and the companies behind them, exploit human artists, using their work without permission or payment to build commercial AI products that compete with them.”Calling on Christie’s to cancel the auction, which starts on 20 February, it adds: “Your support of these models, and the people who use them, rewards and further incentivizes AI companies’ mass theft of human artists’ work.”The use of copyrighted work to train AI models – the technology that underpins chatbots and image generation tools such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney – has become a battleground between creatives and tech companies, with artists,authors,publishersandmusic labelslaunching a series of lawsuits alleging breach of copyright.The British composer Ed Newton-Rex, a key figure in thecampaign by creative professionalsfor protection of their work and a signatory to the letter, said at least nine of the works appearing in the auction appeared to have used models trained on artists’ work. However, other pieces in the auction do not appear to have used such models.‘It’s the opposite of art’: why illustrators are furious about AIRead moreA spokesperson for Christie’s said that “in most cases” the AI used to create art in the auction had been trained on the artists’ “own inputs”.“The artists represented in this sale all have strong, existing multidisciplinary art practices, some recognised in leading museum collections. The works in this auction are using artificial intelligence to enhance their bodies of work and in most cases AI is being employed in a controlled manner, with data trained on the artists’ own inputs,” said the spokesperson.A British artist whose work features in the auction, Mat Dryhurst, said he cared about the issue of art and AI “deeply” and rejected the criticisms in the letter. A piece by Dryhurst and his wife, Holly Herndon – based on a work called xhairymutantx – is on sale at the auction with an estimated price of between $70,000 and $90,000.Dryhurst told the Guardian that the piece of art being auctioned was part of an exploration of how the “concept” of his wifeappeared in publicly available AI models.“This is of interest to us and we have made a lot of art exploring and attempting to intervene in this process as is well within our rights.”He added: “It is not illegal to use any model to create artwork. I resent that an important debate that should be focused on companies and state policy is being focused on artists grappling with the technology of our time.”Anadol also rejected the criticism. In a post on X, he said the backlash was a consequence of “lazy critic practices and doomsday hysteria”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ArtnewsShareReuse this content"

The allegation is raising urgent questions about how Paragon’s government clients are using the powerful hacking tool.Three people – an Italian journalist namedFrancesco Cancellato; the high-profile Italian founder of an NGO that aids immigrants namedLuca Casarini; and a Libyan activist based in Sweden namedHusam El Gomati– announced they were among the 90 people whose mobile phones had probably been compromised last year.WhatsApp says journalists and civil society members were targets of Israeli spywareRead moreMore is likely to be known soon, when researchers at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which investigates digital threats against civil society and has worked closely with WhatsApp, is expected to release a new technical report on the breach.Like NSO Group, Paragon licenses its spyware, which is called Graphite, to government agencies. If it is deployed successfully, it can hack any phone without a mobile phone user’s knowledge, giving the operator of the spyware the ability to intercept phone calls, access photographs, and read encrypted messages. Its purpose, Paragon said, was in line with US policy, which calls for such spyware to only be used to assist governments in “national security missions, including counterterrorism, counter-narcotics, and counter-intelligence”.In a statement to the Guardian, a Paragon representative said the company had “a zero-tolerance policy for violations of our terms of service”. “We require all users of our technology to adhere to terms and conditions that preclude the illicit targeting of journalists and other civil society leaders,” the representative said.The company does appear to have acted swiftly in response to the cases that have emerged so far. The Guardian reported last week thatParagon had terminated its contract with Italyfor violating the terms of its contract with the group. Italy had – hours before the Guardian’s story broke – denied any knowledge of or involvement in the targeting of the journalist and activists, and said it would investigate the matter.David Kaye, who previously served from 2014 to 2020 as a special rapporteur on freedom of expression and opinion said the marketing of military-grade surveillance products, such as the kind made by Paragon, comes with “extraordinary risks of abuse”.“Like the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, it is easy for governments easily to avoid basic principles of rule of law. Though not all the details are known, we are seeing the likelihood of scandalous abuse in the case of Italy, just as we have seen that in other contexts across Europe, Mexico and elsewhere,” Kaye said.The issue seems particularly relevant in the US. In 2019, during the first Donald Trump administration, theFBI acquired a limited license to test NSO Group’s Pegasus. The FBI said the spyware was never used in a domestic investigation and there is no evidence that either the Trump or Joe Biden administrations used spyware domestically.In the face of increasing reports of abuse, including use of NSO’s spyware against American diplomats abroad, the Biden administrationput NSO on a blacklist in 2021, saying the company’s tools had enabled foreign governments to conduct transnational repression and represented a threat to national security.Biden also signed an executive order in 2023 that discouraged the use of spyware by the federal government and allowed it to be used in limited circumstances.It was therefore a surprise when it wasreported by Wiredlast year that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency had – under the Biden administration – signed a $2m one-year contract with Paragon. The contract was reportedly paused after the news became public and its current status is unclear. Ice did not respond to a request for comment.Italian founder of migrant rescue group ‘targeted with spyware’Read moreA Paragon representative said the company was “deeply committed to following all US laws and regulations” and that it was fully compliant with the 2023 executive order signed by Biden. The person also pointed out that Paragon was now a US-owned company, following its takeover by AE Industrial Partners. It also has a US subsidiary based in Virginia, which is headed by John Fleming, a longtime veteran of the CIA who serves as executive chair.Unlike its predecessor, however, the new US administration has publicly stated that it will seek to use the levers of government against Trump’sperceived political enemies. Trump has repeatedly said he would try to use the military to take on “the enemy from within”. He has also singled out career prosecutors who have investigated him, members of the military, members of Congress, intelligence agents and former officials who have been critical of him, for potential prosecution. He has never explicitly stated that he would use spyware against these perceived rivals.Researchers like those at Citizen Lab and Amnesty Tech are considered the leading experts in detecting illegitimate surveillance against members of civil society, which have occurred in a number of democracies, including India, Mexico and Hungary.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsCybercrimeIsraelWhatsAppTrump administrationDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

According to my favouriteWikipediawormhole, that’s just one of the many possible ways our universe could bite the bullet some 100 quindecillion (give or take a few septillion) years from now.To me, Wikipedia’s seemingly innocuousTimeline of the far futurepage (along with its existentially harrowing cousin,Ultimate fate of the universe) is the perfect encapsulation of the internet’s inbuilt dissonance: monolithic in meaning but oh-so pedestrian in its presentation. It offers a snapshot of mind-boggling scientific theory wrapped up in a boring, colour-coded spreadsheet, built and tended to by faceless back-end contributors who are probably goosing up Elon Musk’s own Wikipedia page at the same time as they’re casually cataloguing the theoretical extinction of the Y chromosome 5m years from now.A wholesome escape from the housing crisis: the Facebook group dedicated to retro Australian homesRead moreEvery year of human history has its own dedicated Wikipedia page, going back as far as719BC(when apparently not much happened other than Zhou Huan Wang becoming ruler of China). Some years are leaner than others, naturally, but in general these pages offer a useful TL;DR snapshot of major world events, famous births and deaths and astronomical phenomena.As you scroll through the 2020s, though, you’ll notice that the pages keep going: 2026, 2027, 2028 and so on. The reliably dull Wikipedia interface remains unchanged, even as recorded history cedes tospeculativehistory.View image in fullscreenSpectators at a performance of John Cage’s As Slow As Possible – which began in 2001 and is scheduled to conclude in 2640.Photograph: Markus Schreiber/APIt’s possible to surf Wikipedia into the far future, with each page offering a best-guess as to what that year, decade, century or millennium might have in store. In 2029, “The digital time capsule ‘A Message from Earth’ will reach its destination on the planet Gliese 581c.” In 2085, “The ‘secret’ letter of Queen Elizabeth II will be opened in Sydney.” In 2140, “All of the roughly 21 million Bitcoins are expected to be mined.”It’s a heady mix of asteroid near-misses, grim climate catastrophe and bizarre geopolitics until about the 24th century, when things start to get really trippy: a “negative equinoctial paradox” in 2353, every person in Japan having the same surname by 2531, and “the 639-year-long performance of John Cage’s organ work As Slow as Possible” concluding in 2640.View image in fullscreenA still from the film 2012.

I get that same feeling by scrolling these Wikipedia pages, reading history before it’s happened; me at my little desk with my little keyboard doing my little jobs, trying to wrap my head around a world in which future archaeologists identify the “urban stratum” of fossilised coastal cities – just like mine – 100m years from now.

But nor can we succumb to the momentum of the rightMon 10 Feb 2025 12.46 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 19.06 ESTShareThe problem with Trump’s America is that everything happens so fast, and across too many categories. There are moves so stupid and trivial that you can lose hours wondering whether there is a long game or if it’s all just trolling: renaming the Gulf of Mexico, bringing back plastic straws. There are moves so inhumane, causing so much deliberate suffering, that they are hard to fathom. The cancellation of USAid is so consequential that reaction has almost frozen in place, as the world figures out which immediate humanitarian crisis to prioritise, and waits for some grownup, such as the constitution, to step in. Into that baited silence steps Elon Musk, with ahoax about the agencyhaving been a leftwing money-laundering organisation. Then everyone hares off to react to that, first debunking, then considering, what it might mean, for a man of such wealth and power to have come so completely unstuck from demonstrable reality. This is not an accident – and yet it has no meaning. So why is he doing it? To galvanise a base, or make a public service announcement that observable reality can’t help you now, so get used to having it overwritten by fantasy? It’s an understandable thing to worry about.Then there are the chilling direct legislative moves against sections of US society:banning the use of any pronounsthat are not male or female in government agencies, defunding gender-affirming medical care, signalling aban on transgender people in the militarywith an executive order that says being trans “conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honourable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life”. There’s the assault on immigrant rights, which is vivid and wide-ranging from the resurrection of Guantánamo Bay as a for ever holding-house, to theshackled people deported to Punjab, to thereversal of a conventionthat schools, churches and hospitals would not be raided byImmigration and Customs Enforcement.The sabre-rattling on tariffs throws up its own unstable side-show. Bit-part Republicans such as Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana senator, try to carve out some space in the drama with remarks so bracingly racist –the maternal death rate isn’t as bad if you don’t count black women, apparently – that you’re forced to give him the attention he craves. Ignoring him will not make him go away.There will never be any shortage of things to react to; nothing will ever be inconsequential. Even things that misfire comically or are immediately ruled illegal will have an effect, drive the debate to new lows and foster fear and division. And there will rarely, from outside the US, be any meaningful way to react; whatever ideas about democracy we’ve had to let go of in 2025, it remains bordered.There’s an agenda to that too, of course. If the watching world is constantly responding to things it can’t change or even protest about, that sends spores of impotence far and wide. Events in the US are already debasing our own discourse: Trump cheerleaders springing up with bizarre arguments and the leader of the opposition Kemi Badenoch strategically claiming thatliberalism has been “hacked”by groups focused on“radical green absolutism”. The effect? Everything is pushed rightwards.It might be impossible to blot out the drama, but we have to simultaneously focus on our own debates and our own terms – the threats to trans rights in our own country, the language on immigration in our own parliament, our own burgeoning politics of nastiness and tough-talking. We don’t have to surrender to the momentum of the right by becoming more like them. We don’t have to catch this virus because America sneezed.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Palestinians in Gaza have shown this is not entirely a myth. With the shaky ceasefire barely holding, hundreds of thousands of genocide survivors have emerged from the carnage in this land, whose civilization goes back4,000 years,marching to north Gazawith hope, despite knowing that almost all their homes, roads, services, schools and hospitals have been wiped out. Thereal aspirationof most of them is to keep marching home, to where their familieshad been ethnically cleansed during the 1948 Nakba. Palestinians, it seems, have presciently responded to “Donald Trump’s plan” even before he spat it out.Despite his sinister side, the US president has mastered the skill of dominating the airwaves and cyberspace through manufacturingdissent. With one outrageous statement after another, he has managed to preoccupy the minds of most nations, leaving almost everyone guessing what his next “unhinged” move may be. But he is not the first to indulge in pretending he is “crazy”. Richard Nixon did too. They subscribe to a “madman theory”, creating the perception of insanity, to achieve two simultaneous goals: throwing friends and foes alike off balance, to the edge, as a means of extracting from them prized concessions and normalizing the patently abnormal: anunmaskedmight makes right order.Trump’s recent proposal to “take over” and “own” Gaza afterforcibly displacingmillions of Palestinians must be seen in this light. It has been widely condemned, even by despotic Arab regimes and Germany, with many describing it as “criminal”, “illegal”, “immoral”, “impractical”, or “destabilizing”. This global dissent inadvertently normalizes the idea, making it merely controversial, debatable, not categorically dismissible.Trump’s Gaza remarks are no surprise: ethnically cleansing was always the plan | Arwa MahdawiRead moreInciting for the forced displacement of Palestinian genocide survivors constitutes a “continuation” of the genocide, as a Palestinian human rights organizationputsit. Beyond depraved; it is sheer evil. It is a desperate attempt to normalize the commission ofatrocity crimesand to achieve through US imperialist bullying what Israel’s military prowess hasutterly failedto accomplish after 15 months of genocide. Indeed, only 4% of Jewish-Israelis believe that Israel’s goals were fully achieved in Gaza, according to a recentpoll. The former US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin as early as December 2023 warned Israel of such a “strategic defeat”.Indeed, despite the typical militaristic bravado, it is far from evident that the Israeli establishment wishes to resume the ruthless bombardment and massacres in Gaza. Israel’s economy is experiencing what 130 of its top economists describe as a “spiral of collapse”, with an almost unprecedented “brain drain”, anosediving tech industryand a credit rating that is near “junk” levels, according to Moody’s. Increasinglyseen by investorsas ashut-down nation, Israel hasranked dead lastamong 50 countries in the just released Nations Brand Index. The chairman of the Israel Export Instituteadmits, “BDS and boycotts have changed Israel’s global trade landscape.”As evidenced by repeated UN votes, the overwhelming majority of nations today see Israel as arogue statethat has not onlyexterminatedtens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, and in a few weeks killed thousands in Lebanon and occupied large swathes of Syria, but is simultaneouslybulldozing the very tenets of international law. Its prime minister iswantedby the international criminal court for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The international court of justice in January 2024 decided that it isplausibly committing genocideand in July 2024ruledthat its occupation is illegal and it is an apartheid state.This all explains why Trump isnowamplifying an old Israeli plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza to do Israel’s bidding. Days into the start of Israel’s genocide in October 2023, a leaked Israeli ministry of intelligence documentrevealeda plan for ethnically cleansing Palestinians from Gaza to Sinai at the end of the “war”. Not to be outdone, and to make forced displacement sound normal in comparison, on 5 November 2023, Israel’s minister of heritage (Jewish Power party), Amichai Eliyahu,suggested dropping a nuclear bombon the Gaza “ghetto”.Francesca Albanese, UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the 1967 occupied Palestinian territory, haswarned: “If it is not forced to stop, Israel’s genocide of Palestinians will not be confined to Gaza. Mark my words.” The Israeli war minister, Israel Katz, hasreferredto the military attack on Jenin in the occupied West Bank as “the first lesson from the method of repeated raids in Gaza”. The Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a self-declared “fascist homophobe”, has incited fanatic colonial violence against Palestinians in the West Banksaying: “Nablus and Jenin need to look likeJabalia.”But wiping out Palestinian towns to forcibly displace their residents is nothing new in this ongoing Nakba. A recent error by Israel’s censors has accidentally revealed secret documents exposingDavid Ben-Gurion’s conscious decision to “wipe out” Palestinian villagesduring the 1948 Nakba, as a necessary condition to create what the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem todaycalls“a regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea”.While global outrage against Trump’s plan abounds, the Biden administration, the “lesser evil”, the mainpartner in arming, funding and shielding from accountability Israel’s genocide, has entertained Israel’s proposed ethnic cleansing plans without provoking similar media outrage. It has abortivelyapplied immense pressureon the Egyptian regime to go along with the plan in return for large investments.Trump’s grotesque Gaza proposal is appalling on every level | Kenneth RothRead moreObviously, all settler colonies, not justIsrael, have perpetrated forced displacement of Indigenous populations. US President Theodore Roosevelt towards the turn of the 20th centurywrote, “[V]iewed from the standpoint of applied ethics, the conquest and settlement by the whites of the Indian lands was necessary to the greatness of the race and to the well-being of civilized mankind.” He added, “[A] conquest may be fraught either with evil or with good for mankind, according to the comparative worth of the conquering and conquered peoples.”Similarly, when asked about the rights of Palestinian Arabs in Palestine, British leader Winston Churchill in 1937said: “I do not admit that the dog in the manger has the final right to the manger even though he may have lain there for a very long time … I do not admit, for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America, or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to those people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher grade race, or, at any rate, a more worldly-wise race, to put it that way, has come in and taken their place.”But just asthe legendarysumud, resilience and resistance of the Palestinian people have defeated Israeli-US plans of ethnic cleansing, we know that our agency, our principled and strategic struggle, supported by tens of millions of people of conscience globally, can ultimately prevail over this latest plan. But without meaningful accountability measures, the Gaza ceasefire maylead to a continuation of the genocide in aless visibleform. Unspeakable criminality and shameless complicity must be met with inexorable accountability. As we have learned from the struggle against apartheid in South Africa,ending state, corporate and institutional complicity in Israel’s system of oppression, especially through the non-violent tactics of BDS, is the most effective form of solidarity with our liberation struggle.To defeat Trumpism and the rising wave of fascism worldwide, broad-tent, inclusive, anti-racist alliances are more important than ever. This is not just an ethically desired strategy to unite racial, climate, social and economic justice movements to build a critical mass of people power. The current threat to humanity shows that the intersectional unity of those struggles has truly become anexistentialneed.The Palestinian phoenix ofGazais emerging from under the rubble to reassert to the world that we shall never bow to oppressors; we shall continue to resist oppression and insist on defending our inalienable rights. But in mythology, a phoenix needs sunlight to resurrect itself, and in our case, that sunlight is blocked by dark, heavy clouds of complicity. Principled and strategic solidarity is crucial to dissipate these clouds so we can rise to our inevitable emancipation.Omar Barghouti is co-founder of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement for Palestinian rights andco-recipient of the 2017 Gandhi Peace AwardExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionPalestinian territoriesDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

A day later, the President signed anexecutive order entitled“Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit Based Opportunity.” Together, these executive orders have been used to justify an across the board targeting of all federal programs, grants, and contracts, essentially a targeting of the entire federal bureaucracy. For example, very quickly, thousands of federal web pages have been taken down, with vast amounts of data from Alzheimer’s research to clinical trials being removed.The Trump administration has taken as its chief target DEI - Diversity Equity and Inclusion. The Executive Orders Trump signed on his first two days in office have been used to justify targeting federal agencies and other institutions, and to threaten the jobs of those suspected to be less than completely loyal to the new regime, on the grounds that they embody the ideology of DEI.In the vocabulary of America’s new regime, meritocracy is meant to replace diversity in hiring. But what the administration means by “meritocracy” is distant from its original meaning. The original meaning of “meritocracy” is a system based on competence and excellence. Based on its actions, we can see that the sole metric of this regime’s judgements of merit is loyalty to the regime. The attack on DEI is thus Orwellian double-speak. But, if anything, the true danger of the attack on DEI has been overlooked and underestimated.In the Republican “Southern Strategy”, enacted most clearly and powerfully under Reagan, federal programs that wealthy individuals supported eliminating in order to make way for tax cuts were described as “welfare.” By describing such programs as “welfare”, Republicans intended to communicate that these programs were there to take money away from “hard working” white Americans and directed to benefit Black Americans, who, according to longstanding US anti-Black racist ideology, were associating with criminality, laziness, and corruption (there are of course far more white Americans onprogramsaimedto help the poor than there are Black Americans on such programs). Scientists have repeatedlyfound, at least as recently as 2018, that this strategy was successful.Research has shownthat almost half of white Americans regard Black Americans as lazier than whites, and almost as large a percentage regard Black Americans as less intelligent. By describing certain government programs as “welfare”, politicians can easily decrease their popularity among this group of Americans.The original version of the Republican Southern Strategy was necessarily limited – it was, after all, hard to describeallfederal grant-making as welfare, orallfederal bureaucracy as welfare. We are now witnessing a radical broadening of the Republican Southern Strategy, drawing on the same underlying racist attitudes towards Black Americans. The idea behind the mechanism of extending the Republican Southern Strategy to all public institutions was due to Christopher Rufo, whorealizedthat, in the expression “Critical Race Theory”, lay a potent weapon:“Strung together, the phrase ‘critical race theory’ connotes hostile, academic, divisive, race-obsessed, poisonous, elitist, anti-American.” Most perfect of all, Rufo continued, critical race theory is not “an externally applied pejorative.” Instead, “it’s the label the critical race theorists chose themselves.”Byconnecting all of federal bureaucracyto “Critical Race Theory”, Rufo could create negative attitudes towards the entire federal system.There is, however, an obvious problem with radically extending the Southern Strategy by replacing “welfare” with “Critical Race Theory.” The argument that the ideology of the federal government was Critical Race Theory was impossible to make. Critical Race Theory is a small academic subdiscipline, and the expression “Critical Race Theory” occurs almost nowhere in federal documents. To argue that Critical Race Theory was somehow guiding the funding of (for example) Alzheimer’s research at Harvard and Yale would always sound like a conspiracy theory on the level of QAnon. Even when Rufo argued that Critical Race Theory was guiding public schools, for example, his opponentscould simply challenge himby asking for evidence that this academic theory had so much power. And it was evidence that, even in the much narrower range of education, was difficult to provide.In short, “Critical Race Theory” could be deployed as an effective political weapon, for the reasons Rufo so clearly explains. But it was impossible to argue with any force that it was an ideology that governed the entire federal government.Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs are there to help ensure that workplaces are free from discrimination, and accessible (for example to the disabled). These programs are ubiquitous across federal agencies. Unlike Critical Race Theory, then, it is trivial to show that DEI is present across all federal agencies as well as institutions that the Trump administration deems hostile, such as universities.The term “Welfare” was such a potent political weapon in the Republican Southern Strategy, as it was a useful shorthand for the deeply embedded racist attitude that Black Americans were lazier and less competent than whites. Rufo and others quickly realized that “DEI” could also be used to evoke the same racist attitudes, that Black Americans needed special help to compete with white Americans, positions that they could only obtain through cheating because of their supposed lesser competence and intelligence. We know that calling programs “welfare” made many Americans think less of them. The anti-DEI campaign is the Republican Southern Strategy on steroids, as “DEI” marshals racist attitudes as effectively as “welfare”, but against a vastly broader target.The Republican Southern Strategy was a devastatingly effective weapon against America’s social safety net. By arguing that social programs were “welfare”, and benefitted supposedly undeserving Black Americans, Republican politicians could argue that funding to these programs should be slashed, and the savings handed over to the wealthy in new tax cuts. The new version of the Southern Strategy is directed not just against the social safety net, but against the entire federal government, and all the programs it supports, from health research to foreign aid to basic science. Right now, America’s legacy of racism is being now directed as a weapon against America itself.Jason Stanley is the Jacob Urowsky Professor of Philosophy at Yale University, and the author Erasing History: How Fascists Rewrite the Past to Change the FutureExplore more on these topicsUS newsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

But making the choice feels so much easier than keeping up with new releasesMon 10 Feb 2025 17.44 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 17.48 ESTShareIam a voracious reader, but it is easy to feel there are too many books in the world. How do you find the time to keep up with all those new releases? To say nothing of the overwhelm that comes from even stepping in a bookshop. There you’re faced with not only the latest titles but also the classics you’ve missed and the biographies you hadn’t heard of but find yourself drawn to. The library is the same – the masses of books too frequently inspires inertia.But around the corner from my house is the local little street library – a small wooden box with a plastic door, holding the donated books of my neighbourhood.If the books have really been squeezed in there and piled on top of each other, it can maybe fit two-dozen books. In a world filled with overwhelming choice, I love this little whittled-down selection. There may be a book I want to read, there may not. But making that choice feels so much easier.Deciding to read a book a week was the best new year resolution I ever made | Katie CunninghamRead moreThe little library provides a peek inside my middle-class neighbourhood. There is the person, or people, who have been clearing out their collection of diet cookbooks. The person who gets advanced reading copies and gives them away. The person who always drops off their copy of the Monthly, a month or two after it was released. I would love to know who seems to be slowly clearing out their collection of play scripts – and in doing so boosting my own collection. I’m interested in the people who drop off celebrity memoirs, the readers of the seemingly endless supply of sci-fi novels, and I wonder if the children have grown out of these picture books, or simply didn’t like them.Through their selection of books, I feel I’m getting closer to the people in my suburb.When I have only a limited selection to choose from, I often find myself turning over to read the blurb of books I haven’t heard of, books I possibly wouldn’t have chosen to glance at in spaces of more choice.There are people in my neighbourhood with very similar taste in books to me, but they are tapped into different circles. And so I find books which are perfectly suited to me but, somehow, passed me by: books like Cho Nam-Joo’s delightfully weird novelKim Ji-young, Born 1982, about depression and sexism in South Korea; or VV Ganeshananthan’s epic and sweeping, but still small and intimate,Brotherless Night, about the Sri Lankan civil war.I get my hands on the huge books that came out a decade ago which I didn’t read at the time, and then they faded from consciousness. This is how I come to read Donna Tartt’sThe Goldfinch(now one of my favourite novels), Paul Kalanithi’s beautiful memoirWhen Breath Becomes Airand Maggie O’Farrell’s delicateThe Hand That First Held Mine.I’m not looking at your beach body, I just want to know what you’re reading | Jodi WilsonRead moreI’ve read books I would have never thought to pick up from anywhere else. A huge fan of Ann M Martin’s Baby-Sitters Club series when I was young, I love finding the odd copy of the graphic novel adaptations (illustrated by Raina Telgemeier), which I can pick up and read in half an hour, remembering who I was when I loved these stories the first time. Going through a reading slump, I find someone has cleared out a big selection of Jodi Picoult. I haven’t read her in 15 years, and picking up one I haven’t read before is a panacea. (When I go to read a second one, I find I have reached my fill, and turn my attention elsewhere.)Not a huge genre reader, I pick out Richard Osman’sThe Thursday Murder Clubon a whim for an easy plane read. I devour it and am thrilled to see the next book in the series in the little library a few weeks later. I return the copies as I read them, and I imagine the private book club my neighbours and I are having as we read each one in turn.I still buy the latest releases; I still use my library card. But there is something nice in the quietness of the local little library, the way it connects me to my neighbourhood and to books that aren’t front of mind. I drop by every couple of days. I see if the books I’ve contributed have been picked up; I hope there will be something new for me to embrace. More often than not, I don’t pick up anything new. But the books will be waiting for me the next time I stop by, slowly turning over, in this little reflection of where I live.Jane Howard is a Walkley-award winning arts journalist and arts and culture editor at the ConversationExplore more on these topicsBooksOpinionLibrariesCommunitiescommentShareReuse this content"

He begged Pat to help him die, something he could not do. Assisting a suicide currently attracts a sentence of up to14 years in jail. When Pat’s brother contracted the same disease he couldn’t bear the thought of suffering in the same way, so he took his own life. His wife held his hand as he did so. Both she and her daughter, who was also in the house at the time, were then subjected to a months-long police investigation. When Pat’s sister found she had motor neurone disease she was determined to go to Dignitas, and died alone, far from home, without her loved ones to support her.I believe we have a duty to help families like Pat’s and to spare people a horrendous death when no other option is available to them.But we have to do it in a way that protects others from the risk of being coerced or pressured into a decision they wouldn’t otherwise take voluntarily.I’ve paid careful attention to all the evidence we have received, both orally and in writing, which is why I’m now proposing to make my bill even more robust, without making it so difficult to navigate that it would be too much of a burden for people in the last months of their lives to undertake.The advice from a wide range of witnesses, including medical professionals, lawyers, palliative care specialists, and experts in the fields of disability, coercive control and other disciplines, has been to introduce a multidisciplinary layer of protection. What they said to us makes sense, so later this week I’ll be proposing an amendment to create a voluntary assisted dying commission. It would be chaired by a high court judge or a former senior judge, thus retaining the judicial element in my bill. The commission would then authorise expert panels to look at every application for an assisted death. Those panels would have a legal chair, but also include a psychiatrist and a social worker, who will bring their own expertise in assessing mental capacity and identifying any risk of coercion. In short, I’m proposing what could be termed “Judge Plus”.The evidence we have heard from other jurisdictions that have already introduced tightly drawn laws like mine is that fears about vulnerable people being pressured into asking for an assisted death haverarely, if ever, been borne out in practice. Family and loved ones are far more likely to try to persuade a person not to do so. But I have promised to do everything I can to ensure my bill has the strongest safeguards anywhere in the world, and this change will meet that promise by making it even more robust than it was already.So I’m looking forward to the process of line-by-line scrutiny of the legislation that will start this week. But I’m very clear that we must keep at the front of our minds the terminally ill people and bereaved relatives such as Pat Malone who are being failed so abysmally by the legal quagmire they face now.Kim Leadbeater is MP for Spen Valley and sponsor of the assisted dying billDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There are several, varying definitions, but ultimately it comes down to the same answer: a large group of people bound together through shared culture, history and language. For us in Cymru, the idea of a Welsh nation is something about which we are pretty sensitive and protective. Our most provocative historian,Gwyn Alf Williams, said that Wales has “from birth … lived with the threat of extinction” and that the survival of Welsh nationhood is “one of the minor miracles of history”.To those of you who mainly knowWalesthrough the occasional holiday, the Six Nations and Gareth Bale, this might sound an odd thing to say. After all, whenever you see Wales or Welsh people represented anywhere they are loudly and unequivocally, well, Welsh.But this is not merely an expression of pride; it is a necessity. Wales is a nation of just over 3 million people bordering a country of 57 million, so there is an ever present risk that we could be swallowed up and amalgamated. Our nation didn’t even have a capital city until Cardiff was named in 1955. This insecurity about our own existence is summed up in the chorus of the songYma o Hyd, which is sung before Welsh international football matches: “Ry’n ni yma o hyd/Er gwaetha pawb a phopeth.”This translates as: “We are still here, in spite of everyone and everything.”Back in 1997, Wales voted for devolution, and the Welsh assembly was created in 1999. This officially became the Welsh parliament (Senedd Cymru) in 2020. One of the overriding motivations for devolution was that it would protect Wales and Welsh nationhood. It came with the promise that the future development of our nation would be in our hands and safeguarded. However, the emptiness of this promise has been laid bare by a system that is in many ways the worst of both worlds. Wales is left with a UK government that feels it can wash its hands of responsibility for us, while successive Welsh governments have seemingly lacked the talent, drive or fiscal levers to make Wales better.If you want an example of this, look no further than the truly awful position of culture within Wales. The numbers are stark. Arecent Senedd committee reportfound that Wales ranks second from bottom, among selected European countries, in terms of cultural services spending for each person. Only Greece was lower. Even from the miserly wider UK perspective, Wales’s cultural spend is pitiful. Cymru spends £69.68 a person for cultural services, compared with the UK’s £91.12. For context, Spain spends about £113, Ireland £149, Belgium £209 and France £237. Iceland tops the table at £691.60. In sport, it is just as bad: Wales spends £5 to £6 a head; by contrast, Ireland spends £27.50.It wasn’t always this way. Welsh cultural budgets have been slashed over the last decade. Between2014/15 and 2024/25, funding for the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales has declined by 34% in real terms. Sport Wales has seen a 9% fall, the Books Council of Wales’s total income has reduced by 20% and revenue funding for the Arts Council of Wales reduced in real terms by 29%. It is heartbreaking to see how these cuts manifest themselves day to day across Cymru. Just last weekend, the National Museum Cardiff announced it wastemporarily closing its doorsbecause of the building’s deteriorating condition.It has since reopened, but still, events tell a story. Only nine months before, the Welsh culture secretary gave assurances the building would remain open.Wales trails behind most European countries in arts and sports funding, report findsRead moreNational Youth Arts Wales, which is an umbrella organisation for the likes of the National Youth Choir and National Youth Theatre (and where Michael Sheen, Matthew Rhys, Ruth Jones and Rakie Ayola started their journeys) has railed against the “shameful” state of youth arts funding in Wales. The situation has become such that Sheen last month funded thelaunch of the Welsh National Theatreafter the National Theatre Wales “ceased to exist” following £1.6m in cuts to its core funding from Arts Council of Wales.There is a wider issue here for Wales because the arts is also a vital way in which the Welsh language is promoted. Going back to that definition of what it is to be a “nation”, a key part of it is shared culture and language. These cuts are not merely tragic because they rob individuals of all the benefits that come with the arts; they are also robbing Wales of a major part of what makes it a nation.That the National Museum Cardiff building was closed because of its dilapidated state encapsulates this very issue. Its construction in 1912 began as part of a huge nation-building programme within Wales. It was about making Wales distinct. At the time, legislation covering England and Wales didn’t say “England and Wales” as it does now; it simply read “England” (this didn’t change till the 1950s). To be a nation and not merely an appendage of England, it was felt you needed a museum. Now, 25 years into devolution, it is crumbling due to lack of funds.The blame for this sorry state of affairs lies in several places. Since the onset of Tory austerity in 2010, successive Welsh Labour governments have had to reallocate money into a struggling health service, which has to contend with a population that is older, sicker and more spread out than in England. But the Welsh Labour government must not be given a pass on this. If they were acting in the theatre, their performance as the stewards of Wales’s culture would have been lampooned and derided for totally lacking in believability. While they have been dealt a tough hand financially, there are failings that they must own.‘I’m bursting with ideas’: Michael Sheen launches new national theatre for WalesRead moreLast weekendI published the contentsof a leaked internal report from within the “cultural division” inside the Welsh government, which surveyed the views of staff. This included condemnation of the alleged lack of “real performance management taking place” within the government, meaning that “managers who may not wish to have difficult conversations can avoid them and therefore staff who are not performing ‘get away’ with it”. It also found that staff felt “there was no sense of strategic long term planning” and there was “a widely held view that ministers’ expectations are not being managed”. It is woeful that this is the department charged with overseeing culture in Wales.When you erode Welsh culture you erode Wales. The arts are not a “nice to have”; they are vital. Urgent change is needed or else the land of song risks being finally silenced.Will Hayward is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsWelsh governmentOpinionArts fundingWelsh politicsArts policyWalesNational Theatre WalescommentShareReuse this content"

Then I embraced my passion for cooking, produce and natureFranco Fubini is the founder and CEO of NatooraMon 10 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 12.46 ESTShareAs I wandered out of myNew Yorkapartment, the snow compressing on to the sidewalk in that warming dusk light gave my walk to Citarella’s on Third Avenue a rhythmic glow. It was 1999 and Christmas was a few weeks away. In the northern hemisphere, December is the season for vibrant citrus, bitter leaves and pumpkins, yet behind me someone called out: “Where can I find peaches?” I turned around to see an affronted woman standing outside the greengrocer’s. The absurdity of the moment struck me – why would someone crave peaches in the middle of winter? It is just as absurd as sitting by the pool on a blistering summer day and reaching for a warm, woolly jumper.I was already aware of the issues facing the food system; industrialised farming destroying our soils, the stomach of our planet, opaque supply chains leaving citizens powerless in making the right buying decisions, and the dominance of ultra-processed foods with zero nutritional value in supermarkets, schools and hospitals, to name a few. But this moment underscored our grave disconnect with nature and its seasons. We had normalised the idea that food can and should be eatenany time of the year. I couldn’t escape from this realisation, but little did I know that seemingly innocuous encounter in New York was to change my life for ever.After graduating from university, I was lured to the skyscrapers and energy of the Big Apple. I found myself working on the 45th floor of a Merrill Lynch office, managing portfolios for wealthy Latin American families. The view was breathtaking, and living by the daily movements and emotions of the stock market was exciting and fast-paced, yet my work was mired by an undercurrent of greed that I struggled to reconcile.My escape was cooking, it always has been. When I came home from school in Buenos Aires; for my friends at university; and later while living in NYC, roaming its streets in search of unique ingredients, cooking was always my focus: the one thing I never tired of. In hindsight it should have taken me less time to recognise food was what my life should have been built around, that blurring of lines where life and work become one. My unhappiness with work was nothing new, it came and went throughout my life, but it was getting worse each year.Nearing my 30s came a turning point and I told myself that if I did not actnow, if I didn’t change careers, soon I’d be 40 and it would be too late. An urgency kicked in and food became my north star. It was a deeply personal need. All around me a world opened up where I began to see opportunities that were up to that point invisible. A van driving past, a brand at the supermarket, or a startup food delivery service all sparked inspiration for my conviction to work with food.That was the catapult that shot me from a NYC skyscraper to the cold concrete pavement of London’sNew Covent Garden Marketat 2 o’clock in the morning, surrounded by towers of fruits and vegetables in the wholesale produce market that feeds the city. I made this leap in 2003, into the underbelly of the supply chain, working for Solstice, a fruit and vegetable supplier to top-end restaurants. It was a time when London restaurants wrote their menus based more on the origin of a recipe rather than seasons, before the real farm-to-table movement had started, and that was something I was passionate about changing.View image in fullscreenFranco Fubini, left.Photograph: NatooraThrough my work visiting markets and farmers around Europe, I saw first-hand why seasonality is critical in our ability to regain control of, and fix, our food system. All around me I could see how quickly flavour was disappearing from our plates. There was almost no access to high-quality produce that tasted amazing in large metropolises, and I resolved to do something about it. I wanted to reintroduce phenomenal flavour into people’s lives, and to re-educate and reconnect consumers with nature. In 2004, I took a company originally founded in France called Natoora, with a nascent base inLondon, and embarked on making this a reality.My dedication to flavour over the past two decades has in part been a selfish pursuit for pleasure, but it has over time given my work a deep sense of purpose. Flavour is the conduit to change, thanks to its ability to connect us to foods emotionally and impart powerful memories that stay with us for ever. Flavour can reintroduce joy into our relationship with food.I can’t say at the time I fully appreciated how impactful changing careers would be. What was ignited by passion and desire opened a new world for me. A world filled with a higher purpose, a love for my work that I hope inspires others to do the same. To fight for a better world with joy at the heart of our food.Franco Fubini is the founder and CEO of Natoora, and author of In Search of the Perfect PeachExplore more on these topicsFoodWhy I quitLondonNew YorkRestaurantscommentShareReuse this content"

A less dehumanising approach would actually be more effectiveMon 10 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 06.01 ESTShareTheimages are striking, deliberately so.They show men being taken off a bus and up the stairway of a charter jet to be deported from the UK. One has his hands shackled, escorted by numerous Border Force staff. The government, frustrated by its own polling, which shows voters don’t believe it has increased the number of people being removed, is now resorting toTrump-style TV footageof the deportation flight process.It’s a show-not-tell strategy in response to Reform’s rise in the polls – and it has a whiff of panic about it. After rightly declaring the Rwanda plan a gimmick and immediatelyconsigning it to the scrapheapof failed policies, the government is now getting lost in performative tactics that are destined to fail.Forcing those whose asylum applications have been rejected or who have overstayed their visas on to planes has never been the most effective way to return people and never will be. Being punitive just scares people into hiding. They lose contact with the authorities, living a life on the margins.Voluntary returns are far more effective, and the government should know this because it was the last Labour administration that commissioned independent agencies to run a voluntary programme that saw numbers increase. Building trust with refugee and migrant communities and treating people with dignity and humanitywas far more successfulthan an enforcement approach.Today, though, the entire returns operation is run by theHome Office, and officials quietly acknowledge they struggle to make it work because they can’t track people down who are facing destitution, surviving in hiding, fearful of the authorities.Rather than working to deliver sensible system reforms with partners who have credible solutions, the government appears to be now adopting the similar misdiagnosis that the previous Conservative government was so willing to peddle – that too many people coming across the Channel are either foreign criminals or “economic migrants” we should be rid of.But we know fromour analysis of Channel crossingsthat the top nationalities who have been making the crossings every year since 2021 include many refugees from Afghanistan, Sudan, Eritrea, Iran and Syria.It is, of course, vital that the public has trust in the government to run an orderly and controlled asylum and immigration system. But melodramatic footage and maligning narratives that risk punching down on the men, women and children in the boats who are victims of traffickers and smugglers will not give the public confidence that the system is working.To gain that confidence, the most important thing is to clear the asylum backlog and actually fix the asylum accommodation system. The use of hotels in communities across the country has become the most damaging symbol of government failure and a flashpoint for community tensions.Billions are being wasted on appallingly run contractswith private companies that cream off vast profits. Yet there is no serious plan emerging from the Home Office to trigger the contract break clauses due next year and radically reform the system.The urgency being given to removals should be focused on proposals to quickly transform asylum housing and support.Channel 4’s Go Back to Where You Came From is shocking. I’m glad it was made | Gareth BenestRead moreAnd let’s not forget,it was only in Augustthat mobs seemingly stirred up by the social media antics of the far-right criminal Tommy Robinson sought to burn refugees alive in a hotel. Communities are still healing from that appalling violence. The government must not increase mistrust with performative tactics that play into negative and dangerous stereotypes.Now is the time to focus on rebuilding those communities. Because neighbourhood institutions, such as schools and community and faith centres, are always the first line of defence against a toxic politics that pits “us v them”. It is also where for generations refugees and migrants from all parts of the world have been welcomed and supported to integrate into British life.As the formereditor of the Spectator, Fraser Nelson, acknowledges: “When it comes to integration, we have a strong overall story to tell. Our successes vastly outnumber the failures.”The way to respond to politicians who paint all refugees as illegals and seek to dehumanise migrants is not to play them at their own game. It is to be proud about our integration story, celebrate our values and focus on the importance of a shared community. Choosing to use sensationalist TV footage will simply breed division and suspicion and risk violent hate returning to our streets.Enver Solomon is chief executive of the Refugee CouncilDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And when they do drink, they are drinking less and less often than previous generations at the same age. It’s a trend happeningall around the world. The proportion of young people who drink infrequentlyis growing in the long term. In 2001, 13.6% of Australians aged 18–24 drank less than once a month. That’s since increased to 20%, or one in five.The proportion of young people who’ve never consumed a full glass of alcohol has also more than doubled since 2001, from 7.5% to 16.3%.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBut for many, abstinence is not necessarily the goal. An interest inmindful drinkingmeans trends that encourage moderation – including “zebra striping” and “damp drinking” – have taken off on social media.So, what are these strategies for cutting down? And are they really something new?What is ‘zebra striping’?“Zebra striping” means alternating between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. It effectively halves alcohol consumption for most people. This reduces the risk of intoxication because it gives your body time to process the alcohol.The term is new but the concept of alternating drinks has long been a cornerstone ofharm-reduction strategies.A UK study commissionedby a zero-alcohol beer brand found that 25% of pub goers alternate between alcoholic and non-alcoholic beer. While commercial research like this requires cautious interpretation, it does highlight a growing appetite for moderation.Is it different from ‘damp drinking’?The rise of “damp drinking” is another shift from all-or-nothing approaches to alcohol. In arecent survey, almost 40% of drinkers want to drink less compared with 6.5% who say they want to quit altogether.Going “damp” – rather than completely “dry” – means reducing alcohol without cutting it out altogether.Having a drink is reserved for special occasions, but generally doesn’t feature in everyday life. This is also known as being “99% sober”.It’s an approach that resonates with many young people who are “sober curious”, but do not want to completely abstain from alcohol.Moderationcan be a sustainable strategy for people who are not dependent on alcohol. Sometimes, even people who were dependent canachieve moderation, usually after a period of abstinence. In the past, the consensus was that people who were dependent on alcohol should only aim for complete abstinence.Should alcohol sold in Australia carry cancer warnings?Read moreStrict sobriety goals can increase the likelihood of relapse. This is referred to as theabstinence violation effect, which can sometimes lead to a cycle of binge drinking and guilt when people feel they’ve failed.Moderation strategies, such as damp drinking or zebra striping, are more likely to fosterself-compassionand gradual change.What’s behind this cultural shift?In part, popular wellness trends have promoted alcohol-free living as a positive and aspirational lifestyle. But health concerns are only part of the answer.Young people especially faceincreasing social and economic pressures, and may be more focused on professional and personal growth than previous generations.Studies show manyview excessive drinking– and accompanying anxiety and hangovers – as incompatible with their ambitions and desire to stay in control.Adding to this, social media can make what you do more visible to others – and serve as a permanent record. So some young people aremore carefulwith behaviours that might lead to regret.Theincreasing availabilityof better-tasting zero-alcohol drinks helps, too.Zero-alcohol beer and wine, and mocktails, offer a way to participate socially without the drawbacks of alcohol consumption. These alternatives havereduced the stigmaonce associated with abstaining or drinking less in social settings.This shift is also underpinned by achanging narrative around alcohol. Unlike older generations who often associated drinking with celebration and bonding, younger people are more likely to question the role of alcohol in their lives.Binge drinking, once seen as a rite of passage, simply may not be as “cool” any more.Finding support for changeGiven the health risks associated with drinking, such ascancer, liver disease and poor mental health, it’s great news more young people are reducing their drinking.Butfour in 10 young people(42%) are still consuming alcohol at risky levels.The Australiannational alcohol guidelinestry to balance the social benefits and the health risks of drinking.If you drink within the guidelines – no more than 10 drinks a week and no more than four in any one day – you have a one in 100 chance of dying from an alcohol-related illness such as cancer or heart disease.If you drink above those guidelines the risk exponentially increases.If you are looking to change your relationship with alcohol, self-reflection is a vital first step. Things to consider include:Is alcohol damaging my health, relationships or work?Do I struggle to enjoy social occasions without drinking?Alcohol and other drug support organisations, such asHello Sunday MorningandSmart Recovery, offer free, evidence-based, digital support and resources for people who want to change their drinking habits.These services emphasise harm reduction and self-compassion, encouraging individuals to set realistic goals and achieve lasting change.This articleoriginally appeared in the Conversation.

Why the secrecy?Alexander FantaBillions in EU Covid funding have gone unaccounted for. By hiding its business behind personal messaging, Brussels is dodging public scrutinyMon 10 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 03.09 ESTShareFor weeks during the height of the Covid pandemic in early 2021, the European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, personally exchanged calls and texts with Albert Bourla, the CEO of the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. Von der Leyen was seeking to secure billions of doses of vaccine.At the time, the virus was rampant, people were dying and the EU was desperate to catch up with the UK and Israel,which had moved more quickly to procure vaccines. Supplies fromPfizerand AstraZeneca were running low as a result of production issues.In a frenzied effort to get more Europeans vaccinated, the EU spent anestimated€21.5bn(£17.9bn) on an exclusive deal with Pfizer for up to 1.8bn doses. The deal was secured by Von der Leyen after her text offensive, as she later told the New York Times in aflattering interview. It was a much-needed win for the commission president, who had facedaccusations of mishandlingthe vaccine rollout earlier in the pandemic.As an investigative reporter, I filed an access request under the EU’sfreedom of information lawto the messages shared between von der Leyen and Bourla. These messages, if we had them, might provide important insights into how the controversial life-saving vaccines deal came together. They might also help to answer questions such as why the EU became Pfizer’s single biggest customer but reportedly paid amuch steeper pricefor this batch of vaccines compared with the first tranche of Covid shots it had bought.There is a bigger principle at stake here, too: EU citizens have a right to know what was being negotiated on their behalf during a public health emergency. Did the contract involve too many doses of the vaccinebought at a fixed price, with no scope for a review as the pandemic developed? Did millions of expensive jabsgo to wastebecause of the terms that Bourla secured from a panic-buying Von der Leyen?But the commission refused the request to share the messages,claimingthat the texts were “by [their] nature short-lived” and were not covered by the EU’s freedom of information law. The commission’s secrecy around its communications is so fiercely guarded that it is now defending its refusal to make the texts availablein the EU court.As things stand, any potentially controversial exchanges between EU officials and outside interests, including corporate lobbyists and authoritarian governments, can simply be moved to text or WhatsApp to dodge public scrutiny. To date, no text messages have been stored in the commission’s archives. They are unavailable for scrutiny not only in the present, but are also lost to posterity.After the commission’s ruling on my request, the New York Times and its former Brussels bureau chief Matina Stevis-Gridneff, who hadfirst reportedon the personal diplomacy between Von der Leyen and Bourla, filed a lawsuit to uncover the secret messages.The EU executive’s legal team claimed in court that the texts were not “substantive” and therefore did not qualify as documents subject to disclosure under the EU’s freedom of information law. At the same time, under questioning by the judges, commission officials admitted they had never actually seen the messages but relied on assurances from Von der Leyen’s staff about their lack of substance. No wonder one exasperated judge called the commission’s testimony “bizarre”.The commission’s disregard for transparency in this case is no accident. The EU agreed a fund worth €723bn (£600bn) of public money to revive the EU economy after the pandemic. The recovery and resilience facility, unprecedented in EU history, was supposed to finance investments in digital technologies and climate action over six years through grants and loans. But the commission and EU governments have refused to reveal all the beneficiaries to date. When my colleagues atFollow the Money, an investigative media outlet, asked for a breakdown, they reluctantly released the top 100 recipients in each country but left billions in spending unaccounted for.The secrecy may have provided a cover for suspected cases of abuse. Greek authorities areprobing allegationsof fraud linked to €2.5bn from the post-Covid recovery fund, while Italian police on behalf of EU prosecutors are investigating anotherpotential fraud caseworth €600m.Requests for information about the spending from other high-profile EU funds have also been denied or delayed for years without explanation.The EU’s administrative culture – taking its cue from the powerful bureaucracies of its founding members Germany and France – has always been secretive. But under Von der Leyen, things have become worse. Crucial documents are being held back for political reasons by “powerful consiglieri” in Von der Leyen’s cabinet, the outgoing European ombudsman, Emily O’Reilly,has claimed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Von der Leyen portrays herself as a defender against authoritarian forces and, with rightwing parties gaining ground in last year’s European parliament elections, has vowed to strengthen the rule of law in the EU.However, her reluctance to have the public interfere with her personal communication completely undermines that promise. When her executive appears to flout the rule of law and conducts its most important business in secret, it empowers those who prefer strongman politics to democratic accountability. In the long run, limiting transparency will make it easier for authoritarian leaders such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, who have rolled back the rule of law and shroud their own governing in secrecy, to claim that the EU does not have a leg to stand on.The case before the EU court, which is expected to be decided later this year, could put a limit on Von der Leyen’s secrecy. But other, more forceful measures are needed to fulfil the promise of transparency in the EU’s founding treaties and its charter of fundamental rights. Pressure for more openness must come from the media, civil society organisations and the European parliament.A complete culture change is needed. EU governments call the shots: they need to remind the EU executive that maintaining public trust means allowing people to understand how key decisions that affect their lives are made, even if such transparency makes governing – and texting – more complicated.Alexander Fanta is a journalist at the investigative news outlet Follow the MoneyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As an aside he said that “we’ll also be announcing steel tariffs on Monday” and when asked who they would affect he said “everyone”. When further asked about aluminium he replied “aluminium too” (because hey why bother to mention that upfront?).The headlines went crazy and we saw reports here of how $15bn was “wiped from the Australian share market” in the first hour of trading. That sounds like a lot until you realise it meant only about a 0.5% fall and most of it was recovered soon after.Albanese to speak with Trump as US president announces 25% tariff on steel importsRead moreAt this point I would like to pour out a long one to the USAFTA – that glorious free trade agreement the Howard government signed with the USA, whichat the time John Howard saidwas “an historic agreement” and that “it will add enormous long-term benefits to the Australian economy”.“Long-term” was less than 20 years.The Australian government might ponder such things when it rushes to talk up Aukus which the defence minister, Richard Marles,suggests“provides significant, long-term strategic benefits for all three countries”.If a free-trade agreement is able to be ignored as a mere scrap of paper, how rock solid are agreements to deliver submarines at some vague point in the future and only when the US has decided it does not have any need for them?The government might also ponder that given in 2023 we exported a touch over $800m in steel and aluminium to the US and last week thedefence minister graciously deliveredthat amount to the US as part of our instalment payment for the $360bn Aukus agreement (only 450 payments to go!).So maybe the USAFTA wasn’t a “long-term” thing, but what about the benefits? Well Howard told journalists at the time that he thought the FTA would reduce our trade deficit with the US. In reality it increased:If the graph does not display click hereGoing into a trade war with Australia is a pretty dumb thing for the US to do, given it is already “winning” the war. In 2024 we exported about $23.8bn worth of goods to the US and imported $50.6bn.Most of what we export is not steel or aluminium either.If the graph does not display click hereWe send as much wine, beer and spirits to the US as we do steel.The US is the fifth biggest destination of Australia exports, but that rather overstates its importance. In 2023 all of Australia’s exports to the US was equivalent to less than 20% of the value of just our iron ore exports to China.The US hasn’t accounted for more than 5% of all of Australia exports for nearly a decade:If the graph does not display click hereThat does not mean it is not important – especially for steel exports. As the first graph shows, around a third of our steel exports go to the US. But here’s where Trump’s actual policy (and that might be a generous use of the term) starts to become less of an issue.Tariffs are paid by the importers. So Australian exporters don’t pay anything extra, the US manufacturers needing our steel and aluminium will.If Australia was the only country Trump was targeting, then those manufacturers would start looking elsewhere to buy their steel and aluminium. They can’t do that now because the tariff will apply to imports from every country.Some US manufacturers might instead try to buy steel from US makers, but the US actually imports about twice as much steel as it exports – it needs imported steel.The US might be the biggest importer of steel in the world, but it is hardly dominant. China imports almost as much, Germany is not far behind, and Italy and France combined import more. All up only 7% of global steel imports go to the US:If the graph does not appear click hereYes, the US is important for steel exporters around the world, but it is not so large it can dictate the rules. Trump is acting like it is 1950 and the US can tell everyone what to do.This of course is a movie we’ve all seen before. Trump put the same tariffs onback in 2018and Australia at the time was able to get an exemption.As we all saw with Trump’s tariff threats to Canada and Mexico, he is mostly all hot air. Certainly, Australia has plenty of ways to make it seem as if he has got a concession from us. And our government has not shown any disinclination to genuflect before the Orange autocrat.Will Aukus be used as a way to avoid a tariff? Will our obsequiousness to Trump’s utterances on Gaza help our steel manufacturers? Possibly.But what this all shows however is that we cannot rely on our ally to do good by us. We don’t need to start raising tariffs, but the government should definitely begin supporting our local industries in a way that we might have not when playing under the old rules of pretending that free trade agreements were sacrosanct.Scraps of paper will not save us.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsEconomicsGrogonomicsDonald TrumpAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

That agreement between the three nations explicitly bans tariff hikes beyond what was agreed. Yet, on his return to the White House, Mr Trump immediately threatened steep levies on goods from Canada and Mexico – the US’s key allies – retreating only after they made tokenconcessionson drugs and illegal immigration. Now, he’s vowing freshsteel and aluminumtariffs, a direct hit on Canada.Mr Trump is exploitingpresidential emergency powersto push these tariffs with no real constraints. The bottom line is the US is breaking its word. Friends, such as the EU and theUK, as well as opponents likeChinaare also under threat. Allies will think twice before signing deals with Washington, fearingfuture betrayals. Yet Mr Trump’s administration doesn’t care – it thrives on defying global norms. Skipping this year’sG20 summit– citing host South Africa’s focus on diversity, equality and climate action, alongside Elon Musk’s fixation on white South African farmers – Mr Trump’s team is mulling an exit from theIMF and World Bank.The US has been the linchpin of postwar order. It controls the world’sfinancial, technological and militarynetworks. While rivalparallelsystems are emerging, nothing yet seriously challenges US dominance. But Mr Trump’s talk of American strength through isolation obfuscates his immediate political objective: to repackage corporate power as economic populism. Mr Trump sells tariffs as a shield against globalisation, claiming to protect workers – while actually boosting Wall Street profits. Most wealthy nations – including the US – usedindustrial policies, export subsidies and tariffs to build their economies before shifting to consumption-driven growth. The US went the furthest in this regard, hollowing out its industries to a far greater extent thanGermany and Japan.Chinahas yet to fully shift toward a consumption-driven economy. Yet Mr Trump has convinced many Americans that globalisation alone fuelled China’s rise at their expense – a deliberate distortion. It is true that imports from China cost3.7mUS jobs, mostly in manufacturing. But that’s a tiny fraction of the 170-million-strong US workforce. Since 1970, USimportsas a share of GDP have risen from 5% to 15%, yet inflation-adjusted per capita GDP hastripled.Globalisation proved a golden age for the few not the many. US labour protections were dismantled and median wages stagnated. Since 1970, the top0.5%doubled their share of US wealth, now controlling 30% of the nation’s total assets. Mr Trump’s biggest first-term policy win was a$1.9tn tax cut– a giveaway to millionaires and corporations. But it was temporary and set to expire this year. Now, theWhite Housewants to make it permanent, at a cost so high – $4.6tn – that nothing else could get done.Since 2016, bothpartiesclaim to back trade policies that help US workers by levelling the playing field. But, so far, Mr Trump’s tariff threats are mostly political theatre. He postures as tough on trade while his main policy goal is to keep funnelling wealth to the elite through pursuing trickle-down economics on steroids. The US didn’t lose to globalisation – it was sabotaged from within. Politicians, especiallyRepublicans, rigged the system to serve capital over labour. Mr Trump blames foreigners to mask the real betrayal – an ongoing con at home.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Moss tied in thread. Crack? Organic shea butter. Cocaine bricks? Shrink-wrapped foam blocks. Designers reveal the secrets of faking drugs onscreen – from popping sugar pills to snorting vitamin DKate LloydMon 10 Feb 2025 11.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 11.16 ESTShare‘Suitcases of drugs are not exactly something you’d expect to bring to work,” says Paul Cross, who was the production designer ofSupacell,the crime-laced superhero series that launched last year. Cross has had to handle quite a few in his time though, albeit fake. He recently found himself driving around London with a vanload of fake cocaine bricks. “It’s quite an odd feeling,” he says. “Not something you’d do in your day-to-day life.”From hip teen shows to crime dramas, scenes involving drugs are often pivotal in modern TV series – and ensuring these moments are safe, legal and realistic has become so important to producers that thousands of pounds can be spent on getting it right. For every brick of fake cocaine off-loaded into a fake drug den, someone like Cross has spent weeks crafting the perfect powder texture. For every pill taken by an actor, a huge amount of toil has gone into making sure it’s not harmful.We essentially had our own trap house, with six to eight people making baggies – it was like Miami ViceWhen it comes to props that actors snort, smoke or swallow, there are industry standards. Cocaine is often replicated with glucose, B12 or vitamin C powder, although the most common substitute is milk or lactose powder. “It mixes with the water in your nose and basically turns into milk,” explains Philipp Barnett, who worked on Sam Levinson’s messy, cool teen dramaEuphoria, as well asGriselda, the show about Colombian coke-smugglers.Legal weed alternatives are frequently used: plants grown without psychoactive chemicals. “It’s like disappointing weed!” Cross says. Anything else smoked is typically nicotine-free herbal cigarettes. Meanwhile, ecstasy and diazepam are sometimes substituted with sweets, but more often with sugar pills bought from pharmacists specialising in placebo drugs made especially for TV – complete with breakdowns of allergy information. “Placebo companies are extremely expensive,” says Cross. “You could easily spend £1,000 and only get the equivalent amount of the real drug you’d find on the street.”View image in fullscreen‘The entire set was moved to recreate the drug’s effect’ … Zendaya in Euphoria.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyThis means that when drugs are needed on a larger scale – such as to fill a trap house with fake MDMA, crack cocaine, cocaine and weed, as he was doing on Supacell – productions have to get creative. They used organic shea butter for crack which, says Cross, “didn’t break the same way but looked authentic from a distance”. For the weed, they wrapped moss in thread, sprayed it with glue, and rolled it in herbs. Meanwhile, 1,000 blocks of cocaine were created by wrapping the foam blocks used for flower-arranging in shrink wrap. The entire process took about a month.“We had a dedicated area in the art department with about six to eight people focused solely on making and bagging drugs,” Cross says. “We essentially had our own trap house running upstairs. It was like Miami Vice.” How many little plastic baggies did they need? “Thousands.”For Griselda, Barnett and his team employed Styrofoam bricks dusted with milk powder. “In one scene, Griselda captures some product from the competition and ceremoniously sets it ablaze. We had to ensure it could burn without melting into Styrofoam goo. The biggest surprise came when we shot the scene with a drone: the updraft from the fire combined with the drone’s downdraft created a fire vortex, and we almost set the surrounding palm trees on fire.”While TV shows don’t have drug coordinators in the same way that they have intimacy coaches, most British crime dramas do consult with advisers – typically former police officers, who ensure drug-related storylines maintain realism. Some shows go further. John Singleton, the director ofSnowfall, an 80s-set drug-dealing drama, employed ex-convict Avance “Smokey” Smith, who’dgrown upin LA at that time, around “gangs and drugs” and with a parent using crack cocaine, to provide personal insight.Smokey provided input on everything from the clothes and hair of the era to how to make realistic-looking fake crack using the same recipe dealers would use to dupe addicts in LA. “It’s a pill called Pamprin. When you crush it and mix it with vitamin E and baking soda, it makes it clump up.”View image in fullscreenAdvised by a former prisoner … Snowfall.Photograph: Michael Yarish/Michael Yarish/FXRobb Wilson King, Breaking Bad’s production designer, took a similar approach to making sure the crystal meth on the “schoolteacher to drug kingpin” drama was realistic, consulting with both officers from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and dealers he befriended on the streets of Albuquerque, where they were shooting the show.“By operating this way,” King recalls, “we were able to access neighbourhoods and homes used for cooking meth. We even made friends with some of these people.” The chemical smell of the drug being manufactured lingers in his memory. “It was pretty scary. You’re dealing with a real dangerous thing. If it’s done wrong in your presence, you could suffer. But it’s important to feel it and see it – you can translate that to film.” He learned what tools were needed to create “lo-fi” meth in labs constructed from everyday kitchen equipment that “could blow up at any time”.They did “mid-range” cooking as well, he adds, and a DEA consultant was on hand to educate the team about how meth is made, consumed and even how their raids are conducted. “They were also likely there to ensure we didn’t spill too many beans in the show, because there were a lot of secrets involved. You don’t want ‘the cooking family’ to know what the DEA is doing.” The fake meth they created was so realistic, says King, it sometimes got stolen from the set.Fake drugs would also vanish from the set ofSkins, the wild, 2007 teen drama, but that was the least of the team’s concerns while filming the show’s notorious party scenes. Amelia Shankland, production designer, recalls that filling the background with young extras who had no prior TV experience could lead to things getting chaotic. “We’d have parties where people brought their own things in. As you can imagine, when you’re working on a project where everyone is supposed to be absolutely caned, not everyone will be acting. Some will actually be caned. Navigating that line can be quite tricky.”Today, a big issue is convincing actors to consume the fake drugs. “On something likeSkins, it was a young group of actors who were probably a lot more tolerant of things,” says Shankland. “Most actors don’t like smoking herbal cigarettes because they can be rough to inhale. I imagine it’s the same with snorting anything.”View image in fullscreenBrand problems … Sagar Radia as Rishi in druggy financier series Industry.Photograph: Nick Strasburg/BBCActor Jonah Hill has spoken candidly about his experience of snorting vitamin D as faux cocaine in The Wolf of Wall Street. “If you get that much in your lungs, you get very sick,” he revealed. “It sort of clogs your nose up,”Andrew Rannells said of snorting vitamin B12 in Girls. “I do think there’s a tiny bit of placebo effect. You do have energy – but it’s not the best way to take vitamins!”As for scenes where actors are smoking weed, Barnett says: “The biggest challenge is making it look authentic – because most actors aren’t smokers. Holding a cigarette becomes something they might need to practise.”Another difficulty regards brand placement. TV shows will often borrow items like tech, alcohol and clothing from brands to use while filming, under the agreement that they won’t be used in scenes where characters are doing anything that could be damaging to their reputations. Dominic Roberts, who worked on season two of the drug-fuelled investment banker series Industry, said this was a particular challenge on the show. “Where characters are obviously wealthy,” he says, “they’re likely to use top-end phones. Quite frankly, those manufacturers don’t really want to see people snorting cocaine off their phone,” he says. To navigate this, they put phones in cases and replaced premium tech with non-branded alternatives during drug-taking scenes.Oh my God, I’ve met the people who own this house!Another tricky area involves any drug that features a logo, like ecstasy tablets or drug baggies. “We can’t display graphics or photographs that haven’t been cleared,” Roberts explains, meaning permission had to be sought. This necessitated a lot of detective work: “Who designed this little smiley face, or this unicorn on this pill?”However, the most important hurdle in showing drugs on TV often lies in authentically capturing the intensity of a drug-fuelled experience. Skins had the advantage of a young, partying cast and crew. So instead, production designers focused on creating the right setting: houses borrowed for parties looked so trashed that when the cast arrived, it felt like they’d been raving for hours. That meant strewing mess everywhere and even throwing things at the walls. Shankland says: “I was like, ‘Oh my God, I’ve met the people who own this house.’”For Euphoria, designers used elaborate staging to take viewers on a high with the characters. “In the first season,” says Barnett, “whenZendaya, in a drug-fuelled state, climbs a set of stairs and goes through a hallway that becomes unstable, the entire set had to be built on a pivot and then moved to recreate that effect.”When filming wraps up, what happens to all the fake drugs? For Cross, on Supacell, the process was simple: it all got blown up. “There’s a gunfight in the trap house, with puffs of cocaine exploding in the air. We got good value out of it.” On Breaking Bad, meanwhile, the team had created a faux product so authentic-seeming that they were not allowed to hold on to it. “We had to return everything to the DEA,” says King, “so they could destroy it as if it were real. They didn’t want it out there on the streets.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBreaking BadZendayaSkinsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s also surprisingly moving – and may well leave you in tearsLucy ManganMon 10 Feb 2025 17.00 ESTShareIf Virdee is what we get to mark the naming of Bradford as this year’s city of culture (congratulations, Bradford!) then I’m going to need it to be so anointed until at least 2029. The six-part thriller is an adaptation by Amit Dhand of his own book City of Sinners. It’s the third in a series set in the troubled West Yorkshire town and centred round Detective Harry Virdee and his conflicted personal and professional loyalties, and I am going to need them all.This is a switchbacking ride from the off. We open with a man apparently on the run from the police, until it turns out heisthe police. Virdee (Game of Thrones’ Staz Nair) is in pursuit of the man he suspects can give him the whereabouts of missing teenager Ateeq Farooqi (Yousef Naseer). But, after the eventual arrest, he is taken to task by his brother-in-law Riaz (Vikash Bhai) for not lettinghimhandle the matter “unofficially”. They are on the same side here, he insists to Virdee. A missing kid is bad for business. It is clear that Riaz is a very shady brother-in-law indeed, but neither Virdee the man nor Virdee the show is in the habit of lingering, so with the first of many tantalising set-ups complete, he is off to a friend’s wedding to plunge us into the maelstrom of difficulties that is his private life.Virdee is estranged from his Sikh family after marrying Saima (Aysha Kala), a Muslim woman; their attendance at the wedding is an attempt at rapprochement. Despite his mother’s longing to welcome her son and daughter-in-law back into the fold – via a scene so unexpectedly moving that I was on the verge of tears – his father will not countenance it. The next scene between them, when Virdee takes food to his parents’ house to see if they can be welcomed for Diwali, is so painful it is hard to watch. It is also emblematic of Dhand’s great talent for finding the emotionally universal in the culturally specific. Parental hopes and dreams, however unreasonable, die hard and familial misery knows no bounds.View image in fullscreenQuietly shattering … Staz Nair as Harry Virdee with Aysha Kala as his wife Saima.Photograph: Sam Taylor/BBC/Magical SocietyAgainst this backdrop of quietly shattering scenes and their flipside (the deeply romantic, tender bond between Virdee and Saima that has been forged in the fire) unfurls an incredibly satisfying plot. As the missing boy’s absence stretches into its third week, the detective and his new partner DS Amin (Danyal Ismail) piece together his involvement in the county lines’ drug trade, and his work as an informant while a turf war begins to brew between the two rival gangs wanting control of the city. As the hunt for the child becomes more desperate, Virdee moves ever closer to Riaz’s side of the line. The idea of the conflicted cop is of course one with which we are familiar, but it is given fresh life here – in a situation where corruption begins to seem almost like sheer common sense. Do the bad thing to a bad man and get a good family their boy back. If you can’t fix your own family, at least do what you can to fix theirs.Dhand says he wrote the book first in the form of a screenplay and it shows. There is no waste: everything that happens is punchy and earns its place. He has a gift of an actor in Nair, whose charisma allows Virdee to be ineffably cool and also wholly convincing as a man still struggling to come out from the shadow of his father’s influence and build a life that is properly his own. Dhand’s show is a minor study in masculinity as well as in racial, religious and intra-community divisions, and it does all this with a light but wholly assured touch.And it is, throughout, tremendous fun; the action moves fast and touches on most of the traditional thriller tropes only to give them a fresh new spin as it flies past. I hope Dhand is already hard at work adapting the next book. Here’s to Bradford, city of culture 2025-29!Virdee aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

If I’d moved, everyone would have had an eyeful’Interviews byHannah VerdierMon 10 Feb 2025 09.42 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 18.06 ESTShareBob Stanley, co-writerSt Etienne did a club tour in early 1991 and we were hearing all these dancehits like DJ H featuring Stefy’s I Like Itand(I Wanna Give You) Devotion by Nomad. We thought: “Let’s go home and write something that will work in a club.” We made the song as basic as possible, with a memorable hook.Sarah Cracknell sang on the original demo and Pete Wiggs and I pressed up the white label promo records ourselves and drove around London dropping them off in various shops: City Sounds at Holborn, Black Market Records in Soho and Zoom in Camden. We were stupidly confident about it. We thought it’d be a big hit. That’s about the only time I’ve ever thought that about a record.We’d just pressed a second batch when the track was picked up by Arista, who wanted to sign us, but we couldn’t because we were already on Heavenly and were about to release our first album as St Etienne, Foxbase Alpha.We thought we'd be able to stroll into Top of the Pops – but they wouldn't let us inWe had to re-record the song and the vocals because Sarah was under contract too, so she suggested her friend, Janey Lee Grace, could sing on it. We came up with the alias Cola Boy, but when the song took off we realised we’d have to do personal appearances in clubs to promote it. So I got my mate Andrew Midgley, who I’d met when I was working in Virgin Records in Peterborough, to be Cola Boy. I remember it was released the same time asGypsy Woman (La Da Dee) by Crystal Waters. Mixmag tipped us both as the hot singles of the week.When Cola Boy went on Top of the Pops, Pete and I just assumed we’d be able to stroll in, but they wouldn’t let us into the studio. So we had to watch it at home. It was really odd seeing one of my best mates on TOTP. Me and Pete were both huge fans of theBrill Building pop eraso to do something together, involve our friends and get on TOTP was really exciting. It was like our own hit factory – and far less frightening than having to see yourself on TV.Janey Lee Grace, singerI started my career as a backing singer for Wham! and Mari Wilson, but I was fired from being a “Wilsation” because I wouldn’t cut my hair short and dye it bright yellow. At that time I was trying to do my own stuff. I’d done a cover of Love to Love You Baby with Paul Oakenfold, which got to the very bottom of the dance chart.After Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs of St Etienne called, it took me two hours to get to the session and two hours to get back – and I was only in there for 50 minutes! They just said, “Can you sing, ‘7 Ways to Love’?” then, “Can you ad-lib?” and then, “You’re done.” I was saying: “What about the verse? And the chorus?” But that was it.Andrew and I went straight into doing PAs in the clubs. I know how lucky I was that I got to go to all the raves without being the person driving up and down the country. I’d swan in to all these places, including Ministry of Sound and Heaven, only have to stay for an hour and then I’d get paid. Take That supported us on our first few PAs. They were lovely and asked us for our autographs.When we did a photoshoot for Smash Hits, I told the stylist I liked 60s stuff: feather boas and glamour. So she promised to find me something fabulous. We got to the shoot and she’d brought a worryingly small suitcase containing a mustard rollneck jumper and a below-the-knee tartan kilt. I ended up wearing the photographer’s biker jacket for the photos and the hairdresser pinned up and backcombed my hair as a distraction. That 60s beehive became my look.When we did Top of the Pops, I needed a new outfit because I only had one and I’d already worn it on our first TV appearance onThe Hitman and Her. My manager and I jumped in a cab to a vintage shop in the East End where I found the perfect dress – except it was too tight. I couldn’t really move in it, which is why I’m standing so still and only waving my arms on TV.

If the broadcasting stars align, a spin-off can breathe new life into familiar intellectual property and become beloved in its own right. Or else it can be Joanie Loves Chachi. Or HolbyBlue. Or Baywatch Nights. Or insert any number of best-forgotten flops.Whether it’s a sequel or a prequel, creating something new from a previous hit is a risky business, but it can reap rewards. In the week that theBBC successfully launched Amandaland, an offshoot of Motherland, and the Breaking Bad prequel Better Call Saul celebrated its 10th anniversary, we’ve selected the 10 best TV spin-offs of all time.There’s no room on the list for Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon, which may still become a classic but has yet to truly catch fire. Fear the Walking Dead, The Colbert Report, Lou Grant, Holby City, Beyond Paradise, Mork & Mindy and Melrose Place can also consider themselves unlucky. Post-Friends stinker Joey, however, definitely can’t.Can a small-screen spin-off ever improve on the original? These are the 10 shows that came closest – and, in a few rare cases, actually achieved it …Amandaland (2025)View image in fullscreenA total hoot … Amanda (Lucy Punch) with Mal (Samuel Anderson) in Amandland.Photograph: Natalie Seery/BBC/Merman“I’m actually glad I took the kids out of private school. They’ve got way more chance of getting into Oxbridge from a bog-standard state.” The new sequel to parenting comedy Motherland is far better than many expected, mainly thanks to retaining the original’s bitingly sharp writing team, and lead Lucy Punch is a total hoot. We follow the awful Amanda as she downsizes post-divorce and desperately tries to cling on to alpha mum status. Joanna Lumley steals scenes as her posh, pass-agg mother. A giddy mix of slapstick, class satire and school-gates politics that’s almost as heartfelt as it is hilarious.Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999-present)At 566 episodes and counting, SVU has outlasted and outshone the original Law & Order. Ushered in by a banger of a theme tune, NYPD stalwarts Elliot Stabler and Olivia Benson (terrifically played by Christopher Meloni and Mariska Hargitay) attempt to bring sex offenders to justice. The grimly gripping NBC police procedural remains addictive and remarkably consistent in quality. It’s currently the longest-running live action show on US TV – and will soon overtake Lassie in the all-time list. Woof.Angel (1999-2004)View image in fullscreenGrittier than its mothership show … Angel.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyAfter breaking Buffy’s heart and dodging death, 240-year-old vampire Angel (David Boreanaz) upped sticks to LA in search of redemption. Our brooding antihero became a private detective, hunting demons and “helping the helpless”. A sort of supernatural noir, it was grittier and more mature than its mothership show. A procession of guest stars from the original series provided a reminder of its Sunnydale roots – notably fan favourite Spike (James Marsters), who stayed for a whole series. When the show was unexpectedly axed after five seasons, creator Joss Whedon described it as“Healthy Guy Falls Dead From Heart Attack”.Young Sheldon (2017-2024)A prequel to The Big Bang Theory, this cutely retro sitcom follows Texas child prodigy Sheldon Cooper (Iain Armitage), with Jim Parsons, AKA adult Sheldon, on narration and executive-producing duties. The bow-tied brainiac tries to fit in, despite his precocious intellect and social ineptitude, against a nostalgic 1990s backdrop. Zoe Perry – lookalike daughter of the great Laurie Metcalf – shines as Sheldon’s sardonic mom. The spin-off recently spawned its own spin-off, Georgie and Mandy’s First Marriage. “Bazinga!” indeed.The Good Fight(2017-2022)View image in fullscreenSmart and slick … Audra McDonald, Christine Baranski and Nyambi Nyambi in The Good Fight.Photograph: Elizabeth Fisher/CBSWho doesn’t need more Christine Baranski in their lives? Set a year after The Good Wife’s finale, this smart and slick CBS series saw Baranski’s wryly formidable Diane Lockhart rebuild her reputation at a new Chicago law firm. The gloriously magnetic star was joined by a stellar supporting cast including Rose Leslie, Cush Jumbo and Michael Sheen. It deftly mixed courtroom drama with social commentary and ripped-from-the-headlines political plots, gradually morphing into an audacious howl of protest against Trump’s America.Endeavour(2012-2023)The mighty Inspector Morse had already spawned one spin-off, the serviceable but plodding Lewis. This 60s-set prequel was far superior. Shaun Evans excelled as troubled young DC Endeavour Morse, teamed in Oxford CID with streetwise veteran DI Fred Thursday (the always superb Roger Allam). After being a classy, cosy crime treat for more than a decade, it bowed out with a glimpse of John Thaw’s trademark red Jaguar and a blast of Barrington Pheloung’s Morse theme.Daria (1997-2002)The Simpsons, to our mind, doesn’t quite qualify. Sure, it started as a recurring segment on The Tracey Ullman Show but it grew, rather than spun off. Instead, our animated choice is this MTV cult classic. It’s ironic that one of 90s comedy’s smartest female characters began as a foil to sniggering morons Beavis and Butthead. Daria Morgendorffer’s star vehicle saw the disaffected 16-year-old offer scathingly cynical observations about high school and family life. The New York Times called her “a blend of Dorothy Parker, Fran Lebowitz and Janeane Garofalo”. High praise.Better Call Saul (2015-2022)View image in fullscreenProfound … Bob Odenkirk as Jimmy McGill, left, with Rhea Seehorn as Kim Wexler in Better Call Saul.Photograph: Robert Trachtenberg/APNobody foresaw aprequel series about Walter White’s dodgy lawyer – let’s face it, a pretty left-field pitch – coming close to Breaking Bad. In the event, it arguably bettered it. Creator Vince Gilligan crafted a bold, beautiful tragicomedy about deeply flawed antihero Jimmy McGill, sublimely portrayed by Bob Odenkirk. His origin story traced his journey from slippery Chicago conman to aspiring Albuquerque attorney – ultimately becoming the flamboyant Saul Goodman, shady representative of drug cartels. Slower burning and more cinematic than BB, it was profound, immersive and exceeded all expectations.Torchwood (2006-2011)This anagrammatic Doctor Who spin-off was like “Buffy goes to Cardiff” – sexed-up, post-watershed sci-fi for a teen and twentysomething audience. It was led by John Barrowman as former Tardis companion Captain Jack Harkness. The immortal con artist from the future hired a crack team of bright young things to hunt aliens escaping from the space-time rift beneath the Welsh capital. It became a huge cult favourite (see the outcry when Ianto Jones was killed off) and broke BBC Three ratings records. Fans still hope for a revival, especially now thatTorchwoodcreator Russell T Davies is back at the Whoniverse controls. C’mon, RTD, do it for Ianto.Frasier (1993-present)View image in fullscreenA masterstroke … Kelsey Grammer as Dr Frasier Crane, David Hyde Pierce as Dr Niles Crane, Jane Leeves as Daphne Moon, Peri Gilpin as Roz Doyle in Frasier.Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesPompous psychiatrist DrFrasierCrane occupied a fairly lowly position in the Cheers ensemble. He was originally conceived as the third wheel in a love triangle with leads Sam and Diane. It proved a masterstroke to relocate him to Seattle for his own series, which blossomed into one of the all-time great network sitcoms. A dazzlingly witty, screwball-style comedy was built around the fizzing chemistry between Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce as Frasier’s equally snooty brother Niles. It gobbled up Emmy wins, tossed salads and scrambled eggs for 11 superlative seasons. The patchy 2023 reboot didn’t come close and was recently axed by Paramount+.What have we criminally overlooked?

The Sims is a lot bleaker than I rememberWhen EA surprise-dropped a rerelease of The Sims 1 and 2, I was delighted to return to a defining video game of millennial childhoods – but it feels different 25 years laterBex April MayMon 10 Feb 2025 10.16 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 17.36 ESTShareWhen I was growing up, the genre-defining dollhouse sim The Sims was the ultimate escape. I’d build dream homes, cultivate a neighbourhood of weird and wonderful friends and live out a fantasy adult life.So when EA surprise-dropped a rerelease ofThe Sims 1 and 2last weekend to celebrate the series’ 25th anniversary, with all expansions included (my nine-year-old self’s dream) naturally I was compelled to return to my happy place, revisiting my 10-hour pyjama-clad marathon sessions micromanaging the lives of the Newbies, Roomies, and the Goths, and occasionally removing their pool ladders when they were taking a little swim, and only taking a necessary pause for mum’s roast dinner.While the familiar chaos of breezy music, tragic pool accidents, and my own personal french maid delivered a powerful dose of nostalgia, there is something else lurking beneath this game’s quirky and cheerful exterior, something that I wasn’t conscious of when I was a kid. To my surprise, the game now feels less like a chance to live out your dream life, and more like a struggle simulator. (I also forgot how much time my Sims spent playing chess.) Like a Lynchian picket-fence town, I realised, there’s a darkness lurking under suburban sheen.The original Sims games were more dystopian than today’s perky, brightly coloured The Sims 4. The Sims 1 instead offers a desaturated daily grind. The contrast isn’t just the aesthetic – 20 years ago, Sims had no dreams or ambitions. Your virtual families worked long hours for expensive lives, where death – and some of the most gut-wrenching music in game history – lurked behind even mundane everyday tasks.Forget personality, aspirations and tastes. The Sims 1 is a capitalist nightmare where survival trumps self-actualisation.View image in fullscreenMind the spontaneously combusting ovens! … Sims 1 + 2.I forgot how much time the original Sims actually spend working. They do boring, dull jobs for little pay, out of your sight – making the simple message that you get when they are promoted (or passed over) strangely impactful. Put that meagre wage packet towards the cheapest oven on offer, and it’ll probably catch fire and kill you. This is a game that punishes you for being poor. It means that the rich, like the iconic Goth family, in their still-stunning graveyard-edged stone mansion stay, rich – while the poor stay poor. Social mobility in The Sims 1, I learned, is near impossible.And having a social life? Forget it, at least when you’re on the bottom rung of your random career ladder. There’s simply no time to make friends, something I didn’t remember from my days as a Sims-obsessed tween. I now realise that my neighbourhood’s messy EastEnders-level entanglements were largely scripted in my head. Instead, you must chip away at ++ and – – relationship scores until you can finally, anticlimactically ‘Play in bed,’ thanks to the Livin’ it Up expansion pack that provided the world’s most basic sex education to a generation of 11-year-olds. There’s nothing dark about that expansion’s heart-shaped bed. I still want it in real life.Even these moments with the most meaningful loves of my Sims’ lives seemed to offer them nothing – they were transactional, serving nothing more than to unlock new interactions. They are performing for my enjoyment, not theirs.Friendship is also bleakly transactional here: you need a certain number of them to climb the ranks at work. Stay lonely, and you’ll stay poor, and probably die from having a cheap, spontaneously combusting microwave. It’s an especially sad existence for single Sims who live alone. Exhausted from work, if you don’t find time to call your friends on the phone for hours – or they decline to come over – your relationships decay rapidly. Like Black Mirror’s award-winningNosediveepisode, losing social credibility quickly sees things spiral quickly downhill for your Sims.And nothing flips a millennial’s stomach as quick as the music that heralds a terrifying, sudden burglary. It’s still horrifying 25 years later, so just hope that you had the foresight to spend your meagre savings on a burglar alarm. That’s before we even get into visits from the Grim Reaper, and creepy prank calls. These unexpected callers frighten me just as much now as they did then.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m finally living my fantasy adult life – I just didn’t realise it would be less lounging in gothic-mansion dream homes, and more feeling overworked, underpaid and on the verge of a spiralling breakdown. In 2025, an era of economic anxiety and burnout, the grind of The Sims feels brutal.For all its existential dread, The Sims 1 is still an escape. Sure, it presents a kind of capitalist nightmare. But, it is a capitalist nightmare you can control. No matter how hard the daily slog got, you can always type in a cheat code and wipe away financial stress with a click – the ultimate fantasy. It’s also weirdly accurate: just like in real life, external advantages (and cheating the system) are way more likely to lead to success than grinding away and following the rules.Yes, The Sims 1 was and remains a dystopian suburban treadmill, but it also makes room for humour. It’s a world where chaos is funny, failure is temporary, and the worst tragedies could be undone with the click of a mouse.Explore more on these topicsGamesPCSimulation gamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She discusses punk, porn and politicsMon 10 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Feb 2025 05.21 ESTShareIn 1977, the punk bandBuzzcocksreleased a single called Orgasm Addict, with a record sleeve as jolting as the song’s title. It depicted a lean and muscular, oiled-up naked woman with an iron for a head and smiling, lipsticked mouths for nipples. The collage was scary, sexy and shocking – especially since it was mass produced, seen in record shops and on the streets, rather than confined to a gallery.“Buzzcocks had just signed to United Artists, so there was quite a large publicity budget,” Linder Sterling, the creator of the collage, remembers. “So that poster was in cities everywhere. It was unmissable. There was no social media, so the effect was hard to track, but years later people say to me ‘I saw that poster in Glasgow, or in a back street in Birmingham, and it changed my life.’”The poster is in the collection of MoMA (Malcolm Garrett did the graphic design). The iron-headed woman is still Linder’s most recognisable image, and a version of it advertises her new exhibition, Danger Came Smiling. Like her other collages, it was made from found imagery – often pornography. So what was the woman’s real face like? “When I die, I’ll tell my son that he can finally show the world the source image,” she promises. “Because once you see it, you can’t get it out of your head.”Linder was born Linda Mulvey, in Liverpool; at 21 she decided to go by a Germanic version of her first name only. She’s sitting in a cafe upstairs at the Hayward Gallery in London, dressed in jeans and a cycling top. “To have a retrospective at age 70 – there’s something very joyous about that,” she says. Danger Came Smiling is named after the second album by her band Ludus; she originally took the title from one of her grandmother’s romance novels. “If you’re looking at pornography, those workers are vulnerable and they often have to smile,” Linder notes. “And think of Trump, that horrible gurning.”View image in fullscreenLinder: ‘My family didn’t go to art galleries. We might have sheltered in one in the rain.’Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThe exhibition consists of four huge rooms filled with 50 years’ worth of work. There arepictures by the photographer Birrer of Linder tying cellophane around her face, in pearls and dramatic makeup; many more collages, including old porno postcards with the heads of the models replaced with consumer durables like kettles and TVs; and masks made out of peephole bras and black lace knickers.There is footage of Linder’s notorious performance with Ludus in which she took to the stage in a bodice made of chicken carcasses (decades before Lady Gaga’s meat dress) and then whipped out a strap-on dildo. She says it was inevitable, once punk hitManchester, that she would form a band: “It was like national service in Manchester, you had to pick up an instrument at some point. For a short while, the space between the audience and the stage just seemed to disappear. A lot of us were poor working class, we hadn’t had music lessons as children. But extraordinary music was happening then.”There are dramatic images of the artist bodybuilding in 1983, in an otherwise all-male gym in Manchester’s Moss Side; and a photograph of her tenderly painting the nails of her friend Morrissey on tour in the early 90s. Linder has known Morrissey since 1976; she is the pal he arranges to meet “at the cemetery gates” in the 1986 song by the Smiths. Linder confirms they are “still friends, obviously, for ever, for life”, but is reluctant to discuss their friendshipwith his least favourite news organisation. “I’m wary of clickbait,” she explains.SheShe, 1981.Photograph: Courtesy of the artist  Modern Art, London  Blum, Los Angeles, Tokyo, New York  Andréhn-Schiptjenko, Stockholm, Paris and dépendance, BrusselsAs well as joyous – and funny, alarming, perceptive, uncanny and somehow deeply northern – the show is long overdue. Linder has never had a retrospective in London, let alone enjoyed art-world accolades like a Turner prize nomination. She is delighted she’s finally making a splash inLondon’s Southbank Centre, contrasting its now celebrated brutalist concrete with the “soft, yielding and inviting architecture of women’s bodies” depicted in a stash of Playboy magazines from 1968, the year the Hayward Gallery opened. Linder acquired the mags from her late uncle and has used them in the exhibition’s two most recent works, collages partly inspired by deepfake porn, which feature her face on a porn star’s body. “Pornography used to be print media,” she says. “Whereas now it’s quite aerosolic. You know, pornography is all about profit, so why print a magazine when you can just have a website?”But Linder is wedded to print media, and few other artists wield a scalpel so effectively. Collage is the medium to which she keeps returning, most recently for the piece she has made for the Guardian. “That Roman sculpture of an unnamed emperor just seemed quite apt right now,” she says of the work, adding that her selection of images is usually intuitive. There is a drawing of a baby in the womb – Linder has made a lot of work expressing her despair at the overturning ofRoe v Wadein America – and a very explicit orchid. “Flowers are basically nature’s pornography,” she says. “It’s like, come over here and be attracted to me.”Linder’s work casts doubt on the idea that material comforts will make us happy. “In capitalism, you have this progress narrative, like: buy this, do this, and life will get better,” she says. “Suddenly you think, ‘It could get a hell of a lot worse, very quickly.’” At the moment, she says, “everything we fought for feels as fragile as a magazine from the 1950s. You put the blade into it and it just tears.”Linder discovered collage in 1976, when she was studying graphic design at Manchester Polytechnic; she saw the work of artists including Hannah Höch, Max Ernst and El Lissitzky in a book by Dawn Ades called Photomontage. Her initial collages were taken from magazines, which at that time were divided into “men’s” and “women’s” interest in newsagents. Women’s interests were confined to fashion, homemaking and cooking, but “in men’s interest you’d have pornography, music … Music obviously wasn’t a woman’s interest,” she notes drily.In splicing the two types of media together, her collages comment on the way women are objectified, stereotyped and pressed into domestic and sexual servitude, exposing the tension and aggression seething between the sexes and beneath the surface of family life. They seem to have extra resonance in the era of OnlyFans, when anyone can be a sex worker, broadcasting porn straight from your own home. “Pornography can be ethical,” says Linder. “But when you’ve made a product in your bedroom it needs to be distributed, and that’s when the tech companies take ownership of it. That’s when it gets very, very murky.”View image in fullscreenLinder’s artwork created for the Guardian.Photograph: Courtesy the artist and Modern Art, LondonLinder’s dad was a bricklayer, her mother a hospital cleaner. Born in 1954, she says her life has followed the trajectory of British pop music. “I grew up with Merseybeat and I remember that sense of excitement,” she says. “Harold Wilson was our local politician, and the people from my city were globally changing culture. Success could be local, it wasn’t something far away. As a small child, you just sense that.”There was a much more malevolent influence in Linder’s young life: her step-grandfather, who would show her pornography when she was as young as three, and sexually assault her in the family home. Linder believes this trauma is responsible for her lifelong desire to take control of porn and turn it into a feminist statement – she has spent a lifetime looking at it, and using it in her work, joking that these days when she tries to buy an old porn mag, she finds that someone from the British Museum is also trying to acquire it. “I feel comfortable working with pornography,” she says. “It feels analytic – no, forensic. That’s the word.”The abuse she suffered stayed with her. A couple of years ago, Linder had eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy. “A whole new swathe of imagery came up and it was very, very vivid,” she says. “I was somehow recalling the ballet books I used to have aged three. I think that kind of grooming begins with the handling of the child’s body in a certain way in domestic spaces. In my montages, I reverse-engineer what a paedophile spends their time engineering.”At 10, Linder experienced the culture shock of moving from Liverpool to a small mining village near Wigan. “I’m still recovering from it,” she says. “Liverpool’s a port, so you’re importing goods but you’re also importing ideas. You have that sense of America ahead of you; it’s about reaching outwards. But in a mining village, the idea is boring down into the earth.” Gender roles were strictly enforced. “I was called a wench!” Linder remembers. “Maybe if I hadn’t have grown up there, I wouldn’t have identified as a feminist aged 16.”View image in fullscreenLinder, untitled, 1979.Photograph: © Linder Sterling. Courtesy of the artist  Modern Art, London  Blum, Los Angeles, Tokyo, New York  Andréhn-Schiptjenko, Stockholm, Paris and dépendance, BrusselsLinder discovered Germaine Greer’s galvanising second-wave feminist text, The Female Eunuch, in a bookshop in Wigan in 1970. She was inspired by the book’s cover by the surrealist artist John Holmes, depicting a woman’s torso as a neutered hot-water bottle, complete with handles. I suggest the image is quite Linder-esque, and she says: “It really is! It was very striking at the time – it sort of popped off when you saw it in a bookstore. I think that’s why I was interested in doing graphic design rather than fine art. I really loved record sleeve and book cover design. My family didn’t go to art galleries. We might have sheltered in one in the rain. I didn’t even quite know what art was then, I guess.”She was delighted to get back to the big city to study, and her horizons expanded further on 20 July 1976, when she went to the secondSex Pistolsconcert at Manchester’s Lesser Free Trade Hall after seeing it advertised on the side of a passing van. “I remember John Lydon taking my money on the ticket box and he looked quite extraordinary,” she says. “He was wearing a sparkly jacket, almost like an Elvis jacket. I remember thinking, ‘Oh, this is a good way in. I haven’t seen anyone looking like that in Manchester before.’ And it was all quite gloriously shambolic.” Between bands, she got talking to a group called Buzzcocks, who at that point had only played one gig. They asked her what she did, and on telling them that she was a graphic design student, they invited her to design “posters and things. So it was all very casual.”Linder started dating Howard Devoto, Buzzcocks’ frontman, who soon left the band to form another, Magazine. “We’d go to London, stay in Malcolm McLaren’s flat, hang out in Sex” – McLaren and Vivienne Westwood’s boutique, and the source of the Sex Pistols’ stage wear. Nonetheless, as far as Linder is concerned, punk was over by April 1977. “I was about to hand in my end-of-year thesis about punk. And my mum’s magazine had a big feature about how to make a bin-bag skirt for your daughter and how to knit her a mohair jumper. I remember thinking, ‘Well, that’s it, then.’”Punk’s premature demise didn’t staunch her creativity, but Linder’s desire to be a great urban photographer like Diane Arbus or Weegee ended in horrifying fashion when she was on her way home after photographing a gig by the Damned. A man followed her off the bus and down a shortcut home, then held a stiletto knife to her throat. “I said, ‘Take my cameras, they’re worth a fortune.’ And I bluffed that my friends were coming, so he ran off with my cameras.” When the police finally caught the man two years later, they discovered he had raped seven women, one of them on the night he attacked Linder. She didn’t pick up a camera again until her son was born in 1990.Linder says her retrospective feels “quite tender, because so many people haven’t made it”, although she admits that even as a girl, she “was always obsessed with death”. One room features costumes for a ballet Linder created called The Ultimate Form, made by the fashion designer Richard Nicoll, who died suddenly aged 39. There’s also an unusual (to put it mildly) tribute to Linder’s late father – three huge pictures of Linder and her friend Marie Blum in ecstatic poses, covered in custard, cream and rice pudding. It’s inspired by the niche sexual fetish sploshing, in which people get aroused by having messy food dumped over them.“He was an Irish builder, very strong even in his 80s, and then suddenly he had a severe stroke, so I and others would feed him, trying to maintain his dignity,” says Linder. “He was in hospital, so it was rice pudding, custard, jellies, those kinds of soft and sugary foods. At the time, I was aware of the splosh fetish happening, and was collecting all the magazines. It felt really cathartic to have this extraordinary splosh session after feeding my father so carefully and so tenderly.”Danger Came Smiling is an object lesson in creating art out of even the most abject materials, and Linder is justifiably proud of the inspiration she has provided to others. “I’m on the school syllabus now,” she says. “Sometimes people follow me on social media.

In the US, the one constant is sport and while weekly games might only appeal to an impassioned subset of fans, theSuper Bowl’sbroader appeal makes it the most attractive night of the year to advertisers, their big chance to make an impression with an audience that’s typically over 100 million.Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl half-time show review – game over for DrakeRead moreIt’s also inevitably the most expensive with a30-second spot costing about $8mthis year – a record amount – and so it’s left up to the biggest of the big companies to get involved. On the film side, that translated to just Paramount, Disney, Universal and Warners flashing the cash but was it money well spent?SmurfsIn year that islazily bringing back more franchisesthan ever before from Jurassic World to Final Destination to 28 Days Later to How to Train Your Dragon, why not try once again to make Smurfs work? The characters have moved from Sony to Paramount after two connected films and one reboot and all bets have now been placed on Rihanna as Smurfette, following in the hallowed footsteps of Katy Perry and Demi Lovato. After all that wait, is the new Rihanna album going to be a Smurfs soundtrack?Jurassic WorldRebirthWhile the Jurassic World movies might have failed to reach the lofty heights of Jurassic Park, I’d argue they were mostly more successful than the two films that followed it. That, some hard-to-shake nostalgia and the pairing of Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali make it difficult not to get just a bit excited about the still completely unnecessary Jurassic World Rebirth. The new spot is essentially a remix of therecent trailerbut then that was a remix of everything that came before anyway.Mission: Impossible – The Final ReckoningThere are many, many restarts this summer – Final Destination, Fantastic Four, Jurassic World – but there is one major end. Just don’t tell Tom Cruise. What is now being marketed as the lastMission: Impossible filmwas once supposed to be the second part of the seventh, yet underwhelming box office has changed both title and strategy with Paramount hoping, reportedly against its star’s wishes, to wrap things up. This new spot pushes that selling point hard, a sad goodbye for one of the only consistently enjoyable franchises we have.NovocaineAs audiences prefer to stick with known quantities like Keanu Reeves, Gerard Butler and Jason Statham, Hollywood continues to try out new action stars with mostly middling results. Aaron Taylor-Johnson couldn’t get anyone craving some Kraven the Hunter, Henry Cavill scored two flops back-to-back with Argylle and The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, and this weekend, Ke Huy Quan’s first leading vehicle Love Hurts went nowhere for nobody all at once (it opened to a pitiful $5.8m). Will they warm to Ana de Armas in the John Wick summer spinoff Ballerina or maybe Jack Quaid, best known for Amazon’s The Boys and last month’s Companion, in the gimmicky caper Novocaine? He plays a man incapable of feeling pain whose girlfriend is kidnapped. Given the pricey placement of this new tease, it’s clear that Paramount is hoping for big things from a film that looks like it has a very small budget.How to Train Your DragonMaybe one of the least necessary animated-to-live-action transfers we’ve been lumped with for a while, the How to Train Your Dragon spot doesn’t offer anything we didn’t already expect and haven’t already seen before. It feels like the original wasn’t all that long ago and with the dragon looking essentially the same in both, it’s a struggle to know why we’re here again.Lilo & StitchDisney deserves some reluctant credit here for creating aSuper Bowlad that doesn’t just resemble a condensed trailer, turning something eye-rollingly predictable (a live-action Lilo & Stitch) into an advert we’re actually surprised by. The 30-second spot has the once-animated, now CG monster invade the pitch, helping to kick off a campaign that will most likely make the most of all Fox and Disney channels in the next few months.ThunderboltsDisney also teased its other big summer bet Thunderbolts with a 30-second version of a brand new trailer that’s just been released online. “The Avengers are not coming,” says Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s Wario-ed Nick Fury at the start of the preview for the sorta antiheroes assemble caper (technically not true given that a new Avengers film has been given the green light) before a series of quips, explosions and an ironically used 80s pop song are trotted out to hopefully lure Deadpool fans to their local cinema this May.F1The big Super Bowl spot forBrad Pitt’sF1, one of the summer’s biggest question marks, continues the good work done by last year’s first trailer, focusing on multi-sense immersion. It’s set to be the most authentic racing film we’ve ever seen, made in collaboration with the governing body behind Formula One and filmed during actual events over the last couple of years, and the stripped-back new ad highlights such authenticity. Hopes are high with a giant budget and its backer, Apple, still waiting for its first genuine box office hit, but if anyone can make this kind of unlikely magic happen, it’s Joseph Kosinski, who also steered Top Gun: Maverick from curio to blockbuster.Explore more on these topicsFilmSuper Bowl LIXBrad PittFlorence PughMarvelWalt Disney CompanyTom CruisefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ever.”Palmer and Gaiman, who married in 2011 and had a child together in 2015, announced in 2022 that they had decided to divorce.On 15 January, Palmer said in aninitial Instagram statementthat because of ongoing custody and divorce proceedings, she was unable to offer public comment on the allegations. A representative for Palmertold NMEthat she “is profoundly disturbed” by the allegations against Gaiman.The lawsuit states that Pavlovich met Palmer in Auckland in 2020, when Pavlovich was 22, and the two became acquaintances. Pavlovich would sometimes run errands for Palmer, and eventually became the couple’s nanny.The lawsuit alleges that Gaiman repeatedly sexually assaulted Pavlovich while she was working without pay during a “three-week indenture”. At the time, she was “broke and homeless”, and Gaiman and Palmer “intentionally withheld” pay to keep her “trapped, vulnerable, and penniless”, it claims.Pavlovich said when she went to Palmer about the assaults, Palmer told her that other women had previously come to her about abusive sexual encounters with Gaiman.The lawsuit states that Palmer “knowingly approached and procured the services of Scarlett with reckless disregard for the fact that Gaiman would force Scarlett to engage in commercial sex acts” with him.“I thank you all deeply for continuing to respect my recent request for privacy as I navigate this extremely difficult moment”, Palmer wrote in her post on Friday. “I must protect my young child and his right to privacy.”Explore more on these topicsBooksNeil GaimanAmanda PalmernewsShareReuse this content"

Nigel had an incredible career and will be greatly missed. Our thoughts are with his family at this time.”McCrery, who served with the Nottinghamshire constabulary, began Silent Witness in 1996 – the BBC programme about a police pathologist released its latest series, its 28th, this year.His 1950s-set medical drama Born and Bred, co-created with the Broadchurch creator Chris Chibnall, aired during the 2000s.McCrery also launched New Tricks, which follows the fictional unsolved crime and open case squad, with Roy Mitchell in 2003.The show starring Dennis Waterman, Amanda Redman, Alun Armstrong and James Bolam had strong ratings, before being axed in 2015 after 12 series.McCrery also wrote nonfiction books about sport and the first and second world wars.These included The Footballers Who Fought and Died in the Great War; Into Touch: Rugby Internationals Killed in the Great War and Season in Hell: British Footballers Killed in the Second World War.His book The Vanished Battalion was made into the 1999 war drama All the King’s Men, starring Sir David Jason and Dame Maggie Smith.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These models, and the companies behind them, exploit human artists, using their work without permission or payment to build commercial AI products that compete with them.”Calling on Christie’s to cancel the auction, which starts on 20 February, it adds: “Your support of these models, and the people who use them, rewards and further incentivizes AI companies’ mass theft of human artists’ work.”The use of copyrighted work to train AI models – the technology that underpins chatbots and image generation tools such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney – has become a battleground between creatives and tech companies, with artists,authors,publishersandmusic labelslaunching a series of lawsuits alleging breach of copyright.The British composer Ed Newton-Rex, a key figure in thecampaign by creative professionalsfor protection of their work and a signatory to the letter, said at least nine of the works appearing in the auction appeared to have used models trained on artists’ work. However, other pieces in the auction do not appear to have used such models.‘It’s the opposite of art’: why illustrators are furious about AIRead moreA spokesperson for Christie’s said that “in most cases” the AI used to create art in the auction had been trained on the artists’ “own inputs”.“The artists represented in this sale all have strong, existing multidisciplinary art practices, some recognised in leading museum collections. The works in this auction are using artificial intelligence to enhance their bodies of work and in most cases AI is being employed in a controlled manner, with data trained on the artists’ own inputs,” said the spokesperson.A British artist whose work features in the auction, Mat Dryhurst, said he cared about the issue of art and AI “deeply” and rejected the criticisms in the letter. A piece by Dryhurst and his wife, Holly Herndon – based on a work called xhairymutantx – is on sale at the auction with an estimated price of between $70,000 and $90,000.Dryhurst told the Guardian that the piece of art being auctioned was part of an exploration of how the “concept” of his wifeappeared in publicly available AI models.“This is of interest to us and we have made a lot of art exploring and attempting to intervene in this process as is well within our rights.”He added: “It is not illegal to use any model to create artwork. I resent that an important debate that should be focused on companies and state policy is being focused on artists grappling with the technology of our time.”Anadol also rejected the criticism. In a post on X, he said the backlash was a consequence of “lazy critic practices and doomsday hysteria”.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ArtnewsShareReuse this content"

The 77-year-old Rushdie was grievously injured in the attack and lost sight in one eye.In opening statements on Monday, the prosecutor Jason Schmidt told jurors in Chautauqua county court that Matar, from Fairview, New Jersey, had “come dangerously close to committing murder” when he assaulted Rushdie with a knife.Matar, Schmidt said, had approached Rushdie in a “direct and rapid manner” as he sat on the stage and began his assault “without hesitation, deliberately, forcefully, efficiently and with speed”.The attack, Schmidt continued, “came so fast and unexpectedly that he [Rushdie] continued to sit in his chair … he didn’t register what was happening”. The assault, Schmidt said, continued after Rushdie got up to run. Members of the audience tackled Matar and held him down until a state trooper patrolling nearby arrived.After a vivid description of the wounds Rushdie had received to his neck, face and abdomen, the prosecutor said the author was rushed to a nearby trauma center where was found to be “losing blood so rapidly he was in hemorrhagic shock from blood loss”.Schmidt said anyone in Rushdie’s condition who had not received level-one trauma care would have died.The long-awaited trial has attracted the world’s media to the small town of Mayville in westernNew Yorkstate. As he entered the courtroom Matar said: “Free Palestine.” The defendant, who was dressed in a blue untucked shirt and trousers, faces a 25-year maximum sentence if convicted.Salman Rushdie set to testify as attempted murder trial gets under wayRead moreThe trial was briefly thrown into question when the defense team revealed that Matar’s lead attorney, Nathaniel Barone, had been hospitalized overnight, but Judge David Foley denied a defense request to delay the start of the trial.Public defender Lynn Schaffer, standing in for Barone, said it was not an open-and-shut case against Matar – and reasonable doubt existed.The case is not a “whodunnit, not an Agatha Christie novel”, Schaffer told the court. “The prosecution will want you to believe this is straightforward … open and shut … this case on video, nothing to see here.”But, she added, referring to Schmidt, “Don’t believe him – it’s not that simple. Nothing is that simple in life.”Schaffer said: “The elements of a crime are more than just something really bad happened. Something bad did happen, something very bad did happen, but the DA has to prove something more than that, and something much more specific than that.”Using the analogy of Sunday’s Super Bowl, Schaffer said it was not possible to know “what’s inside any of those players’ minds” despite the camera angles – an apparent reference to video of the attack the prosecution has said it would show to jurors.Deborah Moore Kushmaul, program director at the Chautauqua Institution and the first witness for the prosecution, said Rushdie had been booked to speak on a theme of “shelter and redefining home”.Moore identified a 10in knife prosecutors say was used by Hatar, and described “more and more commotion” in the amphitheater. She said she could not initially tell if the sound was “laughter or screaming”.Later in her testimony, Moore said she could “see blood, I could see people piled on. The audience, many of whom were very elderly, were screaming. I saw people trying to hold the attacker down, and others trying to help Mr Rushdie.”Rushdie may be called by the prosecution on Tuesday, according to reports.In a jailhouse interview soon after he was detained, Matar told the New York Post he had read only two pages of Rushdie’s novel The Satanic Verses, which initiated a fatwa against the author issued in 1989 by Iran’s then leader, Ayatollah Khomeini.Matar, who haspleaded not guiltyand will betried on federal terrorism-related chargesat a later date, told the outlet that he believed Rushdie had “attacked Islam”.Rushdie, who lived with security protection in London for a decade before moving to New York to live under less constrained circumstances, wrotein Knife, a meditative account of the attack, that he does not regret the earlier novel.“I am proud of the work I’ve done, and that very much includes The Satanic Verses. If anyone’s looking for remorse, you can stop reading right here,” he wrote.But before the incident, he dreamed of being attacked by a gladiator with a spear in a Roman amphitheater. He later said he thought: “Don’t be silly. It’s a dream.”But he also questioned his apparent passivity under the attack.“Why didn’t I fight? Why didn’t I run? I just stood there like a piñata and let him smash me,” Rushdie wrote in Knife. “It didn’t feel dramatic, or particularly awful. It just felt probable … matter-of-fact.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkSalman RushdieUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

That is the reason he was asked to vacate the place.”But Sheeran, who is known for performing in unexpected places, insisted later on his Instagram account that he did have permission to perform Shape of You, which was the first song to reach 3bn streams on Spotify.He wrote: “We had permission to busk, by the way. Hence, us playing in that exact spot was planned out beforehand. It wasn’t just us randomly turning up. All good, though.”Fans shared their disappointment at the police decision on social media. PC Mohan, a local MP from the ruling BJP party, posted on X that the impromptu gig had taken on a “sour note” when police arrived, adding that “even global stars must follow local rules – no permit, no performance”.The artist is inIndiafor a 15-day leg of his tour, The Mathematics, and performed in front of thousands of people at an open ground in Bengaluru later that night, accompanied by the Indian singer Shilpa Rao.He surprised fans by singing two hit songs in the Telugu language with Rao on stage.

The cause of death was not disclosed.“Almost every Finn has sat on a chair he designed – at a metro station, in a bank, at school, or in a library,” the studio said in a news release. “Yrjö Kukkapuro never stopped designing and coming up with new ideas. Until the very end, he pondered a concept of ​​his new chair, the plan of which was clear in his mind. His assistant didn’t have time to make drawings of the chair.”In a career spanning more than 70 years, Kukkapuro’s chairs were lauded for their comfort, functionalism and ergonomics as well as their design, and featured names like Ateljee, Karuselli-chair, Long Chair and, his most famous,the Experiment.View image in fullscreenA rocking chair designed by Kukkapuro.Photograph: ArtekDesigned in 1982, the Experiment chair was considered avant-garde but ultimately became commercially successful and was seen as a key turning point for the postmodern style of furniture. The Experiment includes decorative, wavy armrests in bright colors, an upholstered back and bottom, and a signature angled seat – despite the frame being flat on the ground.Although initial production ceased in the 1990s, the European furniture design brand Hem sought permission from Kukkapuro in 2021 to reproduce it with minor adjustments to the scale and construction.Shades of brilliance in a Finnish home packed with clashing colours and funRead more“We are saddened by the news of Yrjö’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family,” said Hem’s founder and chief executive, Petrus Palmér. “He was a furniture design trailblazer, and showed us that a non-conformist approach is the only way to achieve a lasting legacy.”The Experiment chair retailed for up to €2,399 ($2,479) on Hem’s website Sunday, where a description called it “timeless, bold, and as compelling today as the day it was created”.“In the Experiment Chair, Kukkapuro sought to add art to Functionalism, to satisfy romantic tastes alongside meeting essential needs,” the description reads. “The result is startling, authentic, a hero of 20th-century design.”Kukkapuro designed his family’s studio and home to feature a wave-shaped roof and floor-to-ceiling glass windows. Built in the late 1960s for him and his wife, the artist Irmeli Kukkapuro, who died in 2022, it’s scheduled to become a museum next year.Explore more on these topicsDesignFinlandEuropeInteriorsnewsShareReuse this content"

The post did not cite a cause.“He was surrounded by his family and loyal pets. Throughout these difficult last chapters, he was brave, funny and sweet,” Alexa Robbins wrote. “He asked that people remember him by reading his books.”Robbins indulged the hippy sensibilities of young people starting in the early 1970s with books that had an overarching philosophy of what he called “serious playfulness” and a mandate that it should be pursued in the most outlandish ways possible. As he wrote in Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas: “Minds were made for blowing.”Andrew O’Hagan: ‘A kind of Dickens and Zola energy was pulsing’Read moreRobbins’ characters were over the top, off the wall and around the bend. Among them were Sissy Hankshaw, the hitchhiker with the nine-inch thumbs in Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, and Switters, the pacifist CIA operative in love with a nun in Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates. Skinny Legs and All featured a talking can of pork and beans, a dirty sock and Turn Around Norman, a performance artist whose act consisted of moving imperceptibly.View image in fullscreenTom Robbins at a book signing at Stacey’s bookstore in San Francisco, 1980.Photograph: Roger Ressmeyer/Corbis/VCG/Getty Images“What I try to do, among other things, is to mix fantasy and spirituality, sexuality, humor and poetry in combinations that have never quite been seen before in literature,” Robbins said in a 2000 interview. “And I guess when a reader finishes one of my books … I would like for him or her to be in the state that they would be in after a Fellini film or a Grateful Dead concert.”Born in Blowing Rock, North Carolina, Robbins grew up there and in Richmond, Virginia, in a family that he once described as “kind of a Southern Baptist version of The Simpsons”. He said he was dictating stories to his mother at age five and developed his writing skills further at Washington and Lee University in Virginia, working on the school newspaper with Tom Wolfe, who would go on to write The Right Stuff and The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.Robbins worked as an editor, reporter and critic for newspapers in Richmond andSeattle, where he moved in the 1960s in search of a more progressive atmosphere than the South offered. He had a writing epiphany while reviewing a 1967 concert by the Doors.‘We’re not doing the thing we’re built to do’: Agnes Callard, the philosopher living life according to SocratesRead more“It had jimmied the lock on my language box and smashed the last of my literary inhibitions,” he wrote in the 2014 memoir titled Tibetan Peach Pie. “When I read over the paragraphs I’d written that midnight, I detected an ease, a freedom of expression, a syntax simultaneously wild and precise.”What came next was 1971’s Another Roadside Attraction, the roundabout tale of how the mummified, unresurrected body of Jesus was stolen from the Vatican and ended up at a hotdog stand in the US north-west. Five years later, his second book, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, in which Sissy hitchhiked her way through a world of sex, drugs and mysticism, made him a cult favorite.His novels often had strong female protagonists, which made him especially popular with female readers. And while he appealed to the youth culture, the literary establishment never warmed to Robbins. Critics said his plots were formulaic and his style overwrought.Robbins wrote his books in longhand on legal pads, producing only a couple of pages a day and with nothing plotted in advance. An attempt at using an electric typewriter ended with the author bashing it with a piece of lumber.He laboured over word selection and said he liked to “remind reader and writer alike that language is not the frosting, it’s the cake”. As a result, his works were overflowing with wild-eyed metaphors.“Word spread like a skin disease in a nudist colony,” he wrote in Skinny Legs and All. In Jitterbug Perfume he described a falling man as going down “like a sack of meteorites addressed special delivery to gravity.”Robbins had three children with his wife, Alexa.Explore more on these topicsBooksSeattleFictionnewsShareReuse this content"

The latest instalment in Antonio Pappano’s ongoing odyssey opened withElizabeth Maconchy, a gifted yet neglected contemporary of Shostakovich and Tippett, whose impressionistic Nocturne owed more of a debt to Holst and Debussy. A cinematic soundscape, complete with moody undertow and opulent climaxes, hinted at moon, clouds and waves in a spellbinding musical watercolour.William Walton’s Cello Concerto sings of warmer waters, especially the shimmering finale, which seems to end in a balmy Mediterranean sunset. The spirit of Prokofiev hovered over the ticking opening, Pappano and orchestra relishing the smouldering harmonies flecked with vibraphone, harp and celesta. LSO principal celloRebecca Gilliver, a natural team player, was at her finest in the third movement where double stopping and extended trills were rendered with pinpoint accuracy. Elsewhere, she took a more self-effacing approach, a touch smudgy in the spiky scherzo, though always warm of tone.Walt Whitman’s metaphysical maritime poetry was the catalyst for Vaughan Williams’s most operatic of symphonies. No surprise then that Pappano’s 21 years helming the Royal Opera paid dividends in a thrilling performance of the composer’s first symphony, his breakthrough work. As bracing fanfares issued a crisp call to arms and tempi broadened to accommodate impassioned choral entries you could feel the ocean’s heaving breast and taste the salty breezes.American baritoneWill Livermanradiated an ardent sense of pride and purpose. The top of the voice could have used a little more amplitude, but his commitment to the poetry was never in doubt. South African sopranoMasabane Cecilia Rangwanashasang with creamy tone, enviable diction and a commanding confidence as she hurled forth a battery of gleaming top notes.The London Symphony Chorus, singing with laser-focused discipline and an impressive homogeneity of sound, never put a foot wrong, from the briny tang of the scherzo through a series of goosebump-inducing a cappella sections. As Pappano guided ship and crew towards the distant horizon and its visionary conclusion, you could have heard a pin drop.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicLondon Symphony OrchestraAntonio PappanoreviewsShareReuse this content"

From the gentle chugging of a cargo barge along the East River to the clanking jingle of an ice-cream truck, the rhythm of life in this diverse neighbourhood bursts with vibrancy.From this panoramic view of the city, Barrio Boy closes in on a hair salon, where Quique (Dennis Garcia) works as a barber. The place is charming: airy, full of light, yet also witnesses the paradoxes that exist in the local Latino community. Quique shares a strong camaraderie with his male peers, but as a closeted gay man is forced to put on a macho front, especially to his homophobic, drug-dealing cousin (Keet Davis). A love affair with Kevin (James Physick), a handsome stranger from Ireland, threatens to send Quique’s life into chaos.A compelling presence, Garcia lends plenty of charisma to a character that is sorely underwritten. It’s a problem that plagues many films dealing with marginalised identities. Barrio Boy primarily defines Quique through his sexuality crisis, with little insight into his interior life or what draws him to Kevin in the first place. The female characters are also stereotyped, with an overuse of the blonde party girl archetype for comedic effect.The film was developed from a previous short by Shinners; perhaps the script is just too stretched over a feature-length runtime. In spite of these drawbacks, the sizzling chemistry between Garcia and Physick is enough to light up the screen. It is a shame, therefore, that their shared moments, which could have been the emotional backbone of the film, so often seem rushed.Barrio Boy is on digital platforms from 17 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRomance filmsLGBTQ+ rightsBrooklynreviewsShareReuse this content"

Paul Wills’s clever arrangement of television screens and speakers, all linked up by glowing capillary-like tubes, encapsulates Malorie Blackman’s 1997 novel about a boy whose pig-heart transplant leads to a media frenzy. Andrew Exeter’s lighting switches from blood red to cool blue for scenes when 13-year-old Cameron repeatedly puts himself – and, eventually, his new heart – to the test when diving at his local pool.Blackman’s novel is itself a deep dive: this “what would you do?” book for young readers considers ethics, animal rights, othering and empathy. Keeping the pre-social media setting, Winsome Pinnock’s new adaptation draws upon the heightened poetic style of Blackman’s opening chapter. Pinnock retains the narrator’s spirited interest in wordplay, boosts the wisdom of Cameron’s Nan and makes water more of a unifying theme throughout the story. Her version also takes a thrilling new turn towards the end.Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu’s boisterous production has some vivid performances, too, including by Immanuel Yeboah in the main role. But by overplaying the comedy it drowns out some of the story’s more reflective episodes. In the novel, Cameron often cracks jokes, even when face to face with the animal named Trudy whose heart he will receive, yet that encounter is hugely moving as the boy is overwhelmed with relief, fear, guilt and hope. On stage, Trudy is played as a disco-queen pig with pink puffer jacket and oversized glasses; discovering Cameron’s plans for her heart, she squeals in jokey horror. Elsewhere, animal rights are thinly discussed.View image in fullscreenSmooth operator … Tré Medley as Dr Bryce, with Akil Young, Immanuel Yeboa and Christine During.Photograph: Ali WrightThe production is more successful at conveying how Cameron is viewed by his classmates both before the operation (when they see his illness as fragility) and after (when he is still considered different to them). The children are played by an adult cast, most doubling up as the grownup characters. The pioneering Dr Bryce (Tré Medley) is amusingly portrayed as a spy-like smooth operator, all dressed in white both in and out of his laboratory, when that set design again works efficiently. Christina Ngoyi as his best friend Marilyn (Marlon in the book) has the right note of compromised loyalty; Christine During’s popular Julie has a buoyant ease but her later fear of Cameron again tips into comedy.Malorie Blackman on seeing her sci-fi novel about a pig heart transplant come trueRead moreCameron’s asides to the audience include a raucous interrogation about who sold his story to the press that is strained and distracts from his inner tumult. The screens on stage could be used more effectively during Cameron’s TV interview and for the camcorder footage he records for his brother.The show is aimed at nine to 13-year-olds (probably geared more towards the younger side of that range) and dynamically captures the turbulent world of school thanks in part to DK Fashola’s movement direction, especially appealing in an early slo-mo sequence. This staging has plenty of style and flows swiftly, helped by Xana’s sound design and compositions – but it never has quite the same direct appeal to head and heart as Blackman’s book.At theUnicorn theatre, London, until 22 February.

The tour began last year in North America, although that time on the road hasn’t reined in the chaos: the show is all over the place. Along with the incident involving the recorder, Lauper is plagued by technical difficulties, poor sound that buries her voice beneath an admittedly slick band, an uneven setlist, dodgy costumes, and her own garrulous monologues.For anyone else it could be disastrous. But as Lauper begins another anecdote about a breakup with boyfriend and the movie Poltergeist, she wins you over with her charming and squeaky New York drawl. “I’m only talking to you because I don’t want you think that all this is bigger than you and me connecting,” she says.View image in fullscreenGarrulous … Cyndi Lauper.Photograph: Martin Grimes/Getty ImagesWhen things align, the show is excellent: material from She’s So Unusual is a highlight, Lauper’s still impressive voice punching through her fizzy cover of Prince’s When You Were Mine, then delicately caressing the soft, pillowy Time After Time. There’s moving vulnerability in an a cappella take on Fearless, revved-up passion during I Drove All Night, soaring euphoria in the new age strum of Sisters of Avalon, and a poignant performance of True Colors staged alongside a version of artist Daniel Wurtzel’s Air Fountain installation.It’s just enough to distract from the mess – but then again, Lauper has often left slick perfectionism in the hands of her peers. During her final and most famous song, the aim of the night becomes clear: even at 71 years old, this girl just wants to have fun.Atthe O2, London, on 11 February;then touring.Explore more on these topicsCyndi LauperPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

It can glide past without making much impact, but leaves behind a feeling of pleasant sadness, a vapour trail of blue.Live, however, they are far punchier and dancefloor-focused. Not for nothing is the rhythm section – Jonny Cade on drums, Jonjo Williams on bass and percussion – positioned at the front of the stage. Davids and Ivory keep well back, the former mostly on guitar, the latter behind a bank of synths, drum pads and sample triggers.They open with Nervous Tics, perhaps the funkiest song ever written about emotional detachment. In its recorded version it is sung by its co-writer Holly Walker, whose aloof tones are one of the band’s sonic signatures, but live vocals on this tour come from Talulah Ruby, who has a huge soul voice. Two songs, Steal and Midas, which she performs at what feels like close to her full power are met with answering roars from the crowd. Whenever she is off-stage, though – which is half the set – there is a drop in intensity and focus, and the mix of sampled and live singing can feel awkward. For All I Need, Ruby duets with the absent Andreya Triana, whose gospel-inflected hook is a highlight of the new album – but lacking that human dynamic, it falls a bit flat.View image in fullscreenPowerful … Tallulah Ruby on stage with Maribou State.Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/The ObserverA shame, because that song – and the rest of Hallucinating Love – has a powerful emotional register. Indeed, it feels like the committed performances of the musicians, and the strong audience reaction to them, are informed by the compelling backstory to this music. Maribou State have not toured for years in part due to Davids suffering and then recovering from a debilitating brain condition. The situation, while obviously difficult, has been a creative stimulus in that it gave them a theme and a mood: hope in dark times. That is felt most keenly in Blackoak, with its lyrics of healing and compassion, which brings the evening to a close on a beautiful redemptive note.Maribou State playO2 Academy, Bristol, 11 February;Manchester Academy, 12 February;Alexandra Palace, London, 14-16 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsMusicElectronic musicPop and rocklive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

She had previously been institutionalised in a hospital where she was abused, and now experiences episodes of “maladaptive daydreaming” which her therapist is concerned indicate a drift into psychosis. (Spoiler: her therapist is not wrong.) These interludes are rendered through a colourful blue-green filter effect which, like the rest of the film, is not particularly subtle but underlines its point effectively enough.Cara’s sex work is not viewed through any kind of filter, flattering or otherwise. We see a selection of her customers, of which Jacob Roberts’ character Paul Ashton is the least charming. These guys aren’t an imaginative bunch, on the whole, and while nothing overtly explicit is shown, Cara’s distaste for her work is palpable. But it’s nothing next to her absolute aversion to being sent back to hospital, and we sense from the moment we first hear about Cara’s mysterious plan to protect herself from this fate that said plan will turn out to be a grand guignol affair.In the end, in addition to the usual constraints of low-budget film-making, the film suffers from falling between two stools. Until its final 10 minutes or so, it’s not gory and trashy enough to qualify as a midnight movie romp, but nor is it subtle or complex enough to interest an arthouse audience. While the mixture of elements from psychological drama and extreme horror makes for an interesting experiment, the two tones don’t always blend well. For example, a beheading is shot using practical effects that would look top notch in a zombie horror comedy, but in a film aspiring to tough psychological realism, it would need either to look realistic or remain unseen; the evident prosthetics that are all part of the fun in sillier horror movies undermine the effect that the film is aiming for.Cara is on digital platforms from 17 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

After a tense interview onCBS Mornings, CBS News said a week later that the segment had not met its editorial standards. If you followed that media storm, it’s hard to come toThe Message, now that it is out in the UK, fresh. But it’s important to try.The title is a slim volume of essays addressed to Coates’s writing students at Howard University, one of the premier historically black universities in the US. The collection roams: from Darryl Stingley, a New England Patriots wide receiver paralysed in a 1978 pre-season game, to Senegal, to Coates’s own struggles as a student, toPaulo Freire’s pedagogical theories, to a South Carolina school board meeting – and, yes, to Palestine.What connects these topics is his argument that stories shape what we know about the world and, he insists, still serve to justify its least moral aspects. Education too often confines students to the sanctioned stories that don’t threaten national myth-making. And journalists, he argues, have a responsibility to report what’s uncomfortable too.Coates first writes about his trip to Dakar, Senegal. He does not flatter himself in his descriptions. He admits to arriving with preconceptions and wasn’t always up for conversation. But he captures how overwhelming it can be for a Black American to stand on the African Atlantic coastline for the first time and look west. The emotions wash over him when he goes to Gorée, an island just across the water from Dakar, to see theHouse of Slaves, now a museum. He already knew that far fewer enslaved Africans walked through the building’s “door of no return” than once thought, but the site’s symbolism still has power.He is stunned to see the network of checkpoints that make it impossible for Palestinians to move freelyNext, Coates goes to a school board meeting in Chapin, South Carolina, where a teacher has been fighting, at the risk of her job, to teach his second book to her advanced placement English students.Between the World and Meis a deeply personal exploration of Black masculinity and American life in the form of a letter to his son. It’s now one of many books that school boards have banned across the US, part of the post-Covid, post-Black Lives Matter backlash against Black histories. Once again, Coates’s expectations are upended. He thinks he’ll see pitched battles, but the faction against the book isn’t at the meeting. Instead, there is a line of white South Carolinians, from a teenage student to a maths professor, supporting the book’s place within the curriculum.As a writer, Coates’s great gift is learning in public. This was first evident in the blog he wrote for many years at theAtlantic. His entries charted his reading progress through Tony Judt’sPostwarandTimothy Snyder’sBloodlands,while posting periodic updates about his attempts to learn French. That same spirit animatesThe Message, especially in the final essay, on Palestine, which is an attempt to repair something he got wrong.In 2014, theAtlanticpublished his pieceThe Case for Reparations.In it Coates argued that the US owed Black Americans reparations as much for what was withheld from Black people after slavery as for slavery itself. The piece ended by noting Germany’s reparations to Israel, which drew immediate criticism from those who wondered where the Palestinian side of the story was. When the Palestine festival of literature invited him to visit East Jerusalem and the West Bank, Coates went. (This trip took place in late spring 2023, though he never says this in the book itself.) What follows inThe Messageis a firm critique of Israel and of Zionism. He is stunned to see the network of checkpoints that make it impossible for Palestinians to move freely. He is offended that he is only allowed to go through one after he, an atheist, confirms that his grandparents were Christian. He realises that Palestinians in the West Bank have limited access to water while settlers have swimming pools. If it is a surprise that Coates has only just realised this, he makes the point himself. He remains ruthlessly self-critical.The author is equally dismayed that American journalism has largely refused to tell this story. In the City of David complex in Jerusalem, he sees a plaque that reads in part: “The spiritual bedrock of our values as a nation comes from Jerusalem. It is upon these ideals that the American republic was founded.” As he considers why the US supports Israel to this extent, however, he walks right past an important explanation. ForAmerican evangelicals, still a significant portion of the voting population, Israel has an important rolein bringing on the“end times”. Tens of millions of Americans (if not many more) have heard something like this from a pulpit at least once. Coates never draws the connection, but an Israeli archaeologist he speaks to does. “This is why I think that the Evangelical church and the settlers found each other as a perfect match,” says the scholar. “Their mindset is the same. They do other things, but their mindset is the same…”Coates interrupts him to take a breather, andThe Messagenever returns to the point. In a book about stories, maybe this one was too much to bear. In the final pages, Coates insists that American newsrooms must make space for Palestinian journalists. There are some stories that are not his to tell.The Messageby Ta-Nehisi Coates is published by Hamish Hamilton (£18.99). To support theGuardianandObserverorder your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

The oyster and truffle seasons are in full swing and bright, sunny weather makes it the perfect place to sip a glass of muscat on the banks of the town’s Canal Royal.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The main town on theThauarchipelago, 17 miles (27km) south-west of Montpellier, Sète has a strong maritime feel, with nets, floats and trawlers tied up along its waterfront. It also has a handful of excellent museums, pocket theatres and anopen-air galleryof street art. The town was founded in 1666 when Louis XIV was looking for a harbour for his royal galleys and it expanded hugely in the 19th century as a major port for the wine, wool and wood trade.View image in fullscreenToday, Sète is all about fish … and water jousting. Although the tournament takes place late in August, even in winter preparation and training is under way for thejoutes,spectacular water jousts on the canal. It has been going on for over 350 years and involves two teams dressed as sailors charging at each other in a bulky rowing boat carrying musicians and a lone, elevated jouster who tries to batter their opposite number into the water with a lance.This major Sète event is explained in all its elements at the town’sMusée de la Merand shop windows are full of striped sailor tops and straw boaters as well as brass compasses and fishing equipment. The town’s main corniche twists round the archipelago past a fishers’ cemetery where the poet and philosopher Paul Valéry is buried. Valéry was born in Sète in 1871 and a museum dedicated to him sits high above the town in a hugemodernist-style gallery. Cabinets of his private letters, sketches, notebooks, self-portraits and his silver fountain pen contrast with the exuberant contemporary art in the adjoining rooms. A startling exhibition of female artists,Nazanin PouyandehandBrigitte Aubignac, continues until the beginning of March.View image in fullscreenThe town’s annual jousting tournament takes place in August.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyOver the other side of what Valéry called his “singular island” (Sète is surrounded by canals, the Thau lagoon to the north and Mediterranean to the south) is theEspace Georges Brassens. One of France’s most celebrated singers, Brassens spent his childhood in Sète in the 1920s before moving to Paris and a life of cabarets and composing a particular type of jauntychanson, turning a life of near destitution into the gold discs, manouche guitars and recording contracts that line the walls of the centre.One of France’s most celebrated singers, Georges Brassens, spent his childhood in Sète in the 1920s before moving to Paris and a life of cabaretsI discovered that he knew almost 200 songs by heart by the age of five, that he wrote his lyrics out on school notepaper and transformed from a scandalous cabaret singer in the 1950s to selling 20m albums a year by the mid-1970s. Like Valéry, he is buried in a cemetery across the street.The strangely namedMusée International des Arts Modestesis also entertaining. A shop-front entrance where the town’s two main canals meet leads into a former wine warehouse. The top floor is devoted to dioramas of childhood objects by artist and co-founder Bernard Belluc: school chemistry projects frozen in space, toy cars, plastic dinosaurs and transistor radios. The museum’s first two floors house temporary exhibitions that pay tribute to the obscure: kitsch art by new age painters, and works inspired by pulp fiction, sci-fi and popular culture. It’s a palace to the extraordinarily “modest”.View image in fullscreenSète is on the Bassin de Thau, where some of France’s finest oysters are farmed.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyThe town’s energy and maritime charm attracted Jean-Jacques Ferron, who fell in love with the place in 2018 and decided to rebuild a ruined house overlooking the main square. “It was the old police station,” he tells me. “The balcony was in the middle of the building and downstairs, some grim-looking dungeons. It had no roof and had been abandoned for 20 years.”Ferron worked in New York for four decades as an artist, architect and conceptual designer and is drawn to nature and eco-friendly projects. “Spending time in New York City, we get the need for maximising space, so I brought that with me to Sète.”Agnès Varda’s 1955 film Pointe Courte was shot here and became a big influence on France’s nouvelle vague movementThere’s a stone waterfall in his cafe’s dining room and he has handmade all the furniture from natural elements, importing 20 tonnes of limestone from Spain. The cafe serves craft beer from Béziers and healthy, homemade food, hence the nameLa Maison Verte(green house). Upstairs are four cool apartments for rent and the kitchen ceiling is made from large tin tiles, imported from Brooklyn to prevent fires.“I wanted to bring a bit of Brooklyn to the coffee shop idea. In France, they’re stuck on lunch from 12-2pm but we are open all day until 7pm and people can eat whatever they want.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stalls are selling glistening Atlantic wolffish laid on beds of iced mussels and clams with stacks of winter vegetables, charcuterie and cheese. There’s an oyster bar, plenty of noisy cafes and a clothes shop called Tentation.Winter is truffle season. By Sète’s mid-January truffle fair, most of the dense black truffles are at least the weight of a golf ball. You can have a truffle omelette made on the spot or take a sniff from a plastic container kept under the counter. At Truffe d’Elite, the owners found that their doberman dog proved to be an expert truffle-hunter and showed me a video of him snuffling and then digging up a large truffle. Prices this year are about €1,000 per kilo, so €25 buys a conker-sized orb for a week’s worth of truffle-flavoured scrambled eggs.Sète bustles year round.

The reason for this, according to Margaret Visser in her impeccably researched bookMuch Depends on Dinner, is that subjects who see a lemon as well as taste one are liable to react in a manner that ruins the saliva measurements. Simply reading this had an enormous effect on my own saliva production, but I also tried to set up an experiment at home. My attempts, however, were sabotaged by family members showing me lemons, which did confirm something we already knew: perfectly packaged, handy in size, readily available, inexpensive, long-lasting and multitalented, lemons bring joy, even before you scratch or squeeze them.While northern India, with its warm, humid climate that almost never gets colder than 10C, is where lemons very likely originated, Visser also notes that the first clear mention of lemons is, as far as we know, an Arab document from the early 10th century, in which the laimun tree is said to be sensitive to cold. Lemon cultivation in the Mediterranean was certainly the consequence of Arab initiative and the creation of orchards in north Africa, Spain and Sicily; it also seems likely that Arab traders sailed the lemons eastwards to China, where they met the bitter oranges and mandarins that originated in Assam and Myanmar. From China, citrus radiated to Malaysia, which seems to have been a producer of limes and pomelos. The very definition of fruitful encounters and exchange.But back to our common fruit bowls, which very likely contain one, two or five lemons, and this week’s recipe: a great favourite taught to me by my friend Cinzia Fioravanti just after I moved to Rome in 2005. Like a fruit crumble, this cake/tart takes its name from the actionsbriciolata(crumbled), but here the rubbly mixture of flour, sugar and butter is used both as a base and as a topping, which sandwiches a lemon pudding filling. I feel it important to stress that the lemon filling is thickened with eggsandcornstarch, which gives it a homely feel somewhere between blancmange and curd. If this is not to your taste, uselemon curdinstead, or indeed a jar of chocolate spread or jam. But if you do like wobbly set puddings this may well be for you.Because of the nature of the base and topping, it is vital that you let it cool completely before moving it on to a plate. Cinzia inverts hers, so the bottom becomes the top, or simply slides it on to the plate. Grate more lemon zest on top and serve in slices with tea as imagined by Rainer Maria Rilke in a letter to his fiance in 1900: “Great lemons, cut in discs, would sink like suns into the golden dusk of the tea, dimly shining through it with the radiant flesh of their fruit.”Sbriciolata alla crema al limone– lemon crumble cake-tartServes8-12300g plain flour10g baking powder120g golden caster ordemerara sugarA pinch of salt120g cold butter,diced1 large egg, plus 3 egg yolks3 lemons500ml whole milk150g caster sugar40g cornstarch/cornflour, or plain flourWorking in large bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt.
