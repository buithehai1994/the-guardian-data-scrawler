Then I discovered her search history – and the online world that had gripped herPaula CocozzaAdele Zeynep Walton’s sibling Aimee was a talented artist who loved music. It was only after her death that Walton realised Aimee had been lured into a dangerous community – and that others may also be victims of itWed 28 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 08.07 EDTShareAdele Zeynep Walton knew something was wrong when she stumbled out of her caravan in the New Forest at 8am – she was camping with her boyfriend – and, through her sleepy fog, saw her parents’ car driving towards her. Initially annoyed by the idea of a family walk so early in the day, she then noticed that the car was veering off the track and, as it drew closer, her mother looked “hysterical”. “Straight away,” she says. “I was like, ‘It’s Aimee.’”Aimee, Walton’s younger sister, was 21 and had suffered from poor mental health for some months. She loved music technology and art – her accomplished self-portraits dot the walls of the family’s home in Southampton, where her bedroom has been left exactly as it was before her death. She was such a big fan of the singer Pharrell Williams that he called her up five times to dance on stage at his concerts. But, with her mental health deteriorating, she had become harder and harder to reach. For two months, “we didn’t know where she was, what she was doing,” Walton says.In the New Forest, on that morning in October 2022, Walton found out the awful truth: Aimee had been found dead in a hotel room in Slough, Berkshire. She appeared to have taken her own life. In the days, weeks and months that followed, Walton and her family would learn that Aimee’s path to thehotel had been laid with the help of a complex network of online connections.View image in fullscreenShe loved music and art … some of Aimee’s self-portraits in the family home.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianWalton, 25, a journalist, pieced together that Aimee had spent time on a pro-suicide forum that the Guardian has chosen not to name. The site has beenconnected to at least 50 deathsin the UK, and is nowbeing investigatedby the regulator Ofcom under theOnline Safety Act. According to the police investigating her death, it was on this forum that Aimee learned how to procure the substance that killed her, and how she met a man who flew from the US to Heathrow to accompany her while she died. (He was initially charged with assisting suicide, but no further action was taken.)Sitting in the garden of her parents’ house in Southampton, Walton explains how she came to write about what had happened. Her book,Logging Off: The Human Cost of Our Digital World, is partly the story of her sister, and partly a much broader call to arms to ordinary web-browsing, doom-scrolling, social-media-posting mortals to wake up to the harms that a largely unregulated digital world permits and perpetuates.“I thought: I need to pour all my efforts into digging deeper into this. Why are the general public not aware of these constant harms that are happening? Because it is constant. Pretty much every month I learn of a new family … And it’s like, we’ve been going on about this to MPs. Why is this still happening?” She mentions Vlad Nikolin-Caisley, also from Southampton, who died after reportedly using the same suicide forum that Aimee used; earlier this month,a woman was arrestedon suspicion of assisting his suicide.When the pre-inquest review into Aimee’s death happens in June, Walton hopes that the online factors will be brought within the scope of the inquest, and that at the inquest itself in September, “online harms” will be cited as a cause of, or contributing factor to, her sister’s death.It’s a phrase she learned only recently. “Until we lost Aimee, I didn’t know what ‘online harm’ meant,” she says. She first heard the term fromIan Russell, father of Molly, and campaigner for online safety.Molly Russellwas 14 when she took her life after viewing images and videos of self-harm, and, unusually, the coroner reported that online activity had “contributed to her death in a more than minimal way”. Walton hopes that the coroner investigating Aimee’s death will take a similar view, because she believes the word “suicide” alone heaps disproportionate responsibility on to Aimee, while leaving the digital world unaccountable and unregulated.View image in fullscreen‘We can become vulnerable at any point in our lives’ … a photograph of Aimee.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianShe initially described her sister’s death as “suicide” – but says that no longer feels like a faithful representation of Aimee’s demise. Because if suicide is a self-directed, injurious behaviour, how far can a person be judged to be self-directed when acting under the influence of a purposeful online community? And is a person really choosing freely, Walton asks, when algorithms, which continued to show Aimee content relating to self-harm, power a darkening circle of interest and exposure?“That’s where I have a difficulty with calling it suicide,” Walton says. “My feeling is that Aimee was groomed into making the decision.”Her own emergent literacy around these ideas has turned Walton into a campaigner – she works withBereaved Families for Online Safetyand is a youth ambassador forPeople vs Big Tech. “We need to name the problem and fight against it,” she says. “Because otherwise it fuels the feeling that it’s an individual responsibility to keep ourselves safe online.”Walton says the police reported that the man who was with Aimee in the hotel had shared a room with her for 11 days before she died. While the room filled up with Aimee’s notes, written in such distress that, Walton says, they are illegible, he later told the police he was “working”. Then there was the toxic substance, which Aimee is said to have obtained fromKenneth Law, a Canadian national who has beenlinked to 88 deaths in the UK, and who is under investigation by the National Crime Agency.The forum itself was founded by two men, according to a New York Times investigation, who run a number of websites for “incels”. Wanting to retrace her sister’s last steps, Walton visited the forum herself. “A lot of the posts are basically saying, ‘Your family don’t care about you’, ‘You should do it’. ‘When are you going to catch the bus?’ is a phrase they use.”Walton believes that what takes place on the forum “is a type of radicalisation into an extreme action that people otherwise might not even have considered.” She is haunted by the possibility that the man who was with Aimee when she died was “living out a sick fantasy as an incel who wants to see a young and vulnerable woman end her life”.Before Aimee’s death, Walton felt neutral about technology. But, now, she believes that “the digital world is a warped distortion of our offline world, one that intensifies its pitfalls and maximises its risks”. Walton’s consideration of victims of online harms in her book ranges widely – fromArchie Battersbee, who had accessed TikTok the day he suffered a catastrophic brain injury, toMeareg Amare Abrha, a university professor in Ethiopia who was killed following inciting posts on Facebook. She also considers the Amazon workers who have sought to unionise in a battle to improve pay and conditions, as well as “Tony”, her 90-year-old neighbour who suffered digital exclusion and whom Walton taught to use a smartphone.“For so long there was this facade of technology equals progress, technology equals innovation. That’s what I really want the book to challenge,” she says. She hopes that Trump’s inauguration, “wherethe tech guys[Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk] were lined up, was a shift for people in realising how closely these networks of power are connected”.View image in fullscreen‘Campaigning enables survivors to regain control’ … Aimee’s bedroom at their family home.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianBut, sometimes, she says, she feels like the digital equivalent of a 1970s climate scientist. And she is the first to admit that her relationship with technology is complex – as was Aimee’s. Her earliest memories of their playing together are set around the family computer in their parents’ bedroom.“There’s a video of us playing, aged one and three – Chadwick and the Sneaky Egg Thief. A colouring-in game. We’d play it over and over … We grew up playing Stardoll, Club Penguin, The Sims, FarmVille. All my prominent childhood memories with Aimee involved digital technology,” she says. “Whether it’s Xbox, Nintendo, the computer … We were doing photoshoots on the ‘digicam’ from the age of eight. Just for fun!”In a sense, Walton says, she leads “a double life”. Her book has clearly made her question her own habits. She lived in a tracksuit while writing it, but none of herInstagramposts about the project show this. She uses an app to help her reduce her screen time. She posts onTikTokabout logging off. Then again, video calls enabled her family “to grieve collectively” after her sister’s death – many of her relatives live in Turkey.Promoting the book has made it harder to stay offline. “I’m a hypocrite!” she says, because “my screen time this week is nine and a half hours.”A day? “It’s disgusting,” she says. “I am normally six hours.”And, anyway, she says, “I don’t want to present myself as perfect, like, ‘I’ve got it all under control, guys’. Because every day I’m trying again. We are up against a system that is rigged to capture our attention.”Online suicide forum investigated under new UK digital safety lawsRead moreIn the book, Walton writes that “campaigning enables survivors to regain control where it’s been taken from them”, and I wonder if it functions like that for her, because the process sounds exhausting. “Did I say that?” she says, surprised. “But, if I wasn’t doing this, where would that anger go? It would fester inside me and make me ill. I need to get it out of me.”She has recounted what happened to Aimee to support groups, her local MP (first Royston Smith, then Darren Paffey), to Peter Kyle, secretary of state for science, innovation and technology. “When we talk about online safety, often it’s child safety. And I find it really important, representing Aimee, to say, it’s not just children. We can become vulnerable at any point in our lives. And, if we only look at children’s safety we are going to see a generation get to 18 and not know how to lead safe and healthy digital lives,” she says.“I feel it’s my duty to Aimee, because I wish I could have protected her.” Her eyes are shiny with tears that don’t fall, when she says: “I’m doing what I am doing out of love for her that a lot of the time she wouldn’t let me give to her. And I think this is something that’s common with people who are struggling with their mental health. She didn’t want people to know how much she was struggling.”It can’t have been easy to make space to grieve between writing and campaigning. “Some days I’m like, I can’t really deal with this. Or, I just need a day in bed. Because my body is catching up with all the emotional stuff … Some days I cry because I wish I didn’t have to do this. I wish I was having my 20s and having a laugh.“But this is my concern: people in power will only act if they feel what this grief feels like. I would not wish that on anyone. But if Mark Zuckerberg, for example, lost a child to online harms, then he’d be like, ‘Oh my God, I need to wake up.’”Logging Off: The Human Cost of Our Digital Worldby Adele Zeynep Walton is published by Trapeze on 5 June (£20).

She was in her late 20s, so the story goes, on holiday with her young family in Florida, and flicking through a magazine, when she saw an advert for the “Monique”: a breast-enhancing bra insert, or what we’d now call a chicken fillet. It sounds like the unlikely start of a business empire, but what began there would ultimately grow into Ultimo, the lingerie brand established by Mone and her first husband, Michael. For a time it looked set to compete with the big guns of the underwear world. The Rise and Fall of Michelle Mone is a gripping two-part documentary, which first examines how Mone rose to fame and entered the heart of the political establishment, before moving on to look at her more recent nosedive into scandal and a different sort of notoriety, in next week’s episode.As Mone built her brand of bras out of a small warehouse in Glasgow, she also constructed her own legend. This is a tale of tits and assets, then, but in the way that all great BBC documentaries can be, it is also a story of culture and politics, and a broad portrait of an era, as well as a focused portrait of a person. Mone found success and fame during the late 90s, at the tail-end of Cool Britannia, in a decade still flashing the Vs of girl power, its cleavage squeezed in, up and out. By all accounts, Mone knew how to spin a yarn and put that talent to good use. Ultimo was pitched as the plucky Scottish David to the big lingerie Goliaths such as Gossard and Playtex. The documentary reports she liked to claim that Julia Roberts wore an Ultimo bra in the movie Erin Brockovich, a tale which passed into myth. The costume designer on the film denied this. Publicly, she was seen as a tough, tenacious girl-done-good in the largely male world of big business.On the surface, this is a retelling of the Michelle Mone fairytale. She grew up in poverty in Glasgow’s East End and left school at 15 with no qualifications. She grafted her way into the business world, working her way up from selling fruit and veg, via a modelling career and eventually landing on lingerie. The documentary is detailed enough that it tracks down a childhood friend and a modelling colleague, as well as talking to former contacts and advisers. It even interviews Selfridges’ lingerie buyer in the late 90s, Virginia Marcolin, who gives a convincing account of the persistent woman she met back then, who was determined to get her product into one of the biggest department stores in the UK.You can see what people saw in Mone. Quite literally, in fact. There is lots of footage from that time, as she was keen on having cameras around to document her rags to riches story, and to keep the brand, and herself, in the public eye. There are ample clips of her launching the Ultimo bra, trying to expand into Australia, and her then-new house, in which her first marriage was beginning to show signs of trouble. She talked about that, too, on TV, on chatshows, on panels. She became a celebrity, and in Ultimo’s careful choice of models, sometimes famous themselves, the brand fed the celebrity machine. It was a successful ecosystem of notoriety, but whether it was as successful a business as it appeared is one of the many questions asked here.In some ways, this is a parable of fame. Mone courted it and won it, but eventually learned that once you turn on the faucet of public attention, trying to turn it off again is a sisyphean task. Even as the Ultimo launch succeeds, there are hints of choppy waters under the smooth public image. The documentary makers question Mone’s relationship with the truth and say that of the more than 50 people who worked for Ultimo they approached, none would speak on camera, and those who did, gave less-than-flattering accounts of the workplace and asked for their identities to be hidden.How the Michelle Mone scandal unfolded: £200m of PPE contracts, denials and a government lawsuitRead moreNow, Mone is perhaps less famous for her business acumen than she is for her involvement in the lucrative “VIP lane” PPE scandal with her husband, Doug Barrowman, which was brought to public attentionby a Guardian investigation(both deny any wrongdoing and have never been arrested or charged, though do stay for the legal notes at the end of episode two, which are unusually entertaining). It builds towards their notorious interview with Laura Kuenssberg, at the end of 2023, and the second episode is a great success as an investigative thriller, carefully laying out the claims that have been made against them. But this also works as a cultural artefact, and surely Mone, of all people, would appreciate that the story makes very good television.The Rise and Fall of Michelle Mone aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMichelle MonereviewsShareReuse this content"

Why was it met with a shrug in France?Pauline BockWhatever the explanation for the incident, the reaction points to backward French attitudes – including from the president himselfWed 28 May 2025 08.51 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 14.16 EDTShareThe French president’s plane has just landed in Hanoi. Its door is open and Emmanuel Macron is standing looking at his wife, Brigitte, who is still inside. Two hands – hers –push his face. Macron seems to bring his arms up in defence, and steps back.Dumbstruck, the president turns and sees the cameras on the asphalt. He’s being filmed. In a split second, his shock morphs into a smile. He waves, charmingly, at the journalists: he’s back in control. As Macron and his wife walk down the plane’s stairs, he offers her his arm. She doesn’t take it.The strange moment was caught by Associated Press cameras, and immediately went viral, being shared around the world. Questioned by the French press, which woke up to the images on Monday morning, the Élysée Palace originallyclaimedthat the video was a deepfake, then admitted the scene was real but was simply a “moment of closeness” shared by the presidential couple. They were “decompressing one last time before the start of the visit, larking around”, a source close to the presidentbriefedthe French press. “But that was enough to feed the conspiracy theorists.”Macrondoubled downlater during the day, explaining that he and Brigitte were “bickering, or rather joking”, and that he had been “taken by surprise” by the cameras: “The video becomes a sort of geoplanetary catastrophe. In the world we live in, we don’t have a lot of time to lose. This is all a bit of nonsense.” French TV commentators were left wondering why the Élysée would deny that the whole scene happened: “It becomes newsworthy because the Élysée lied about it,” aBFMTV journalist noted. Yet the French media immediately accepted Macron’s “squabble” explanation and moved on, the story no longer leading news websites and broadcasts.French political journalists have long applied the “bedroom rule” to their coverage: what happens in the bedroom, or in romantic relationships more generally, is private and therefore not newsworthy. This has begun to change since the #MeToo movement, thanks to a younger generation of journalists keen to highlight that the private can be political, too, but the attitude remains prevalent inFrance– even more so if the person in question is the president.There were political reasons, too, to deflect attention from the video – the president is being frequently targeted by online conspiracy theories, and pro-Russia news sources have been leading on the video. Macron said: “For three weeks, people have looked at videos of me and think that I have shared a bag of cocaine with Keir Starmer, that I have fought with the Turkish president, and, now, that I am having a domestic dispute with my wife. None of that is true, yet these videos are real. Everyone should calm down.” TheÉlysée Palace’s denialin response to the “cocaine bag” story was funny and straight to the point: the palace’s X account simply tweeted a photo of the “cocaine bag”, which was really just a tissue, and commented: “That’s a tissue. To blow your nose.”The incident also reignited speculation around the circumstances of Brigitte and Emmanuel’s relationship. Some people on social media were quick to point out that he was 15 and Brigitte was his 39-year-old theatre teacher when they met. Macron has brushed it off several times over the years, speaking about theinevitability of their love, and a certain amount of PR was fed to the press back in 2017, when he was first elected. Themedia then spokeof their “20-year age difference” and of him being a “year 12 student” when they met. It is, in fact, a25-year age gap, and he was in year 10, not 12. Watching the video, it was hard not to wonder what the response would have been if the roles were reversed: what if an older man were to be filmed pushing his younger wife in the face? Would that be met with a shrug that it’s no big deal? The power and gender dynamics are different in each case – he is the president, after all – but all forms of partner-on-partner violence deserve attention.There is no way to know what transpired between them at that moment, but optics do matter, especially in the leader of a country. To imply that it is normal for a “squabble” to become physical, even if in this case there was an innocent explanation, is unhelpful at best.That Macron doesn’t see the potential problem in the video points to a narrow, obsolete understanding of couple dynamics and domestic violence. He has twice proclaimed gender equality to be the “great cause” of his presidential mandates before refusing toproperly fund it; he hasspoken in supportof the French actor Gérard Depardieu, who has recently beenfound guiltyof sexual assault and is soon to beon trial againfor rape; and to this day, the former interior minister and current justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, who was accused of sexual assault (the case has nowbeen dismissed), has remained in Macron’s cabinet.It would have been easy enough to turn this moment into a public health message. He could have simply said that he’s all right, thanks for your consideration, but that men who do experience violence should feel no shame in seeking help, using it as an opportunity to discuss domestic violence prevention. Instead,he mockedthe “fools” who thought anything could be amiss.Pauline Bock is a French journalist based in ParisExplore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronOpinionBrigitte MacronFranceVietnamcommentShareReuse this content"

Yet the rumbles and grumbles emanating from public screenings suggests a disgruntled consensus is forming around the concluding instalment: that this is an altogether disjointed way to resolve the affairs of Ethan Hunt and his IMF crew, and a shaky way to ignite the movie summer season. Ninety minutes in which nothing happens over and over again, followed by 70 minutes of M:I B-roll.‘Breath-stoppingly tense’: which Mission: Impossible film is the greatest?Read moreTo better diagnose this latest glitch in the Hollywood machine, we need to return to the relighting of the fuse. This was the franchise to whichTom Cruiseretreated in the wake of the commercial underperformance of 1999’s Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia – the two most rigorous turns of this star’s career, films in which Cruise allowed himself to be rattled and be seen to be rattled, only to be met with widespread public and awards-circuit indifference. The Mission: Impossibles, by contrast, would be the sort of 4DX-coded sure thing for which audiences have routinely turned out, a creative safe space, even as the films’ constituent set pieces pushed their prime mover into performing ever riskier business to ensure bums on seats.In those early films, the character of Hunt was as much martyr and marked man as saviour or secular saint, targeted at every turn by directors with comparably forceful visions. The sensationalist De Palma revelled in the set-up’s potential for spectacle; and while, in retrospect, the motorbike-and-mullet combo of 2000’s M:I 2, directed by John Woo and set to a bruising Limp Bizkit beat, was bound to date rapidly, the sometime animator Brad Bird, in Ghost Protocol, had the bright idea of turning the series into a live-action cartoon, with Cruise defying gravity and nature alike by hanging off the side of the Burj Khalifa and personally outrunning a sandstorm.View image in fullscreenTom Cruise attends the Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning Mexico premiere.Photograph: Toya Sarno Jordan/Getty Images for Paramount PicturesThe last four films, however, bear the imprint of screenwriter turned director Christopher McQuarrie, who concluded that what this series needed was a little more conversation, overseeing the construction of a vast story framework for his star to dangle off one-handed. That approach reaches its apotheosis inThe Final Reckoning, but the scaffolding now overwhelms the spectacle. The attempt to solder eight films together ends in much-rewritten incoherence – see Ving Rhames’s confused sendoff – and, worryingly, results in missions being described rather than shown. You wonder whether the insurers blanched after Cruise crocked an ankle shooting 2018’s Fallout; now we’re left with folks talking at length in nondescript rooms. Is this a Mission: Impossible movie, as advertised, or some M:I-themed podcast?The spectacle, when it tardily follows, is subpar; nothing rivals the train derailment in 2023’s Dead Reckoning, which perversely benefitted from McQuarrie’s yen for stringing matters out. A soggy deep dive, cramped and claustrophobic, offers another (this time depressurised) chamber piece; during a rote subterranean shootout, we learn world-ending AI generators can apparently be stored in complex cave systems. (I mean, how long’s the extension cable?) The biplane conclusion feels more like the M:Is of yore, but chiefly reminds you of Top Gun: Maverick’s superior engineering. Too often, McQuarrie has deferred to Cruise and his exhausted stunt coordinators; as a result, the series’ bank of memorable images has dwindled.Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning review – world-saving Tom Cruise signs off with wildly entertaining adventureRead moreAt this length, other flaws become apparent. While the cast expanded once the series set up shop in London, the supporting players now have far less to do, save raise sporadic eyebrows in Hunt’s direction. McQuarrie has penned great intros for his women (Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Hayley Atwell), but they’re then stranded because Cruise is neither Cary Grant nor Colin Farrell. (Onscreen chemistry remains his most impossible mission.) Making artificial intelligence the villain in 2025 is a resonant choice, but it’s never developed beyond abstract concept; the human big bad (the ever-underused Esai Morales) is an afterthought. Late M:I is mostly All About Tom, or as the credits frame it: Tom Cruise in A Tom Cruise Production.Maybe the star still has enough goodwill in the tank to get the series over the line financially, but creatively, The Final Reckoning is a busted flush: the fact it’s been outperformed on opening weekend by alive-action Lilo & Stitchseems in some way telling. For his part, Cruise has earned the right to stand alone and unbowed atop the BFI Imax like the world’s most celebrated Antony Gormley figure; his stardom has only been reaffirmed over the course of the past quarter-century. But it’s a problem when your publicity stunts generate punchier images than anything in the film you’re promoting. That long-lit fuse flickered out before it reached the explosives; and in any event, the gelignite has been swapped for flannel and waffle.Explore more on these topicsMission: ImpossibleAction and adventure filmsTom CruisefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Five introvert-friendly ways to hang outIt can be challenging to leave the house when you’re all out of eye contact, but a low social battery doesn’t have to mean a life short on socialisingJenny ValentishWed 28 May 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 21.56 EDTShareWhen I arrive at a gathering I tend to announce my departure in the same breath as my greeting. “Hi! I brought some wine, where do you want it? Just letting you know I can only stay an hour because I start work really early on Sunday mornings.” Then I might throw in a little yawn and stretch.Restaurants aren’t much different: my leg’s likely to be jiggling before the order has been jotted down. The last mouthful of dessert sounds a last-drinks bell in my head. It’s not that I don’t love my friends. I’ve just got a window of tolerance for face-to-face activities, and then the agitation kicks in.I’ve been so fascinated by social reluctance that I wrote a book exploring it,The Introvert’s Guide to Leaving the House. In my 30s, I’d embarked on a five-year mission to become more outgoing, figuring out which situations I could be comfortable in, and setting myself exercises in social etiquette, empathy and positive reframing. These techniques became second nature by the time I hit my 40s, so I decided to share what I’d learned.In my family, introvert-extrovert pairings are common. But I had to get to 36 to learn which one applied to me | Jessie ColeRead moreIt seems timely. When discussing the book with non-introverts, I realised that social overwhelm has massively broadened in recent years. Whether you blame lockdowns, news-cycle malaise or digital-era disconnect, we’re less likely to commit to an outing.But I’ve learned it’s possible to engineer low-key hangs that charge an introvert’s social battery – or at least don’t drain it as quickly.Choose shoulder-to-shoulder meet-upsThe three-second rule doesn’t just apply to dropped food. As reported by theBritish Psychological Society, a 2016 study of nearly 500 participants found the vast majority felt most comfortable with eye contact that lasted just over three seconds. Business blogs fromThroughline GrouptoIncwill tell you that’s the optimal eye gaze time because you’re showing engagement without becoming unnerving.That’s why shoulder-to-shoulder activities are such a relief. These are activities we do alongside each other rather than face to face, such as going to a gallery, playing pool, a games night, joining your local chapter of theSilent Book Clubor taking a simple walk – cheapest hangout ever. Men tend to naturally go shoulder to shoulder more than women; in fact, the Australian Men’s Shed Association slogan is “Men don’t talk face to face, but shoulder to shoulder”.Numbers: forewarned is forearmedI prefer to know in advance how many people are coming. A newish friend once suggested we go on holiday overseas. I agreed, we made an itinerary, then she announced that another woman, who I didn’t know, would be joining us. “The more the merrier!” said the friend. Worst holiday ever.The maths is simple: the more bodies there are in a social pile-up, the more overwhelming it becomes. A single person is possible to read. A scenario with two people requires split concentration to accommodate them both. More than two people means second-guessing what everyone is thinking, so knowing what is most appropriate to say is absolutely impossible.It can help to know who’s coming in order to take a moment beforehand to recall the last time you met each person and what was going on for them. Having a one to one side-conversation with someone about something that interests them is infinitely better than aimless group small talk. You could even make notes in your phone contacts whenever you’ve had an interesting chat. It’s not stalking, it’s anthropology – you’re studying your community.What if you don’t know the people? I like to gamify a situation I’m not looking forward to. In this scenario the game could be: figure out who in this group could potentially be your new BFF. Find common ground.Consider the acousticsMany introverts take the scraping of chair legs across a cafe floor extremely personally. We’re sensitive to loud, unscheduled noises (at kids’ parties, balloons were a nightmare for me), so venues with the acoustics of a concrete cube are best avoided lest we fritz our synapses. For anyone with sensory processing issues or simply of an irritable nature, a table of six people talking at once sounds like a beer hall during Oktoberfest. Worse, there’s probably going to be cross-talk, where more than one conversation is competing for our brain’s attention. In these social gatherings I often fall silent. People must think I have the consumptive constitution of a 19th-century muse.If it’s just you and a friend, you could likely get away with suggesting a venue change because you’re dying to hang on to their every word but can’t hear them. If it’s a larger group you could try wearable tech – the fancy term for earplugs. Brands such as Happy Ears, Earjobs or Loop earplugs reduce background noise while still allowing conversation to cut through.Earplugs as fashion items? I gave Loop’s hit accessories a festival testRead moreSit out strategicallyEvery year I fly back to the UK for a week-long family holiday by the seaside, but despite wanting to see my family, I find being fully present during this intensive period a real struggle. After each trip my cousin Adam posts a big album of photos to Facebook. Without fail I’m only in about two photographs, because all week I’ve been “just going back to the house”, “just off to get something” or giving them a head start to the beach hut and promising to catch up. Eventually.One year, I decided I would consciously opt to skip certain activities and fully participate in others. Of course, I chose to commit to shoulder-to-shoulder activities. For instance, I opted out of sitting and chatting in the beach hut, but committed to a board game in the evening.Think of the next lengthy get-together you’ve got coming up and consider what elements you’ll sit out and what you’ll commit to. Then make sure you’re in the photos.Manage your moodNow you’ve committed to a hangout, give yourself time to self-regulate, since your mood has an effect on others. That means no sighing on arrival or being distant.Introverts can find it harder than most to communicate what’s going on for us, but developmentally, managing our spillage is something we ought to be on top of by the time we leave school. If we’re still killing everyone’s buzz as adults, then it’s something we’ve given ourselves permission to do, hoping people will just make allowances.If your modus operandi has always been Wallow Now, Apologise Later, a good way to behaviour-check yourself is to ask: am I likely to send an apologetic text to this person later? If the answer is yes, try to tackle your behaviour in the moment instead. You might acknowledge your mood and say you’re going to reset. You could even half-jokingly ask the other person to help you out by giving you an update on their news while you’re “rebooting”.Better still, take a few minutesbeforea meet-up to focus on your positive relationship with the person and what might be going on in their life. Ultimately, the best way to get out of your own head is to consider another person’s needs.Jenny Valentish is the author ofThe Introvert’s Guide to Leaving the House(Simon & Schuster, A$36.99)Explore more on these topicsFriendshipAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

They take turns posing with a cat, passing it casually from one to the other. But as the camera settles, it becomes clear this is no house cat – it’s a lion cub. One woman, in a red cocktail dress, lifts the animal to her face and blows a kiss at the camera, a glass of wine balanced in her other hand.Clips such as this are flooding Instagram and TikTok, offering a glimpse into Thailand’s booming captive lion trade. According to a new report by theWildlifeFriends Foundation Thailand and the Oxford Wildlife Trade Research Group the number of lions in captivity has more than tripled since 2018 – a trend fuelled in part by the rising popularity of exotic pets among the country’s wealthy elite. A growing network of lion farms cater to this demand – many of them run by amateurs with little experience in wildlife care.View image in fullscreenLion breeder Patamawadee Chanpithak plays with cubs in the nursery at her farm. Photograph: Ana Norman BermudezSitting cross-legged on the floor of her nursery, lion breeder Patamawadee Chanpithak giggles as three cubs – just weeks old – clumsily crawl over her lap, nudging her with closed eyes as if trying to suckle. The room smells of kitten formula.“We were very inexperienced when we started,” she says, recalling how five of her first six cubs died within days. To date, she has sold more than 80 lions across the country.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenSocial media posts advertising cubs for hire for photoshoots and for saleSome buyers are Thai and some are foreigners, she says, but all of them are wealthy – lion cub prices inThailandstart from $5,000 (£3,700), with white cubs fetching up to $15,000. Keeping a lion is costly, requiring reinforced enclosures and up to 10kg of fresh meat a day.Most buyers want their lions as young as possible. While there are customers who buy directly from farms, breeders also work with agents who aggressively promote cubs on social media – not just to sell, but also to rent them out for photoshoots and parties.View image in fullscreenCustomers interact with a cub inside a ‘lion cafe’ in Bangkok. Photograph: Ana Norman BermudezThe problems begin once the animals grow. “Some people buy a lion and then can’t handle it,” says Patamawadee. “They ask us to buy it back.”The report suggests this “buy-back” system has become central to the farms’ business model, offering the experience of owning a lion without the long-term commitment. Older lions may be used for breeding or passed on to zoo-like venues, generating profit at every stage of life.I don’t agree with people keeping lions as pets. Our climate is too humid for them. Skin infections are commonTaweesak Anansiriwattana, Thai vetRegular transfers between facilities make it difficult to track individual lions, contributing to the gap between official records and actual figures. The report identifies at least 444 lions in captivity – up from 138 in 2018, and more than the 342 registered with Thailand’s Department of National Parks, Wildlife and PlantConservation. Researchers say the real number is probably significantly higher, as many sales and breeding activities go unregistered.View image in fullscreenCubs are not just sold, they are also rented out for photoshoots and parties. Photograph: Ana Norman Bermudez/LightRocket/Getty ImagesDespite attempts to control the trade, a number of loopholes have allowed it to flourish. In 2019, the government introduced the Wild Animal Preservation and Protection Act to regulate the ownership of non-native Cites-listed species such as lions, which previously had little protection. According to the report, the law had the unintended effect of boosting the trade in lions by creating a legal pathway with significant gaps in oversight. While lion ownership requires a licence, breeding does not – anyone who legally owns lions can also breed them. Cubs don’t need to be registered until they are 60 days old, and hybrid species such as ligers are excluded from the law altogether. The result is a thriving industry, with the trade in lion cubs alone estimated at more than $1m (£740,000) a year.Taweesak Anansiriwattana, a Bangkok vet known by his customers as Dr Vee, sits in his office in a clinic on the outskirts of the city. “I don’t agree with people keeping lions as pets,” he says. Over the past five years, he has treated more than 25 privately owned lions. “Our climate is too humid for them. Skin infections are common,” he says, adding that malnutrition is also widespread. “People feed them chicken, but they need organs like liver and intestines to survive.” Though owners are required to build enclosures measuring a minimum of 3 metres by 3 metres, fewer than half of the households Dr Vee has visited meet these standards.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAdult animals, including valuable white lions, and cubs at a breeding farm. Photographs: Ana Norman Bermudez“There are serious animal welfare challenges,” saysTom Taylor, operations chief at Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailandand co-author of the report. “Some of these facilities keep lions in cramped and barren enclosures without sunlight, on concrete substrate, and poor-quality food, resulting in a life of misery.” To meet demand, breeders often separate cubs early to force mothers back into oestrus. Inbreeding is common, especially with white lions and hybrids, which are considered more valuable.Lions, which are not native to Thailand, are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. While the country’s captive population offers little benefit to conservation, Taylor warns it is becoming fertile ground for trafficking, fuelling demand that puts wild lions at risk. “We have received credible reports from traders indicating that lions in Thailand are being illegally exported, both as live animals and dead for their body parts,” he says, adding that lion parts may be filling the market gap left by the more tightly restricted tiger trade.View image in fullscreenA Thai woman was charged with illegal possession of lion cub after a video showing the animal in a car gained 2.6m views. Photograph: Thailand Central Investigation BureauPublic safety is also a significant concern, as seen in news reports of lions escaping from private enclosures or being taken into public spaces. In 2024, a viral video of a man driving a pet lion in a convertible car caused widespread concern. In response, the director general of the department of national parks said the government was considering changes to the law, including restrictions on lion ownership.‘It shouldn’t be that easy’: inside the illegal wildlife trade booming on social mediaRead moreThe report calls for an urgent ban on private ownership and commercial breeding, tougher licensing requirements, and limits on lion cafes and photo opportunities – arguing these practices promote the glamorisation of exotic pets. “Many people are drawn to the idea of owning a lion without fully understanding the ethical, financial and safety implications,” says Taylor, adding that similar trends are emerging with other non-native species, including ring-tailed lemurs and red pandas. “We hope this report encourages the public to think about where these animals come from, the conditions they are kept in, and what happens when they grow too large and dangerous to handle.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsThe age of extinctionIllegal wildlife tradeAnimalsThailandWildlifeAsia PacificAnimal welfarefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is leading to a really serious fracturing of trust, which in some cases is irreparable,” he said.In a new report on social housing repairs and maintenance, theHousingOmbudsman Service reported a 474% increase in complaints about substandard living conditions between 2019/20 and 2024/25, with 72% identified as stemming from poor practice.Despite social landlords spending a record £9bn on repairs and maintenance in 2023/24, the ombudsman – which resolves disputes between residents and social landlords – ordered £3.4m in compensation for poor living conditions in 2024/25.“We’ve seen an unprecedented increase in complaints, which far exceeds the rising complaints in other sectors. What we’re seeing is exponential in comparison to other ombudsmen,” Blakeway said.The report is based on a review of hundreds of cases and more than 3,000 responses to a call for evidence. It features dozens of examples of bad practice, including a child’s bedroom window being boarded up for four years rather than replaced and collapsed ceilings containing asbestos left unrepaired for two years.View image in fullscreenAwaab Ishak died in December 2020 after being exposed to mould at his family’s social housing flat.Photograph: Family Handout/PAAgeing, poor-quality housing stock and the rising cost and complexity of repairs were two of the key drivers behind the rise in complaints. Almost half (45%) of social homes in England were built before 1964, and the percentage with damp and mould has risen from 4% in 2019 to 7% in 2023.Blakeway said policies had not kept pace with living standards, and called rules that say kitchens and bathrooms need only be replaced every 20 and 30 years respectively “a statement absent of aspiration from the world’s sixth wealthiest nation”.He added: “The baseline set for the quality of social housing is completely detached from the reality of consumer experience elsewhere. It’s completely inadequate in the 21st century.”The report found that landlords were “effectively rationing repairs services”, with one landlord’s policy referring to doing some repairs only when “resources are available” and others saying they would deal with emergencies only.It also found incidents of cases being closed before hazards were resolved because of “unevidenced claims that the resident had denied access”.Blakeway called for a “transformative overhaul” of the sector, including a national tenant body to strengthen the rights of residents and increase landlord accountability, as well as long-term funding for the sector.“These homes are only getting older, so we need a fundamental rethink on how we do maintenance and the investment required to preserve the social housing legacy which previous generations have worked hard to build,” he said.He called the model for maintaining existing social homes “unsustainable” and “a significant risk to the government’s vital housebuilding ambitions”.The government has announced plans to build 1.5m homes to tackle the country’s housing crisis, but there are reports ofinternal disputes over the level of funding for social housing.Awaab’s law, named after two-year-old Awaab Ishak, who was killed by mould in a social housing flat in Rochdale in 2020, is due to come into force from October, but the government has beencriticised for delaying its full implementationto 2027.From October, social landlords in England will have 24 hours to make emergency repairs, including to damp and mould, but will have until 2027 to begin fixing other hazards immediately, including asbestos and contaminated water supplies.Blakeway called the law “desperately needed” but still too reactive. “It improves the response, but it doesn’t prevent the issues,” he said.“Where is our aspiration? Landlord systems just haven’t modernised to move from a reactive approach to maintenance to a predictive approach, and that often creates long delays to repairs,” he added.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing,Communitiesand Local Government said: “Everyone deserves to live in a safe, secure home and despite the dire situation we have inherited, we are taking decisive action to make this a reality.“We will clamp down on damp, mould and other hazards in social homes by bringing in Awaab’s law for the social rented sector from October, while we will also introduce a competence and conduct standard for the social rented sector to ensure staff have the right skills, knowledge and experience to do their jobs effectively.”Explore more on these topicsSocial housingHousingEnglandSocial exclusionCommunitiesGrenfell Tower firenewsShareReuse this content"

A Red Cross field hospital said injuries from the scene included women and children with gunshot wounds.Footage showed throngs of people shouting and pushing into the building while others threw bags of flour and boxes into the crowd.“Hordes of hungry people broke into WFP’s al-Ghafari warehouse in Deir al-Balah, centralGaza, in search of food supplies that were pre-positioned for distribution,” WFP said in a statement, which warned of “alarming and deteriorating conditions on the ground”.“Humanitarian needs have spiralled out of control after 80 days of complete blockade of all food assistance and other aid into Gaza,” the statement said. “Gaza needs an immediate scale-up of food assistance. This is the only way to reassure people that they will not starve.”Short clip showing people running and a helicopter in the sky firing flaresA UN envoy compared the limited aid being allowed into Gaza to “a lifeboat after the ship has sunk”. Sigrid Kaag, the acting UN special coordinator for the Middle East, told the UN security council that people facing famine in Gaza “have lost hope”.The 11-week siege and a continuing tight Israel blockade meanmost people in Gaza are desperately hungry. Medics and aid workers in the devastated Palestinian territory have said for months that malnutrition is spreading. Bakeriesoperated by the UN World Food Programmehave closed owing to a lack of cooking gas, andprices are soaringfor the limited food available in shops and markets.Crowds of people running over a collapsed fenceThe chaotic scenes came as Gaza health officials said at least one civilian had been killed and 48 injured in a separate incident at a food distribution point in the south of the territory on the previous day. Israeli troops opened fire at the newly established site as a large crowd gathered there on Tuesday.Witnesses to that incident said Israeli forces started shooting after crowds of Palestiniansbroke through the fencesaround the centre managed by a US-backed group, chosen by Israel to ship food into Gaza, which lost control of its distribution site. An Israeli military helicopter was seen firing flares and bursts of gunfire were heard in the distance. In one video, a large crowd of panicked civilians, including women and children, can be seen running away, trampling the fencing.Footage showed hundreds of Palestinians queueing alongside barbed-wire fences shortly before the incident. As the food distribution began, thousands of starving Palestinians rushed into the site, causing at least two of the fences at the entrance queue to collapse quickly. Later footage shows all the entrance row fences collapsed in the panic that followed.Ajith Sunghay, the head of the UN human rights office for thePalestinian territories, said most of the injured people were hurt by gunfire. Gaza’s health ministry said at least one person was killed.The Israeli military said it fired “warning shots” near the compound to restore control, but denied firing towards people.In a statement released on Wednesday, Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has been authorised by Israel to take over food distribution operations to bypass the UN aid mechanisms into the Palestinian territory, said: “No shots were fired at Palestinian crowds and there were no casualties.”Annotated satellite imageThe accounts of the events of Tuesday came as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said an airstrike earlier this month had killed Mohammed Sinwar, the Hamas chief in Gaza who took the position after the death of his elder brother Yahya last year. Both were planners of the 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel. Tuesday also marked the 600th day in captivity for the remaining Israeli hostages seized that day.Satellite imagery of the Gaza food distribution centre, reviewed by the Guardian, suggests the incident took place inside an areamarked by the IDFfor evacuation as recently as Sunday.Images and videos shared by the Israel Defense Forces in preparation for food distribution showed a large clearing constructed with fortifications around it, amid the bombed-out ruins of southern Gaza. Two routes with fencing were erected for entrance and exit, with the ones for entrance having five narrow fenced rows that crowds squeezed themselves into.Map of evacuation areas and food distribution pointsRecent imagery shows tables lined up end to end inside the clearing, where several armoured IDF vehicles and at least eight aid trucks were visible. Interior photos of the aid trucks showed stacks of brown boxes shabbily packed, with stickers bearing “GHF”.Children and women were caught in the crowd, and a large dust cloud from the scrambling was visible. Some Palestinians managed to get their hands on boxes of food and run away, while others grabbed what food items they could and left.Two of the boxes opened appeared to contain oil, pasta, beans, noodles, biscuits, flour, tinned food, sugar and tahini. Some videos appeared to show people lugging away bits of wood on foot and on the back of donkey carts.View image in fullscreenPalestinians receiving food packages from the US-backed foundation in western Rafah.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesIsraelimposed a blockade on all suppliesin March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters, which the group denies. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the strip faced starvation.The IPC estimatedthat nearly 71,000 children under the age of five were expected to be “acutely malnourished”, with 14,100 cases expected to be severe in the next 11 months.Annotated satellite imageThe UN and other humanitarian organisations have rejected the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people and allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population. They have also said there was a risk of friction between Israeli troops and hungry people seeking supplies.The organisations added that the newly formed group had no experience and so would not be able to handle the logistics of feeding more than 2 million people in a devastated combat zone, a prediction the dangerous scenes on Tuesday appeared to confirm.1:42Gunfire heard as thousands rush to receive aid at Gaza distribution centre – videoThe head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, said on Wednesday that the new – US-backed – distribution model was a waste of resources and a distraction from “atrocities”.“We already have an aid distribution system that is fit for purpose,” Lazzarini said. “The humanitarian community in Gaza, including Unrwa, is ready. We have the experience and expertise to reach people in need. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking towards famine, so humanitarian [work] must be allowed to do its life-saving work now.”GHF said on Wednesday there were “many parties” that wished to see them fail. The US president, Donald Trump, said his administration was working on accelerating food deliveries to Gaza.A group of NGOs, including ActionAid, said this month: “Aid that is used to mask ongoing violence is not aid, it is in fact humanitarian cover for a military strategy of control and dispossession.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

He has denied the allegations.Lawyer Matt Jury, representing several alleged British victims of Andrew Tate, said: “We welcome the clarity from the Crown Prosecution Service that our authorities are working to ensure the Tates face justice here in the UK – they cannot be allowed to escape extradition.“At the same time, we ask once more that CPS admit its mistake in failing to prosecute Tate when he lived in the UK and finally charge him for the rape and assault of the other three women, our clients, who originally filed criminal complaints against him as long ago as 2014 but were failed by the system. They deserve justice, too.”The allegations were subject to a Hertfordshire police investigation, which was closed in 2019.The Tates are the sons of an American chess master, who also served in the US air force as a sergeant, and a British catering assistant. The brothers were raised on an estate in Luton, Bedfordshire.Andrew Tate is a former professional kickboxer who has amassed more than 10 million followers on X, sharing his lifestyle of supercars, expensive watches and private jets.He runs an online academy where he says he teaches young men how to get rich and attract women.Explore more on these topicsAndrew TatenewsShareReuse this content"

Merseyside police said detectives had been granted more time to question the man, with an extension until Thursday.The force has identified 79 people who were injured in the incident on Water Street on Monday, with 50 treated in hospital. Of those, seven remained in hospital for treatment on Wednesday afternoon, all in a stable condition, police said.1:08CCTV footage shows cars moving through groups of Liverpool fans before collision – video“I’m pleased to say that the number of people in hospital is reducing as they continue to recover from the awful incident,” Det Supt Rachel Wilson said. “I want to reassure the public of Merseyside that detectives are making significant progress as we seek to establish the full circumstances that led to what happened.”The police and Liverpool council have said that traffic management plans were in operation at the event, including rolling road closures and hostile vehicle measures.The Merseyside police assistant chief constable Jenny Sims said on Tuesday: “We had worked extensively with event organisers and key partner agencies in the months ahead of the potential parade, and a robust traffic management plan was put in place, which included a number of local authority road closures throughout the route and the city centre.“This included Water Street, which was closed to traffic. It is believed the driver of the Ford Galaxy car involved in the incident was able to follow an ambulance on to Water Street, after the roadblock was temporarily lifted so that the ambulance crew could attend to a member of the public who was having a suspected heart attack.”​It is understood planning for this year’s parade began in February and was subject to rigorous testing which met national standards. ​The budget was​ also increased significantly ​from previous parades to enhance security, with​ costs met in full by Liverpool FC.​“Hostile​ vehicle ​mitigation​” measures ​were in place along the 15km route. The plan included road closures and traffic diversions as well as road closure signage, traffic cones, accredited traffic stewards and ​traffic ​management ​vehicles, which were supported by police vehicles at key junctions.As a final barrier, the measures included a 3.5 tonne HGV, used to prevent access from hostile vehicles to Water Street. This was an identified “red route” for emergency vehicle access.Map of area where the collision occurred.However, many fans who attended the parade have said they had feared something could happen as “vehicles were edging and pushing through crowds” who had lined the streets to watch.Paul Marsden, 57, a quality and risk manager from Flint, who had been watching the parade nearby, said: “I have to say, I wasn’t surprised. I saw time and again vehicles edging and pushing through crowds leading up to the parade and during it. I warned my sons to stay back because I could recall the Nice terror attack ploughing through crowds.”He added: “I understand police and authorities want to keep parade access open for as much as possible but there needs to be lessons learned. When hundreds of thousands of people are close together, the traffic must be cordoned off with barriers protecting the whole route and not just the endpoints.”Phil Williams, from Sunderland, who was watching the parade with his 15-year-old son Harry, said he had not seen “any traffic control measures to prevent him and other cars coming along there the way they did”.“I’m absolutely staggered that the road closures didn’t go further,” he added.Adrian Littlermore, 59, from Winchester, said that even outside the city centre, pedestrians were being “pushed into the road”.He said: “You could tell the police there weren’t happy and were asking each other who was letting the cars through. There were probably 20 let through by the time we left and it was sectioned off so badly they were practically driving into the crowds.“Police on the ground were doing their best, I don’t fault them at all, but it was clear it wasn’t under control. I’m not sure at one point, at the planning stage, if there was a breakdown in communication, but there were cars going where they weren’t supposed to be.“There were people having to move their feet so the wheels didn’t go over them and people with buggies just having to stand in front of them to get between them and the cars. The drivers looked scared stiff as well, they didn’t want to be there. It wasn’t the fault of the police there, but it was like a free-for-all.”On Wednesday the prime minister visited Merseyside police headquarters and met the deputy chief constable , assistant chief constable, the police and crime commissioner, Emily Spurrell, and the metro mayor, Steve Rotheram.At the start of the meeting, Keir Starmer said: “Thank you all for making time. It’s really important for me to be here. The scenes on Monday were just awful, to see how incredible joy at an amazing achievement turned to horror in a moment.“Steve, the mayor, has been keeping me informed and updated, along with my team, but it’s really important to be here to go through this first-hand with you, so thank you for making time and ensuring that I get to see the detail in the way that I’d like to.”Rotheram said later that those who had assisted after the incident “encapsulated the true spirit” of the city.“The response from so many to such a shocking incident has shown the very best of our region at a very difficult time,” he said.“Scousers reacted, as I knew that they would, offering food and drink, warmth, somewhere to rest, even lifts across the country, and simple gestures like somewhere to charge phones or to help contact loved ones.“As the injured recover and the city returns to normality, I hope that in time people will remember a spectacular parade of colour and joy.“Thank you once again for those that assisted in whatever capacity and from wherever you come from, because you encapsulated the true spirit of this place that we’re so lucky to call home.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsLiverpool (UK news)Liverpool (Football)newsShareReuse this content"

And, just like Truss, he is using your family finances, your mortgage, your bills as a gambling chip on his mad experiment. The result will be the same.”The Reform leaderlaid out several promisesduring a speech on Tuesday designed to take advantage of disquiet among Labour voters at the government’s policies on taxes and benefits.Leading economists said the policies lacked credibility because Farage’s spending plans significantly outstripped any cost savings he planned to deliver.Having said his party is “coming for Labour” to win over the party’s traditional working-class voters, Farage said that if elected he would scrap a two-child limit on benefits and increase winter fuel payments for pensioners.The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that Reform’s proposals for deep tax cuts would blow a big hole in the public finances. A promise to raise the tax-free personal allowance alone would cost £80bn.Farage has pledged to raise revenue to cover his spending plans by finding savings from departmental budgets and by making other welfare cuts. He has also promised to scrap the government’s commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, which he said would save £45bn a year, citing calculations by the Institute for Government.However, Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the institute, said Farage had used a figure that included both public sector and private sector investment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We were right. And we were elected to fix that mess. Now in government, we are once again fighting the same fantasy – this time fromNigel Farage.“Liz Truss bet the house and lost. £45bn in unfunded tax cuts, with no means to pay for them. Markets reacted, the economy tanked and we’re all still paying the price for mortgages, rents and bills that spiralled out of control.“I won’t let that happen. Labour’s plan for change has stabilised the economy, with growth at the fastest rate in the G7 this year, four cuts to interest rates, and a pay boost for 3.5 million low-paid workers.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyTax and spendingEconomicsReform UKNigel FarageLabourKeir StarmerShareReuse this content"

Lennon said voters were very clear they believed serious environmental crimes needed to be policed and punished.“I think the bill will give people hope,” she said. “I think it’s really important to renew hope and put environmental protection at the top of the agenda.“This should give confidence to policymakers, and ensure the public knows we’re making sure our laws are fit for purpose, and closing gaps and loopholes. We just don’t talk about the nature emergency: we have a robust legal framework too.”More than 50 MSPs from all the major parties in the Scottish parliament, including the Conservatives, have supported Lennon’s decision to table the bill, which will soon go to an initial vote to confirm it can progress.Environmental campaigners are critical of theScottish government’s recent track record on the climateand nature conservation, with promised legislation watered down and spending cut. Even so, ministers in Edinburgh support Lennon’s bill in principle.Maurice Golden, a Scottish Tory MSP who backs the legislation, said the mere fact of its implementation would force companies and public agencies to be far more rigorous on environmental issues to avoid breaching it.“The context of this is an international one. We don’t want Scotland being seen as a soft touch,” he said. “What we will see, as a result of this law, is that in order to reduce the risks of malpractice, companies are going to up their game.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

We’ve played there many many times, with no issues – ever. Make of that what you will. To try to make up for it, we will be at your O2 Academy on Tuesday July 8th.”The TRNSMT festival at Glasgow Green is taking place from 11 to 13 July.Last week,Kneecapmember Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh was charged by police with a terrorism offence for allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a gig in London.The 27-year-old of Belfast was charged after an investigation by the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command and is scheduled to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 18 June.Ó hAnnaidh, who performs under the stage name Mo Chara, was charged with displaying a flag at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town, north London, on 21 November last year “in such a way or in such circumstances as to arouse reasonable suspicion that he is a supporter of a proscribed organisation”, the Met said.Thousands of fans went tosupport Kneecap at the Wide Awake festivalin Brockwell Park, south London, last Friday night.Addressing the police charge from the main stage, Ó hAnnaidh said: “I went for an interview with counter-terror police and, within days, they came to their verdict that they were going to charge me.”He later added: “They tried to stop this gig. Honestly, you have no idea how close they came to pulling us.”This month, the Met said Kneecap was being investigated by counter-terrorism police after videos emerged allegedly showing the band calling for the deaths of MPs and shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”.Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.Kneecap have said they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and apologised last month to the families of murdered MPs but claimed footage of the incident had been taken out of context and was being “exploited and weaponised”.Several of the band’s have been called off since the videos emerged.After the TRNSMT performance was cancelled, the Gloucestershire festival 2000trees wrote on X: “After loads of speculation and numerous requests from the press of late, we are happy to confirm that YES! @KNEECAPCEOL are still headlining the Thursday at 2000trees this July.”Explore more on these topicsKneecapMusic festivalsGlasgowScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The charity is also calling for the strengthening of government procurement rules for schools and other public spaces where food is served, through a review of government guidelines.Rebecca Tobi of the Food Foundation, said: “It’s worrying that children are eating so much processed meat, especially in schools, where meals should be nourishing.“The government should review the Government Buying Standards for Food and School Food Standards to ensure they align with the latest health and sustainability recommendations. This includes relaxing the rule requiring schools to serve meat three times a week and reducing the amount of processed meat served.“This would let caterers offer more beans, pulses, wholegrains, and vegetables – improving health and cutting costs. Current policies don’t support children’s long-term health or British farmers, who face unfair competition from lower-standard imported processed meat.”The report also found that four-fifths of the most commonly eaten meat-containing dishes from fast-food outlets are likely to be processed and/or highly processed meat, while sausages and bacon are two of the five most commonly eaten dishes in casual dining restaurant chains.Processed meats, which can be high in salt and saturated fat, have been classified as carcinogenic by the World Health Organization (WHO).CancerResearch UK estimates that of the 42,000 new cases of bowel cancer that occur every year in the UK, 13% are caused by eating too much processed meat.Dale Vince, a green energy industrialist and campaigner, said: “This report exposes the shocking fact that 80% of meat served in schools is either processed or is red meat, both of which are classified as carcinogenic by the WHO.

Rights groups warned it was a sign of both settler impunity and official tolerance for increasingly open and violent land grabs.Images of the latest violence were later recovered by Mohar, a photographer who works for B’Tselem, one of Israel’s most influential human rights groups.View image in fullscreenAvishay Mohar, a photographer who works for the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem, was attacked by violent settlers who injured him and nine others.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian“I went to document the residents fleeing the village,” he told the Guardian. “Throughout the day, settlers that now live in an outpost located dozens of metres from the village started wandering around provoking the residents.”Israeli settlers force about 150 Palestinians to leave their West Bank villageRead moreWhen the attack began on Saturday, the group of activists called in the police and the army. Within minutes, a military truck arrived, and soldiers moved in to disperse the settlers, eventually persuading them to retreat to their outpost.But once the soldiers had left, the settlers resumed their assault on the Palestinians. They climbed on to the roof of a livestock shed the villagers had been dismantling and began trying to push Palestinians off the structure.“At that point, the Palestinians tried to defend themselves and the settlers started hitting them, Mohar says. They started throwing stones on both sides. Meanwhile, the settlers started making phone calls. I heard them calling other settlers, telling them that the stones were being thrown at them and to come there quickly.”Moments later, dozens more settlers, some masked, descended on the village aboard trucks and ATVs. Many were carrying batons; others had firearms and rifles.View image in fullscreenThe inhabitants of Mughayyir al-Deir flee the village after settlers carry out an attack on them, injuring several men.Photograph: Avishay Mohar/Activestills“Things escalated at that point,” he said. “One of the Palestinians got hit by a rock in his face and started bleeding. Then I saw a settler that also was hit by something. I didn’t know what it was, but he fell on the ground. He had a gun on his belt. Another settler immediately took the gun off his belt and started shooting. It was a pistol.”Palestinians fled alongside the activists, scrambling toward a nearby valley while settlers continued to fire shots and hurl stones.“My son Omar, who is just 14 years old, was taking videos to document the attack of the settlers,” said Mlehat, 47, one of the Palestinian men. “The settler used a drone to chase us. They beat my son Omar on the head, he was left more than half an hour bleeding on the scene.”“They did not shoot in the air,” Mohar said. “One had a pistol and two were shooting with M16s or other long rifles. Some of us were hit on the way. I was hit by a rock. On the way, two settlers caught me and hit me and stole everything from me. I had three cameras, one video camera. They stole everything and also my backpack. They searched my pants and took my wallet and car keys.”Mohar began to run as settlers kept shooting in his direction. When they reached the main road, Palestinians and activists realised they had been surrounded.Violent Israeli settlers under UK sanctions join illegal West Bank outpostRead more“We had nowhere to go,” Mohar says. “Those settlers kept shooting at us and telling us to come over to them. We understood that we had nothing to do other than to walk towards them.“When we got there, the settlers immediately took all of our phones and all the things we had in our pockets and smashed it with rocks. Then they made us all sit on the ground. Both masked and unmasked settlers started hitting us with batons and with rocks. They kicked us while we lay on the ground. I got hit by batons on my head, on my eyes, on my back.”“I was sure that they were going to kill me because they kept hitting me with batons and kicking me. But then I heard one of the settlers telling his friends – because I’m Jewish and not Palestinian – ‘don’t kill him, hit him in the balls’. Then they tried to spread my legs and hit me, but I managed to flip on my belly.”The settlers left the injured where they lay and departed before the ambulance arrived. Ten Palestinians were wounded, some with multiple fractures.“This is all part of a project of ethnic cleansing in the West Bank,” said Mohar. “It’s not done by crazy settlers. It’s a state project. The state is informed of everything. If there was a will to stop those attacks, it would have happened in a minute.”View image in fullscreenSettlers from an outpost erected near the village of Mughayyir al-Deir walk around the villagers’ houses as its inhabitants pack their belongings in order to flee.Photograph: Avishay Mohar/ActivestillsTwo violent Israeli settlers, Neria Ben Pazi and Zohar Sabah, who had joined the campaign to drive Palestinians from their homes in Mughayyir al-Deir,had sanctions imposed on them last week by the UK. According to witnesses, they did not take part in the attack.“We lost 25 houses,” said Mlehat, father of the injured 14-year-old boy. “The whole community were displaced. Those settlers are terrorists. They pursue ethnic cleansing against us. They don’t care if you are a child or a grown-up, they do not discriminate between a man or a woman. All of us are a legitimate target for them. What can we do?”For many of the families forced out, it was a second displacement at the hands of Israelis, as their parents and grandparents had been forced from land near the Israeli city of Be’er Sheva when the state was formed in 1948.4:35Could the West Bank become the next Gaza? – video explainerExplore more on these topicsWest BankIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We are facing a discredit of climate policies. I don’t think we are facing climate denial,” he said, referring to the increasingly desperate attempts to pretend there is no consensus on climate science that have plagued climate action for the past 30 years. “It’s not a scientific denial, it’s an economic denial.”This economic denial could bejust as dangerousand cause as much delay as repeated attempts to deny climate science in previous years, he warned in an exclusive interview with the Guardian.‘A future on our terms’: how community energy is lighting up Latin AmericaRead moreAs the climate crisis has gathered pace, temperatures have risen and the effects of extreme weather have become more obvious, scientists have been able to draw ever more clearly the links between greenhouse gas emissions and our impacts on the planet. So the argument has shifted, Corrêa do Lago believes, from undermining or misrepresenting the science to attempts to counter climate policy.“It is not possible to have [scientific] denialism at this stage, after everything that has happened in recent years. So there is a migration from scientific denial to a denial that economic measures against climate change can be good for the economy and for people.”The rise of populist politicians around the world has fuelled a backlash against climate policy, most clearly seen in the presidency ofDonald Trumpin the US, where he has set about cancelling policies intended to boost renewable energy and cut greenhouse gases, and dismantling all forms of government-sponsored climate-related institutions, including scientific research labs.Corrêa do Lago wants to spur a new global effort to persuade people that remodelling the economy away from a reliance on fossil fuels and towards a clean energy future will reap benefits for all people. “The new populism is trying to show [that tackling the climate crisis does not work],” he said. “It’s the turn of those who believe in the fight against climate change to show and to prove that fighting climate change is possible, and that it can come with economic advantages and with a better quality of life.”Corrêa do Lago is an economist by training – the youngest of five brothers, all of whom became economists. “My mother was horrified with our lack of originality,” he joked.He has been a career diplomat, having joined Brazil’s foreign service in 1983 and serving previously as ambassador to India and Japan. He is also a veteran of the Cop talks – the annual “conference of the parties”, which will take place this year in Belém, near the mouth of the Amazon, in November.“Most of the answers have to come from the economy,” said Corrêa do Lago. “Because we have now enough science, enough demonstration of how climate change can affect people’s lives. Now we need answers [in the form of policy measures]. We need economists to rally.”View image in fullscreenWorkers constructing an avenue, named Liberdade, or Freedom, before Cop30 in Belém, Brazil.Photograph: Jorge Sáenz/APOver the past two decades, economists have begun to take on the challenge of the climate crisis, after the 2006 landmark review by Nicholas Stern, the former chief economist of the World Bank, which found it would be cheaper to tackle emissions than to allow them to run unchecked. That contradicted the conclusions of some previous economists, who had claimed it was not worth trying to move away from fossil fuels, or it would be too expensive.Since then, multiple reports have proved the same point. Most recently, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the UN Development Programme produced a joint report this year, with the final version to come out next month, showing thattackling the climate crisis would materially increase economic growth, rather than being a necessary cost.But much mainstream thinking on economics does not take the climate crisis into account. Most governments preparing budgets, for instance, do not include climate impacts in their estimates, and nor do businesses. Many of the economic estimates of climate damage are also far too modest. For Corrêa do Lago, this shows that much more needs to be done.“Climate has not been incorporated into economic theory in a satisfactory way yet,” he said. “Because it’s a very disturbing element.”Corrêa do Lago also faces the task ofcorralling 196 nations into producing new national plans on greenhouse gas emissionswithin the next few months, and meanwhile Brazil is already wrestling with thelogistical challengesof holding Cop30 in a rainforest. There was controversy earlier this year over a road being built through the forest to the city, though Brazilian officials said the road had already been planned before Cop30 was awarded to Belém. There are also concerns about the environmental credentials of the Brazilian president as his government continues to approve mines and oil drilling projects.Will Cop30 in Belém help or harm the Amazon?Read moreBut those pale in comparison with geopolitical headwinds.Trump will not attend the talksand has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, and his actions have emboldened countries that wish to derail progress. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Argentina, Venezuela and a host of other countries, including petrostates and populist-leaning governments, are all possible mischief-makers. Other major economies may be less overtly disruptive but also could fall well short in their commitments, with equally damaging effects.Each country is supposed to prepare a nationally determined contribution (NDC), a complex document setting out targets on greenhouse gas emissions to 2035 and sometimes beyond, and policies intended to meet them. But so far only a handful of countries – not including the EU, China, Japan or India – have submitted their NDCs, even though the deadline passed in February.The UK’s plan was submitted last year, along with Brazil’s.Brazil and last year’s hosts, Azerbaijan, are working on a “roadmap” that will set out what countries must do to achieve the financial goals that will also be a key issue. The outline will be ready before governments gather in the Amazon in November.For Corrêa do Lago, the hope is that the world can come together to solve the existential crisis of the climate in the way governments did 40 years ago to tackle the hole in the ozone layer. “Climate change is much more complex, and the gases act for much longer, and the impact on the economy is infinitely larger than the elimination of the gases that deplete the ozone layer. But the ozone layer is the only example of the phenomenon that connected human action could change the direction [of an environmental crisis].”If we fail? “The alternative is accelerating climate change.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisBrazilAmericasUnited NationsClimate science scepticism and denialClimate financenewsShareReuse this content"

Another false claim was thatPakistan’s powerful military chiefhad been arrested and a coup had taken place. “We’ll be having breakfast in Rawalpindi tomorrow,” was a widely reshared post in the midst of hostilities, referring to the Pakistani city where its military is headquartered.Many of these claims were accompanied by footage of explosions, crumbling structures and missiles being shot from the sky. The problem was, none of them were true.‘Global trend in hybrid warfare’Aceasefire on 10 Maybrought the two countries back from the brink of all-out war after the latest conflict, which marked the biggest crisis in decades between the nuclear-armed rivals, and was ignited after militants opened fire at a beauty spot in Indian-controlled Kashmir, killing 26 people, mainly Indian tourists. India blamed Pakistan for the attack – a charge Islamabad has denied.Yet even as military hostilities have ceased, analysts, factcheckers and activists have documented how a fully fledged war of disinformation took place online.Misinformation and disinformation was also being circulated widely in Pakistan. The Pakistan government removed a ban on X shortly before the conflict broke out, and researchers found it immediately became a source of misinformation, though not on the same scale as in India.View image in fullscreenA fake image on X purporting to show fighter planes on fire in Udhamphur, India.Photograph: XRecycled and AI-generated footage purportedly showing Pakistani military victories was shared widely on social media and then amplified by both its mainstream media, respected journalists and government ministers to make fake claims such as the capture of an Indian pilot, a coup in the Indian army and Pakistani strikes wiping out India’s defences.There were also widely circulated fake reports that a Pakistani cyber-attack had wiped out most of the Indian power grid and that Indian soldiers had raised a white flag in surrender. In particular, video game simulations proved to be a popular tool in spreading disinformation about Pakistan “delivering justice” against India.A report into the social media war that surrounded the India-Pakistan conflict,released last weekby the civil society organisation The London Story, detailed how X and Facebook “became fertile ground for the spread of war narratives, hate speech, and emotionally manipulative disinformation” and “drivers of nationalist incitement” in both countries.In a written statement, a spokesperson for Meta, the owner of Facebook, said it had taken “significant steps to fight the spread of misinformation”, including removing content and labelling and reducing the reach of stories marked as false by their factcheckers.While disinformation and misinformation were rampant on both sides, in India “the scale went beyond what we have seen before”, said Joyojeet Pal, associate professor at the school of information at the University of Michigan.Pal is among those arguing that the misinformation campaign went beyond the usual nationalist propaganda often seen in both India and Pakistan: “This had the power to push two nuclear armed countries closer to war.”View image in fullscreenFake images claiming to show India’s Narendra Modi stadium in ruins were shared and debunked on X.Photograph: XAnalysts say that it is evidence of a new digital frontier in warfare, where an onslaught of tactical misinformation is used to manipulate the narrative and escalate tensions. Factcheckers say misinformation including the repurposing of old footage and widespread fake claims of military victories mirrored much of what had come out of Russia in the early days of the Russia-Ukraine war.The Washington DC-based Centre for the Study of Organized Hate (CSOH), which tracked and documented the misinformation coming from both sides, warned that the weaponisation of misinformation and disinformation in the the most recent India-Pakistan conflict was “not an isolated phenomenon, but part of a broader global trend in hybrid warfare”.Raqib Hameed Naik, the executive director of CSOH, said there had been “a pretty catastrophic failure” on the part of social media platforms to moderate and control the scale of disinformation that was being generated from both India and Pakistan. Of the 427 most concerning posts CSOH examined on X, some of which had almost 10m views, only 73 had been flagged with a warning. X did not respond to request for comment.Fabricated reports from India first emerged largely on X and Facebook, Naik said, often shared or reposted by verified rightwing accounts. Many accounts openly supported the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government, led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, which has a long history of using social media to push its agenda. BJP politicians also reposted some of this material.View image in fullscreenDeepfake videos putting words into the mouths of Narendra Modi and other Indian politicians have been exposed on the same platforms that shared them.Photograph: XAmong the examples circulating were a 2023 video of an Israeli airstrike on Gaza that was falsely claimed as an Indian strike on Pakistan, as well as an image of an Indian naval drill from the same year presented as evidence that the Indian navy had attacked and taken over Karachi port.Video game imagery was passed off as real-life footage of India’s air force downing one of Pakistan’s JF-17 fighter jets, while footage from the Russian-Ukraine war was claimed to be scenes of “massive airstrikes on Pakistan”. Doctored AI visuals were circulated widely to show Pakistan’s defeat and visuals of a Turkish pilot was used in fabricated reports of a captured Pakistani pilot. Doctored images were used to fabricate reports of the murder of Pakistan’s popular former prime ministerImran Khan.Many of these posts first generated by Indian social media accounts gained millions of views and the misinformation spread to some of India’s most widely watched TV news.‘Fog of war accepted as reality’India’s mainstream media, which have already suffered a major loss of credibility owing to their heavy pro-government stance under Modi, are facing difficult questions. Some prominent anchors have already issued apologies.Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), an Indian human rights organisation, has filed formal complaints to the broadcasting watchdog for “serious ethical breaches” of six of the country’s most prominent television news channels in their reporting of Operation Sindoor.Teesta Setalvad, the secretary of CJP, said the channels had completely abandoned their responsibilities as neutral news broadcasters. “Instead, they became propaganda collaborators,” she said.Uneasy India-Pakistan ceasefire holds but is a return to war inevitable?Read moreKanchan Gupta, a senior adviser to the Indian ministry of information and broadcasting, denied any government role in the misinformation campaign. He said the government had been “very alert” to the issue of misinformation and has issued explicit advice to mainstream media reporting on the conflict.“We set up a monitoring centre which operated 24-7 and scrutinised every bit of disinformation that could have a cascading impact, and a fact check was put out immediately.Social mediaplatforms also cooperated with us to take down vast numbers of accounts spreading this disinformation. Whatever was in the ambit of the law to stop this was done.”Gupta said that “strong” notices had since been issued to several news channels for a violation of broadcasting rules. Nonetheless, he emphasised that the “fog of war is universally accepted as a reality. It is a fact that in any conflict situation, whether overt or covert conflict, the nature of reportage tends to go high-pitch”.Explore more on these topicsIndiaPakistanWar reportingSouth and central AsiaKashmirSocial mediaDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It wasmovedto Saudi Arabia in 2006 from Alabama, US. Before that, the plant’s home was in the UK.The plant can produce about 1m tonnes a year of direct reduced iron (DRI), a material that can be used in green steel production. Decades after the plant left the UK – shippedin 28,000 pieces– British ministers are now considering reversing course and funding a similar facility once again.However, the government’s DRI ambition is controversial within the British steel sector; the lobby group UK Steel told the Guardian that a DRI plant was not its priority. Senior industry insiders said they were concerned that hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayer money may be spent on funding a “white elephant”.View image in fullscreenThe British Steel plant at Scunthorpe.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianThe government last monthrecalled parliament to pass emergency legislationto take control of British Steel’s two blast furnaces at Scunthorpe, amid concerns its Chinese owner, Jingye, was days away from closing it. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and the industry minister Sarah Jones said the effective takeover was necessary to preserve the UK’s ability to produce “virgin” or primary steel from iron ore.The Scunthorpe blast furnaces, known as Queen Anne and Queen Bess, are the last two operating in the UK. However, despitereceiving materials supplies for several months, they are running out of time, and ministers are hoping to find a way of retaining primary steelmaking abilities.Blast furnaces use the carbon in coal to strip oxygen from iron ore. That process eventually results in carbon dioxide being vented into the atmosphere, where it heats the globe. Many steel companies areswitching to much cleaner electric arc furnaces, which use electricity to melt down scrap steel. However, they cannot produce iron from iron ore.That is where DRI could come in. The process strips out the ore’s oxygen using gas. While the vast majority of DRI uses methane, resulting in carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere, switching to using green hydrogen could allow iron production without significant emissions..Ministers have repeatedly cited DRI as a strong contender to receive part of a £2.5bn fund for a new steel strategy. Reynolds last month told parliament: “Direct reduced iron technology is of significant potential interest to us for the future.”Yet, within the industry the idea is seen as a lower priority thanreducing energy costsand preventing a flood of metal imports diverted to avoid Donald Trump’s tariffs, according to the lobby group UK Steel and several industry executives.Several executives and industry experts have raised significant doubts over whether a new UK DRI plant, costing up to £2bn to build, would provide good value for money.The owners of the two biggest steelworks, Tata Steel at Port Talbot, Wales, andBritish Steelat Scunthorpe, are not thought to be interested in sourcing the huge DRI supplies that would justify a plant. Other, smaller producers such as Celsa in Cardiff and Liberty Steel at Rotherham could use DRI, but do not need to.Energy costsView image in fullscreenSteel rolls stacked up the German steel company Salzgitter AG. Steelworks tend to cluster around abundant and cheap sources of energy.Photograph: Fabian Bimmer/ReutersUK Steel said it would be better to focus on reducing sky-high energy costs at existing plants tomatch rates in France and Germanythan on subsidising an expensive new facility. As the Saudi plant’s trajectory shows, DRI plants have tended, like much heavy industry, to cluster in countries with abundant, cheap energy. The UK has some of the highest industrial energy prices in the world.“The UK steel industry is in crisis, facing uncompetitive market conditions, shrinking demand, and global trade pressures,” UK Steel said.“While the steel strategy is an opportunity to formulate a long-term vision for the sector, the government must also assess how its finite resources are best allocated at this point in time. Addressing urgent issues like electricity prices and trade defence must clearly take priority in order to put our sector on a sustainable footing.”The trade body said that efforts to assess how to meet future demand for steel would include assessing the need for – and viability of – a UK DRI plant, adding: “Energy costs and access to affordable hydrogen will underpin this assessment, balanced against investing in new capabilities, energy efficiency, and productivity improvements.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

New DRI plants usually only employ about 200 people.Crisis backupView image in fullscreenArcelorMittal’s plant in Ghent, Belgium, has embarked on a €1.1bn project to build a 2.5m tonne DRI plant and two new electric furnaces.Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty ImagesHowever, union leaders and many MPs believe that virgin steel is crucial either for making weapons in case of war, or for economic resilience in crises such as pandemics. Saudi Arabia is the only member of the G20 group of developed economies that does not have blast furnaces to make iron for steel production. But its two DRI plants mean it could theoretically, at a pinch, keep producing iron and therefore steel.Alasdair McDiarmid, the assistant general secretary at Community, a union representing UK steelworkers, said there was a strong case for DRI investment.“Investment in DRI can make our steel greener and more competitive, while maintaining the UK’s primary steelmaking capability, which is so crucial in our volatile world,” he said.“DRI is fully compatible with electric arc furnaces and would make them more sustainable by delivering a secure, homegrown supply of metallics, and allowing for the future adoption of hydrogen-based steelmaking.”The UK government is awaiting a report on DRI by the Materials Processing Institute, a Middlesbrough-based research organisation, which is expected to recommend DRI as necessary to maintain primary steelmaking. Ministers will have to weigh up whether to heavily subsidise a plant to attract a private sector investor.“People see it as a bit of a red herring,” one industry leader said. “Stop going on about this DRI stuff. If you’ve got limited resources, you would probably do something else.”Explore more on these topicsSteel industryGreenhouse gas emissionsManufacturing sectorBritish SteelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Buta new studybased on data collected over two decades in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, suggests that another physical attribute might be just as important – and it’s one that declines even faster than strength as the years go by. The good news? It might also be less uncomfortable, and even slightly safer, to improve. Also, it will probably make you better at table tennis.Power, in case your physics is a bit rusty, is force multiplied by velocity – or to put it another way, how quickly you can apply the strength you have. Sprinters, high jumpers and hurdlers need huge amounts of power; marathon runners, who prioritise endurance over explosive strength, don’t. Olympic weightlifting, where heavy barbells are thrown overhead in mere milliseconds, is incredibly power-dependent (unlike the confusingly named powerlifting, where grinding a bench press upwards can take several seconds). As for rugby, “If you said to a rugby coach: ‘Would you want a really strong player or a really powerful one?’, they’re going to pick power every time,” says the strength and conditioning coach Joe Lightfoot. But power also plays a pivotal role in day-to-day movement, from running up a flight of stairs to catching yourself when you fall, and it’s here that it becomes most important for quality of life. In a recently completed study that tracked almost 4,000 men and women aged between 46 and 75, power was a stronger predictor of mortality than relative strength – meaning that, everything else being equal, people who can produce forcequicklyare less likely to die early.One reason for this might be accident prone-ness. “Power is likely more related to the risk of falls than strength,” says Dr Claudio Gil Araújo, one of the lead authors on the study. “Let’s say you are walking down the street and stumble. To keep your balance and avoid falling, you will have to use your muscles to quickly make compensatory movements – and as we know, a fall, especially for older people, can have serious repercussions on your health. This is where muscle power comes in.”Part of the problem with this is that power tends to peak in your late 20s and early 30s – this is where elite sprinters typically hit their peak – and declines more quickly than other qualities if you don’t train it. “It’s strongly advisable to include power training in exercise regimes for individuals in their 30s, 40s and 50s,” says Arto Hautala, an associate professor of physiotherapy and rehabilitation at Finland’s University of Jyväskylä. “Consider something as simple as crossing at traffic lights: you need to be quick enough to cross the street within the allotted time, which can be a challenge without power.”View image in fullscreenExplode upward in a press-up.Photograph: diego_cervo/Getty ImagesSo how do you build it? Well, one way is to just keep doing the same physical things you already do, but a bit faster. “Running upstairs is one of the simplest ways to incorporate power training into your daily routine, and it also incorporates the elements of coordination and balance we need as we age,” says Lightfoot. “You could also try hill sprints or even regular sprints – though for the latter, you need to be more careful and warm up properly.”Jumping movements (often known as plyometrics) are the next level – it’s impossible to do these slowly, so power is a prerequisite. Here, though, it’s crucial to build up to the harder stuff properly, and minimise your risk of injury. (This is particularly true if you have osteoporosis. “While moderate-impact exercise – such as running or racket sports – is generally safe for people with osteoporosis, we recommend that people who have suffered spinal fractures, or multiple broken bones as the result of osteoporosis, stick to low-impact exercises such as walking or stair climbing,” says Kirsty Carne, a senior osteoporosis specialist nurse at the Royal Osteoporosis Society.)“There’s a great set of movements that athletics coaches use known as the ‘rudiment hop’ series,” says Lightfoot. “They are very simple – just low-amplitude jumps done forward, backward, sideways or in place – and much safer than more high-speed moves, but you can start with a handful and build up to a solid volume of them.”Skipping does something similar, encouraging you to keep your jumps low and challenging your coordination: if you have never mastered it, there’s never been a better time to start. Once you’ve got the hang of small hops, you can move up to jumps for height, or for distance: the “broad jump”, where you take off and land on both feet at once, is a great test of explosiveness, and relatively safe. You can also try rebound jumps, where you’ll step, or lightly hop, off a box, and then explode into another jump, though that’s slightly more advanced. Don’t do more than a few of these at a time, though, and stop well before your legs get tired: you’re trying to build explosiveness, not endurance.View image in fullscreen‘Running upstairs is one of the simplest ways to incorporate power training into your daily routine.’Photograph: amriphoto/Getty ImagesIf you’re going to the gym, you can still do a lot of the same movements you are already doing – but just make a few tweaks to the way you do them. “When we talk about power training, what we typically mean is using high velocity or speed of execution in the concentric, or ‘raising’, phase of the movement,” says Araújo. “This is often represented by the simple expression ‘as fast as possible’.” In other words, if you’re doing a press-up or squat, you’ll do the downward, or eccentric, part of the movement slowly and under control, then explode upwards for the concentric part.If you’re using free weights or weight-training machines, it’s a good idea to do this with 50-70% of the weight you could lift for a single rep – or about the same weight as you’d lift for 10-15 reps of a slower, more traditional movement. “You should aim for a weight where you can complete six to eight repetitions without the last reps decreasing in speed, resting for one or two minutes between sets,” says Araújo. “If you can reach more reps, increase the weight.”One little-considered benefit of training like this is that it’s often a lot more pleasant than many traditional styles of training. If you’re doing six to eight reps with maximum speed and stopping when you slow down, there’s no need to go to failure – you’re teaching your muscle fibres to fire together, rather than forcing them to work to their limit. But it might also be a safer way to train for people as they age. “Arterial blood pressure, or BP, dramatically increases during heavy resistance training,” says Araújo, referencingstudies showingthat BP also increases dramatically with each rep, especially as a lifter approaches failure. “Thus, the maximal BP tends to be lower at the end of six to eight than with 10-15 high-intensity reps. ”Finally, of course, you could just get into a sport. Almost any athletic endeavour includes some sort of power component – and generally speaking, the shorter each individual “effort”, the more power-intensive it is. But whether you’re hurling a barbell overhead, or practising your push-block in table tennis, the important thing is to start building power before it’s too late. Because power isn’t just for elite athletes – it’s essential for maintaining speed, coordination and resilience as you age. Developing it now might mean staying agile, capable and confident in your movements for the rest of your life.How to power up your exerciseView image in fullscreenMedicine ball throws have plenty of variations.Photograph: Hirurg/Getty ImagesIf you don’t just want to do your existing workout regime faster, try adding some of these extras to your training plan.Medicine ball throwsCrossFit and Hyrox both use the upward variety as a staple of their programming, but there are loads of varieties to try – if you’ve got the space. “One-armed throws, two-armed throws, overheads and slams on the ground are all great ways of generating power,” says Lightfoot. “Just make sure you’re not using a ball that bounces if you’re doing slams.”Precision jumpsThese are a key move in parkour – and a fun way to challenge your body without overdoing it. Pick a point to jump to – a kerb is ideal, but even a line on the floor will do – and then jump to it as accurately as possible, trying not to stumble on the landing. If you make it, shuffle back a bit from your starting point and try again.Sled workMore and more gyms are including sled tracks, and you don’t need much weight to challenge yourself. Use a sled that allows you to move at a decent speed, and push or pull it for 10-20 metres, rest for a minute, then go again.Inverted pullsPulling can be tricky to do with power – unless you’ve got enough strength in reserve to do an explosive pull-up – but using a suspension trainer is a great option, allowing you to put a little bit of oomph into each rep. Stand a decent distance from an overhead anchor point (your body should be at about 45 degrees from the ground) and pull hard on each rep.Kettlebell swingsAlmost every kettlebell move requires power to do properly: if you’re using your shoulders for the movement, you’re doing it wrong. To get your swing working, drive your hips forward and keep your arms loose, like ropes connecting your body to the bell.For something more structured, the Results Inc head coach, Callum Roberts, has put together two workouts that you can do at home, without any equipment. Warm up first – a practice rep or two of each move will do.Workout one: speed“These exercises are all about controlled explosiveness, and moving with intent – good for when you need that extra push, such as picking up a wriggling toddler or hoisting a box into the loft,” says Roberts. “After a brief pause at the bottom of each, drive up as fast as you can, and repeat each move three times, for three to five sets. Rest for two minutes between sets. You shouldn’t feel out of breath, but your body needs to recover fully to maximise power.”Sprinter step-backStand tall with feet hip-width apart, then step one foot back into a deep lunge, driving the opposite arm forward (as if you’re on the start line for a race), and keeping your front knee stacked over your ankle. Push through your front heel to drive back up to standing, and alternate sides. If you’re confident, try sprinter lunges, where you alternate from one side to the other without touching the ground in between.Power press-upDo this one on a wall, kitchen counter, sofa or the floor, depending on how powerful you are feeling. Set your hands just wider than shoulder-width apart, engage your core and lower with control. Now explode upwards into the rep. Ideally, your hands should briefly leave whatever you’re pressing off, but just moving quickly is fine. Catch yourself softly and repeat.Paused squat jump (or squat to heel raise)Sink into a squat and pause, holding it for a second. Now drive up – jump off the ground (no tuck), land soft, and drop right back into the next pause. This isn’t about rushing – it’s about control into power. No jump today? No problem. Rise up to the balls of your feet in a strong heel raise and lower under control.Workout two: reactive power“These movements help your body react quickly, and stay relaxed and springy,” says Roberts. “They’re good for balance, coordination and staying agile. Aim to minimise the amount of time spent on the floor.” Do five reps per side, for three to five sets. Rest for one to two minutes between sets.Forward scissorsStand tall, with your arms up as if you’re ready to sprint. Now, think quick feet – one foot forward, one foot back – staying light as you switch quickly between positions. Keep your upper body steady while the legs do the work. Need to slow it down? Step rather than jump, and make the movement faster over a few sessions.High plank shoulder tapsThe high plank is basically the top of a press-up: your shoulders should be over your wrists, your heels driving back, and core locked in. Now, without shifting your hips, tap one shoulder with the opposite hand. Then switch. Keep your glutes tight, and your body in a straight line from head to heel. Strong and still is better than fast and wobbly.Lateral pogosStart with your feet together, knees soft and core braced. Now bounce from side to side as if you’re skipping over an invisible line. This should all come from the ankles and calves – keep your heels just off the ground and stay springy. Eyes forward, chest out, arms relaxed at your sides. You are training agility and power here – small jumps, big control. Need to ease in? Just step from side to side using one foot at a time.Explore more on these topicsFitnessHealth & wellbeingAgeingHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Beijing émigré (played by Disney mainstay Ben Wang) is barely settled into his new Manhattan surrounds when he finds himself schooling Victor, a West Side pizzaiolo (Joshua Jackson), in the ways of kung fu to help him win a boxing purse and clear his debt with an unfriendly neighborhood loan shark (Tim Rozon). But when Victor is cheated out of a certain win by an illegal knockout blow, Fong is reminded of the tragic death of his kung-fu idol older brother, and his frozen reaction in the moment puts him at odds with Victor’s daughter Mia, an emerging love interest (Sadie Stanley),andhis own mother (Ming-Na Wen), who explicitly forbade him from fighting.‘I should really be the world champion’: Ralph Macchio on kicking it as The Karate Kid for 41 yearsRead moreBesides acing the SAT and fitting into a new high school, Fong is further charged with reinvigorating a cultural institution attempting its first feature film reboot in 15 years. Inferior franchises have buckled under lesser pressure. All of it had the makings of a disaster recipe for director Jonathan Entwistle. But Rob Lieber’s script embroiders those plot points on to a classic underdog story that feels even more resonant at a time when young people appear to be more lonely and powerless than ever. Sure, longtime Karate Kid watchers will see many of Legends’ punches coming, but there’s vastly more enjoyment to be taken from watching the film with young viewers who are either coming into the Karate Kid world fresh or from Netflix’s Cobra Kai TV series spinoff. (Kids ruled my screening of the film in Atlanta, where many of the exterior and street scenes in Legends were shot.)To set up the passing of the bandana, the film opens with a scene between Daniel-san and Mr Miyagi fromThe Karate KidPart II. In it, Miyagi explains the connection between his brand of karate and a style of kung fu practiced in China – “two branches of the same tree”, as it were. That’s our reintroduction to Fong’s uncle, Mr Han (Jackie Chan) – the kung-fu master (and carryover from the 2010 Karate Kid sequel) who keeps Fong fighting over his mother’s objections. He’s the one who pushes Fong to enter a lucrative New York martial arts tournament after he gets in over his head, and the one who flies out to Los Angeles to recruitMasterDaniel (played by a still-fresh-faced Ralph Macchio) to prepare Fong for the make-or-break event.It all makes for a winsome 94 minutes that satisfies young audiences’ taste for constant action and plays to adult viewers’ sense of nostalgiaandmakes them both laugh at the same jokes. (Fong picks up the nickname “Stuffed Crust” after committing the worst New York pizzeria ordering faux pas imaginable.) Viewers of a certain generation will have a hard time not feeling old when they see Jackson (AKA Pacey of Dawson’s Creek) as a grizzled girl dad, or Wen (AKA Street Fighter’s Chun-Li) as a helicopter mom. (Maybe she’ll get some fight scenes in the sequel?) Wyatt Oleff – the Entwistle holdover who plays Fong’s tutor turned wingman, Alan – was delightful too in his moments of repartee with Fong, who initially recoils from this mother-enforced relationship. (In my screening, Alan got the night’s biggest laugh off the bat when he asks Fong, who sports a shiner when they first meet, if his mom “did that to your eye”.) But for Karate Kid fans ofthisgeneration, the biggest payoff is likely to come when the callback to Cobra Kai is finally revealed.For my money, though, the far bigger surprise was the chemistry between Chan and Macchio. It really saves what could’ve been a too-many-cooks situation. (Surely there’s a Zen koan about the vanity of the student withtwomasters … ) Chan in particular remains the all-time best at getting laughs through martial artistry, and there’s an apartment break-in scene between him and Fong that wouldn’t look out of place in Rush Hour or another of Chan’s stuntwork ballets.Still: that’s not to say Legends is a perfect reboot. The grownups in the room who were too young to appreciate character development in the 80s will probably scoff at Legends’ thinly sketched antagonists, Aramis Knight’s Conor not least. Critical fight sequences in the film unfold like scenes from Mortal Kombat-style fighter games, with only the energy meter missing from the framing. The film also could have done without one notably cringe product placement nod, for which Oleff does the honors. But other than those faint missteps, Legends sweeps the leg. It’s warm, it’s breezy – it’s a burst of summery family fun that is sure to inspire long looks back at the old movies and Cobra Kai episodes while sparking renewed interest in martial arts apprenticeship. Anyone would get a kick out of it.Karate Kid: Legends is out in US and UK cinemas on 30 May and Australian cinemas on 4 JuneExplore more on these topicsThe Karate KidAction and adventure filmsJackie ChanreviewsShareReuse this content"

My long-term partner and I broke up recently, and I’ve been going on dates. My problem is I hate my skin. I have large pores, acne scarring, chicken pox scarring. Every time I meet someone new, I feel scared that they will find me hideous and think I catfished them. I’ve also been zooming in on pictures of my skin and looking at it in different lighting, which is worsening my insecurity.Rationally, I know men probably won’t mind, because my previous partner – who had perfect skin! – still found me beautiful. And nobody I’ve gone on a date with has seemed to care so far. But I still criticize myself for it over and over again. How do I get over this?– Not A CatfishBack when I was on the apps, I’d upload slightlyunflattering photos of myself: an up-close, no-makeup selfie; a wide shot in a muumuu the size of a small circus tent. I wanted to meet men who weren’t primarily interested in looks. Bonus: in person, I exceeded all expectations!I’ve found love two, maybe even three times this way – the last one stuck – despite the fact that my skin, like yours, is marked by acne scars, visible pores and a smattering of old chicken pox pits (plus the burgeoning wrinkles of a woman 10 years your senior).I call this the Inverse Catfish Method.If it seems like I have a neurotic need to diminish myself first before a man does it, well … guilty as charged. After reading your question, Not A Catfish, I’d say we have this in common.How did we end up this way? Aside from, you know, living under patriarchy, internalizing the male gaze and unconsciously inhaling the lessons of beauty culture like so much secondhand smoke.For me, it was my ex-husband. A few months after we got married, he started making comments about my skin: suggesting I wear more makeup, telling me to “go on medication already” when I broke out. This charming new habit coincided with his decision to join Donald Trump’s mailing list and purchase a pack of “Make America Great Again” plastic straws as a “joke” to rile me up. Coincidence?I wonder if something similar is contributing to your insecurity. You’re wading into the dating pool when the most powerful men in the world – andKid Rock– are arguing that women exist to serve men; that our faces should beoptimized for beauty, our bodiesoptimized for breeding. And it’s working! Data shows gen Z men are embracingregressive gender rolesandleaning right. Theresulting dating sceneis reportedly in a sorry state.Thereisa possibility that some men are looking for a barely sentient Stepford wife with skin like glass, like a screen, like an inanimate object under their thumbs. But there are also many men who want a real, live, regular partner. On subway seats, in coffee shops, across candlelit tables, I see people with scars and spots and dark under-eye circles being held and kissed and loved like it’s the most natural thing in the world. Because it is! You don’t have to fix a single thing about your face to find that.It strikes me that becoming obsessed with your skin started with a change in your romantic life.InLove: A New Understanding of an Ancient Emotion, philosopher Simon May writes that the loved one can give us something essential we can’t generate alone, like the feeling of being truly understood or “safety from a paralyzing source of insecurity”. Love “empowers us by intensifying our sense of existence and also humbles us by bringing to light our ontological smallness”, he says. It expands our world and puts the little things, like acne scars, in proportion.But when love is lost, itshrinksthe world – to the size of a pore, perhaps. It may “tear us from the familiar moorings of an ‘attachment’ or undermine our self-esteem”, according to May, leaving us “less able to be present” and scrambling to prove we still exist. We reach for something, anything, to anchor us.Cue: hyperfixation on your face. Which makes sense!Skinis solid. It senses the outside world and confirms you’re in it andofit. It’s also the focus of countless beauty industry ads that claim attaining clear, poreless perfection will finally make you therealyou, the “best version of you”. Sometimes, they even frame skincare as a replacement for love. See Cutocin, a brand that markets its Social Exchange Serum as an alternative to the oxytocin-releasing effects of, well, social exchange.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now he wants me and my mother to get work doneHow should I be styling my pubic hair?How do I deal with imperfection?I want to ignore beauty culture. But I’ll never get anywhere if I don’t look a certain wayI could tell you that making peace with every last epidermal divot is an inside job – to love yourself first, that no product or partner can help you. But I don’t think we’re meant to love, heal, or even become ourselves alone. Humans are communal creatures. We need each other.I’m not saying you’re doomed to spiral about your selfies until a boyfriend appears. The perspective-shifting power of love that May describes applies to non-romantic relationships, too.Family, friends and communities can bring us a similar sense “of an ethical home, of power over our sense of existing and of a call to our destiny”, he says. “A work of art, a vocation, a god, a new country, even a landscape” can inspire sublimity, too – that feeling of being both empowered and humbled. So stare at a sunset instead of the mirror. Put down the phone and pick up a guitar. Go to a museum! Volunteer! Take a mini road trip with your mom! Find God in the mosh pit of a punk show!Make your world bigger, and soon enough, your scars will seem appropriately small.One last tip: Data fromPew Research Centershows only one in five partnered adults under 30 first connected with their current partner online.

First, keep your shoes on.For the whole flight?At a minimum, wear socks. Absolutely no bare feet.And the second?The person in the aisle seat has the aisle, and the window seat passenger has the window. Therefore the person in the middle seat gets command of both armrests.What about reclining your seat? Yes or no?A matter of much dispute – some people believe that if your seat is reclinable, then it’s your right to recline it.There’s a certainlogic to that.Others think it’s always rude. But the dispute itself can get you into trouble.

If we don’t act now, it might be lost for everJohn McDonnell calls for grassroots leadership challenge to Starmer’s governmentWed 28 May 2025 10.24 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 13.55 EDTShareIjoined theLabourparty 50 years ago. Back then, as a young man, I was proud that I was becoming part of a movement motivated by the highest ideals. I felt I was joining a group of like-minded people who wanted to change the world for the better and that, whatever setbacks might occur, we were on the right side of history.I devoted my life to securing the election of Labour governments that would transform our society. I was a working-class kid, born in the slums of Liverpool to a father who was a docker and a mother who was a cleaner, and I gained all the benefits of Labour’s policies: the security of aParker Morris-standardcouncil house and the care of the NHS when I was sick. As a trade union branch secretary, my dad and his fellow members exercised their rights and their solidarity to secure the wage levels that lifted the families of workers out of poverty.No matter how tough it was through the worst of the Thatcher period and especially during the harsh years of Tory austerity, the light of hope still burned in me that eventually Labour would return to power, and we would be able to get back on the righteous path of social advance for everybody.Keir Starmer was elected leader of the party on the policy platform that Jeremy Corbyn and I developed, and then he promptly dropped virtually everypolicy promise he made. My concern was that dropping a radical programme and narrative in favour of a mealy mouthed politics meant that the Starmer administration would deliver a timid move forward at best. But even then, I held to the belief that the desperate nature of the Tory inheritance would force him to change course.I wrote articles and made speeches arguing that there was still hope because by the middle of Labour’s term, it was highly likely these mediocre policies would have proved ineffective, with the risk of the administration under Starmer becoming deeply unpopular. At that stage, I thought, the argument for an alternative strategy would be overwhelming. That was when the broad church of the left and progressives in the movement would have a key role to play.What I didn’t appreciate was that once elected, the Starmer government wouldn’t just be an administration of timid reform, but would rapidly instigate a series of policies that drove a knife into the heart of what I believed Labour stood for when I joined the party.Labour was founded to eliminate poverty and secure equality. After the first king’s speech, the government didn’t just fail to address the major cause of child poverty in Britain at the moment – the Conservatives’ two-child benefit cap – but demanded that Labour MPs vote against its abolition. This was the first time the political incompetence and callousness of the new administration’s decision-makers were put on display. To then remove the whip from me and six colleagues for voting to scrap the capshowed a remarkable combination of arrogance and lack of judgment.At the same time, the public got view of the distasteful sight of Labour ministers accepting gifts, tickets and donations from the rich and corporate carpetbaggers. For that scandal to be followed by the government cutting the benefits of the poorest in our society was nauseating for many Labour supporters.Following this up with the debacle of the changes to the winter fuel allowance and the brutalattack on disabled people’s benefitshas disillusioned Labour voters on a scale not seen before in the recent history of the party. It has opened the door to the divisive and destructive opportunism of Nigel Farage, who has now said he wouldscrap the two-child cap.Justifying this negation of the historic role of Labour byadhering to an anachronistic fiscal ruledoesn’t just make the government appear tin-eared. It makes it look inflexibly incompetent.What we are now witnessing is a panicked, half-hearted policy retreat, while the backroom boys – Morgan McSweeney in the leader’s office and Nick Parrottin the deputy leader’s office– fight between themselves.All this against a backdrop ofdefending the exportof F-35 fighter jet parts that enable the Israel Defense Forces to continue bombing Gaza and a Labour prime ministerechoing the language of Enoch Powell.Unless party members, affiliated unions and MPs stand up and assert themselves to take back control of Labour, in the next period of its history we may not only lose a government. We could also lose a party.John McDonnell is the independent MP for Hayes and Harlington.

The result was weirdly coyJennifer Jasmine WhiteSexologists? Tick. ‘Up against the wall’ practice sessions? Tick. But Virgin Island obscured the real truth about intimacyWed 28 May 2025 11.51 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 13.55 EDTShareChannel 4’s latest attempt to straddle the line between televised humiliation and light titillation came to an end this week. Virgin Island documented a two-week bootcamp for 12 “courageous virgins”, whisked off to Mamma Mia!-style surrounds and delivered into the hands of self-proclaimed experts with job titles such as “emotional intimacy coach”, “surrogate partner therapist” and “sexological bodyworker”. These professionals were meant to help them overcome physical and emotional hang-ups around sex, andoffered a kind of hands-on, public therapy that for most of us previously existed only in nightmares.Having watched the entire series across an especially sedentary weekend, I’m in no position to doubt that this sometimes made for maddeningly good TV. From tutorials in oral sex to animal role-play, the whole affair resembled a sun-kissed gameshow with a few premature ejaculations scattered in for good measure. At the end of the series, only one contestant had lost their virginal status, and it briefly seemed possible that the grinning individual in question might be presented with a Bullseye-style prize for doing so – a Nissan Micra for your victory in the boudoir, perhaps?Miles from the mainland, with nothing but deep-rooted psychological trauma or diagnosable medical disorders to get in the way, Virgin Island positioned itself as a locus of pure fantasy. Unfortunately, this was also its downfall. Turning sex into a series of uncomfy routines to be memorised and performed (classes included practising ‘“smooth transitions” from one position to another, or learning exactly when during a dinner date to kiss your partner’s hand in the manner of a serial killer), the show seemed unable to admit that sex is not only a physical challenge but a social phenomenon, one bound up with unpredictability, rejection and power.View image in fullscreen‘Sexological bodyworker’ Thomas with Emma, another contestant on the show.Photograph: Channel 4Still, the oddly evacuated social politics of sex kept cropping up. Cast member Charlotte spoke about trying to work through issues with shame, but had few qualms about humiliating others, openly repulsed by the “horrible stretch marks” of civil servant Ben. When anxious Emma, 23, was paired with confident, middle-aged “sexological bodyworker” Thomas, she was visibly uncomfortable. The optics of their pairing – and how unlikely it was to help Emma – seemed not to matter.Then there was Zac, the villain of the piece. In one scene, he dished out a range of objectifying compliments to the women of the show. These women had little interest in finding out whether they would be winners (“banging body”) or losers (“good sense of humour”) in Zac’s personal hotness Olympics, but on he went regardless. Zac seemed to have almost no issues around sex, other than his lack of it. He described his intense impatience as his coach delayed penetrative sex, seemingly keen to race through the steadily paced structure of the programme in which individuals graduated through various sex acts only if and when the experts deemed them ready. His best explanation was, fascinatingly, that perhaps she was intimidated by him. Having said as much, Zac was kindly asked to put on his clothes, but beyond this, Virgin Island seemed totally uninterested in engaging with the behaviours and dynamics actually exhibited by the group.Desire is complex, unpredictable and often indecipherable even by those experiencing it. Nothing about this could have been neatly resolved in six hours, but a gesture to the relationship between what happens in the bedroom and what happens beyond it might have helped. True to the neoliberal navel-gazing that so defines our times, Virgin Island invited its contestants to look only inwards, but more interesting lessons might have been learned if they had observed their relationships with one another, too.They might have noticed a grimly gendered divide, in which many of the women were indeed intimidated by men, a situation unlikely to be helped by the “up against the wall” practice session where nervous participants were made to forcefully push partners up against a pillar, with as much allegedly sexy conviction as they could muster. What are the connotations of a move like that? Why might some people, sometimes, like it, and some people, sometimes, not? TV producers, fearful of dull detail, might be sceptical, but for my money, those conversations would have produced the most revealing content yet.From childhood trauma to fantasies of worship, it was clear that for absolutely everyone on the island, sex was inseparable from power. Why, then, couldn’t the programme admit it? Maybe because to open up a conversation about power would risk admitting the odd imbalance at play as paid professionals take an ambiguous pleasure in laying hands on often vulnerable bodies, all while denying a transaction is taking place. The show had little choice but to remove power from the conversation lest it, ironically, expose itself. Perhaps most unexpectedly of all though, in doing so, Virgin Island often boxed itself into a dull little corner of denial. Pretending that sex is a matter for the bedroom alone?

Maybe it is this that makes us an island of strangersWed 28 May 2025 10.53 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 12.16 EDTShareIlearned a lot driving to Hinckley in Leicestershire. I had some work there. That’s showbiz, folks. I didn’t do the journey as I’d normally do it – eyeballs out, gripping the steering wheel, fixating on the satnav ETA, on some motorway or other. If I’d done it that way, it would have taken less than two hours. For a change, I decided to take my time. And this change was as good as a rest. You’re unlikely to find London to Hinckley in any coffee table book about the World’s Best Road Trips, but this little odyssey lifted my spirits no end.It helped that I was on my motorbike. Wherever I’m going, I find motorcycling the shortest route to serenity. I think it’s partly an ADHD thing, with the relief that total absorption affords me. On a motorbike you have to be absorbed – hyper-focused, in fact – because your life is on the line. And while there’s road noise in your ears, there’s none of the other brain-wrecking cacophony of modern life. No phone, no internet, no news, no radio, no nothing. In its own way, it’s as peaceful as lying in a meadow by a babbling brook miles from anywhere.There’s another magical aspect to it, which I can only really explain by quoting a guy I once interviewed called Ara Gureghian, who, with his rescue dog Spirit alongside him in a sidecar, had covered around 300,000 miles riding around the US for nearly 10 years. I asked Ara, what with the dog and all, if it mightn’t have been easier to do it in a car. “The difference between riding a motorbike and driving a car,” he said, “is like the difference between sailing and using a speedboat.” That’s not a perfect analogy, but I’ve never come up with anything better.So there I was, sailing along the A41 bearing north-west towards Aylesbury, passing Berkhamsted, Cow Roast, Aston Clinton. Wasn’t Berkhamsted something to do with Graham Greene? What on earth went on in Cow Roast? Surely Aston Clinton is a bloke, not a place? These questions asked themselves, but there was no Googling for me, and on I went. Aylesbury materialised, but the Through Traffic signage was so insistent I took the hint and swerved the middle of town.Where now then? I spied a sign to Buckingham. That would do nicely. Weedon, Hardwick and Oving showed themselves. I was thoroughly enjoying the A413. The mere place names provided some enchantment. It felt a mite shaming, even rather rude, not to have seen or heard of any of these places before. I took a break in Winslow, somewhere else I had never heard of, which looked to me like a pitch-perfect little English town. How many more of these places were there around the country that I’d never heard of and would probably never see? It panicked me a bit.I parked in the town square and asked the lad in the shop if there was a cafe anywhere. “Oh yes,” he said. “There’s a great cafe a couple of minutes’ walk away.” He was right. It was called Legends. Here, an extravagantly tattooed and exuberantly friendly bloke made me a cup of tea and a sandwich. I’d have been perfectly happy, if I’d been able to stop thinking about how many places like this I’d been missing out on.I looked at the map, and saw my route was working the space between the M40 and the M1. I dread to think how many hours I’ve spent on those roads in my time, so close to all this, yet missing it completely. That’s the trouble with motorways – since the first one, the Preston Bypass in 1958, they’ve been doing what they were invented to do. They’ve been allowing us to bypass everything. Which is great, and necessary, and how it must be. But the more bypassing we do, the more our world passes us by. I don’t think trains are much better in this regard: they too take you past everything. Last weekend a friend was initially dismayed to find she had to take a rail replacement bus from Rugby to Rugeley Trent Valley, but was soon loving seeing the middle of towns and cities she’d hitherto only barely glimpsed out of train windowsWe all have an idea of what our country and our compatriots are like, but what are we basing this on when even those of us who travel a lot are seeing so little of it? Here’s a sense in which I think we might well be an island of strangers.On to Buckingham and then Towcester. En route, Maids Moreton, Akeley, Lillingstone Lovell, Whittlebury: to you, I say sorry to have left it this long to make your – albeit fleeting – acquaintance. I decided I’d call this thing I was doing mindful motoring. And I busied my mind formulating some guidance as to how it should be done. Bike is best, but car is fine too. Just give yourself time. It won’t work at all if you’re on a clock. Optimally, don’t have the car radio on, and, most importantly, don’t use satnav. This makes a world of difference. If I have my satnav on, my attention’s drawn to the data on it rather than what’s all around me.It helps to plan ahead a little, pick a road number or two and just stick to them. The more route anxiety you spare yourself, the more headspace you free up. Here, for example, I knew I could get on the A5 at Towcester, which, deliciously, took me all the way to Hinckley. Towcester, by the way, looks a smashing town. And what a magnificent entrance it is to the racecourse. I’ll be back. But not before I’ve chalked off some other mindful, alternative routes. I’m thinking Birmingham to Manchester on the A515 via Ashbourne and Buxton. And all the way from Oxford to Aberystwyth on the A44 via too many new places to mention.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMindfulnessOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

You can’t get a proper sense of proportion when: you most likely don’t know the answer the examiners are looking for, or anything about the subject; your kid can’t remember what they wrote anyway; and someone on TikTok has the mark scheme. But do they really? Or is it more TikTok nonsense? You’ll either get sucked into the catastrophe-vortex, or you fall into the trap of minimising, looking over your metaphorical half-moon glasses and going, “I’m sure it’ll be fine, darling,” like an Edwardian dad.All parents and teachers know this, which is what made last week so very unusual. The English paper set by one of the main examining boards has a character question that encourages pupils to engage deeply with someone in the key text. It might not be the main character, but usually it will be one you’ve heard of.Who is better, Dickens or Shakespeare? We asked nine prominent writersRead moreIn Great Expectations, however, they chose Herbert. Maybe you’re familiar with the story – there’s a hero, there’s a love interest, there’s an eccentric benefactor, and there’s a villain who only appears twice but is very colourful. None of these people are Herbert. There’s a kindly father figure, a mother figure, a random bad guy, a merchant and a gold-digger, and, again, none of these are Herbert.Herbert is a nobody. He’s the guy in the wedding photo whose name people can’t remember by the 10th anniversary. He is – in the modern parlance – not A Thing. Shoehorning everything, or even anything you know about Great Expectations, through the character of Herbert is like trying to explain photosynthesis using a fingernail and some gravel. It’s been the talk of the town. I walked into a Starbucks and overheard two people of about my age going: “Who the hell is Herbert?” This is probably the most talked-about Herbert has ever been.So, a great day for him, but a disaster for everyone else.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGCSEsOpinionExamsSchoolsCharles DickenscommentShareReuse this content"

I wish I could point you to a government transcript, but the White House recentlystarted removing official transcriptsof the president’s public remarks, replacing them withcurated videosinstead. I imagine (just a hypothesis!) that this is to make Trump seem more coherent.One of the “highlights” of the disjointed ramble Trump delivered at West Point was his thoughts on trophy wives: “I must tell ya. A lot of trophy wives, doesn’t work out [sic],” he mused in the middle of an anecdote about a divorced real estate developer (not him). This has raised a few eyebrows; particularly as Michael Wolff’s 2018 book about Trump claimed the president used to boast that Melania was his “trophy wife.”I don’t know if Trump ever really thought that Melania was some sort of compliant accessory to be paraded around. If he did, I’m sure he’s now seen the error of his ways. Melania has made it clear to everyone that she is unbothered, unbossed, and entirely uninterested in pretending to care about either her husband or her role as first lady. It’s claimed that as of early May, Melania had spentfewer than 14 daysat the White House. Trump is her useful idiot husband, she’s not his trophy wife.Melania is certainly collecting her own trophies, however. I’ve got to hand it to the woman: she’s mastered the art of making enormous amounts of money with the minimum amount of effort. Last year, she released what columnist Pamela Paul described as a “book-adjacent object” titled Melania, which one imagines she did not write herself. Last week, she announced that theaudiobook was narratedwith an AI-generated version of her voice. Now we’ve officially got an AI Melania voice, can it be long before we get a full-on MelanAI?

First, the court fears it will look pathetically weak if it becomes the first supreme court in history to have a president defy its rulings in a wholesale way. With that in mind, the court seems to be taking pains to avoid provokingDonald Trump’s defiance – it has issued several decisions upholding the president’s actions while in other cases, it has given him lots of wiggle room even as it objected to his administration’s moves.Then there’s the court’s second, big worry – that it will look pathetically weak if it doesn’t stand up to the most authoritarian president in US history.Many legal expertscriticize the court for not standing up more to Trump, even though he has brazenly attacked the court and many lower-court judges, hasdefied severaljudicial ordersand has, according to numerous judges, repeatedly violated the law – whether by deporting immigrants without due process or by freezing funds approved by Congress.The court’s six conservative justices have let themselves seem like Trump’s chumps because they’ve often bowed to him instead of standing up and ruling against him. The foremost example is last year’s supreme court ruling giving Trump astonishingly broad immunity from criminal prosecution.Trump’s revenge spree on Harvard echoes well beyond education | Jan-Werner MüllerRead moreThe image-conscious chief justice,John Roberts, and his court have to decide which of two paths to take. One path – which the court’s conservative supermajority seems to be following – is to issue pro-Trump rulings to avoid inciting his ire and defiance. That approach might spare the court the Maga movement’s anger, but historians will look dimly on the court for bending in Trump’s favor – they’ll accuse it of complicity and sacrificing principle for not blocking Trump moves that,many legal experts,conservative,centristandprogressive, say, violate federal law and the constitution.The court can choose a more courageous path: stick to principle and not shrink from ruling against Trump. That might spur the bull-headed president to defy the court, but under that scenario, historians would praise the justices for upholding the law and the court’s constitutional role and for not letting themselves become stooges for a power-hungry president.The Roberts court has given us some hope, but not much. In a surpriseruling at 1am one April night, it seemed to develop a few inches of backbone by ordering the Trump administrationnot to deportseveral dozen Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador without first giving them due process.That was a promising ruling, but on the other side of the ledger, the court has often bowed to Trump, for instance, by overturning a lower court ruling and letting Trumpfire 16,000 probationary federal employeesand by letting his administrationsuspend $65min teacher-training grants. Moreover, the rightwing supermajority did Trump a big favor by letting himprovisionally remove the headsof two independent agencies, the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protections Board. That hurried ruling, made without full briefing or arguments, indicated that the court’s conservatives are eager to overturn a unanimous, 90-year-old supreme court decision that limits presidents’ ability to fire officials at independent agencies. In this way, the Roberts court is giving more power to our dangerously authoritarian president.Let’s not forget how weak the court has looked for failing to act firmly to assure the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, an immigrant from El Salvador who even Trump administration officials acknowledged was deported illegally. On 10 April, the court issued a wimpy decision that called on the Trump administration to“facilitate” Ábrego Garcia’s return– it stopped short of using the district court’s more muscular language to“effectuate” his return. More than six weeks have passed since the high court called on Trump to bring back Ábrego García, but Trump hasn’t done so. His administration has sidestepped outright defiance by pretending that it is seeking to facilitate Ábrego García’s return.Not only that, Trump has smeared the justices bysaying: “THE SUPREME COURT WON’T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!” Trump has also savaged several federal district court judges, calling one a “radical left lunatic” anddenouncing othersas “MONSTERS WHO WANT OUR COUNTRY TO GO TO HELL”.With their hard-right ideology, the court’s supermajority evidently sympathizes with many of Trump’s moves and has blessed such moves far more often than many legal scholars would like. In doing so, the court has emboldened Trump to take even more actions that push – and often overstep – the boundaries of what is legal. In a worrisome development, the court has, at least thus far, shown surprisingly little concern about Trump’s defiance of district court judges’ orders and his authoritarian effort to assert his dominance over the two, other theoretically co-equal branches of government: the judiciary and Congress.For its own good and for the nation’s good, the supreme court needs to step up and do its utmost to stop Trump’s lawlessness and his unprecedented efforts to defy district court rulings and lash out against the judiciary. Trump hascalled forimpeaching judges who ruled against him, and as his tirades against judges have increased, the number of judges who havereceived threatshas soared.The court needs to issue some strong, clarion decisions that make clear to the nation that Trump has shown repeated contempt for the constitution, the rule of law and the judiciary. The justices should move quickly to issue an outrage-filled ruling that finds that Trump violated law firms’ free speech rights by punishing several firms for taking cases he didn’t like or employing lawyers he didn’t like. The justices should also move swiftly to issue a strong ruling in favor of Harvard University and against Trump’s vindictive assault – an assault that violated Harvard’s first amendment rights by seeking to suppress speech and ideas that Trump doesn’t like and by trying to dictate much of Harvard’s hiring, curriculum and admissions policies.A hidden measure in the Republican budget bill would crown Trump king | Robert ReichRead moreThe court should also issue a forceful ruling that demolishes Trump’s arguments that he caninvoke the 1798 Alien Enemies Actto deport alleged Venezuelan gang members en masse without due process. The court should trumpet the absurdity of Trump’s claim that Venezuelan immigrants constitute an invasion force the way, for instance, British troops constituted an invasion force during the war of 1812.The court should also shoot down Trump’s efforts to gut federal agencies and freeze funding by making it emphatically clear that those efforts violate Congress’s article I spending power. The conservative supermajority should also rethink its intention to overturn the 1935 ruling that limits presidents’ ability to fire members of independent agencies. That ruling sought to ensure that those agencies didn’t become partisan puppets that do whatever a president wants – something that no one should want when the nation has such a vengeful and capricious president.With the Roberts court slated to issue a flood of rulings by early July, the justices have an important choice: to bend to Trump or to grow a real backbone. Does the Roberts court want to be remembered as cowardly enablers who helped the most authoritarian and lawless president in history consolidate power? Or do the justices want to be remembered as determined defenders who stood up to an authoritarian bully to protect our laws, our constitution and our democracy?Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsLaw (US)John RobertscommentShareReuse this content"

You might suffer from DownbaditisLucinda PriceI heard from a woman who wore off-the-shoulder tops for an entire year because her crush said he ‘liked shoulders’Wed 28 May 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 21.36 EDTShareIt was mid-winter when I found myself shivering on a slippery rock, staring out to sea. The waves in front of me were growling and my gut responded in kind. Instead of listening to it, I wrestled into a wetsuit and pulled the goggles I’d had since year 5 over my head. I signalled my friend to start recording. Then, I walked in.By walked, I mean slipped. Violently. The ocean licked me off the rocks and sucked me under with glee. After a few seconds of panicked tumbling, I surfaced with a mouthful of salt water. My friend laughed. I laughed, then coughed, then laughed again.I was overjoyed because she had just recorded a moment I was sure would capture my crush’s attention. It was a mission I was willing to complete at any cost. Even if that cost was my dignity. Or even, my life.Do you trust Mark Zuckerberg to solve your loneliness with an ‘AI friend’? No, me neither | Emma BrockesRead moreI didn’t know it at the time, but I was suffering from an illness known as Downbaditis. Put simply, it is a state of spiritual psychosis triggered by a crush and/or intense courting period. Victims of Downbaditis display an insatiable need for validation from their chosen suitor. Ironically, a suitor’s ineligibility may worsen symptoms. These include, but are not limited to: overhyping hobbies, appearing effortlessly hot on Instagram Stories and pretending you have ever gone for an “ocean swim”.Being “down bad” is not a new experience. Usher wrote about it in 2001 with U Got It Bad. The entire plot of The Great Gatsby revolves around Jay throwing lavish parties for Daisy’s affection. Charli xcx extrapolated on this well-worn tradition in her sleeper hit Party 4 U. She even secured a cake, champagne and a party bag with purple pills, no less. Perhaps she’d watched The Matrix with her betrothed but she never got around to asking red or blue? It’s hard to know but one thing’s for sure: she was suffering from a critical case of Downbaditis.The modern strain of Downbaditis can be traced back to the invention of Snapchat Stories. It was the first time regular people could post their most banal daily goings-on without the judgment of a full Facebook post. You had permission to post every little thing, because it disappeared after 24 hours and could only be replied to via direct message. It felt so chill, so flippant, so unscripted, so real. You could pretend to love Drake without your friends pointing out you only knew Hotline Bling because it played on loop at the Foot Locker you worked at in 2016.Last week, I invited my Instagram community to share stories of times they had fallen prey to Downbaditis. The responses came in thick and fast. Some were vintage – like the woman who went to high school Christian group meetings despite being “1,000% an atheist”. Another played the clarinet for the entirety of her secondary education because there was a hot guy in the band. A third school-age memory was from someone who memorised every single AFL player’s name in primary school so they could talk to the boy they liked. The illness is lifelong, you see.They grew all the more deranged as time wore on. Like the woman who wore off-the-shoulder tops for an entire year because her crush said he “liked shoulders”. One respondent started learning Afrikaans after a first date. Another lied and said that they saw whales because their crush liked them. “It wasn’t whale season,” she said ominously. “And he knew”.A 14-step guide to taking a (fleeting) break from social media | Eleanor LimprechtRead moreI also asked my audience to share times they had clocked that they were on the receiving end of someone’s Downbaditis. One woman told me that her friend was seeing a guy who seemed sweet. “On one of their first dates, he offered to order them some dinner. She said she’d like some chicken nuggets. They locked in and all was well until his flatmates came home. They couldn’t believe their eyes because he’d been vegan for six years.”What I learnt while receiving responses was that Downbaditis strikes everyone. Every gender, every age. It is non-denominational and that is what makes it so dangerous. It is often only diagnosable after the fact. For me, I barely clock my Downbaditis until it’s too late and I’ve bought a surfboard.Subscribers to attachment theory could argue that Downbaditis is a sign of anxious attachment. It could be. It could also be a feature of the human condition. At its core, Downbaditis is just yearning. A creative strain, for sure. To yearn is a treat – it means you are alive and open. Married people blow up their whole lives to feel it again. So I say yearn while you can. Take up Spanish to impress someone, like one guy I spoke to. “I learnt it on Duolingo to impress a Chilean girl,” he told me. “And now, whenever I see a loaf of bread, a voice of regret in my head sighs ‘el pan’.”It hurts, but it’s a lot more exciting than plain old bread.Lucinda Price is a writer, presenter and comedian who goes by the name FroomesExplore more on these topicsSocietyOpinionSocial mediaRelationshipscommentShareReuse this content"

That was the moment when Cold Palmer finally emerged, decided that enough was enough and took an icy hold on a final that was in danger of running away from Chelsea. That was the moment when disaster was averted, Betis’s hopes of winning the Uefa Conference League faded and it became clear that Todd Boehly, Behdad Eghbali and the rest of Chelsea’s leadership team would be on the pitch at full time, drinking it all in after claiming their first piece of silverware in the men’s game since their takeover in 2022.Chelsea’s billion-pound boys take charge and show clinical cutting edge | Nick AmesRead moreThe predictability of the outcome did not make the feeling any less sweet for Boehly and Eghbali after a season that began with their differences getting a very public airing. Really, though, this was all about one very special individual. There have been countless signings under thisChelseaownership but none as smart as the £40m spent on buying Palmer from Manchester City.He is a unique talent, a maverick whose personality and skill defined this contest. So what if Chelsea still resemble Cole Palmer FC in times of trouble? They would have been lost without him accepting the responsibility of scrubbing out Betis’s 1-0 lead by sparking a turnaround with gorgeous assists for Enzo Fernández and Nicolas Jackson.There could be no better demonstration of why Palmer deserves to hear the Champions League anthem before his next European assignment. It was an astonishing five minutes from the 23-year-old. Betis chased their first European trophy but the financial gulf told in the end. There was no romance in Manuel Pellegrini, the 71-year-old Chilean, and his band of Premier League cast-offs running out of steam succumbing to a 4-1 defeat after further strikes from Moisés Caicedo and Jadon Sancho, who will hope he has done enough for his loan from Manchester United to be made permanent.View image in fullscreenNicolas Jackson puts Chelsea into the lead after Cole Palmer’s second sublime assist in five minutes.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesThe weird thing is that Chelsea were booed off at half-time. They were appalling during the first half, falling behind to a sloppy goal and offering nothing in attack. Enzo Maresca, who delighted insticking it to his criticsafter clinching Champions League qualification last weekend, got his initial tactics badly wrong. Malo Gusto, a right-back by trade, had a nightmare as an auxiliary midfielder. Betis led through Abde Ezzalzouli and could have had more. It was just as well that Chelsea emerged with more intensity in the second half.It had been a relief to focus on the football after two daysmarred by idiotic violence involving supportersof both sides in the city centre. The longing came from Betis, who were thrilled to be in their first European final. Chelsea, by contrast, did not fill their allocation.Maresca tells Chelsea players European trophy can build ‘winner mentality’Read moreThey struggled during the first 30 minutes. The mind went back to Gary Neville branding Chelsea “billion-pound bottle jobs” after they lost to Liverpool’s kids in last season’s Carabao Cup final. The touches were loose and the early tactical battle was won by Pellegrini targeting the space left by Gusto drifting inside from right-back. The Frenchman was one of five changes from Maresca and was culpable when Betis scored in the ninth minute, a slack pass into midfield intercepted, leaving Isco to send Ezzalzouli through to fire a low shot past Filip Jörgensen.Chelsea were shambolic. Ezzalzouli was tormenting Gusto. Isco, a European champion on five occasions with Real Madrid, was running the show. Jörgensen saved from Marc Bartra and Benoît Badiashile made a vital block to deny Johnny Cardoso.Maresca, who calls Pellegrini his footballing father, used the break to correct his error of leaving out Reece James. The captain came on for Gusto and gave Chelsea more poise on the right. The mood shifted, Betis tiring. Antony was the Antony of Manchester United on the Betis right. Ezzalzouli limping off was a blow for Pellegrini.View image in fullscreenMoisés Caicedo, Chelsea’s player of the season, fires in the fourth goal to cap a fantastic night for the club.Photograph: Darko Vojinović/APChelsea took control in midfield, Fernández and Caicedo dominating. But still we waited for Palmer. He has struggled since Christmas. The goals and assists have dried up. He picked a good moment to stir. His influence grew and Chelsea were level when he lifted in a feathery cross for Fernández, who ghosted in to head past Adrián.Now Palmer was irrepressible. Soon he twisted past the Betis substitute, Jesús Rodríguez, and slammed in another cross from the right for Jackson to chest home.

Swiatek is attempting to win her fourth successive French Open singles title, a feat that has never been achieved by a female player in the open era.Swiatek dismantles Raducanu to maintain quest for fourth French Open title in a rowRead more“Iga played really well today,” Raducanu said. “I think every time we have played she plays really well. It puts a lot of pressure on me from the beginning, makes me feel like I have to maybe do something extra or I just don’t know what to do in the moment. It does shift the dynamics of the match a bit, and then it’s very difficult to stay with her as she grows in confidence. It just shows, I guess, the distance that I have to improve.”Although she has performed well against lower-ranked players recently, Raducanu has one win and 10 defeats in her matches against players in the top eight in her career, winning only one set in those 10 defeats. She has lost all five of her matches against Swiatek, who has won every time in straight sets. Along with her far superior level and achievements, Swiatek notes that Raducanu just feels like a good matchup to her.“There are players that just have the ball; that for some of us it’s a little bit easier, others don’t like it,” Swiatek said. “There are some players that you just kind of know what you’re going to do a little bit. I just think it’s a [good] matchup.”Despite how comprehensively she was beaten on the biggest stage, Raducanu enjoyed a positive clay-court season and she has made genuine progress. She has improved on the surface and gained a greater understanding of how to optimise her game, which should only help as she shifts to the grass-court season. It is clear, however, that her game is still too underpowered against the top players, which is only accentuated on slower surfaces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

South Africa and Zimbabwe are hosts of the 14-team World Cup in 2027, after which the next eight spots are booked via the International Cricket ­Council ladder in March that year.

The role came up after a winter of dis­content that led toJos Buttler falling on his sword: in six ODIs this year they have ­mustered six defeats, with those against Australia, Afghanistan and South Africa in Pakistan leading to them ending the Champions Trophy at the bottom of the heap.“We are going to bring a lot of energy, competitiveness and fun,” Brook said, setting out the vision he and the head coach, Brendon McCullum, have for this new phase. “We want to try to put opposition bowlers under pressure from their best balls. I feel when I’m batting my best, I do that quite often.”Brook cited Ben Stokes as his leader­ship muse and in time he could well be his successor as Test captain. The Yorkshireman also put the ­struggles that followed Buttler’sT20 World Cup win in 2022down to never having his full-strength side for bilateral series, something he and McCullum are seeking to change.Buttler was actually absent from the optional training on Wednesday, less to give Brook some space and more because he has only just returned from the Indian Premier League.

Brydon Carse returns to give the attack some snarl after a toe injury, while the statement move, if it can be called that, is to promote Jamie Smith to open alongside Ben Duckett – a plan McCullum first floated in Pakistan whenSmith was parachuted into No 3and made scores of 15, nine and nought.“[McCullum] just had this ­burning desire that Smudge could be an ­amazing opening batter in one-day cricket,” said Brook, confirming that Buttler would be taking the wicket­keeping gloves. Smith has been promised a long run to make the position his own, with McCullum ­believing he has the game to ransack the powerplay.Quick GuideEngland v West Indies: first ODI lineupsShowEngland (confirmed):Jamie Smith, Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Harry Brook (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Jacob Bethell, Will Jacks, Jamie Overton, Brydon Carse, Adil Rashid, Saqib Mahmood.West Indies (possible):Brandon King, Evin Lewis, Keacy Carty, Shai Hope (wk & c), Amir Jangoo, Roston Chase, Justin Greaves, Matthew Forde, Alzarri Joseph, Gudakesh Motie, Jayden Seales.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Another being backed for a “quite a while” is Jacob Bethell, who has not played for England since a hamstring injury in February but is another returned from the IPL.

But chatter about what this left-hander might achieve has been ­following him since his days growing up in ­Barbados; chatter to which Shai Hope, the West Indies captain, was happy to contribute.“I first saw him at under-15s on the Police Ground in Weymouth,” said Hope, whose side are fresh from a 1-1 series draw in ­Ireland. “Seeing what he’s done over the last couple of months, internationally, franchise cricket as well, he’s certainly a formidable talent; one of those players who can go a very long way.“Every time I play against him, every time I see him, yes, he’s not neces­sarily full-on Bajan [these days], but it’s great to be around him, it gives me a sense of home. I’m happy for him, seeing the success he’s had … but we are enemies this time.”There was a twinkle in Hope’s eye. This is the friendliest of rivalries even if Bethell turning out for England – as part of the IPL contingent who have returned in time – underlines how the playing field is not exactly level.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamCricketHarry BrooknewsShareReuse this content"

There is no place for the 18-year-old Manchester United striker Gabriele Biancheri, who will join Canada’s senior squad on Sunday.Biancheri, whose mother is Canadian and father is Italian, has been capped by Wales at under-19 level and was part of Wales’s recent training camp in Spain, but Bellamy had no plans to bring him into his latest squad. Wales are relaxed about the teenager’s situation and are happy for him to gain further experience.Wales are without Joe Allen, who retired this month. The 35-year-old reversed his decision to retire from international duty last year, but has stepped away a second time. Wales were staring at a first defeat under Bellamy when Allen’s wayward pass allowed North Macedonia to take a stoppage-time lead in Skopje in Marchuntil David Brooks’s 96th-minute equaliser.“I knew he was going to retire,” Bellamy said. “When we conceded, it was like: ‘There’s no way this is going to be his last touch for us.’ Even if I would delay it after we play this one in June, you are not finishing that way.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That has been somewhat overshadowed by the announcement ofMary Earps’s international retirement, with the FA relieved that another potential distraction in bonus talks has been removed.Quick GuideMorris out of England squad after ACL injuryShowThe England defender Ella Morris has withdrawn from the squad after sustaining anterior cruciate ligament damage in training.The Tottenham right-back  had been hoping to make her senior England debut against Portugal in Friday's Nations League game at Wembley after being included in Sarina Wiegman's squad for the first time.The 22-year-old will undergo surgery, Tottenham have confirmed.Morris, who suffered a similar injury aged 17 while at first club Southampton, said on social media she had gone \"from the highest high to the lowest low\".She added: \"Devastated doesn't even come close. So grateful for the incredible people around me. ACL round 2 - let's go.\"Manchester City midfielder Laura Blindkilde Brown has been called up to the squad as Morris's replacement.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A dispute interrupted the Lionesses’ preparations for the World Cup two years ago with the FA initially reluctant to offer performance-related payments after Fifa introduced individual player fees for the first time. The FA agreed to pay bonuses, although the matter was only resolved the month after they returned from the tournament, whereEngland were beaten 1-0in the final by Spain. The governing body will also cash in if England have a successful tournament this summer as Uefa has more than doubled the prize money available to the 16 competing countries to £34m, with the winners receiving £4.3m.The FA equalised match fees for the men’s and women’s national teams five years ago with all senior England players receiving about £2,000 a game, which in most cases is donated to charities, but bonus payments remain far apart due to the differing levels of prize money on offer. Gareth Southgate’s squad would have shared a bonus pot of about £14m had they won theEuropean Championship final against Spainlast summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Harry Maguire led the side. Casemiro, Patrick Dorgu, André Onana, Ayden Heaven, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Højlund started while Alejandro Garnacho and Bruno Fernandes, both linked with summer moves, played from the bench as part of 11 half-time changes.It was Maung Maung Lwin, a Burmese winger for Thai League 1 club Lamphun Warriors, who netted a 71st-minute winner for the south-east Asian team. United could not shake off their season’s travails, including last week’sloss in the Europa League final, and played disjointedly. Several youth products were given their turn, which heartened Amorim amid his disappointment at the result.He said: “No injuries and a tough pitch. We don’t have it in us not to choke in every exercise, in every game – that is what happened. We should win these kind of games, no matter what. We need to bring that inside of us in every game.“The important thing is no injuries with this weather and to arrive here in this day. It is not an excuse, we should perform better. I liked the young kids, they try. That’s enough for me in the moment. They want to play more but we have to rotate everybody to play. They did well.”United play another friendly in Hong Kong on Friday to end a tour reportedly set to earn the club £8m. Before Wednesday’s opening game, the club’s chief executive, Omar Berrada, had put a positive spin on United’s end to the season and what lies ahead in the transfer window.“I can’t talk about specifics, but I can say that we’ve been planning for many months now,” Berrarda told MUTV. “We were ready for all the different scenarios, so now we know what we need to do.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sign up now!Barry GlendenningWed 28 May 2025 11.58 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 13.06 EDTShareFRAZZLED FERDINANDIn the preliminaries before kick-off between Aston Villa and Paris Saint-Germain at Parc des Princes last month, TNT Sports landed something of a coup. Having got celebrity Villa fan Prince William to agree toa pre-match interview, Rio Ferdinand and Ally McCoist were dispatched to ask His Royal Highness The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge for his thoughts on how the game might unfold. While both former footballers have reached an age where they no longer have forelocks worthy of the name left to tug, Rio was so impressed with William’s knowledge of gegenpressing, xG and heat maps that he issued a stark warning to the heir to the throne. “Do not go into a punditry job because I could be out of the game,” he joked, as those armchair viewers the length and breadth of the country who are forced to pay top dollar for TNT subscriptions if they want to watch European football dared to dream.While there is no evidence to suggest that Prince William subsequently sent an equerry to hand one’s curriculum vitae into the network’s personnel department in the hope of earning a place in the gantry alongside Darren Fletcher and Lucy Ward on co-comms, today it was revealed that Rio is out of the punditry game anyway. The former Manchester United defender has quit TNT after a decade’s service to focus on making YouTube videos in which he says “geezer” a lot, hawking branded snapbacks and chilling with his family. His final outing with Woodsy, Resh, Fletch, Sav, Luce, Coisty, Jules, Crouchy and Owen Hargreaves will be at the Bigger Cup final between PSG and Inter at the Allianz Arena. It is to be hoped he marks the occasion by engineering another one of those ludicrous scenarios where he makes sure the cameras are rolling before studiouslynotstepping on a club-branded carpetin a preposterously performative show of respect.“Since retiring from football, it has been a privilege talking about the game I love for a decade for sports fans watching BT Sport and TNT Sports,” he announced in a statement on his Social Media Disgraces. “I want to acknowledge the tremendous support from the team behind the scenes, whose hard work often goes unseen but has been essential to our success. As I turn the page to the next chapter, I carry with me countless memories. I am excited about what the future holds, spending more time with my family, focusing onRio FerdinandPresents and my other business interests.”Whether it was stating the bland and blindingly obvious at great and tedious length, repeatedly parroting “Ballon d’Or!” at the top of his voice in praise of a player who would go on to be overlooked for the award in question, or abandoning any small pretence at professionalism by reducing the commentary of a recent dramatic finale to the status of FanZone homage, Ferdinand has carved out a unique and lucrative niche in the punditry pantheon over the past decade. While TNT have yet to announce how they plan to fill the gaping void that will be left by the absence of his searing football insight and top-tier banter, subscribers can at least rest easy, safe in the knowledge that the inevitable montage of his “best bits” shown at the end of Saturday night’s Bigger Cup broadcast should be mercifully brief.QUOTE OF THE DAY[Mikel Arteta] had time to get a nine, he had time … Manchester United played five finals in the last five years.

Hundreds of thousands of the six million Syrians who fled abroad during 14 years of war have returned. Yet the mood has inevitably grown more sober, and last week Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, warned that the fractured country could be weeks away from “potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions”.Mr Rubio was defending Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to lift sanctions after meeting the country’s new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa – a former al-Qaida fighter who until months ago had a $10m US bounty on his head, but who is also, in Mr Trump’s considered view, a “young, attractive guy. Tough guy”. Whatever the trigger, the suspension of some sanctions by the US, and the lifting of some EU and UK measures, was essential to allow a country devastated by civil war to recover. It may also reduce opportunities somewhat for Russia and Iran to reassert their influence.Turkey is a longtime backer of Mr Sharaa, who came to power as leader of the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which led the military operation to oust Mr Assad. Other governments are less keen, but may be concerned that they cannot afford for him to fail, after watching Syria being torn apart – and dealing with the fallout. Israel ignored that lesson, launching hundreds of attacks on Syria, but has dialled them down since Mr Trump’s embrace of the new leader. It should also withdraw fromthe territory it has seized.Many Syrians too have concluded that while Mr Sharaa is not the leader they would have chosen, he is the one they have – backing him for fear of the alternative. The government has only limited control of the country. Violence remains rife. Minority communities are understandably terrified afteratrocities in March. The Syrian government had called for reinforcements as Assad loyalists ambushed security forces, but fighters who converged on Latakia province slaughtered hundreds of mainly Alawite civilians. Mr Sharaa blamed “individual actions”. Islamic State, thriving since Mr Assad’s fall, has seized upon Mr Sharaa’s rapprochement with the US as arecruitment tool, hoping to persuade foreign fighters and others that they will be sold out.Politically, too, there is deep unease. Thenew constitutionconcentrates power in the executive. Mr Sharaa says that Syrians will be able to choose their leaders – but not for at least four years. While his cabinet contains members of minority communities – Alawite (Mr Assad’s sect), Druze, Kurdish and Christian (the only woman in the team) – thekey positionsare held by HTS figures.Speaking in Aleppo on Tuesday, the president declared that “our war against tyranny has ended, and our battle against poverty has begun”. Though it will take time for relief from sanctions to be felt, and though the gradual loosening is sensible given concerns about the leadership, a new Syria cannot be realised without their relaxation. Infrastructure has been destroyed. Half the population remains displaced. Unemployment is high and food prices are rising. Syria is the world’sfourth most food-insecure country, with seven out of 10 people – more than 16 million – in need of humanitarian assistance.These material needs are matched by the demand for accountability and reassurance through transitional justice. Syrians will not feel safe until perpetrators are held to account for the viciousness of the Assad regime andfor March’s horrific crimes. Those who are warily engaging with Mr Sharaa must remember, and remind him, that containing violence cannot be separated from the tasks of economic and social progress and political inclusion.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Brussels needs to draw a line in the sandWed 28 May 2025 13.51 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 13.59 EDTShareAccording to article 2 of thetreatyof the European Union, the EU is founded on respect for human dignity in societies where “pluralism, non-discrimination [and] tolerance prevail”. Try telling that to the organisers of next month’s Budapest Pride march.Following new laws introduced by Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz government, Hungary has become the first EU country to legislate to enable the banning of a Pride event. Anamendmentto the country’s constitution now allows public LGBTQ+ events to be designated a threat to children, expanding the scope of earlier laws targeted at schools. As a result, organisers and participants in Budapest’s Pride celebration on 28 June risk being fined and harassed if they turn up to the parade.Unsurprisingly, and accurately, Mr Orbán’s ban has been described as a “full-frontal attack” on LGBTQ+ people. It is also a typically machiavellian manoeuvre by Hungary’s prime minister, intended to provoke a backlash from liberals at home and abroad. As Fidesztrailsin the polls ahead of elections next year, Mr Orbán is turning to his polarising playbook once again.The fact that Mr Orbán may be hoping for a reaction does not mean there should not be one. The banning of a Pride parade in a European capital would be in flagrant contravention of EU law regarding freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. A delegation of EU lawmakers who visited Hungary last monthreportedthat the new law had already created a “very hostile atmosphere” for LGBTQ+ Hungarians and led to a rise in violent attacks.In Brussels, demands for a showdown with Mr Orbán were already growing, partly as a result of his pro-Putin obstructionism throughout the war in Ukraine. Hungary is currentlydeniedaccess to €18bn in EU funds, due to rule-of-law concerns relating to issues such as the treatment of asylum seekers and corruption. But its rogue prime minister has largely led the European Commission a merry dance and shown contempt for its strictures. This week 20 member states, including France and Germany, published adeclarationdemanding that all possible sanctions should be deployed if the new anti-LGBTQ+ legislation is not withdrawn.Unanimity rules mean they would be unlikely to include the suspension of Hungary’s rights as a voting member of the European Council – a move that would be vetoed by Slovakia’s national populist government. But at the very minimum, the council should move swiftly to identify Mr Orbán’s government as clearly in breach of EU values and act to substantially close off its access to Brussels’ funds.The first Budapest Pride parade took place in 1997.Writingin the Guardian last month, an opposition MP described the event as “the largest recurring demonstration of human rights in Hungary”. According topolls, 78% of the city’s residents wish it to go ahead as normal. At a time when the EU’s liberal norms are being challenged by the rise of authoritarianism and intolerance in the west and beyond, its leaders must respond robustly to Mr Orbán’s latest shameless attempt to undermine them for his own political ends.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the race for second place was a closely fought contest between the Socialist party (PS) and Chega.With 99% of the votes counted on election night itself, the provisional results had the PS and Chega tied on 58 seats each, although the socialists had a slightly larger share of the vote.But when the overseas votes were counted and added to the national tally on Wednesday, Chega reached a final total of 60 seats and won 22.76% of the vote, while the PS stayed at 58 seats but maintained its marginally higher share of the vote (22.83%).The far-right party, which was founded in 2019by the former football pundit André Ventura, has capitalised on widespread dissatisfaction with Portugal’s mainstream left and right parties as the country continues to suffer a housing crisis, stressed health and education systems, and an average monthly wage of €1,602 (£1,346). It has seen a dramatic rise in support over the past few years, winning 1.3% of the vote in 2019, 7.2% in 2022, and 18.1% last year, when its seat count shot up from 12 to 50.Ventura thanked his supporters as the final results came on Wednesday evening, saying his party’s historic performance represented a win for the entire country and showed that its political system had “changed forever today”.“What a great victory!!! Thank you to all the Portuguese who trusted us!” he wrote on X. “This historic victory is also yours, it is Portugal’s!”.The PS’s dire performance – down 20 seats on last year’s result – had already led its leader, Pedro Nuno Santos, to announce his resignation hours after the polls closed.Carlos César, the president of the PS, accepted his party’s relegation to third place a few hours before Wednesday’s final results were published, saying the writing had been on the wall for his party since election night.‘It’s a really big threat’: Portuguese minorities on the rise of the far rightRead more“We will have time, later, to reflect and to correct our paths and to once again deserve the increased trust of the Portuguese people,” he said, adding that once a new leader was chosen at the end of June, the party would have to prove that it was “an instrument of participation and innovation”.Chega’s delight at eclipsing the PS will be tempered by the knowledge that it is no closer to government because of Montenegro’s enduring refusal to strike any deals with the party.“Governing with Chega is impossible for three reasons,” Montenegro has previously said. “It isn’t reliable in its thinking; it behaves like a political weathervane, always changing its mind, and it’s not suited to the exercise of government.”The small Liberal Initiative party – which could throw its weight behind Montenegro, bringing the AD nine extra seats – has alsocategorically refusedto do anything that would help Chega into power.If invited to form a new government by the president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Montenegro’s minority government will face another fragmented and awkward legislature.The early election was triggered in March after the prime minister used a confidence vote in his government to try to head offgrowing scrutiny relating to a data protection consultancythat he founded in 2021 and which he transferred to his wife and sons the following year.Faced with questions over possible conflicts of interest, the prime minister – who has denied any wrongdoing or ethical breaches – said he hoped the vote would “end the atmosphere of permanent insinuations and intrigues”. Buthe failed to win the confidence of MPs and a fresh election was called.The electoral campaign had focused onissues such as housing, public services and safety. Immigration – one of Chega’s priorities – has also risen up the agenda, and Montenegro’s caretaker government was recentlyaccused of pandering to the far rightafter it announced the expulsion of 18,000 irregular migrants earlier this month.Chega’s vows to clean up politics – and its hardline stance on immigration and people abusing the benefits system – have recently been undermined by the kind of corruption and sleaze scandals it has been railing against.In January, Ventura’s party expelled one of its MPs after he was accused of stealing suitcases at several airports. Another member of the party was caught drunk-driving the same month, while a third has been charged with paying for oral sex with an underage male who was 15 at the time.Explore more on these topicsPortugalThe far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We must take back control of our party – before it’s too lateAletha AduPolitical correspondentWed 28 May 2025 10.27 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 19.04 EDTShareThe suspended Labour veteranJohn McDonnellhas called for a grassroots leadership challenge to the Labour government, warning that unless party members, unions and MPs “stand up and assert themselves to take back control of our party”, Labour risks losing not just its power: “We could lose a party.”The former shadow chancellor accused Keir Starmer’s government of “callousness and political incompetence”, criticising its hesitancein abolishing the two-child limit on benefits, and what he calls a “brutal launch of an attack on benefits of disabled people”.Writing for the Guardianfive decades after joining Labour as a young trade unionist, McDonnell said the movement he had devoted his life to had “instigated a series of policies that fly like a knife to the heart of what we believed the Labour party above all else stood for when we joined the party”.“When in the first king’s speech the Starmer leadership didn’t just fail to address the major cause of child poverty, the two-child benefit cap, but demandedLabourMPs vote against its abolition, the first signs of the callousness and political incompetency of the decision-making of the new administration were put on display,” he wrote.McDonnell was among seven Labour MPs suspended last July for defying the whip on a Commons vote to end the two-child limit – a policy that continues to cause anger across Labour’s benches – leaving many MPs ready to use the welfare-related vote expected in the coming weeks to express their discontent.Labour’s decision to delay the release of its long-awaited child poverty strategy until autumn has left some MPs feeling relieved, but many feeling further angered given experts have warned more children will continue to be pushed into poverty every day the policy exists.By delaying its child poverty plan, Labour has a chance to reverse 15 years of inequality | Gordon BrownRead moreMcDonnell highlights what he sees as an erosion of Labour’s founding mission. “We are the party founded to eliminate poverty and secure equality,” he said, but instead he added, “the distasteful sight of Labour ministers accepting gifts and tickets and donations from the rich and corporate carpet baggers whilst cutting the benefits of the poorest in our society was justifiably nauseating for many of our supporters.”“To then follow this up with the debacle of the winter fuel allowance and the brutal launch of an attack on benefits of disabled people has disillusioned our supporters on a scale not seen before in the recent history of our party”.TheU-turn on universal winter fuel support, which initially excluded millions of pensioners on modest incomes, followed internal backlash and a local elections drubbing. But McDonnell argued the government’s direction had already “opened the door to the divisive and destructive proto fascism of Farage”.Going even further, McDonnell launched a cutting assessment of Starmer’s inner circle, claiming a full-blown power struggle was already under way. “What we are now witnessing is a panicked half-hearted policy retreat whilst the back room boys, Morgan McSweeney in the leader’s office and Nick Parrot in the deputy leader’s office, fight like rats in a sack for the succession toKeir Starmer.”Downing Street heavily pushed back against MPs’ criticism of Starmer’srecent immigration speech, rejecting the direct comparisonwith Enoch Powellbut saying the prime minister would not “shy away” from direct talk about the subject.The government is preparing for a June spending review, with pressure from Labour backbenchers and trade unions to introduce a wealth tax and reverseplanned welfare cuts. The leadership has so far resisted those calls, but McDonnell’s intervention will be read by Labour insiders as a direct call for Starmer’s ousting if he does not.“Unless the party members, our affiliated unions and members of the parliamentary Labour party stand up and assert themselves to take back control of our party, in the next period, in the Labour party’s history we may not just lose a government, we could lose a party”, he said.The subheading of this article was amended on 28 May 2025.

He did so outside the Turkish consulate, a political institution, which provides further evidence he was not seeking to persuade others to dislike Islam, but express his personal criticism of Turkey and its stance on Islam.“His protest was specifically political and thus, it is submitted, requires the highest protection of freedom of speech.”Prosecuting, Philip McGhee said Coskun was not being prosecuted simply for the burning of the Qur’an, but for “disorderly conduct”.McGhee said of Thorne’s argument: “There is simply no misconduct in this case.”Judge McGarva ruled there was no abuse of process and dismissed the application.McGhee added that the decision to prosecute does not affect the ability of others to criticise religion. The prosecutor had earlier said Coskun had deliberately chosen the time and location of his demonstration.He went on: “His actions gave rise to a very clear threat to public order and went beyond a legitimate expression of protest, crossing the line to pose a threat to public order.”Turkey-born Coskun, who is half-Kurdish and half-Armenian, travelled from his home in the Midlands on 13 February and set fire to the Qur’an at about 2pm, the court heard.Coskun had posted on social media that he was protesting against the “Islamist government” of Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who the defendant allegedly said “has made Turkey a base for radical Islamists and is trying to establish a sharia regime”, prosecutors said.Coskun, who is an atheist, believes that he protested peacefully and burning the Qur’an amounted to freedom of expression, the court heard.Before his trial, in a quote released through the Free Speech Union, he said: “Encountering such treatment in a country like England, which I truly believed to be a place where freedom prevailed, was a real shock to me.”His legal fees are being paid for by the Free Speech Union and the National Secular Society.The Free Speech Union said it is defending him “not because we’re anti-Islam, but because we believe no one should be compelled to observe the blasphemy codes of any religion, whether Christian or Muslim”.The prosecution and defence have finished their cases, but a further hearing will take place on Thursday afternoon, with a verdict likely to come on a later date, the court heard.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was his third visit to the German capital since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022 and his first since Merz entered office.Merz avoided commenting on speculation as to whether Germany would deploy Taurus missiles, which was prompted by his pronouncement that range restrictions were no longer in place, enabling Kyiv to strike Russian military targets over the border.Neither leader would detail the specific weapons that would be manufactured in Ukraine, saying it was prudent to keep the information as secretive as possible.Zelenskyy said he expected the first weapons to be ready by June 2026.The expectation is that Berlin will supply Ukraine with the technical components to build and maintain its own long-range weaponry, including rockets and cruise missiles, with a range of up to 2,500km. This could enable Kyiv to better defend itself, and also save Berlin from accusations – at home in particular – that it is a war monger, helping to placate sceptics within elements of Merz’s government who fear Germany being dragged into a wider-scale conflict.The two leaders said they believed all the stops had been pulled out to solve the conflict through diplomatic means, repeatedly emphasising their conviction that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was not interested in ending the bloodshed. But they said they would continue to pursue a negotiated peace, referring to possible talks in Geneva.View image in fullscreenFriedrich Merz shakes hands with members of the Ukrainian delegation alongside Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/ReutersGermany has long supported Kyiv and is the second-biggest deliverer of weapons after the US, but relations between Zelenskyy and Merz’s predecessor, Olaf Scholz, often felt decidedly cool, and Kyiv was evidently repeatedly frustrated by the speed of Berlin’s decisions.Merz said while in opposition that he would back Ukraine in office, and Wednesday’s meeting was noticeably warmer and less tense than those between Scholz and Zelenskyy. The two leaders used the informal version of “you” to address each other, as well as referring to each other by their first names. When Zelenskyy’s microphone appeared not to be connected to the in-house interpreter, Merz quipped “German technology”, and laid a supportive hand on the Ukrainian president’s arm.As well as focusing on Germany’s continued support for Ukraine, the visit was also expected to be used to discuss efforts to bring about a ceasefire in the conflict that has run for three-and-a-half years, the German government spokesperson, Stefan Kornelius, said earlier in the day.Almost immediately on entering office earlier this month, Merz took a train to Kyiv with his French and British counterparts, Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer, as a sign of their solidarity towards Zelenskyy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He and Merz are then due to travel to the western German city of Aachen on Thursday, where the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is to receive a prize. Starmer is also due to attend, and the four leaders are expected to hold further talks there.Ukraine war briefing: Drones target Moscow forcing suspension of some flightsRead moreBefore the Berlin encounter, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, called Merz’s recent plansto build the strongest conventional army in Europe“very worrying”. Speaking at a security conference in Moscow, Lavrov said the announcement was reminiscent of “the periods of the previous century when Germany twice became the leading military power and how much trouble this brought”.There has been heightened speculation that Merz will promise to deliver longer-ranged weapons systems to Ukraine, such as Taurus missiles, after he said on Monday there were no longer any range restrictions on the weapons Germany sends to Kyiv to defend itself against Russia.However, the German government has since sought to clarify its position, saying these range restrictions had already been lifted.Merz is expected to offer his Ukrainian counterpart a multibillion-euro package including additional air defence capabilities, more weapons and financial aid with which Ukraine can buy US military equipment. It is unclear whether the package will be in addition to the €3bn (£2.5bn) in aid already agreed in March by the outgoing government.There are also expectations that a longer-term approach to helping Ukraine will be adopted. This would probably include Berlin supplying Ukraine with the technical components necessary to build and maintain its own long-range weaponry, including rockets and cruise missiles. This would enable Kyiv to defend itself more effectively without Berlin having to be concerned about being labelled a “war monger”. This in turn would make support for Ukraine more palatable to Merz’s domestic audience, among whom there is concern about Germany being dragged into a wider-scale conflict.Explore more on these topicsUkraineGermanyVolodymyr ZelenskyyFriedrich MerzRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Qataris have given the president aBoeing747-8, a stretch model of the jumbo that is more than 18ft longer than the much older 747-200B that flies as the current Air Force One.0:41Airplane gifted by Qatar 'much too big', laments Donald Trump – video“Frankly, it’s much too big,” Trump told reporters during a question-and-answer media session in the Oval Office at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, as he tried to explain why he regarded it as a gift to the nation rather than a perk for him as an individual.Trump is stretching his pardon power – to the delight of his Maga acolytesRead moreHe called the new jet a “beautiful, big, magnificent, free airplane for the United States air force”. Trump continued: “They tried to say: ‘Oh, it’s Trump’s airplane.’ Oh, yeah, sure. It’s too big, frankly, it’s much too big.”The original offer from Qatar set off a firestorm ofcriticismof Trump, fromboth political parties, particularly following his visit to the country earlier this month where he focused most vigorously on trade and business deals. The US senator Cory Booker and other prominent Democratsslammedthe arrangement and Chris Murphy, the Connecticut senator, called the gift “the definition of corruption” and “wildly illegal”.Asked on Wednesday whether the jet is definitely going to become Air Force One, the official plane of the US president, Trump said only that the aircraft was in the US and “being re-fitted for military standard”.He admitted he doesn’t know how much the re-fitting will cost but guessed “a hell of a lot less than building a new one”. He again criticized Boeing, the troubled US aircraft manufacturer, for delays in replacing the current jet used as Air Force One, which dates back to the early 1990s, apparently necessitating an expedited replacement from another country.This article was modified on 28 May 2025 to clarify the context in which Donald Trump said the jet gifted byQatarwas too big.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpQatarBoeingnewsShareReuse this content"

Legend says the columns were built by the Irish giant Finn McCool as a crossing to confront a Scottish rival, Benandonner.But coins from the UK, Europe, the US and elsewhere that are wedged into joints and cracks as tokens of visits are harming the basalt rock aesthetically and physically, according to a British Geological Survey report.View image in fullscreenCoins from all over the world are rusting and expanding to three times their original thickness, causing the rock to crumble.Photograph: National Trust/PA“The coins are rusting, and expanding to three times their original thickness, which puts huge pressure on the surrounding rock causing it to crumble. Unsightly streaks of copper, nickel and iron oxides are also staining the stones where the coins are corroding,” said Henry. “The coins here also have accelerated corrosion because they are often soaked in saltwater spray and the mixture of metals means they break down faster.”The National Trust, in partnership with Causeway Coast and Glens Heritage Trust, hired stone conservation specialists to remove coins without causing further damage at 10 test locations. The trial was successful and it is hoped all the remaining coins will be removed, costing an estimated £30,000.The Giant’s Causeway formed between 50 and 60m years ago whenmolten basalt eruptedthrough chalk beds and formed a lake of lava. As this cooled and contracted, cracks propagated across the plateau to form hexagonal stepping stones.Signs are to be erected urging visitors to keep coins in their pockets and not leave a legacy of additional cracks. “We protect and care for places so people and nature can thrive,” said Henry.City Hall officials in Paris made a similar appeal after a tradition of leavingpadlocks on the Pont des Artswas blamed for a partial collapse in 2014.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandThe National TrustHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

Samples collected from two birds found they tested positive for H5N1, a strain of bird flu.The farm’s owners sued over the order, but the Canadian federal government argued they were following a “stamping out” policy in order to keep avian flu at bay, in line withadvice from the World Health Organization.According tocourt documents, the owners conceded that 69 of their ostriches died from the flu, but argued that the rest were free of symptoms and claimed that there had been no further deaths since January.Karen Espersen, the owner, said she welcomed expressions of support from Kennedy, Oz and the US billionaire John Catsimatidis, who are lobbying the Canadian government to reverse the order.She said that Oz had told her he would be willing to take the birds to his ranch in Okeechobee, Florida. “He said: ‘You know if by chance you want to move [them] to the States, I got 900 acres,’” she said.While Espersen says she wants the birds to stay inCanada, if they can’t fight the order at the supreme court, they are open to moving the birds to Oz’s ranch.She said: “We are not against our government … but we’re very, very saddened our government [does not believe the birds are well].”Oz told the New York Post that he, Kennedy Jr and Catsimatidis are “sticking our necks out” for the ostriches. “It doesn’t help anyone to kill the birds,” Oz told the outlet.Kennedy has sent a letter to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), which issued the order, to reconsider.But the CFIA has been clear on the need to cull the birds in order to protect Canadians. In a statement, it told the Guardian that its response is to protect human and animal health and “minimize impacts on the $6.8 billion domestic poultry industry and Canada’s economy”.In the US, bird flu has been spreading among animals andegg prices have been soaringas a result and amid concerns of price fixing.BC has been the epicentre of a bird flu outbreak in Canada. Millions of birds have been culled at hundreds of farms in an infection period that has lasted over three years. North of the border, however,egg prices have not spikedas they have in the US due to the resiliency of smaller farms and the country’s supply management system.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationCanadaDonald TrumpRobert F Kennedy JrBird fluHealthAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Located 60 miles south of Houston, it’s home to a sprawling petrochemical complex – one of the largest and most polluting in the US.Among its facilities is a plant dedicated to the production of ammonia, a colourless compound of nitrogen and hydrogen and a key ingredient in fertilisers widely used on industrial arable farms – including on fields of barley, wheat and maize acrossEurope.Chemicals giants Yara and BASF opened the factory to great fanfare in 2018,promising“cost-efficient” and “sustainable” ammonia production. Unlike conventional plants, which use hydrogen made from natural gas, this factory would employ a hydrogen “byproduct” from a nearby Dow plant producing components for plastic, they said, helping to tackle the fertiliser industry’ssizeablecarbon footprint.Butan investigation by DeSmog, Data Desk and the Guardian reveals that despite these green promises, the Yara Freeport plant is relying on hydrogen made from US shale gas – one of the most environmentally and socially damaging fossil fuels – to manufacture its ammonia in Texas.Analysis of pipeline and permit documents traces the source of this gas hundreds of miles west of Freeport to the Permian Basin – thesecond largestgas-producing region in the US.Why Trump’s ‘drill, baby, drill’ pledge may not actually lower US gas pricesRead moreExperts said Yara and BASF’s claim the production process was gas-free was “not true at all”. While the recycling of hydrogen results in energy savings overall, the fuel has to be replaced with fossil gas, meaning that Yara Freeport indirectly drives demand for gas.Despite these links to fracked gas and uncertain carbon savings, the investigation shows this ammonia is being shipped to fertiliser factories in Europe.Yara – which remains Europe’s largest industrial buyer of natural gas and is globally responsible for emissions equivalent to 16 coal-fired power plants each year –claimsit is “committed to reducing emissions” and “mitigating climate change”.Yet shale gas extraction through fracking releases large volumes of the potent greenhouse gasmethane and multiple toxic chemicalsand pollutants into the air and water.Ammonia production’s gas demand is expected to triple in the next decades,drivenby a booming fertiliser trade currentlyestimatedat about $200bn. The use and production of fertiliser is already a major contributor to climate breakdown,creatingmore emissions than aviation and shipping combined.Efforts to tackle fertiliser emissions in Europe appear to have stalled since an ambitious reductions pledge was announced in 2021.“European countries and companies claim to be feeding the world with ‘clean’ fertilisers and fuelling the future with ‘clean’ energy,” says Taylor Hodge, an agrochemicals campaigner from the Washington-based group the Center for International Environmental Law. “In reality, they’re offshoring the pollution, costs, and risks to communities in the US Gulf south.”Yara’s plant in Freeport is the company’s first investment on US soil. The Norwegian chemicals giant – Europe’s largest fertiliser producer – said in its joint launchpress releasewith the German multinational BASF that its use of hydrogen byproduct would reduce the environmental impact of 750,000 tonnes of ammonia production a year.Pipeline maps and permit documents show the hydrogen supplying Yara’s plant can be traced back to fracked gas stored at Mont Belvieu, a vast salt dome containing dozens of caverns filled with natural gas liquids from several shale gas basins including the Permian.From Mont Belvieu, the fracked gas is piped 90 miles south to Dow’s ethylene plant in Freeport, just metres from the ammonia plant, where an intensive steam cracking process produces both ethylene and hydrogen.Yara claims the Freeport plant’s use of byproduct hydrogen reduces emissions from chemical production by 20%, but experts say that while such savings are possible, they do not go far enough.“Just because it’s a byproduct doesn’t mean it’s clean,” says Paul Martin, a chemical engineer with Spitfire Research, a Toronto-based consultancy specialising in industry decarbonisation.While Yara can claim it is using a more “sustainable” byproduct, Dow’s plant has to use more fracked gas to fuel its furnace toreplacethe lost heat energy it would otherwise have generated from burning its hydrogen in-house.According to Martin, this would amount to about 1.1m kg of natural gas a year being fed to the cracker furnaces to replace the lost heat energy from hydrogen. He therefore says that while the use of byproduct hydrogen is more efficient overall, reducing the amount of fossil fuels required to produce Yara’s ammonia, it is “not true at all” to say the ammonia production is natural gas-free, since it is also driving up Dow’s use of natural gas.Yara’s use of fracked gas makes a mockery of Yara’s “green” expansion in Europe and undermines its attempts at “sustainable” US production, according to Hodge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Yara’s claims mislead the public about their climate- and community-harming emissions.”Yara recently closed two of its largest European production plants, in France and Belgium. Despite this, the company maintains that “a strong European fertiliser industry is crucial not only for ensuring food security in Europe and globally but also for enabling Europe to lead the green transition” and has highlighted recent investments in “green ammonia” created using renewable energy at plants in Norway and the Netherlands.Yara has communicated little about how its European facilities are using ammonia imported from its US plant, but DeSmog and Data Desk were able to trace ammonia shipped across the Atlantic Ocean from Yara’s Freeport facility to a number of key European fertiliser plants.Analysis of customs and shipping data reveals that about a quarter of Yara Freeport ammonia is exported outside of the US, with more than 90% of this shipped to Europe to be made into fertiliser.These fertilisers – used for everything from wheat to potatoes – are shipped onwards to Asian and European markets.In 2023, Ireland received about 14% of all its fertiliser imports from the facilities, while the UK received about 8% and Spain almost 6%.The investigation “exposes the bitter truth” of the industry, according to Raj Patel, a research professor at the University of Texas in Austin and panel expert at the IPES-Food coalition, who said a focus on green hydrogen fertiliser technology did not address underlying issues around fertiliser use, and called for policies that instead targeted reduction.“They don’t touch the root problem – the overuse, pollution and potent greenhouse gas emissions happening on farms,” he said. “We’re applying 21st-century technology to preserve 20th-century farming problems.”“While fertiliser giant Yara markets ‘green solutions’, it’s actually pioneering new frontiers for fracking and fossil fuels. Our food system is becoming Big Oil’s emergency escape hatch.”A Yara spokesperson said: “Yara is a leader in the transition to lower-carbon fertilisers and low-emission ammonia. Profitable decarbonisation is a top strategic priority, and since 2005, we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by about 45%. Ammonia produced at Yara’s Freeport plant has always relied on hydrogen derived from natural gas, supplied by third parties. Still, the configuration of the plant makes it both one of the lowest emitters of pollutants and one of the lowest carbon intensity plants in the US.”BASF and Dow did not respond to requests for comment.This article was supported by a grant from Journalismfund.euThis article was amended on 28 May 2025. Yara estimates that using byproduct hydrogen reduces emissions by 20%, not 25%. Also, the text was changed to reflect that one of Yara’s recently closed European plants did not produce ammonia.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentChemical industryShale oilFrackingPollutionEuropeFossil fuelsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is with profound regret this happened,” Court said. “The officers in this case have been held accountable to a criminal threshold and we respect the jury’s decision. While this concludes the criminal investigation, both officers will now face gross misconduct proceedings.”Jurors found Smith not guilty of two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for his use of Pava spray and for using a baton, while Comotto was found not guilty of one count for deploying her Taser.The care home called 999 after Burgess, a single-leg amputee and wheelchair user, reportedly grabbed a knife he was given to cut his food and threatened to stab staff.The court previously heard this was “out of character” for Burgess. “The reason for his behaviour that day, we now know, is that he was delirious as a result of a urinary tract infection,” Judge Hehir told jurors.Smith sprayed synthetic Pava pepper spray into Burgess’s face and used his baton to try to knock the knife out of Burgess’s hand, with Comotto deploying her Taser, all within a minute and 23 seconds of entering the pensioner’s room, the court heard.Burgess was taken to hospital after the incident and later contracted Covid, dying 22 days later aged 93.The court heard that Smith and Comotto both repeatedly asked Burgess to drop the knife. Smith told jurors he did not see that Burgess was disabled and using a wheelchair until after the incident, as he was focused on the knife the pensioner was holding in his hand. He added that he believed Burgess “could clearly understand what we were saying to him”.Comotto said she believed using the Taser was the safest way to “protect” Burgess as she feared her colleague using the baton again would cause more harm. “I’m not a trigger-happy officer,” she told the court. “It’s the first time I’ve fired my Taser.”The Independent Office for Police Conduct said it would liaise with Sussex police about the misconduct hearings now criminal proceedings are over.It said both officers should face a gross misconduct hearing for potential breaches of the police standards of professional behaviour relating to use of force, and authority, respect and courtesy, with Comotto facing a further misconduct allegation relating to comments she made on social media after the incident.Explore more on these topicsEast SussexPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

He expressed his “deep regret at not being contactable during the night of the incident” to the internal inquiry conducted by Ruth Kelly, former secretary of state for transport.Woldbye washeavily criticisedafter the outage for reportedly going to bed on the night of the crisis so he could be “better rested” to handle the fallout the following day. But the Kelly Review was told that reports that Woldbye had appointed Echave in charge of the incident and then gone to sleep were incorrect.The Kelly Review found that the early decision taken by Echave, about 90 minutes after the power outage, to shut the airport immediately “was correctly made and essential to protect the safety and security of people”.View image in fullscreenThomas Woldbye issues a statement on 21 March, the day after the disruption at the airport.Photograph: PA Video/PAKelly said: “The evidence confirms that Heathrow made the right decisions in exceptionally difficult circumstances. While the disruption was significant, alternative choices on the day would not have materially changed the outcome.”The outage at Europe’s busiest airport has raised questions over the resilience of the UK’s ageing national infrastructure. In addition to the Kelly review, there are ongoing investigations by the National Energy System Operator and the energy regulator Ofgem into the loss of power that triggered the airport’s shutdown.The substation outage disrupted electricity grids in the local area, cutting power to one of Heathrow’s three connection points to the surrounding power networks, which caused the airport to shut down.The Kelly review has called on Heathrow to give “careful consideration” to investing in new diesel generators to provide extra backup power to the airport in its future plans.The review found that the airport was aware that losing power from one intake would disrupt its operations for at least eight hours while it reset its systems to accept power from the other two connection points.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, Heathrow should work closely with airlines and the Civil Aviation Authority on the need for new energy investments, “so that a shared understanding can be reached on this topic as soon as possible”.Heathrow has enough diesel generators to provide instant backup power supply to the airfield lighting and the control tower for up to seven days to allow for emergency landings.Woldbye has said it couldcost about £1bnto install a more resilient power supply system to prevent a repeat of theoutage, which could mean higher charges for the airlines who help to fund it, and higher ticket prices for passengers.In response to the review, Woldbye said: “Investments in energy resilience have been and will continue to be part of our strategy, and our response to this unprecedented incident was effective due to well-drilled procedures.”Explore more on these topicsHeathrow airportTransportAir transportAirline industryNational GridnewsShareReuse this content"

Mahmood has insisted that she must take drastic action to cut prison overcrowding or risk the collapse of the criminal justice system.Recommendations from David Gauke’s sentencing review, which proposed less jail time for thousands of offenders including some violent criminals and domestic abusers, wereaccepted in principle by Mahmoodlast week.These recommendations would allow prisoners in England and Wales to be eligible for releaseafter serving a third of their sentence, and would drop short custodial sentences for nearly all offenders and allow suspended sentences for up to three years.On Wednesday morning, Rowley told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme that the plans would “generate a lot of work for police”.“We’ve asked the Ministry of Justice for the data so that we can understand the exact detail of the types of offenders who will in the future be in communities, so we can work through what the consequence of that are,” he said.Rowley said the decision would further stretch the resources of police forces still struggling to recover from financial cuts.“We’re carrying the scar tissue of years of austerity cuts, and forces are much smaller when you compare the population they’re policing than they were a decade or 15 years ago,” he said.Responding to Rowley, a government source said that police, including Rowley himself, had been consulted by officials and politicians in the months leading up to the publication of the review. Rowley met Mahmood last week before the sentencing review was published, it is understood.“The department and David Gauke consulted with police. The justice secretary accepted the recommendations ‘in principle’, but always said that further detail would come forward with the bill. The impact assessment will be published when the bill comes before parliament,” the source said.Officials from the Ministry of Justice are currently drawing up legislation based on the elements that were passed in principle before parliament. They hope that a bill could be put forward before summer recess.Police remain concerned that the principles have been drawn up before the impacts upon policing have been taken into account. A police source said: “More criminals in the community will result in more work for police officers. After a decade of keeping things on an even keel, the cash reserves have been eaten through.”Rowley also joined the head ofMI5and the National Crime Agency in writing to the justice ministry to predict that plans to release prisoners early could be to the “net detriment to public safety”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They predicted the next spending round could jeopardise Keir Starmer’s promise to halve knife crime and violence against women and girls, and to appoint 13,000 additional frontline officers.In a further development, police chiefs in England and Wales have said they want fewer, larger forces, amid financial shortages and difficulties dealing with fraud and updating technology.The current structure of 43 geographical forces was established in the 1960s and there have long been concerns that the model is not fit for purpose.As the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) published the police data strategy for 2025 to 2030 on Thursday, force bosses called for a redesign of the structure of policing in England and Wales.The NPCC chair, Gavin Stephens, said: “We need police forces that are strong and capable to be able to use technology … that are able to respond to a range of threats that might emerge in their local area and be resilient to those.“At the moment, the system is not resilient, so I would absolutely argue for bigger, capable forces led by a stronger national centre.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justicePoliceMark RowleyShabana MahmoodMetropolitan policeMI5newsShareReuse this content"

Many of the children he assaulted were under anaesthetic or waking up after operations. Some were assaulted in their hospital beds. The average age of the victims was 11.The French health minister, Yannick Neuder, said he would work with the justice minister to ensure that “never again will we find ourselves in a situation where patients and vulnerable children” were exposed to predators.Le Scouarnec eventually admitted all the assaults in court, saying in his final statement: “I am not asking the court for leniency.” During the trial, he said: “I was a surgeon who benefited from my status to attack children, I don’t deny that.” Psychological assessments found that he remained extremely dangerous.Le Scouarnec’s lawyer, Maxime Tessier, said the French medical world and politicians must learn lessons from “the major dysfunction of our health system”, which had not stopped Le Scouarnec’s decades of abuse.Le Scouarnec was flagged to the French authorities by the FBI in 2004 for viewing child abuse imagery on the dark web. In 2005 he was convicted in a French court of owning child abuse imagery and given a four-year suspended prison sentence, but the court did not rule that the surgeon should never work with children.He continued to gain prestigious jobs in hospitals across France until his retirement in 2017, systematically abusing children who had undergone surgery.Victims’ groups and child protection campaigners said the trial had raised the issue of serious failings by the state and officials. They said there should be a full government assessment of how the surgeon had been able to continue working and abusing for so long.The 20-year prison sentence is the maximum Le Scouarnec could have received for aggravated rape. In France, sentences are not added together, unlike in the US, where Le Scouarnec would have been jailed for 2,000 years, according to the state prosecutor, Stéphane Kellenberger.Victims expressed anger at his sentence, with cries of “shame on the justice system” as they watched the proceedings.Le Scouarnec will not be able to ask for parole until two-thirds of his sentence is served. The court rejected a rare demand from prosecutors that he should be held in a centre for treatment and supervision even after any release. The court cited his age and his “desire to make amends”.One victim, Amélie Lévêque, said she felt “humiliated by this verdict”.Le Scouarnec is already in prison after being sentenced in December 2020 to 15 years for raping and sexually assaulting four children. Kellenberger said there was likely to be a further trial after the prosecutor’s office opened an investigation to find more victims whose abuse was not part of the latest case.“You were the devil and sometimes the devil is dressed in a white coat,” Kellenberger told Le Scouarnec.Le Scouarnec, whose 2005 conviction was not automatically flagged to hospitals where he worked, was employed at a series of regional hospitals that depended on having surgeons of his expertise in order to stay open.In one instance, Le Scouarnec had told Michèle Cals, the then director of the Jonzac hospital in western France, about his 2005 conviction, saying he had viewed child abuse imagery only because he had been upset about separating from his wife. Cals received no word from her medical hierarchy not to hire him, so she appointed him in 2008. “We were in need of surgeons,” Cals told the court.Cals said Le Scouarnec’s 2005 sentencing had not prohibited him from being around minors. She told the court she “didn’t dig deep enough” and recognised there had been a “dysfunction” on her part and that of her superiors.Thierry Bonvalot, a hospital psychiatrist who tried to raise the alarm about Le Scouarnec’s 2005 conviction at one hospital where the surgeon later worked, said there had been a medical “fiasco”.Joël Belloc, the head of the Order of Physicians in Charente-Maritime, where Le Scouarnec finished his career, was asked if he could have done things differently. He said: “With hindsight, it’s obvious we could have.” He added that “perceptions were different” at the time.Victims complained of the “silence of the political world”, saying the government must address lessons from the case to prevent future abuse.They said: “We are appalled to see that this trial of the century is not a watershed event in the eyes of the government and, more broadly, the general public.”Manon Lemoine, now 36, whom Le Scouarnec admitted to raping when she was 11, said: “They’re trying to make him out to be a monster but this monster is the society that created him and allowed him to continue.”Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

One of her last words was that she wished she had taken the vaccine.”The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), experts on high-risk pregnancy, said in a statement that it “strongly reaffirms its recommendation that pregnant patients receive the Covid-19 vaccine”, and that the vaccine is safe to receive at any time during pregnancy.In a statement, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) said it was “concerned about and extremely disappointed”.“We also understand that despite the change in recommendations from [health and human services], the science has not changed,” said Dr Steven J Fleischman, ACOG president. “It is very clear that Covid-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families,” said Fleischman.Kennedy madethe announcementon Tuesday on social media, flanked by Trump administration appointees to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – neither of whom are typically involved in such decisions.Typically, changes to the recommended vaccine schedule are based on open public debate and the recommendation of an independent panel of experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advisory committee on immunization practices.Kennedy’s announcement circumvented both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its advisory panel, and neither body was advised of the forthcoming decision, sources toldSTAT. The CDC is currently without a leader.A directive making the change official, also reported bySTAT, suggested that Kennedy reviewed the evidence with the FDA. That agency’s advisory committee, which is structured similarly to the CDC’s, was also bypassed.Just a week earlier, the FDA’s head, Dr Marty Makary, published asimilarly unprecedentedarticle in theNew England Journal of Medicinethat described pregnancy and recent pregnancy as on a list of “underlying medical conditions that can increase a person’s risk of severe Covid-19”.As of Tuesday, the CDC’s website continued to state that those who are pregnant are at increased risk of severe illness if they contract Covid-19, including heightened risk of hospitalization and the need for intensive care. Further, evidence shows that mothers who are vaccinated pass protective immunity to infants, without the many risks that come alongside Covid-19 infection during pregnancy.Infants younger than six months old are at the highest risk of severe disease among children, with the risk to children younger than four years old on par with that of 50-to-64-year-old adults, according to the Journal article.“Kennedy’s unilateral decision to change the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule for Covid-19 vaccines demonstrates once again why he is completely unqualified to be the HHS secretary,” said Dr Robert Steinbrook, research director at consumer rights group Public Citizen, said in a statement.“In Congressional testimony on May 14, Kennedy said, ‘I don’t think people should be taking medical advice from me.’ Yet two weeks later he is making arbitrary public health decisions, defying norms, and with no accountability.”Despite the known risks of contracting Covid-19 while pregnant, public health authorities have struggled to get pregnant people vaccinated.CDC datashows only about 14% of pregnant people received the most recently updated Covid-19 vaccine.Kennedy’s decision to unilaterally change the vaccine recommendation comes as some of his supporters, particularly anti-vaccine advocates, continue to call for Covid-19 vaccines to be completely removed from the market.Explore more on these topicsCoronavirusTrump administrationRobert F Kennedy JrInfectious diseasesUS healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

Current verification is undertaken by a UN nuclear inspectorate, the International Atomic Energy Agency.“I want it very strong where we can go in with inspectors, we can take whatever we want, we can blow up whatever we want, but nobody getting killed. We can blow up a lab, but nobody is gonna be in a lab, as opposed to everybody being in the lab and blowing it up,” Trump said, adding that he believed he was very close to an agreement.The US president’s remarks implied, but did not confirm, that – subject to the new intrusive verification inspectorate – Iran would be allowed to continue to enrich uranium. The issue has been Tehran’s key demand in five rounds of talks between Iran and the US, which have been mediated by Oman.Iran’s nuclear chief, Mohammad Eslami, on Wednesday said the country was willing to see US inspectors enter its nuclear sites, but he insisted sovereignty required it to be entitled to enrich uranium, and not rely on imports.In a sign of the importance Iran places on retaining the right to enrich uranium, foreign minister Abbas Araghchi threatened to end all talks with European officials over its nuclear programme afterPeter Mandelson, the UK ambassador to Washington, appeared to side with previous US calls to eliminate the country’s uranium enrichment facilities.It was not clear if Lord Mandelson’s remarks during a question and answer session at the Atlantic Council in Washington revealed an unannounced change in UK policy or if, in seeking to side with US policy, he had spoken in a way to allow misinterpretation.The two sides remain at loggerheads over Iran’s continued ability to enrich uranium, which the US fears leaves open a path to an Iranian nuclear bomb.After Mandelson’s comments, Araghchi posted on social media on Wednesday: “If the UK position is ‘zero enrichment’ in Iran, there is nothing left for us to discuss on the nuclear issue.”He said such a request was a clear violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and undermined Britain’s commitments in the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPoA), the agreement to contain Iran’s civil nuclear programme that the UK and other world powers signed with Iran in 2015.Under the current JCPoA, Iran is entitled to enrich uranium to up to 3.75% purity, but the country gradually dismantled the previous UN inspection regime in protest at Trump taking the US out of the JCPoA in 2018.The British Foreign Office said when asked for comment: “We remain committed to taking every diplomatic step to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, including through snapback [of sanctions] if necessary. That is the UK’s longstanding position, which has not changed.“We have urged Iran to engage with President Trump’s offer of a negotiated solution and we continue to liaise closely with our allies and partners on this in support of regional stability and to secure peace in the Middle East.”No date has been set for a sixth round of talks. Iran has already offered to revert to much lower levels of enrichment, and for its stocks of highly enriched uranium to be put out of use, probably in a third country such as Russia.Explore more on these topicsIran nuclear dealIran's nuclear programmeIranForeign policyPeter MandelsonUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It amounted to 80% and 50% of their respective populations at the time.Some of their skulls were taken toGermanyfor racist experiments and were stored in German hospitals, museums and universities for decades.Namibia’s president, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, told a memorial event in the parliament’s gardens on Wednesday that the government would continue to push for reparations from Germany.She said: “We should find a degree of comfort in the fact that the German government has agreed that German troops committed a genocide against the … people of our land.“We may not agree on the final quantum, but that is part of the complex negotiations we have been engaged in with the German government since 2013 … We must remain committed that as a nation, we shall soldier on until the ultimate conclusion is reached.”In 2021, Germany officiallyrecognised the atrocities as a genocideand agreed to pay Namibia €1.1bn (then £940m) to fund development for the Herero and Nama. It said this was a gesture of “reconciliation”, but not compensation or reparations. Germany returned the skulls and other human remains to Namibia in 2011 and 2018.Descendants of genocide victims said this was not enough and called on the German governmentto negotiate with them directly.Germany ruled Namibia, then known as South WestAfrica, from 1884 to 1915, when it was taken over by South Africa during the first world war. It became independent in 1990.Between 1904 and 1908, German troops shot, tortured or drove tens of thousands of Herero and Nama people into the Kalahari desert to starve, after they rebelled against colonial rule. Their descendants are now politically marginalised.Germany’s ambassador to Namibia, Thorsten Hutter, said in a speech at the memorial: “It is a stark reminder of the pain and suffering that was inflicted by German imperial troops during the colonial era … We cannot change the past, but as the people who are living today, it is our responsibility to remember those atrocities that were committed.”He told the local newspaperthe Namibian: “I believe we are on a very good path to forge forward, which includes the issues of reconciliation.”Herero and Nama representatives said more people in Namibia and worldwide should learn about the genocide. Hoze Riruako, a Herero chief, said it was a precursor to the Holocaust, but “people are not aware of what has happened here to the same level”.Last year, Namibia declared 28 May would be a genocide remembrance day and a public holiday. It was chosen as it was the day in 1907 when Germany decided to close its concentration camps after an international outcry.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this storyExplore more on these topicsNamibiaAfricaGermanyColonialismReparations and reparative justicenewsShareReuse this content"

He was so hot he had to run to the car for a blast of the air-con’Interview by Harry Thorfinn-GeorgeWed 28 May 2025 10.19 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 13.15 EDTShareThe idea for Pink Man was born when I went to the first giant mall that opened in Bangkok. It was a warehouse on the outskirts of town that was so huge you got lost among stacks of products. Normally I would go to the supermarket with a small basket, but the trolleys I saw there were so big you could lie down in them. I saw a family in front of me filling one and I thought: “How many days will it take them to finish that? How much money do you need to fill this?” It reminded me ofDuane Hanson’s hyperreal sculpturesof American families but also how his art reflected his time. I thought my art should reflect my time, too.I was born in 1961 and lived by the canals with rice fields right in front of me. I couldn’t believe how society had changed within my lifetime, how it had happened right in front of my eyes. In many ways my art is a reflection of my life. When I pass away you can look at my art and you will see my life.The first Pink Man series, Pink Man Begins, was in 1997, two months before theAsian financial crisis. I photographed the performance artist and poet Sompong Thawee pushing an empty pink trolley in Silom, the financial district in Bangkok, while wearing a bright pink suit. At the time I felt there was something wrong with Thai society. People were becoming crazy, wanting to be rich and always talking about money. A new set of values were emerging at odds with the predominantly agricultural society I had grown up in, where Buddhism – the predominant religion – teaches you to live a humble life. Pink Man, in his tasteless pink suit, is a personification of consumerist greed. His empty cart represents how we will always feel empty no matter how much we consume. I wanted to question if this was the direction our country wanted to go in.It was difficult to set up the shot – rice fields are not meant for shopping trolleys!This photograph was taken in 1998 when the Thai government began promoting its AmazingThailandtourism campaign as a response to the economic downturn. Its idea was that tourism was an industry that was free because Thailand already had everything: culture, nature and beaches. I wanted to challenge the idea that tourism doesn’t cost anything: no, it costs. When bars, noise and traffic come to a small fishing village people have to change their way of life to serve tourists. Pink Man is a critique of consumerism, and tourism is just another form of consumerism.I took Pink Man to the Chiang Mai Social Installation festival in 1998. I wanted him to push his trolley silently outside Thae Pae Gate, the entrance to the old town and a popular tourist attraction. I didn’t make an announcement, I wanted it to happen spontaneously and see the public’s reaction. People were surprised and confused: they thought he was trying to sell something or that he was part of a commercial.We were travelling together, so I took the opportunity to take photos at tourist markets, hotel resorts and this rice field, which became Pink Man on Tour. It was not easy for Sompong because it was very hot in his cheap pink suit and he almost fainted. We had to stop because he was exhausted and ran back to the car to blast the air-con. It was difficult to set up the shot because we had to drag the trolley across the rice field, but rice fields are not meant for shopping trolleys!After years of doing Pink Man, I felt sorry for Sompong. I thought he got bored of posing for me, so I tried using a different actor, but there was something missing. Sompong has an anger in his aura, just like how city people try so hard to make money but are still not happy. In 2018, I received an invitation to a gallery in New York and I knew this was the place to end Pink Man. The consumerism he represents was born in America, so it felt cyclical. I photographed pink body bags next to the trolley which became The Last Man and the End of His Story.My Pink Man photos have been exhibited around the world. I think he was so successful because at the time there was no real contemporary photography in Thailand.Photographywas considered a decorative art, but my teacher at Srinakharinwirot University taught me that photos can reflect ideas, be conceptual, experimental, and deal with current issues. Pink Man was a benchmark that helped push Thai photography into the contemporary.Manit Sriwanichpoom’s CVView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Manit SriwanichpoomBorn:Bangkok, Thailand, 1961.Trained:Visual art at Srinakharinwirot University with major in photography.Influences:Robert Frank,Duane Michals,Caravaggio.High point:“The seriesHorror in Pinkin which I Photoshopped Pink Man into black and white news photos of the6 October massacrein 1976 [a violent crackdown against students who were protesting the return to Thailand of former military dictator Thanom Kittikachorn] that hadn’t been shown before.

Is there enough money in the account? Everything is at stake. This impressive, intelligent drama is an adaptation of Raynor Winn’s memoir about walking the South West Coast Path from Somerset to Dorset, with her husband, Moth. Unlike other hikers, the couple were not walking for pleasure – at least not to begin with. They had nowhere else to go after losing their farm. From theatre directorMarianne Elliott, it stars two fancy actors – Anderson and Jason Isaacs – both giving lovely, emotional, low-key performances.In flashback we see the bailiffs banging at the door, evicting the couple, who are in their 50s, from the home in which they raised their kids, now flown the nest to university. Moth has recently been diagnosed with a rare, life-limiting degenerative brain disease; nevertheless, off they set carrying their heavy rucksacks, sleeping in a tent, living off £40 a week, sharing teabags, eating in soup kitchens. The landscape is gorgeous and there are lovely moments of kindness, like the barman in a pub who brings them a teapot of hot water to make a brew, tactfully acknowledging they can’t pay for drinks.Making her feature-film debut, Elliott handles their story gently, with patience – though it might feel a bit slow for some. Somehow, they all bring a real sense of meaning and truth to cheap-sounding messages about living in the moment, and the possibility of long-term relationships deepening and growing in ways impossible to predict. And the best thing about watching the couple’s hardship is knowing there is a happy end coming – with the publication of Winn’s bestselling memoir.The Salt Path is in UK, Irish and Australian cinemas from 30 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFilm adaptationsWalkingGillian AndersonJason IsaacsAutobiography and memoirreviewsShareReuse this content"

The latter – which revolves around thrill-seeking teenagers who converse with spirits instead of taking recreational drugs (kids these days!) – marked the fiendishly good debut of Adelaide-born directors Danny and Michael Philippou.‘It’s very risky’: the Philippou brothers on horror films, back yard wrestling and knocking back HollywoodRead moreThey’re back – or baaa-ack! – with another serving of macabre bravado pulled from the black cauldron. Bring Her Back is lighter on thrills and spills for the midnight movie and heavy with thick, abject horror and despair, featuring an intensely disturbing performance fromSally Hawkinsas a foster mother from hell. She plays Laura, a former social worker who welcomes into her house two teens around whom the story orbits: Piper (Sora Wong), who is vision impaired, and her older brother, Andy (Billy Barratt).Early in the run time, the pair discover their father dead in the bathroom, and, with Andy three months too young to be Piper’s guardian, they move in with Laura and her other foster child, Oliver (Jonah Wren Phillips). The latter is a creepy kid from central casting: mute, with a shaved head, a thousand-yard stare and a tendency to do things that literally left me watching the film through the gaps between my fingers.It’s clear that something’s a little off about Laura, whose daughter died some time ago. But the script (written by Danny Philippou and Bill Hinzman) obscures her intentions for a long time, fuelling an aura of dreadful anticipation. Hawkins’ performance is coy, evasively dancing between light and heavy emotions; trying to nail down exactly what’s wrong with Laura is like trying to pin down water with a knife. She creates a character who’s needy, desperate and, as we increasingly realise, choked up with intense longing, before moving into a more volcanic space.View image in fullscreen‘When this kid starts doing crazy stuff, Bring Her Back goes next-level’ … Jonah Wren-Phillips as Oliver.Photograph: Ingvar KenneStrange sounds rumble and buzz on the soundtrack, with Cornel Wilczek’s shapeshifting score unfolding as if it were partly composed by demons; perhaps he got a hold of the embalmed hand from Talk to Me and consulted the spirit world. Circles become a visual motif, implying dark magic and rituals, and there are blurry sporadic visions of demonic undertakings recorded on videotapes. The humble old VHS format has been retooled into an eerie relic of yesteryear, ghouls from the past roaming around in the shadows of a passé technology, insulated from the modern digital world.Talk to Me review – terrific creepy-hand horror offers a blast of wild punk energyRead moreKeep an eye on Oliver: when this kid starts doing crazy stuff, Bring Her Back goes next-level, conjuring images that will challenge even horror enthusiasts with cast-iron stomachs. There’s no doubting this film’s art, craft and impact, although I did leave the cinema wondering whether I was a richer person for having experienced it, or in some way irrevocably tarnished.I might ordinarily have felt inclined to go home and take a cold shower – but not after this film. Water is often used to signify cleansing, renewal and rebirth but, in their most audacious visual accomplishment, the Philippous turn H20 into something hideous, a metaphorical devil’s rain signifying unrelenting emotional pressure. They achieve this partly through contrast: there’s either too much water or not enough.An example of the former belongs to that terrible early scene when Piper and Andy encounter the corpse of their father, water still gushing from the shower, steam thickening the air into a horrible deathly fog. An example of the latter can be found in Laura’s empty swimming pool, which is an oddly evocative image: to observe a pool without water is to see something that just isn’tright –a literal emptiness; a space that should be filled.I dare say that the pool might not be front of mind when the closing credits roll. You’ll be plagued by much more distressing visuals – and, like me, wondering how to get rid of them.Bring Her Back isin cinemas in Australia from Thursday, in the US from Friday, and in the UK from 1 AugustExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsAustralian filmSally HawkinsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But they weren’t that big: not Dylan-big, not even Cat Stevens-big. They graced some NME covers, they played Glastonbury, but even at the height of their success they could definitely pop to the shops without getting mobbed. Still, you’re always Dylan-big to your biggest fans, and Charles (Tim Key) is exactly that. He’s also a reclusive lottery winner, giving him the motive and the means to stage a private reunion gig for an audience of one on a remote island.Basden and Key starring in a film about a folk band reunion might have you expecting something a little bit sketch comedy, but this turns out to be a different beast: a funny but also melancholy piece of work. It’s more interested in maintaining a consistent and sincere emotional connection than in wild virtuoso showboating.As superfan Charles, Key blends a bit of the pleasant oddness he always brings to his acting roles with the verbal playfulness familiar to admirers of his poetry. Charles has a galloping case of verbal diarrhoea; like a perpetual talk radio DJ, he overflows with continual jokey non-jokes – “Houston, we have chutney, and it’s not a problem” – and is seemingly petrified of the possibility of leaving dead air.Basden does excellent work as a character, in contrast, whose face does the talking: a spiky presence, all low cut T-shirts, wounded ego and rounded shoulders. It’s a perfect performance both as an actor and, when the songs come along, as a musician. Basden wrote the music here and it is played and sung completely straight; it’s all rather beautiful. And while she might be a bigger name, Mulligan has a lot less to do than either of them: she is entirely plausible as a woman who was once part of the duo and now makes jam in Portland with her geek-chic birdwatching husband. You’ll leave wanting your own island, your own gig and your own lock of Carey Mulligan’s hair.The Ballad of Wallis Island is in UK cinemas from 30 MayExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFolk musicCarey MulliganTim KeyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, it goes to town on a sleazy peephole sexuality that now looks either quaint or distinctly stone-age, depending on your tolerance for aesthetic standards in anime’s red-light district. A miniskirted heroine kitted out like a cos playing bierkeller wench, Medusa-like succubi draining a bounty-hunter of his essence, one character fishing out one of the protagonist’s breasts mid-conversation a propos of nothing … #MeToo feels a very long way off.Seriously underdressed to fight mutants in an apocalyptic wasteland, Doris Lang (voiced by Kaneto Shiozawa) is waylaid by Count Magnus Lee (Seizō Katō), who is intent on making her his bride. So she hires roving mercenary D – half-undead, half-human, Blade-style “dhampir” – to dispatch this horror. Not only does he have to hack down a thicket of minions en route, including shock-haired mutant Rei (Kazuyuki Sogabe) and Lee’s snooty daughter L’Armica (Satoko Kitou), he has his own baser nature to deal with. Arguing with a symbiote who inhabits his left palm when the bloodlust kicks in, he is a paid-up member of the self-hating undead brethren.Apart from her ass-kicking intro, Doris is largely a passive plaything, in an unsophisticated linear storyline (adapted from the first in Hideyuki Kikuchi’s bestselling light-novel series) that is not unlike a TV cartoon serial. But what a setting: a florid, prog-rock album-cover desolation that is part-western, part-sci-fi, filled with mittel-European towns assailed by freaky Japaneseyokai. Despite some rough background art, the character designs (with contributions from original illustrator Yoshitaka Amano) are always sumptuous; D, peering from underneath the brim of his art, is like a bounty-hunting Marc Bolan.In terms of narrative and emotional intelligence, Vampire Hunter D might be crude compared with Studio Ghibli films, founded the same year. But it’s also possessed of a psychedelic freakiness that insistently tweaks the imagination, from the radiant “time-bewitching censer” that stops vampires in their tracks, to D’s mitt. The sexual politics are outdated, but you might find yourself talking to the hand regardless.Vampire Hunter D is on Shudder, AMC+ and HIDIVE from 30 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmAnimeJapanHorror filmsAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

Measuredly paced to let us fully sink into the experience, it understands the rhythms and mental accommodations of long-distance walking; even in its awareness of how its pair of protagonists position themselves on the trail and when they rest, it acknowledges the need for solitude and locating inner truths that often drives these undertakings. Its revelations and epiphanies arise at their own pace, never forced.Lapsed buddies Chris (Bart Harder) and Lluis (Carles Pulido) are reconnecting, backpacks in tow, after 10 years apart. Dutch and Latino respectively, life has taken them in different directions. Chris, judging by the office calls he frequently fends off, is a hectic modern professional, whose next project is kids with his girlfriend. Lluis, on the other hand, doesn’t want them and is, in fact, not sure what he wants; he has ditched his job shooting wedding videos and is now looking to find his creativity. Despite the catch-up time, their basic outdoor stances hint at a more profound divergence: Chris lapping up each new vista, Lluis masochistically trudging on.After2022’s Arctic trek Human Nature, Schrijver is well into his directorial stride. Chris and Lluis often appear as minute figures traversing valleys and crags, and – putting human drama into perspective – what we learn about their lives is measured out in sips of spare, allusive dialogue. The director also resists dealing in too much pathetic fallacy; this foreboding landscape is indifferent to the characters’ feelings. Big disclosures – about Lluis’s health, or a beach breakdown that hints that Chris isn’t as stable as he appears – arrive as suddenly as a wild panorama over a hillcrest. Nor is it certain these moments are transformative in the manner of mainstream drama; there and gone as suddenly as the girl walker who likes screaming into the void, they don’t necessarily mean more than anything else in nature.Perhaps the film’s innate trajectory means Schrijver doesn’t strive as hard as he might in search of a structure. But The North has a kind of purifying and uplifting effect that builds as the hikers approach their destination; a reminder for those interested in cinema going the distance, how the medium – in its commitment, immersion and focus – reaches altitudes TV can’t touch.The North is on tuesdayfilm.com from 31 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsWalkingScotlandFitnessHealth & wellbeingHobbiesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Since then, her acclaimed graphic novels have focused mainly on herself and her family.Fun Homein 2006 (exploring her closeted, funeral-director father’s suicide and her coming out) was followed byAre You My Mother?(psychoanalysis and her relationship with her mother) andThe Secret to Superhuman Strength(her compulsive exercising, from karate and crunches to snowshoeing).These three erudite, pensive and observant works spend most of their time looking back. Where the modern Bechdel is present, she is mostly sketching, editing and narrating her past, and contemplating how everyone from Jack Kerouac and Virginia Woolf topaediatrician Donald Winnicottcan help her shed light on it.In Spent, by contrast, we meet an Alison Bechdel who lives largely in the present. She writes and draws in rural Vermont, campaigns for progressive causes and hangs out with her friends and her wife, Holly. Yet this book-Alison is not quite the real Bechdel. In Spent, Alison’s father was a taxidermist, not a mortician; Bechdel’s two brothers have been replaced by aMaga-loving sister. In our world, Fun Home has been made into a Tony-winning musical and is being (slowly) developed into a movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal. The equivalent in Spent is Death and Taxidermy, a graphic memoir whose very loose TV adaptation (dragons and cannibalism feature, alongside Aubrey Plaza and Benedict Cumberbatch) is on to its third season.The book-Alison has mixed feelings about its success, but the royalties help fund the pygmy goat sanctuary she runs with Holly, and give her the leeway to prevaricate as she plans a new work: $um, an accounting of money and her life, with a little help from Karl Marx. Progress is slow: headlines about Trump’s first term blare from her device screens, the goats are grabbing every opportunity to breed, Holly is increasingly keen to film everything for her social feeds and Covid has the world in its grip. America is atomised, with “a zillion streaming options with six people tuned into each of them”, Alison says. “No wonder the country’s a mess.”Yet Spent is anything but a book about a writer’s lonely lot. Alison’s liberal community bustles with gossip and life. There are vets to befriend, new neighbours to meet, anticolonial Thanksgiving dinners to attend and speeches to give against book banning. Just down the road, her friends Ginger, Lois, Sparrow and Stuart share a house, this quartet – in another metafictional twist – having wandered over from the panels of Dykes to Watch Out For.Spent, then, feels less like a fictionalised autobiography and more a gathering of threads from Bechdel’s life and work, a celebration of and a rumination on where she has landed in late middle age, and how some of her fictional creations might live alongside her.Writing about herself from a greater fictional distance seems to have given the author more room to have funThat doesn’t mean first-time readers won’t enjoy it. Bechdel’s acutely observant line drawings – here enriched with warm colour by the real-life Holly – lend themselves wonderfully to the alternately comfortable, intimate and awkward interactions of her cast as they gather around tamari-roasted turnips and fennel flambé to shoot the breeze. There’s always been a spark to Bechdel’s work, despite its often serious themes, and writing about herself from a greater fictional distance seems to have given her more room to have fun. Dramas and mishaps unspool with a lightly comic charm that belies the darkness in the world outside, from Alison’s optimistic side-hustle (she pitches a reality TV show based on ethical living) to Sparrow and Stuart’s experiment as a throuple with old friend Naomi (a vegan purple dildo is delivered with a wink by a FedEx driver).Yet it’s longtime fans who will get the most from Spent. There’s a real joy to seeing characters return, their shapes a little baggier, their hair greyer, but their spirits the same. If you’ve treasured sharing Bechdel’s days spent hunched over her diary as a pale and anxious child, or cycling up theAdirondacksas a fitness-mad thirtysomething, it’s poignant to meet an Alison whose fierce self-analysis has mellowed a little. There’s a pathos, too, in seeing once-young radicals engage with a younger generation, in the form of Sparrow and Stuart’s daughter JR, who has returned to Vermont after the collapse of her polycule.Spent isn’t perfect. At times Alison’s world, with its “Shmetflix” and “Schmamazon” and “sage and sawdust” gluten-free stuffing, seems broad pastiche. There are stretches where you feel like you’re watching comfortably off semi-retirees cosplaying as agricultural workers. Yet while Spent may lack some of the raw power of Bechdel’s earlier work, this wise and playful tale has deep roots. On a flight back from pitching half-interested streaming networks about her reality TV show Alison soars over the “intriguingly wrinkled landscape of the south-west”, asks for a pencil and starts drawing over a TV script, the “rasp of graphite on paper … opening the flat page into another dimension”.It’s a neat epiphany and a lovely summary of the craft of comics, and it feels thoroughly earned. By the end of Spent, Alison has learned that she can’t do everything, but that perhaps doing something – and being in the moment with people you love – is enough. It’s an almost cosy conclusion, undercut by what we know but the book-Alison does not: that Trump will return, not long after her account has finished. Will Alison keep her newfound joie de vivre? I hope we get to find out.Spent: A Comic Novel by Alison Bechdel is published by Jonathan Cape (£20). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Who would intentionally spend their days immersed in the toxic online subculture where men go to blame women for everything and plot their revenge? Who would choose to listen to endlessJordan Petersonpodcasts or watch interminable Andrew Tate videos? Well, the answer is quite a lot of men, even though Bloodworth doesn’t really seem to know why.His book begins with an excellent chapter in which he describes how, as a callow 23-year-old, he forked out a couple of grand to take a course in seduction. This was the era of Neil Strauss’s 2005 bestseller The Game, which taught geeky men how to pull hapless women. A bundle of nerves, the author ended up chanting a mantra of “Right here, right now!” on a night out in the West End. As he prepared to approach a “target”, his coach informed him encouragingly, “Your organ is a spear.”Unfortunately, for a book subtitled “a personal journey”, this reminiscence is as personal as it gets. The author has interviewed some leading lights of the manosphere, including former pickup artist Anthony “Dream” Johnson. He has gone to several conferences where participants wear baseball caps printed with the slogan “Make Women Great Again”. He has even worked as a coach on a course in how to design social media profiles to attract women. (The signature Instagram pic of the tutor, Michael Sartain, has him surrounded by scantily clad women with a grin on his face.) Yet we never again get the same level of detail. We get little idea of how Bloodworth landed that job, or how he felt doing it. Was he nervous, for instance, that he might be unmasked as a left-leaning investigative reporter?Nick wanted to drop bodyfat and build his own micro-harem of women: how my friend fell for the red-pill hucksters of the manosphereRead moreThis leaves us with more generic material, which is sobering all the same. According to Lost Boys’ broadly chronological account, noughties pickup culture gave rise to the manosphere proper as men who absorbed the lessons of Strauss’s book found they still weren’t having any luck, and got angry about it. Those who were successful posted clips online of themselves chatting up women, and worked out that the ones where they insulted their targets were the most popular. So they posted more clips like that. We learn about theRed Pillbrigade, who believe that the world is secretly run by women and most men don’t stand a chance. And so on.Strangely, there’s zero consideration here of the explosion of online pornography, which encourages hyper-sexualisation while arguably exacerbating the sense of inadequacy felt by the viewer. I would have liked to have read more, too, on the accelerating effects of social media algorithms, as a result of which, Bloodworth notes, a boy showing interest in the relatively cerebral musings of Peterson will, within the hour, be exposed to Tate’s more extreme messaging.At its best, Lost Boys itself acts as a kind of red pill, exposing the fact that the manosphere is really run by an assortment of more or less sleazy grifters. When I followed Sartain on Instagram to learn more about the kind of course to which Bloodworth contributed, within minutes I received a DM from Sartain himself: “You here for the girls & lifestyle or the recent social circle vid I just did?” “Girls & lifestyle,” I replied after a pause, keen to see how far the racket would go. I’ve since had five more messages steering me towards his 21 Day Social Circle programme, which costs about $7,000.Meanwhile, as Bloodworth points out towards the end of the book, the White House has enthusiastically embraced the slang and stylings of these hucksters. Trump dismisses his enemies as “beta”. His vice-president, JD Vance, describes himself as “red-pilled”. The manosphere may be a tawdry subculture.

Not Grand Theft Auto, Shakespeare’s MacbethIf Shakespeare were around today, he’d be making open-world shooters with the same depth and diversion as his playsKeith StuartWed 28 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 10.03 EDTShareLast week, the Guardianspoke to the team behind Lili, a video game retelling of Macbeth, shown at the Cannes film festival. The headline quote from the piece was “Shakespeare would be writing for games today”, which I have heard many times, and does make a lot of sense. Shakespeare worked in the Elizabethan theatre, a period in which plays were considered popularist entertainment hardly worthy of analysis or preservation – just like video games today! The authorities were also concerned about the lewd and violent nature of plays and the effect they may have on the impressionable masses – ditto!But if we agree that a 21st-century Shakespeare would be making games, what sort would he be making? If our central thesis is that Shakespeare would be interested in mass, popular entertainment, then – if we’re talking pure revenue – he would be making casual smartphone games: Tencent’s multiplayer arena battle game Honor of Kings, for example, made$2.6bn (£1.9bn) last year. However, while the Bard was certainly interested in royalty and honour (and making money), it’s hard to see Hamlet working as a multiplayer arena-based online battle game structured into an endless series of fast-paced skirmishes. Our titular hero would barely get out the words, “O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!” before being vaporised in a scorching barrage attack. For similar reasons, I can’t see Shakespeare making battle royale games such as Fortnite because, while he certainly liked a battle and lots of deaths, there’s not a lot of room for narrative complexity or rousing military rhetoric when the sole aim is to shoot as many people as possible while dressed as a giant banana orSabrina Carpenter.No, I think if Shakespeare was magically reincarnated in the first quarter of the 21st century, there is only one genre he’d be working in: the open-world role-playing adventure. Here, he’d have the time and space to weave complex narratives involving dozens of characters and diverse environments. King Lear’s moors would become a desolate explorable wasteland, much like the post-apocalyptic hellscapes of Fallout or Death Stranding; Macbeth’s castle would resemble the haunted dungeons of Elden Ring or The Witcher 3; the Verona of Romeo and Juliet would be a beautiful, troubled take on GTA’s Los Santos. Shakespeare’s major thematic obsessions – war, revenge, madness and the nature of free will – are all major elements in fantasy RPGs; his ability to weave in all classes, from the lowest peasants to the most vainglorious kings, is reflected in the social strata of the great open-world titles. Shakespeare’s histories mixed real-life and fictional characters, as does the Assassin’s Creed series, titles that are also interested in the classic Shakespearean concerns of identity, disguise and illusion.View image in fullscreen‘This castle hath a pleasant seat’ … The Witcher 3, an open-world RPG of the sort that might inspire a reincarnated Bard.Photograph: CD Projekt REDMore broadly, open-world games have the same sort of freewheeling structure and psychological flexibility as Shakespeare’s plays. They have subplots and side quests, they have nonlinear timelines and complicated, morally ambiguous characters; they are expansive and baggy, and wide open to varied interpretation. Vitally, open-world games let the spectator into the narrative as a viewer and an actor; similarly Shakespeare wanted his audiences to be drawn into the action, using asides, quips and monologues to break down the divide between stage and pit. Loud, opinionated and combative, video game players have much more in common with Shakespeare’s Elizabethan audiences than polite modern theatregoers.This potential intersection between Shakespeare and open-world games is quietly gaining traction. A few years ago the RSC employed three artists to considerthe interplay of live theatre with technologyand one of them, the digital artist Adam Clarke, tested ideas for hosting Shakespeare performances within Minecraft. More recently, we saw the brilliant documentaryGrand Theft Hamletabout an attempt to stage Hamlet within Grand Theft Auto during the Covid lockdowns. What, after all, is an open-world online video game if not a technological rendering of Shakespeare’s fundamental philosophy: all the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.What to playView image in fullscreenA captivating strategy sim … Rift Riff.Photograph: Adriaan de JonghIt is always intriguing to see highly recognisable video game genres getting clever reinterpretations.Rift Riffby Dutch game designer Adriaan de Jongh and his small team is a tower defence game like, say, Plants vs. Zombies, except here the landscape is much more open and there are little tactical additions, such as being able to lay down the foundations for new towers before you have gathered the required resources to build them, which makes planning fun and creative.

Rather than other players, they fight a variety of monsters and explore locations lifted directly from the Elden Ring universe. After each match, they also gain upgrade materials to modify future runs and advance the game’s story, similar to a rogue-like game … so it’s a Fortnite/Elden Ring/Hades experience? This is getting complicated.View image in fullscreenRace against time … Elden Ring Nightreign.Photograph: Bandai NamcoEvery session is an engagingly frantic race against time to craft an on-the-fly strategy that takes you across the whole map. Each match is split into three days: on the first two, you pick areas to rush through, besting local bosses to gain minor buffs to your strength or loot weapons with powerful passive abilities, before escaping the rapidly closing ring that saps your health and is sure to end your run. Each night culminates in a larger and far more challenging fight than you’ve faced thus far, amping up the pressure even further.It’s quite the stressful slog, but day three is what you’re battling towards. As the day dawns, you step into a barren arena, ready to face one of several tough-as-nails mega bosses specifically designed to be tackled by multiple players.Nightreign is overwhelmingly designed for three-person teams. Youcanchoose to head out on your own, but doing so is a severe challenge. There’s no one to get you back up if you accidentally die rolling into a boss’s attack, and many of the enemies designed to be tackled by a team of allies frequently overwhelm you.View image in fullscreenBest not to tackle this on your own … Elden Ring Nightreign.Photograph: Bandai NamcoUltimately, this is a game all about momentum. The feeling of pressure as you navigate the world is palpable. Every second, you’re constantly questioning yourself: am I wasting too much time by checking what’s around this corner? Can we take down this boss quickly enough to warrant the reward? It’s an incredibly stimulating experience, as you rush to analyse your equipment and make build-defining decisions on the fly, but so much has been modified for the sake of speed that the nuance typical to FromSoftware games is somewhat lost.There’s no choice of stats when levelling up, for example, with levelling now reduced to the mash of a button when you reach a rest point. And while the world has been painstakingly populated with smaller enemies, beyond taking down a couple in the first few seconds of a run to hit level 2, there’s little point engaging with them, since tackling bosses is the main way to get more powerful.This momentum gives Nightreign its “just one more run” feel, but the pace feels more rapid than necessary, reducing much of the world to a distraction that wastes your precious time. It’s also why the bugs present in the review version we played feel particularly frustrating. Spending five minutes tackling a dragon that then flies through a wall and ends up being untargetable feels particularly unfair.One of the more loathed mechanics from the Dark Souls series is the requirement for you to run back to the boss arena every time you die. When this was updated for Elden Ring, allowing you to respawn right outside the arena, fans rejoiced. Yet the Nightreign experience is such an extreme move back in the other direction that it feels almost Sisyphean. Every run requires you to spend around 35 minutes to reach the final boss, but those bosses often have unique mechanics that can wipe out unsuspecting teams in just a couple of hits. Dying to a new move you’ve not seen before, requiring you to spend another 35 minutes rolling that boulder back up the hill, feels grossly disrespectful.Considering the success of Elden Ring in applying FromSoftware’s dense level design ethos to an open world, it’s disappointing that the developer appears to have missed the mark with Nightreign. Where that game iterated, Nightreign takes shortcuts. It is billed as a standalone release, yet so much environmental content is carbon-copied from Elden Ring – often thrown in haphazardly – that the world feels more like a particularly polished fan-created mod than a whole new title.FromSoftware’s experiment in upending its established gameplay formula is admirable, and taking down gargantuan foes alongside friends really adds to the joy you feel at finally besting what at first felt like an insurmountable task. It’s just a shame that the game’s skewed pacing and overreliance on Elden Ring’s pool of assets so greatly mars the experience.Elden Ring Nightreign is out Friday 30 May; £34.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

Luckily F1 25 – crafted, as ever, in Birmingham by Codemasters – has many. There’s the return of Braking Point, the game’s story mode; a revamp of My Team, the most popular career mode; a tie-up with the forthcoming F1: The Movie; and perhaps most intriguing of all, the chance to race round three tracks in the reverse direction to normal.F1 25 feels like something of a culmination – last year’sF1 24, for example, introduced a new physics model which required tweaks after launch, but has now been thoroughly fettled, so F1 25’s essential building blocks of car handling (and tyre wear) plus state-of-the-art graphics (this year, Codemasters has moved on from previous-gen consoles) are simply impeccable.View image in fullscreenImpeccable graphics … F1 25.Photograph: Electronic ArtsThis has freed the company to delve into the sort of fantasy elements that you can find in games but not real life. Chief among those is the aforementioned third instalment of Braking Point, which follows the fortunes of the fictional Konnersport team. Over 15 chapters it knits together a deliciously tortuous soap opera-style storyline with some cleverly varied on-track action.More fundamentally, the most popular of the career modes – My Team, which ramps up the management element by casting you as the owner of a new team – has received the bulk of Codemasters’ attentions. This time around, you stay in your corporate lane and drive instead as either of the two drivers you’ve hired, which makes much more sense than previously. As does separating research and development, meaning you must allocate new parts to specific drivers. Further effective tweaks render My Team 2.0, as Codemasters calls it, much more convincing and realistic.As ever, you can jump online, against various standards of opposition, or on to individual tracks, or play split-screen against a friend. But there’s a new mode called Challenge Career, which lets you play timed scenarios offline, then post them to a global leaderboard. It’s a nice idea, designed to take you out of your driver-aids comfort zone, but the scenarios will only get going properly after launch, so the jury remains out on its merits. A number of scenarios from F1: The Movie will also be delivered as post-launch episodes, but it’s pretty cool to be able to step into a Formula One car as Brad Pitt playing a fictional racer.For diehard Formula One fans, though, the chance to race around Silverstone, Zandvoort and Austria’s Red Bull Ring in the wrong direction (with the tracks remodelled to accommodate new pit lanes and the like) might just be the clincher. Reversing the tracks’ direction completely changes their nature in a deliciously intriguing manner.With a real-life rule-change next year due to change the cars radically, Formula One currently feels like it’s at a generational peak, and F1 25 is so brilliantly crafted and full of elements that generate an irresistible mix of nailed-on realism and fantasy that it, too, feels like the culmination of a generation of officially licensed Formula One games.

Musically it is very fine indeedTim AshleyWed 28 May 2025 10.32 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 10.33 EDTShareOpera Holland Parkopens this year’s season with a new production of The Flying Dutchman, directed byJulia Burbachand conducted byPeter Selwyn. The company’s first everWagnerstaging, it aims high and doesn’t always succeed, though the best of it, both musically and theatrically, is unquestionably impressive.Burbach essentially stages it as a psychological horror story (which it is), making Eleanor Dennis’s Senta the central protagonist rather than Paul Carey Jones’s charismatic Dutchman, and heightening the opera’s sense of the uncanny by blurring the lines between reality and illusion as she dreams of escaping the normative confines of the world around her.Using both auditorium and stage for her setting, Burbach hauls us into Senta’s vivid imagination. Holland Park theatre’s tarpaulin roof has been extended to form the backdrop for the vertiginous platforms of Naomi Dawson’s set, so we seem to be sitting beneath the unfurling sails of some monstrous ship ourselves. Sailors haul ropes through the aisles and doss down on staircases, while ghostly, faceless figures move wraith-like among the audience.View image in fullscreenVertiginous … The Flying Dutchman by Opera Holland Park.Photograph: Ali WrightNot all of it works. Burbach is strong on Senta’s increasing disquiet at the erratic behaviour of Neal Cooper’s Erik, whose bristling resentment marks him out as potentially abusive. Yet her relationship with her equally dangerous father Daland (Robert Winslade Anderson), who would gladly sell her to the Dutchman for the latter’s wealth, is under-characterised and doesn’t hit home as much as it should. During the overture, Burbach confusingly and unnecessarily fills both stage and auditorium with women who may be Senta’s predecessors in trying to save the Dutchman’s soul. And the ending, deliberately enigmatic as to what redemption might consist of, or indeed whether it is even possible, is anticlimactic after what has gone before.A couple of tweaks to the score are odd – a choral refrain from Senta’s ballad transferred to the close of Act I, and Daland’s crew and the Norwegian women are missing from the final scene. But there are some terrific performances. Dennis, radiant in tone, is outstanding and entirely convincing as a restless visionary in the grip of forces beyond reason. Carey Jones captures the Dutchman’s spiritual and moral anguish with singing of great emotional depth and verbal subtlety. Cooper makes a fiercely intense Erik, less lyrical than some, which works well with Burbach’s view of the character. Winslade Anderson, meanwhile, sounds suave, tellingly masking ambition behind glibness. Conducting a reduced orchestration by Tony Burke, Selwyn took time to settle on opening night, though the gathering tensions and hurtling momentum of the final two acts were superbly done. There was fine playing from the City of London Sinfonia, and theOpera Holland ParkChorus, sensational throughout, have done little finer.Until 14 JuneExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicOpera Holland ParkreviewsShareReuse this content"

Either way, the latest instalment of the Barbican’s celebrations for the centenary of20th-century musical giant Pierre BoulezfeaturingEnsemble intercontemporain(his own crack team for new music) drew only a paltry audience. The man himself was dismissive of such difficulties: “You always find 200 fanatics,” he once observed. “What is important is to increase the number.” (Composer, conductor, visionary – but Boulez was no PR maven.)The fanatics, at least, were there – though they hadn’t come for Boulez himself, if the polite response to a thrillingly anarchic performance of his Sur Incises after the interval was anything to go by. Under rising-star conductorNicolò Umberto Foron, its moments of freefall reverberation were a delicious release from the ultra-precise rhythmic flurries of three pianos, thunderous in their lower register.Instead, it was the first half that generated excitement: a taut, intensely focused performance ofshouting forever into the receiver, for which British composerHannah Kendallwon an Ivor Novello award in 2023, followed by the world premiere of composer, saxophonist and bandleaderCassie Kinoshi’s [Untitled].Kendall’s piece is a haunting exploration of Cuban writer Antonio Benítez-Rojo’s concept of the “Plantation Machine”. Much of the finely textured score functions as pitched white noise around crackly walkie-talkie speech in French and English. At its most memorable moment, the orchestral instruments fall silent, leaving only music boxes cranking out extracts of classical hits and harmonicas producing vivid note-clusters on every exhalation like an ethereal musical life-support machine.Kinoshi’s [Untitled] was a noisier, funkier affair, incorporating virtuosic live turntabling byNikNak, whose whirlwind scratches cut deeply across the orchestra’s dense textures, as well as video by French artistJulien Creuzetand solo choreography fromtyroneisaacstuart. Musically, it was exquisitely paced. Momentum gathered through the hefty bass of lower strings, fiendish trumpet curlicues were picked up by a cello screaming high up the fingerboard and two flutes combined in a moreish, barline-defying groove. At the heady climax, the orchestra was suddenly cut, leaving only a symphony of squelches, echoes and loops from the turntable, spinning out overhead.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicPierre BoulezreviewsShareReuse this content"

When the idea of the opera was first mooted, Wagner’s great-granddaughter Eva approved it, “as long as Cosima doesn’t come out of it very well”. She doesn’t, almost no one does, and certainly not the extraordinary and appalling figure of Houston Chamberlain.Chamberlainis so little known that he could be a figment of librettists Lutz Hübner and Sarah Nemitz’s imagination, yet the opera’s historical veracity is impeccable. The English Germanophile, a failed scientist and admirer of Wagner, inveigled his way into Cosima’s household, eventually marrying Wagner’s daughter Eva. He was, through his writings on German supremacy, a crucial architect of the antisemitism and hatred that Kaiser Wilhelm II and Adolf Hitler admired and upheld.View image in fullscreenAn authentic piece … Avner Dorman’s Wahnfried.Photograph: Matthew Williams-EllisFrom the outset, when Chamberlain appears as a naive and ridiculous bumbler who believes that the order of the world is for the strong to kill the weak, the tenor of the narrative is chilling and deeply disquieting, despite moments of clowning black humour. As Dorman observed at the time of the world premiere in Germany in 2017, the same horrors are being perpetrated in the world today – and so much ignored – making Longborough Festival Opera’s UK premiere and director Polly Graham’s brilliant production important and all the braver.The irony in the opera’s title is implicit. Wagner named his home inBayreuth, Bavaria, Wahnfried, meaning free from delusion, but this is a portrait of madness writ large against a background of blood-red velvet drapes. The deluded fervour first of the Wagnerites and then of Mark Le Brocq’s Chamberlain – simply a tour de force – is monstrous. Le Broq andSusan Bullock’s imperious Cosima are a hateful pair, their philosophy of hate for the Jews carefully delineated. It’s Chamberlain who pushes Cosima to banish her daughter Isolde, spirited into a Tardis-like box with the demand that she reimagine herself in keeping with the true Wagner ethos; he too insists on her brother Siegfried’s homosexuality being hidden. Andrew Watts’s impassioned aria to his lover is a focal point, while the picture of Siegfried’s hardly idyllic marriage to Winifred Williams – the better known figure here for her insidious cosying up to Hitler, sung by the formidable Alexandra Lowe – is a further marker of the authenticity of the piece.View image in fullscreenImpeccable stagecraft … Susan Bullock as Cosima with Mark Le Brocq as Houston Chamberlain.Photograph: Matthew Williams-EllisWritten in 20 scenes, each setting flagged up on a small blackboard, the driving energy of the second of two acts is the more convincing. Dorman’s music, multifaceted in its references – Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Wagner himself – is incisive, with often brittle instrumentation, and dynamically paced by conductor Justin Brown. The impeccable stagecraft carries the evening, but there are two characters who haunt Chamberlain to inject a further dimension. Hermann Levi – the Jew who conducted the Bayreuth premiere of Parsifal, the opera that became core to the family wrangling – is sympathetically portrayed, embracing the terrible and ever-present contradictions, perhaps an alter ego for Dorman. But it is the mischievous figure of Oskar McCarthy’s Wagner-Daemon, the composer’s familiar after death, whose disapproval brings a lighter note. It’s his final judgment that Chamberlain, who aspired to be counted alongside Kant, Goethe and Wagner himself, will – like all Wagner’s heroes – ultimately be a failure. It was Dorman, taking a bow at the curtain call, who was greeted as a hero.Until 14 JuneExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

In a culture of lookism, being seen is understood as tantamount to existing, even to survival. But being seen is complicated. Both the current exhibitions at Autograph grapple with this through photographs by two women of the same generation working in portraiture.Eileen Perrier’s A Thousand Small Stories occupies the ground-floor gallery. Since the 1990s, Perrier’s work has centred on setting up temporary photographic studios, in homes, hair salons, on the streets of Brixton and Peckham in London, and at a metro station in Paris. Her 2009 exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in London displayed large-format Polaroid portraits taken in pop-up studios at Petticoat Lane market and in the nearby 23-storey tower block Denning Point. The travelling portrait studio has been a device Perrier has used for 30 years, to take photography into diverse communities and tackle the politics of beauty and identity. This is the first survey of her work.View image in fullscreenClose-up … from the series Red, Gold and Green, 1996-1997 by Eileen Perrier.Photograph: Eileen Perrier/© Eileen Perrier. Courtesy the artist and Autograph, LondonPerrier makes portraits that don’t rely on beauty but find it everywhere. She doesn’t flatter – in fact the lighting and poses in her pictures in some series are direct references to school photographs, such as Grace (2000) in which her subjects, including the photographer and her mother, share the physical trait diastema (a gap between the teeth). Perrier’s subjects are mostly regular people, commuters, passersby. In these quick encounters with ordinary lives, Perrier gives glimpses of beauty where you don’t look for it.An image of two women on a leather chesterfield, from the series Red, Gold and Green (made between 1996 and 1997 in the homes of three generations of British Ghanaians), scintillates with shining confidence, from the women’s style to the polished ceramics gleaming on the dresser behind them. The makeshift red cloth Perrier has hung up behind them is a reminder that this is a studio, too, where an unexpected moment of beauty, through the alchemy of the camera, becomes an eternity.There’s an unresolved paradox in Perrier’s pictures, between the artifice of beauty and the photographer’s constant quest to find it. Perrier acknowledges this, between celebrating beauty and critiquing it, right from the start of her career. One of the earliest works in the show belongs to her documentary portrait series, Afro Hair andBeautyShow. Between 1998 and 2003, Perrier photographed women attending the annual show at Alexandra Palace, one of the venue’s biggest events of the time.It’s a document of evolving styles, creativity and the importance of self-expression through hair. While making the portraits, Perrier also began collecting and photographing products for black hair and skin from London shops and photographing them. She turned these grooming goods into a wallpaper that also charts a controversial side of the beauty industry: Dear Heart promises skin lightening, hair relaxant for children is marketed as Beautiful Beginnings.View image in fullscreenUnravelling self-image … from the series Belonging and Beyond, 2025, by Dianne Minnicucci.Photograph: © Dianne Minnicucci, courtesy the artistPerrier is positioned through this show as an important counter to a Photoshopped, retouched reality, in a culture of beauty and image worship. Upstairs Dianne Minnicucci’s small exhibition of new works – made as part of a residency funded by Autograph – picks up on the impact of white-centric beauty standards on women of colour. Minnicucci confesses to not being comfortable in front of the camera herself – she has portrayed her family and domestic scenes with an intimate, autobiographical tenor but had never ventured in front of the lens herself.Her show, Belonging and Beyond, is about a personal struggle with self-image, compounded by photography, and now using photography as a means to unravel and understand it. Like Perrier, Minnicucci began by dismantling and reconstructing her studio – bringing it into the classroom of Thomas Tallis school, south-east London, where she is head of photography. Working alongside her students for six months, inviting them into the work as collaborators, Minnicucci was forced to practise what she’d preached – to embrace discomfort.A series of wistful black and white self-portraits sees Minnicucci try to break through this awkward confrontation, all of them shot in Lesnes Abbey Woods. We see her figuring out what to do with her body, her hands, her gaze. Half-masked by spiky shrubs and trees, thesepictures have a quiet, self-conscious grace. Minnicucci dressed in white in this misty atmosphere looks shyly away from the camera, tentative, uncertain. This is not really about the images but what the process reveals. In a film accompanying the images, Minnicucci realises where her trepidation in taking self-portraits as a black woman might come from: “Because I haven’t been exposed to those images, maybe that’s why?”Eileen Perrier’s A Thousand Small Stories, and Dianne Minnicucci’s Belonging and Beyond areboth at Autograph, London, until 13 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsPhotographyArtBeautyBritish identity and societyreviewsShareReuse this content"

I think that is all I have to say for now.”Ngũgĩ explored the troubled legacy of colonialism through essays, plays and novels including Weep Not, Child (1964), Devil on the Cross (1980) and Wizard of the Crow (2006). Considera giant of the modern African pantheon, he had been a favourite for the Nobel prize in literature for years. After missing out on the prize in 2010 to Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa, Ngũgĩsaid he was less disappointedthan the photographers who had gathered outside his home: “I was the one who was consoling them!”Born in 1938, whileKenyawas under British colonial rule, Ngũgĩ was one of 28 children, born to a father with four wives. He lived through the Mau Mau uprising as a teenager, during which the authorities imprisoned, abused and tortured tens or even hundreds of thousands of people. During the conflict, Ngũgĩ’s father – one of the Gikuyu, Kenya’s largest ethnic group – was forced off his land, and two of his brothers were killed.This struggle formed the backdrop to the novel that made his name: Weep Not, Child. Published in 1964, just a year after Kenya gained independence, it tells the story of the education of Njoroge, the first of his family to go to school, and how his life is thrown into turmoil by the events which surround him.Ngugi wa Thiong’o: ‘I don’t think we were meant to come out alive’Read moreA series of novels, including short stories and plays followed, as Ngũgĩ became a lecturer in English literature at Nairobi University. There he argued that the English department should be renamed, and shift its focus to literature around the world. “If there is need for a ‘study of the historic continuity of a single culture’, why can’t this be African?” he wrote in a paper. “Why can’t African literature be at the centre so that we can view other cultures in relationship to it?”In 1977, he published his fourth novel, Petals of Blood, and a play, The Trial of Dedan Kimathi, which dealt with the troubled legacy of the Mau Mau uprising, but it was his co-authoring of a play written in Gikuyu, I Will Marry When I Want, which led to his arrest and imprisonment in Mamiti maximum security prison.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Daniel A. Anderson“In prison I began to think in a more systematic way about language,”he told the Guardian in 2006. “Why was I not detained before, when I wrote in English?” He decided from then on to write in Gikuyu, that “the only language I could use was my own”.Released in 1978, exile followed in 1982, when the author learned of a plot to kill him upon his return from a trip to Britain to promote his novel Caitani Mutharabaini, translated as Devil on the Cross. He later moved from the UK to the US, where he worked as a professor of English and comparative literature at the University of California, Irvine, and headed its International Centre for Writing and Translation.Ngũgĩ continued to write in Gikuyu, despite his troubled connection with his homeland; an arrest warrant was issued for the fictional main character of his 1986 novel Matigari, which was also banned in Kenya. Returning to Nairobi with his wife Njeeri for the first time in 2004, two years after the death of Daniel arap Moi, Ngũgĩ was greeted by crowds at the airport. But during the trip,men wielding guns broke into their apartment, raping Njeeri and beating Ngũgĩ when he tried to intervene. “I don’t think we were meant to come out alive,”he told the Guardiantwo years later.His novel Wizard of the Crow,translated by the author into English in 2006, returned to the subject of African kleptocracy, being set in the imaginary dictatorship of the Free Republic of Aburiria. He said the “most beautiful sentence in the entire novel” was “a translation from Gikuyu by the author”.He continued totranslate his own works from Gikuyu, and was nominated for the international Booker prize in 2021 for his epic novel-in-verse The Perfect Nine. He was the prize’s first nominee writing in an indigenous African language and the first author to be nominated for their own translation.Ngũgĩ had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1995 and underwent triple heart bypass surgery in 2019.Ngũgĩ had nine children, four of whom are authors: Tee Ngũgĩ, Mũkoma wa Ngũgĩ, Nducu wa Ngũgĩ, and Wanjiku wa Ngũgĩ.“Resistance is the best way of keeping alive,”he said to the Guardian in 2018. “It can take even the smallest form of saying no to injustice.

It’s not just the setting but the rare joy of seeing a majority-Black audience and roster at a literary event. It’s a festival infused with the magic and fire born of resistance.James was one of many authors who shared that, were it not for the festival, he wouldn’t be the literary giant he is today. It was after one of Calabash’s now-legendary open mic sessions that he secured his first publishing deal. No surprise, then, that people waited in snaking lines, some for well over an hour, to get their three minutes on the mic.View image in fullscreenLudicrously picturesque … the view from Jakes hotel, Treasure Beach.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyFor festival-goers, one of the most anticipated readings of the weekend was from Safiya Sinclair’s National Book Critics Circle award-winningHow to Say Babylon– on home soil for the first time. Her book chronicles growing up in 80s and 90s Jamaica as a Rastafarian girl, and she read a haunting passage about deliberately stepping on a rusty nail after being ostracised at school. This was at a time when the legacy of Jamaica’s first prime minister Alexander Bustamante, and his infamous 1963 command to “Bring in all Rastas, dead or alive” still loomed.The Calabash literary festival was founded in 2001 by poet Kwame Dawes, novelist Colin Channer, and producer Justine Henzell (whose family own and run Jakes, the beachfront hotel where the festival is hosted). What began as a small event in Jakes’ lobby with only 150 guests now attracts thousands, a quarter of a century later. And, unlike most literary festivals, Calabash is completely free to attend. “Passion is the only price of entry,” its website states – though adds that “voluntary contributions are welcomed”.The festival’s allure is undeniably amplified by its ludicrously picturesque setting: piercing blue skies, crashing waves and endless rays of sunshine frame the stage from which authors speak. If you thought Treasure Beach a sleepy town full of beach bums, fishers, locals and ex-corporate types who have traded in their careers for psychedelic retreats, you wouldn’t be entirely wrong. But as the festival begins, a rebellious spirit is ushered in. The weekend’s format is simple: readings arranged around specific themes, punctuated by a handful of headline talks.The crowd at Calabash is a world unto itself, made up of authors and book lovers from across the Caribbean, as well as from the UK, US, Canada and South Africa. A new wave of influencers were also in attendance, including prominent bookstagrammers like Trinidad-based @bookofcinz and South Africa’s @pretty_x_bookish, who now play an increasingly important role in elevating Caribbean and diasporic literature.View image in fullscreenInfused with the magic and fire … audience members at the 2025 Calabash literary festival.Photograph: Calabash literary festivalStandout sessions from the weekend includedCaleb Femi, a former young people’s poet laureate and the author of Poor. He brought south-east London to Calabash with four poems from his sophomore collection The Wickedest – a portrait of one party night told through the eyes of flirtatious guests, unwanted intruders and their fearless leader. Laughter echoed throughout. Danez Smith, author of Homie and Don’t Call Us Dead, read work that could melt even the coldest of hearts – opening with a tribute to the gully queens (Jamaica’s trans community), thanking their lesbian friends for teaching them how to love, and sharing poetry in the form of a love letter to their formidable grandmother. Mary-Alice Daniel gave perhaps the most brilliantly absurd reading of the weekend, sharing surreal poems and a hilarious piece of prose about the loss of her toe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

On Friday and Saturday, the festival turned into a party, with live performances and DJs that didn’t start until midnight. And Sunday afternoon closed with a moving celebration of the 50th anniversary of Burning Spear’s album Marcus Garvey, a tribute to the power of roots reggae as a form of cultural memory and resistance.Over dinner that final night, there were discussions about how such a small island has managed to have a gargantuan, global cultural footprint, especially within the world of literature. Dawes, one of the organisers, pointed to Jamaica’s history of rebellion, including the largest of slave uprisings, as the root of its spiritual and creative fire.“Jamaica was the site of the most virulent practices of the transatlantic chattel slavery,” Dawes says. “While we can speak of the negative legacy of this truth we can also speak of the restorative and inventive power of resistance and rebellion [that has] allowed this small population of 2.5 million people to have an absurdly outside global impact as a culture.”“Despite the hardships of history,” he adds, “there is a necessary confidence that is part of the Jamaican spirit.”The nextCalabash literary festivalwill take place in 2027Explore more on these topicsBooksJamaicaFestivalsMarlon JamesIan McEwanPoetryFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Insiders and regulars like KT Tunstall explain why the live music venue is so loved by audience and artistsRachel KeenanWed 28 May 2025 06.21 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 06.22 EDTShare‘Lewis Capaldi said to me recently: ‘All I ever wanted was to get my name on the steps at King Tut’s,’” says Judith Atkinson, one half of the couple behind the music venue that has long been where Glaswegians find their new favourite band.Celebrating 35 years this year, King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut was whereOasiswere discovered by Alan McGee and soon signed to his record label Creation. The Verve and Radiohead played in the same two-week period as that gig in 1993, while Manic Street Preachers, Florence + the Machine and entire scenes of Scottish alternative music have got a leg up there since. “When I was growing up you didn’t dream about playing Glastonbury – but you dream about playing King Tut’s, the thing that’s within your reach,” says Scottish singer-songwriterKT Tunstall. “It’s such a big deal.”Small music venues like this have been in crisis since the pandemic due to rising costs for rent and utilities – according to the Music Venue Trust, 125 grassroots venues permanently closed in 2023, the worst year on record, followed by another 25 in 2024. And yet, thanks in part to a live music empire the owners have built around it, King Tut’s is thriving, despite only having space for 300 people.View image in fullscreenA step up … the stairs at King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut.Photograph: PRStuart Clumpas, who founded the venue in 1990 alongside his wife Atkinson, reckons it has something to do with Glasgow’s dismal climate. “Scotland is an indoor entertainment society because of the weather,” he says. “The only way to go, ‘Hey I’m going to go out for a night’ and be guaranteed it’s going to happen and work is to go to something indoors.”He remembers that fabled Oasis night, when the band drove from Manchester to try their luck and play an already-filled support slot. From the bouncer almost not letting them in, to venue staff refusing to let them perform, each story is different. Clumpas sets the record straight: “It was another support band who said they can’t play, not us,” he says. “They went, ‘Fuck off, it’s too small a stage.’ You can’t put three drumkits on the stage the size of King Tut’s.” But Oasis did manage to perform, and the rest is history.Another legendary band would never have been booked, though, if it was up to Atkinson and not venue booker Geoff Ellis. “He kept booking this band calledRadioheadand they only ever did 150 people,” Atkinson says, “I remember saying to him: ‘Why do you keep booking that bloody Radiohead, Geoff?’ That’s why I’m not a booker!”But Atkinson’s experience in promoting gigs meant she was well placed to spot local up and coming artists, including future indie legendsBelle and Sebastian. “They used to come in a lot and hang out,” she says, and the band once struck up an impromptu live set in the pub area below the main venue. “They were playing Boy With the Arab Strap and the whole pub was sitting at their tables jiggling to this song. I just went: wow, we’re in a scene!”Blur got much shorter shrift. “I do likeBlurnow, I’m very fond of them. But they played King Tut’s when they’d been tipped to be the next big thing. They were so obnoxious because they were on the front cover of all the magazines that week – they were so full of it. I was only in my mid-20s but I was able to be like, ‘Guys, you’re going to meet the same people on the way down as the way up.’ They came back and played about six months later and their tail was between their legs. God, they were polite.”View image in fullscreen‘You dream about playing King Tut’s’ … KT Tunstall.Photograph: Eoin CareyWhen you enter King Tut’s, history surrounds you. Downstairs in the pub the walls are adorned with memorabilia from gigs past, and on the stairs up to the venue each step shows an artist and the year they played. Tunstall has her name painted on the 2005 step next to Simple Minds, Arctic Monkeys and Texas. “It’s definitely one of the proudest notches on my belt,” she says.That gig was around when her debut album Eye to the Telescope was released – the next year, she received three Brit nominations, winning for British female solo artist. She reckons the venue’s success comes down to the kind treatment she received from the owners, along with the sound quality. “Your job on stage is to just try and whip up that energy to the point where everybody feels extremely present and connected to each other, and at some venues it’s hard to do that,” she says. “But at King Tut’s, you’re halfway there already. Thank God they don’t freshly paint it every three years – it’s like all the energy is kind of soaked into the walls in that place.”Another Scot,Nina Nesbitt, says “it feels like a moment when you go there” to play – her first time was in 2013, the year before her debut album Peroxide (a Scottish chart topper). “Touring at that [grassroots] level is really difficult mentally and physically,” she says. “You’re not really getting much sleep and you’re sitting in dressing rooms with no windows, and it’s quite depressing. The shows are amazing, but everything else is tough. Sometimes you don’t evenhavea dressing room.” But at King Tut’s, “they really do take care of their artists. They have a lovely little dressing room, I think they have fairy lights in it. Little things go a long way, and put you in a good mood for the show.”View image in fullscreen‘There’s just a real vibe about the place’ … Courteeners performing in 2015.Photograph: Ross Gilmore/Redferns/Getty ImagesGeneral manager Davie Millar says he is still visited by famous faces who have made it big since their King Tut’s debut. Liam Gallagher set the video for his single Come Back to Me at the venue – Millar has a cameo – and the 1975 “just popped in for a drink” recently. “There’s just a real vibe about the place. Bands like Manic Street Preachers and the Killers who played here many years ago, it’s a real privilege for them to say ‘yeah, we’d love to come back and play’.”As well as its famous patrons, King Tut’s has benefited from being a small part of a much bigger operation. Clumpas, the founder, and Ellis, the booker, founded Scottish festival T in the Park in 1994 as a joint venture between DF Concerts – Clumpas’s entertainment business he started in Dundee in the 80s – and Tennent’s Lager (it later became TRNSMT festival). After Ellis took over as chief executive of DF Concerts in 2001, Live Nation acquired a majority stake in 2008 – all of which means that King Tut’s has a financial security that is rare for a grassroots venue.‘The whole ecosystem is collapsing’: inside the crisis in Britain’s live music sceneRead moreIt’s also unique in that it doesn’t have outside promoters putting on their own gigs: all the booking are still done in house. Millar clearly sees all that as a privilege, too: “We’re just going to keep doing what we’re doing: continually finding artists, giving them a platform to be able to create and share their art.” He says the fundamentals won’t change – “People buy tickets because they love coming to live shows” – so what’s next? “Another 35 years. I truly believe that.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockGlasgowMusic industryIndieScotlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The beach dress – specifically designed to turn your swimsuit into an outfit you can wear to lunch – is a wardrobe category that didn’t really exist until about a decade ago. I mean, obviously, it was not unknown to wear your bikini as undies en route to the beach. But this was a DIY form of outfit-wrangling, a way of fudging the awkward transition from swimwear to actual clothes without resorting to changing underneath a towel. The vibe was lo-fi: a sarong, an oversized T-shirt, wriggling out of a wet one-piece to avoid a damp patch where you sit on your dress.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The new beach dress is not remotely lo-fi, no sir. It is, in fact, summer fashion’s most glamorous category. Walk on to any shopfloor and you will find a world bedazzled by dresses that have cocktail-hour detailing but are intended to be worn on a beach. The sunlounger is to this decade what the bar stool was to the 00s: the place to showcase your hottest looks.What has changed? Our attitude to tanning has a lot to do with it. The idea of a beach cover-up made no sense, back when a deep all-over tan was the plan. When I was in my 20s, I didn’t always bother packing the top half of my bikini for holidays, sunbathing being a serious business and very much a scanty knicks-only affair. A beach cover-up? I would have been genuinely puzzled by the concept. Yes reader, I was an idiot.View image in fullscreenMaximum coverage. Brigitte Bardot in a colourful T-shirt dress in Saint Tropez in 1974.Photograph: Jack Garofalo/Paris Match/Getty ImagesBut something else has changed, too. Going on holiday – which used to be a time when you disappeared off-radar to eat ice-cream, snooze and not wear any makeup – has become a Lifestyle Moment. Because of social media, but also the pandemic, which snatched travel from us for a year or two, making lots of people realise how much those two weeks mattered to them. Holidays have become a time to dress up. Lots of retailers have told me over the past few years that their customers will cut back on spending elsewhere, but prioritise buying new holiday pieces.There are all kinds of ways to cover up on the beach. I will always love a kaftan. The sarong is having a comeback, if that’s your thing. An oversized cotton shirt looks chic with a baseball cap or a sunhat. There is even such a thing as “beach pyjamas”, although now that airline prices have pushed many of us into a hand luggage-only era, I’m sceptical that these will prove themselves worthy of the space they take up in your case, unless you wear them as bedtime pyjamas as well, which feels a little scuzzy to me, but you do you.Your swimwear serves both as a kind of petticoat, concealing your modesty, and as an accessory, bringing the dramaBut the hero piece of this season is the main-character-energy beach dress. This is a dress that compliments your swimwear, rather than concealing it. It will be in an openwork crochet or loose-weave knit, so your bikini or one-piece is visible in the gaps; or it will be in a sheer lace or tissue-thin cheesecloth, so that what you are wearing beneath shows through. Either way, your swimwear serves both as a kind of petticoat, concealing your modesty, and an accessory, bringing the drama.This is going to seem obvious, but at the risk of sounding like a broken record: you need to try this on. When you look at an image of an influencer in a crochet dress, what your eye sees is the body; but remember, you are buying the dress not the abs. What it looks like on some teenager, who is probably AI anyway, is neither here nor there.View image in fullscreenPeek-a-boo. At Ralph Lauren’s spring/summer ‘25 show, white crochet dresses offered just a glimpse of skin.That’s my main tip. Apart from that: sleeves can be more useful than you think – they help you feel dressed – but a shorter hemline is more practical than floor-length. A knit or a crinkled cheesecloth will pack well without needing to be ironed. White looks great over dark or colourful swimwear, but a dark dress is practical for when you sit on a grubby sea wall waiting for a taxi or whatever. How to accessorise? Sunnies, a book and an ice-cream. Some things never change.Model: Teesta at Milk. Styling: Melanie Wilkinson. Hair and makeup: Delilah Blakeney using Nars. Styling assistant: Sam Deaman.

But it took going to meet other fans to help me find my self-confidence – and my tribeSarah DeenWed 28 May 2025 01.55 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 06.31 EDTShare‘You need to listen to this,” said my friend Helen over her birthday lunch in 2018. “Have you ever heard ofK-pop?” I hadn’t – I didn’t know it was short for Korean pop music, or about K-pop “idols” (stars). She played me songs by the South Korean boyband SHINee and I was instantly captivated. It reminded me of the pop music I loved in the 00s, when I was growing up: the bombastic music videos, the repetitive electro-pop hooks, the bands where each member has a distinct role, like a family. It was pure escapism.Gradually, I started listening to more and more K-pop, until I took the plunge and did something I’d previously dismissed as “cringe”. With my twin sister, Hannah, I went to a K-pop-themed “cafe event” at the Gaza cafe in Soho, London. The get-together marked the birthdays of three members of the boyband GOT7. Their music videos played on TV screens and their album sleeves were displayed on the stairwell walls. Mounds of bingsoo – a Korean shaved-ice dessert – were served.I was surprised to find that the cafe event drew a relatively mixed crowd – including other Black girls, like me. I’d expected to stick out and felt apprehensive that I might leave feeling ostracised from a scene I’d come to adore. But everyone was friendly and welcoming, and we quickly bonded over our shared – albeit niche – interest. Growing up, I was often preoccupied by what other people thought of me; here, no one seemed to care.View image in fullscreenTight-knit … Sarah Deen (second left), pictured with (from left) Shari, Tasha, Hannah and Helen in London.Photograph: Sarah DeenAs a teenager, I often felt I stood out, despite my best efforts to blend in. By the time I reached my 20s, I was an overweight, dark-skinned “four-eyes”, and acutely aware of it. As a result, I did everything I could to make myself seem smaller: I wore dark clothes, pinned every strand of my afro hair flat to my head and hardly spoke at work. Yet at the K-pop party, Black girls wore bright makeup, band T-shirts and big smiles as they shared homemade photocards (trading cards, a little like football stickers), swapped badges and squealed when their favourite tracks were played.From there, my K-pop obsession began to snowball. I started listening to boybands such as MONSTA X, BTS and EXO, then girl groups such as Mamamoo and Dreamcatcher. Helen and I, friends since secondary school, launched a K-pop podcast called UK-pop (get it?). The fashion rubbed off on me too: black clothes stopped dominating my wardrobe as I added a red mohair scarf here, a Lucozade-orange balaclava there; I even bought a bomber jacket with pink flamingos all over it. I got silver braids in my hair and wore all my ear piercings at once – something I’d previously avoided, in case it looked “too much”. I spent more than £400 on concerts, including a £160 ticket to see GOT7 at Wembley Arena which included “hi-touch”, where you high-five the group on the way out of the venue (I can distinctly remember my cologne-scented palm afterwards).Being a K-pop fan bled into my then job as a journalist; I interviewed idols and reviewed concerts. Other Black women who were into K-pop contacted me on social media, including Tasha and Shari, who became good friends offline. With my sister and Helen, we all began meeting up regularly to discuss the latest K-pop news, gigs we’d been to and idol scandals. We went for food at Korean barbecue restaurants, and went to K-pop exhibitions, films and festivals.View image in fullscreenSouth Korean boy band ATEEZ at the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Berlin in 2023.Photograph: Booba Photography / KQ EntertainmentI had finally found my tribe, a group of friends I could message day or night about anything – not just K-pop – and feel completely supported. In the decade since I first encountered K-pop culture, we’ve remained a tight-knit group, encouraging each other through new jobs, moving houses, family bereavements and many other big life decisions. We plan to visit Seoul together in the next couple of years – my last visit was in 2019, where my sister and I spent an afternoon going to see the headquarters of K-pop labels including SM Entertainment and JYP.Although my K-pop obsession isn’t as intense as it was, an ATEEZ concert in January reminded me of why I fell in love with it so hard. Yes, I enjoy the music, but it’s also down to the warm, funny people K-pop has brought into my orbit, close friends who have encouraged me to let my guard down.I’m now in my 30s and I still aspire to be more like the carefree girls in bright makeup I met at the Gaza cafe all those years ago. I’ve learned that people are not nearly as judgmental as I once feared – and if they are, so what? As K-pop megastars BTS would say: you can’t stop me loving myself.Explore more on these topicsK-popA moment that changed mePop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The irresistible lure of sunkissed skin has long been a summer staple – and from tanning waters to wipes, instant tans to gradual tanning moisturisers, there are now more ways than ever to get a faux glow.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There’s also been a growing demand for multitasking beauty products, so the newest fake tan formulas often add skincare benefits alongside the bronze. Self-tans infused with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and vitamin C hydrate, nourish and protect much like your usual body cream or facial serum.As with all skincare, there’s no one-size-fits-all; what works for you very much depends on your skin tone and type, not to mention the time you have to perfect your glow. While clear tanning waters and fast-drying mousses are great for developing a golden tan overnight, you can find even more express options in the form of serums or drops, so you can float into the office just a few hours later with a post-holiday-worthy glow.Then there are the gradual tanners – the hydrating moisturising lotions that reign supreme in the world of the budget self-tan. These are great for beginners, letting you build your glow slowly – apply Monday to Friday, and by the weekend you’ll have beautifully bronzed skin. To help you pick, I tested my way through the noise to find the products that will give you a seamless sunkissed colour.The best mascaras for longer, fuller and fluttery lashes: 10 favourites worn and rated by our beauty expertRead moreAt a glanceBest fake tan overall:Bare by Vogue Williams clear tan water£22.50 for 150ml at DebenhamsBest budget fake tan:Boots Glow tanning milk£6 for 300ml at BootsBest fake tan drops:Caudalíe Self-Tan sun drops£19 for 15ml at John LewisBest fake tan for mature skin:St Tropez Luxe body serum£12.50 for 200ml at AmazonBest gradual tan:This Works Perfect Legs gradual tan£33.60 for 150ml at John LewisBest fake tan with a mitt:Bali Body Deep Violet self-tanning mousse£37 for 200ml at Bali BodyWhy you should trust meI’m an experienced beauty and lifestyle journalist who’s reviewed and written about everything from LED masks and beauty blenders to mascaras and moisturisers – but I still fear applying fake tan. I love the sunkissed look, though, so gradual tanning moisturisers and drops have become my go-to, and I’ve pretty much tried them all in my quest to replicate that holiday glow at home. I’m also the busy mother of two young boys, so everything in my skincare routine needs to work without fuss. In short, if I’ve found these products foolproof, then I’m sure most others will too.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I spritzed, sprayed and slathered myself in more than 20 self-tan products’: our writer with the This Works Perfect Legs gradual tan.Photograph: Danielle WilkinsI’ve used some of the clear tanning waters, serums, mousses, gradual tanning lotions, facial tanning drops and self-tan wipes included here for years (and retested for this piece), while others are new formulas that hit the mark in my testing.With so many fake tan products out there – many of which perform well – it was difficult to whittle this edit down to the 10 best. I spritzed, sprayed and slathered myself in more than 20 self-tan products over five weeks (seriously, my exfoliating mitt has never seen so much action), considering everything from ease of application to colour payoff and staying power, while also noting each product’s texture, fragrance and cost. These are my top recommendations.The best fake tan for sunkissed skinView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Danielle WilkinsBest fake tan overall:Bare by Vogue Williams clear tan waterView image in fullscreen£22.50 for 150ml at Debenhams£23 for 150ml at BootsBare by Vogue Williams’ tanning products have garnered hundreds of five-star reviews since launching in 2019. And when the clear tan water, one of its bestsellers, can take you from winter ravaged to suitably summer in as little as four hours, it’s easy to see why.Why we love itI loved this winning formula’s light and subtle scent and, rather surprisingly, it was also one of the most hydrating.

This one is definitely for the tanning enthusiasts who want to take their glow to the next level.The mousse glides on effortlessly with the mitt and takes just minutes to absorb into the skin.

Exfoliate with a salt scrub and moisturise 24 hours in advance to create a hydrated base for your tan. This will help prevent a patchy finish and ensure your tan goes the distance. You should also do any hair removal 24 hours before tanning to give your skin time to recover.“Typically, a fake tan will last about five to seven days,” says Lansley. “Moisturising daily with an oil-free moisturiser – this is important, as oil will break down the tan – will keep the skin hydrated and prolong your tan. Avoid chlorine and taking long baths.”Should you moisturise before fake tan?Moisturising skin after exfoliating is vital before applying fake tan. “It will prevent your skin from becoming dehydrated and scaly,” says Lansley. “Moisturising also prevents the tan from clinging to dry patches, so pay close attention to areas such as knees, elbows and ankles 24 hours before you tan.”How to remove fake tanThe best way to lift a fake tan is to exfoliate gently and use a dedicated fake tan remover. These usually include exfoliating acids such as salicylic acid to gently break down the tanning agents and smooth the skin.And to avoid those tell-tale orange palms? “Always wear a mitt when you’re self-tanning, and wash your hands thoroughly after use,” says Lansley.Danielle Wilkins is alifestyle journalist and formermagazine editor with almost two decades of experience writing about beauty, parenting and all things weddings for some of the biggest names in publishing.

It’s the sort of cooking that feels generous but effortless; everything simmers away in one big pan, and produces a sauce that’s rich and thick from the potato starch but lemony and fresh-tasting, too. I also often find myself craving an entire cucumber for lunch, so I love today’s salad for its simplicity and for its big flavours. I really enjoy writing recipes that I believe people will come back to again and again, and I think this is definitely one of those.Olive oil and lemon-poached fish with grated courgette salad (pictured top)I love serving this with a simple courgette salad to cut through the richness, as well as a dollop of creme fraiche, if you fancy it. This is a perfect lunch or dinner when you want things to feel a bit special without any drama. I haven’t added any extra herbs, so the dish has a cleaner flavour, but if you’d like to add some parsley, chives or mint, they’d be a great addition.Prep10 minCook30 minServes4150mlextra-virgin olive oil2 bay leaves, or a few thyme sprigs1 lemon, 2-3 slices cut off, the rest juiced, plus extra lemon wedges to serveSea salt and black pepper4–5 medium cyprus potatoes, or 400g new potatoes –I peel them, so they have that clean, waxy texture, but if you prefer them unpeeled, that’s fine, too6 small banana shallots,peeled and trimmed4 thick sustainably-sourced cod fillets, or hake, haddock or any firm white fish2 courgettesCreme fraiche, to serve (optional)Pour the olive oil and 600ml water into a wide, high-sided pan (about 28cm), then add the bay leaves, a few slices of lemon and a good pinch of salt. Slice the potatoes into 1½cm-thick coins, halve the shallots lengthways, then drop them into the pan, too.Bring to a gentle boil and cook for eight to 10 minutes, until the potatoes and shallots are just tender. Make four indents in the mix for the fish fillets, then nestle them in; the liquid needs to come about halfway up the fish, so if need be top up with a splash more water.Cut out a circle of baking paper to fit the pan, then lay it over the fish and vegetables. Turn down the heat to medium and leave to bubble gently for six to eight minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish. The sauce should have reduced slightly, and the starch from the potatoes will have thickened it; if it still looks a bit watery, carefully lift out the fish and potatoes, and simmer the sauce for a few minutes more to reduce.Meanwhile, grate the courgettes into a bowl and season with salt, pepper and the juice of the remaining lemon.Serve everything straight away, topping the fish with a dollop of creme fraiche, if you fancy, and with extra lemon wedges on the side.The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

Use a vegetable peeler to pare the lemon zest into nice wide strips.In a small saucepan on a medium heat, melt the butter with the pine nuts. As the butter melts, the pine nuts will begin to toast; keep a close eye on them, though, because you don’t want the nuts or butter to burn, although a little browning does add a lovely, nutty depth.Once the pine nuts are golden, stir in the harissa and lemon peel, leave to bubble gently for a minute, then take off the heat. Squeeze in the juice of half the lemon and season with a little salt, if needed.Transfer the cucumber and celery to a bowl and drizzle over the olive oil, the juice from the remaining lemon half, and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat, then spoon on to a platter; now’s the time to add the tuna, if using. Dollop over the yoghurt, then spoon the warm harissa-pine nut butter on top. Eat straight away, while the butter is still warm.Kitty Coles’ latest book, Make More with Less: Foolproof Recipes to Make Your Food go Further, is published by Hardie Grant at £22.

Just two ingredients – chocolate and aquafaba – come together to create a waste-saving treat. Bean water has a mild savoury taste, but the dominant flavour here is chocolate, which, without the addition of extra fat (usually in the form of cream), becomes incredibly intense, amplifying its sheer chocolatiness.Aquafabahas magical properties that mean it behaves like egg whites when whisked, creating an airy foam that can be used for everything from mayonnaise to mousse. According to Ada McVean in an article askingWhat is Aquafaba?for McGill University in Montreal, the water-soluble proteins and sugars in the beans leak into the water during cooking, giving it a similar composition to egg whites; it also contain saponins, which help it foam so well.Aquafaba chocolate mousseThe other week, I was on a panel about the magic of food, and one of the first questions we were asked was how to balance taste, health and convenience, to assist people to cook healthily and diversify their diets. Well, this dish is a perfect example: it’s not only healthy, but it is also incredibly delicious, fun and easy to make. Dark chocolate is low in sugar and rich in minerals such as iron, magnesium and zinc, and has been linked to various health benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease.Personally, I enjoy a row of super-dark chocolate every afternoon as a little pick-me-up, and it always makes me smile to think that it’s good for me.Chocolatemelts at body temperature, which is possibly one reason it feels so satisfying on the tongue. However, it is also heat-sensitive: if it is overheated, it will split and turn oily, so always melt chocolate gently, ideally in a heatproof bowl set over a larger pot of hot but not boiling water.120g aquafaba(ie, from a 400g can of chickpeas)¼ tsp cream of tartar or1 tsp lemon juice(optional, and only if the aquafaba is struggling to form firm peaks)100g dark chocolate, plus a little extra for grating on topIn a clean, grease-free bowl, use an electric whisk to beat the aquafaba to stiff peaks, then keep whisking for at least five more minutes, to ensure the aquafaba is firmly set (unlike egg whites, it is hard to over-whisk). If the aquafaba struggles to form stiff peaks, add the cream of tartar or lemon juice, although that shouldn’t be necessary.Gently melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of hot but not boiling water, stirring occasionally until smooth. Take off the heat and leave to cool slightly – this prevents it seizing up when mixed with the whipped aquafaba. Gently fold a third of the whipped aquafaba into the chocolate to loosen it, then carefully fold in the rest, keeping as much air in the mix as possible.Spoon into four small serving glasses or ramekins and chill for at least eight hours, or overnight. Before serving, top with grated chocolate, if you like. The mousse will keep in the fridge for three to five days.Explore more on these topicsDessertWaste notFoodFood wasteVegan food and drinkChocolateBeans, pulses and legumesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On a Mac you canuse Time Machineto back up the laptop to an external drive orsync your apps and files with iCloud(you can store 5GB for free). Alternatively, copy files to an external drive but be sure to encrypt it first before backing up any sensitive documents.Host important documents in the cloud. Microsoft and Apple have cloud services, but there are many others including Google Drive, Dropbox and Proton Drive.Take note of your laptop’s colour, model number and serial number, and store your proof of purchase somewhere safe.Consider putting the laptop on your home contents insurance, which may need it to be added to the high-risk or high-value items list, particularly if you take it out of the home. Otherwise, there is dedicated laptop or gadget insurance, with multiple cover levels including theft.Explore more on these topicsLaptopsLost or stolenConsumer affairsComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The best thing about this very sheer tint is the shade lineup, which is well considered and natural-looking across the board (24N is a perfect match for me). However, skin type matters. It will best suit someone with balanced or slightly dry skin, since the finish will look too moist for oilier types, and cling to any flakiness on very dry skin.Sensitive skins and eyes generally fare best with mineral sunscreens, andMerit Beautyhas them covered. TheUniform SPF50(pictured, £33) comes in a generous 50ml helping and although coverage is still very sheer, it does blend beautifully and realistically.

While tinted sunscreens are of the same standard as regular SPF products, their effectiveness is identically dependent on applying enough: two longest finger lengths of sunscreen is adequate for face and neck. And so in order to be properly protected, one would have to apply so much tinted sunscreen as to appear caked in makeup (imagine applying that much foundation and you’ll get the idea – you’d look like a TikTok influencer). It’s for this reason that I would always suggest applying a tinted productovera regular untinted sunscreen, in a belt and braces approach.Explore more on these topicsFashionSali Hughes on beautyBeautyMakeupSkincareWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Borrowing the original working title of Federico Fellini’s film 8 ½, Maria Grazia Chiuri, designer ofDiorsince 2016, called it “the Beautiful Confusion”.She was talking about Rome, with its heady jumble of art, culture, faith and mopeds, and about a collection in which haute couture pieces were mixed with theatrical costumes. But there was also an inescapable allusion to the question of her own future of Dior.Even before the show opened, operatically coded with models in Venetian masks and knots ofEyes Wide Shutlace pageanting at nightfall through the central parterre of a villa packed with Roman antiquities, the evening was ablaze with intrigue. Chiuri was born and began her career in Rome, and the deeply personal nature of the show, which was a passionate love letter to her home city, fuelled longstanding rumours that this was orchestrated as a swan song.View image in fullscreenDior’s operatic collection took inspiration from Venetian masks and Eyes Wide Shut.Photograph: Guglielmo Mangiapane/ReutersChiuri has tripled sales at Dior during her nine-year tenure, but the Northern Irish designer Jonathan Anderson, recently appointed to lead menswear design at the house, is seen as waiting in the wings to assume complete creative control of the house. The plot thickened when it emerged that this cruise collection would also include looks from the autumn haute couture collection, which would normally be under wraps until July, putting a question mark over Dior’s plans for the next Paris season.Like a Fellini film, there was no neat ending. The evening finished without official news and with Dior’s next chapter unwritten. But if it was a farewell, it was a fond and fabulous one for a designer whose progressive vision of fashion’s power to platform feminism, female artists and the under-celebrated history of female creativity has been a gamechanger for her industry.View image in fullscreenThe American actress Alexandra Daddario arrives for the Dior cruise 2026 show. The dress code was white for women, black for men.Photograph: Mario Cartelli/Sopa Images/ShutterstockGuests had been issued with a dress code – white for women, black for men – taken from a white ball thrown in 1930 by the Roman patron Mimì Pecci-Blunt – “an extraordinary woman who loved the arts”, Chiuri said before the show. The effect was to synthesise the front row with a collection that was 90% white, drawing the audience into the story.Each outfit brought the drama: a tailcoat suit with tiny ivory silk buttons; silvered latticework fit for a Renaissance princess; translucent classical gowns that looked like marble goddesses come to life; liturgical pomp in capes and collars tipping a hat to the Vatican in its jubilee year. The 450-strong guest list was heavily tilted toward Chiuri’s friends and family and luminaries of the Roman fashion and art world.“My last show in Rome was for another brand, and it was over 10 years ago, so this is a big emotional moment for me,” Chiuri said before the show. The storytelling on the catwalk had close links to a personal project that Chiuri and her daughter Rachele Regini have masterminded and financed independent of Dior. The pair have renovated Teatro della Cometa, a 233-seat experimental theatre that was founded by Pecci-Blunt and became a cultural hotspot in the city when it opened in 1958, but closed 11 years later after a fire.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And how long can a sea anemone live? These were the big questions we considered, sitting outside Heddon Orchard Bothy, listening to the river gurgle through the steep valley(for answers, see * below). I had a fat Penguin book of trivia (1991 edition) balanced on my knees, gifted by a past guest who’d written on the yellowing flyleaf: “This is your only entertainment.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

No electricity. No running water – just space for sleeping and access to a loo, 100 metres away. In other ways it has everything you really need.North Devon mapBothies are more often associated with Scotland. But since 2015, the National Trust has opened a scattering of bookable “camps with walls” in the south-west, including Heddon Orchard and Foreland (a converted stable). This spring the NT unveiled a new one at West Challacombe, above the seaside village of Combe Martin, where five-star views cost from just £15 a night for exclusive use. Well-spaced along North Devon’s Exmoor coast, these three spots make it easy to plan a low-cost bothy-to-bothy walking weekend, using theSouth West Coast Pathor other trails. Both Combe Martin and Lynton (between Foreland and Heddon) can be reached by bus from Barnstaple station, so you don’t need a car. And, although wild-feeling, each bothy is within walking distance of a pub.View image in fullscreenWest Challacombe bothy.Photograph: Sarah Baxter“The bothies are about getting more people into nature – we’re fighting to keep affordable accommodation down here,” said Amy U’Ren, the National Trust’s Volunteering & Community Officer for West Exmoor. She was showing me and my husband around the green, gorse-bright slopes of West Challacombe, 41 hectares (100 acres) of former sheep pasture that the NT is slowly working to make more biodiverse. “It’s exciting – we’re at the start of the project,” Amy added. “It’s about restoring nature and natural processes: sowing wildflowers, digging ponds, reconnecting rivers to floodplains, using pigs, cows and Exmoor ponies for grazing – all to create a mix of habitats.” So far, 20,000 trees have been planted here.In the midst of all this sits the bothy, an old stone barn freshly fitted with sleeping platforms and full-width doors that fling open to the outside world. The loo is a quarter-mile away, in an outbuilding of 15th-centuryWest Challacombe Manor– a rather more refined National Trust place to stay. But we were more than content. Having toured the sweeping site, we sauntered into Combe Martin for vital supplies – wine and beer – and climbed up to raise a toast atop Little Hangman cliff. It was the early evening of dreams, low sun scattering diamonds on the Bristol Channel, ferocious headlands rolling on either side. Then we headed back to the bothy for a camping-stove supper as night not so much fell as exploded, the moon so bright it cast our shadows on the grass.Dew-glistened grass, songbirds in the blossom, blush-blue skies. It was like stepping into a Coleridge poem. The perfect day for a walkI didn’t sleep well, thanks to my wafer-thin mat and the spine-tingling calls of owls. But what a morning! Dew-glistened grass, songbirds in the blossom, blush-blue skies. It was like stepping into a Coleridge poem. The perfect day for a walk.From West Challacombe it’s about seven miles east along the South West Coast Path to the Heddon Valley, and 9.5 miles from there to Foreland Point – a spectacular two-day hike. But we decided to plot a bolder route. We’d parked at Heddon the previous day and then walked to West Challacombe via the coast path, up 318-metre Great Hangman, England’s highest sea cliff. Our plan was to follow a different course back, across the top of 349-metre Holdstone Hill, and continue through to Foreland, stay there, then return to Heddon for our last night, making the most of Exmoor’s combe-dipping, stream-tracing trails. It sounds tiring and complicated on paper, but in reality it felt in keeping with bothying’s adventurous spirit.View image in fullscreenSarah Baxter on the South West Coast Path near Heddon’s Mouth.Photograph: Sarah BaxterIt was a glorious mix too, combining the best of the coast path – hidden Woody Bay, idyllicLee Abbey Tea Cottage– with other gems. For instance, though only millimetres from the official coast path on the Ordnance Survey map, the broad higher path east of Heddon, rising towards a Roman fortlet, affords a remarkably different perspective. Likewise, the route into Lynton viaHollerday Hill: here you get a gull’s eye lookout over the Valley of Rocks, before a leafy path leads to the remains of Hollerday House, mysteriously burned down in 1913 – some say by suffragettes.The full moon glared like a second sun – no need for torches. It was pure magic, and if we hadn’t been bothying we’d have missed it allWe were weary by the time we finally found Foreland bothy, hidden in a cleft with a sea view. Despite being tired, we still hiked the mile to Countisbury’sBlue Ball Inn– money saved on accommodation allowed for splurges on dinner. As we strolled there, a low sea mist cast the shore into romantic soft focus and deer grazed in the golden rays. On the return, at nautical twilight, a peachy ribbon blurred the horizon, while the full moon glared like a second sun – no need for torches. It was pure magic, and if we hadn’t been bothying we’d have missed it all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

First we headed east, passing an Australian, also on her third day – though, in her case, day three of a full 630-mile South West Coast Path hike.

We had lunch atWatersmeet, a fishing lodge turned National Trust tearoom in a deep, wooded valley where blue tits eat your crumbs, then picked up the coast path again at Lynton, this time following the classic route back to Heddon. It rained briefly, which made the sessile oaks’ mossy, twisted fingers seem all the more fairytale.It dried up by the time we climbed the primrose-lined path to the bothy itself. Heddon Orchard is especially popular with families, Amy had said – there are nature trails and a beach nearby, and theHunters Innpub opposite. Indeed, sitting outside the bothy with the book of Penguin trivia, I watched Derek, the pub’s peacock, peering through the guest-room windows like the most majestic peeping Tom. Then a buzzard soared. And wood pigeons began to coo. And the sun sidled out of the valley, a fascinating slow creep from light to shade. Entertainment?

One person alighted; two others climbed onboard and the aircraft rose into the sky.The lone man made his way towards Triple Island lighthouse, an octagonal concrete tower erupting from the trio of islets. Fringed with barnacles, rockweed and algae, the rocky cluster sits on Canada’s west coast, a seascape notorious for its battering storms, heavy fog and hostile waters.Chief among the lists of tasks of lightkeepers working at the station, known to locals as “The Rock” or “Little Alcatraz”, is to deliver weather reports every three hours.But that spring day, the first report never came.Crews tried repeatedly to raise the lighthouse keeper on various marine radio channels and his mobile phone, but all efforts were met with silence.“Lightkeepers have a record of being perfect on their timing,” said Jim Abram, a former president of the lightkeepers union. “If they ever miss a report, it’s for an emergency.”aerial view of white lighthouseFootage from a helicopter leaving Triple Island lighthouse.Fear set in and a helicopter was dispatched from the Langara station lighthouse, a 20-minute flight away. When the crew touched down, they confirmed their worst fears: the lightkeeper was dead.“You never staff a light station with only one person. Never,” said Abram. “But that’s what happened. The three other keepers that are on that station rotation are just devastated and left with a lot of questions – most of which we’ll never know the answer to because, against all common sense, there was just one person on that island.”The death of the keeper, whose name has not been released, has prompted questions over workplace safety rules, shaken the tightly knit group of guardians – and renewed fears of de-staffing. As an investigation unfolds into the death, those who have served as the “eyes and ears” in remote pockets of the country worry the incident will be used as pretext to automate yet another lighthouse, putting people at greater risk in an environment that is already unforgiving and unpredictable.View image in fullscreenThe Dryad Point lighthouse on Campbell Island in Canada in 2018.Photograph: Danita Delimont/AlamyOf the 750 lighthouses scattered across Canada, many were first constructed in areas where safe navigation was a challenge, with the stations serving as guardrails against disaster.“They’ve become symbols of a particular place and take on meanings in a profound way as anchors of local memory,” said Kate Bauer, a doctoral researcher at the University of Toronto. “And increasingly, we associate them with a bygone era and for that reason, they tend to serve that purpose. But we forget that they were once part of a large technological system oriented towards modernizing Canada from coast to coast.”map of Canada, showing Triple Islands lighthouseIn recent decades, a global push to modernize maritime safety and navigation has increased pace, supplanting manned posts with automated warning systems – and provoking a fierce battle over the purpose of the technology. A large factor in de-staffing is the cost associated with maintaining a human presence at remote outposts.Canada’s coast guard says it is not aware of any evidence that unstaffed light stations increase risks for mariners and point to a number of countries that have de-staffed their light stations. The United Statesoffered up 10 lighthousesto the public in 2023 – either to be sold at auction or given away free of charge – after determining modern technology meant they were no longer essential for navigation.Of the hundreds of lighthouses in Canada, only 51 remain staffed. Nearly half of those are on British Columbia’s Pacific coast, a region that is often inaccessible except by boat and air. As a result,keepers in those stations have often taken on roles far beyond their basic responsibilities, acting as weather watchers and rescue workers. They have broken up bothdrug-smugglingand human-trafficking rings after spotting suspicious boasts and alerted authorities during environmental disasters.“The fear of losing keepers is a fear that we’re losing those eyes on the coast. They’re often the first – and only – line of defence for something going wrong in a really sparsely populated part of the country,” said Bauer.View image in fullscreenThe Cape Mudge lighthouse on Quadra Island, British Columbia, in 2018.Photograph: Sebastien Lecocq/AlamyWhen a plane or vehicle crashes, most often the tragedy is attributable to operator error. Humans fatigue, they are distracted and they fail. Increasingly, the solution is to automate jobs, both to save money and because of an assumption that machines can better complete the task. But as society pushes towards greater automation, there is growing fear that a blanket embrace of technology in the form of algorithms and machine learning is not always a clearcut cost or efficiency saving.Bauer points out that earlier pushes for automation have been justified in terms of potential savings, but provoked an energetic pushback from keepers who say they fulfill an irreplaceable role.“The lightkeepers argued you can’t replace the human ability to discern the way clouds are moving or the way the air smells,” she said.The four-storey tower of the Cape Mudge lighthouse, with its twin foghorns and windows capped with simple decorative pediments, stands watch over the nearby Seymour Narrows, which the famed mariner George Vancouver described as “one of the vilest stretches of water in the world” .Abram, who spent more than two decades as the Cape Mudge lightkeeper, says the surrounding sea can rapidly deteriorate into “absolutely horrific” conditions in the form of standing waves, rip tides, whirlpools and back eddies. He was also the chief architect behind a highly organized fight that eventually halted the previous round of de-staffing in the 1990s and has in recent yearshighlighted instancesin which lightkeepers saved the lives of boats in distress.‘They just disappeared’: lost planes frustrate British Columbia search crewsRead moreDuring his time at Cape Mudge, vessels would call the lighthouse for accurate, real-time descriptions of the weather because the conditions reflected on their charts were already outdated.“You get all kinds of chaotic water that is not picked up by any kind of instrument. Nothing we’ve devised that can pick up any of that. The only thing that can are human eyes and ears,” said Abram. “The ship captains would just take that as gospel – because they know we know.”Meanwhile sensitive weather-monitoring equipment – and the lighthouse beacon itself – can be extremely challenging to repair in such remote areas.Abram points to a recent incident after a station on Vancouver Island was de-staffed last summer. Days after crews were removed, the powerful beacon failed. Efforts to repair the light were foiled by thick fog that prevented helicopters from accessing the site.“You’ve got a C$5,000-per-hour helicopter flying as many as five highly paid technicians to do something as simple as fixing a bare wire or a burnt-out lightbulb. Little things [a] lightkeeper can do in minutes can take days or weeks because weather prevents crews from accessing sites that are, in their nature, inaccessible,” he said.ACanadian Senate reportfrom 2010 found the cost savings from automating the remaining lighthouses were minimal, given the scope of risks posed. The report alsofound a number of other of benefits to using lightkeepers, who can take valuable readings of the local environments, including daily temperature and seawater salinity testing alongside detailed marine wildlife counts.View image in fullscreenThe Lennard lighthouse at Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia.Photograph: All Canada Photos/Alamy“The views we heard on both coasts were overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the keepers,” said authors of the Seeing the Light report. “And that is what we are unanimously recommending.” The Senate committee found that while most developed countries have pushed forward with de-staffing, others, including Ireland and Australia, have returned keepers to some stations.Illuminating: an illustrated guide to some of the world’s most remote lighthousesRead moreIn Canada, while the pace of de-staffing has slowed dramatically, it hasn’t halted.Last year, the coastguard said it would remove staff from both the Carmanah Point and Pachena Point light stations on Vancouver Island, arguing that the ground was unstable. And recently, a staffing shortage has meant a number of stations – including the nearby Langara Point lighthouse – have been maintained by a single person.The coastguard and the union representing lightkeepers have declined to comment publicly, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation.Critics of the de-staffing push fear the fatality at Triple Island will serve as a useful pretext to remove a human presence from the station. Since the investigation into the incident began in early April, no staff have been at the island.“I’ve long worried about Triple Island and the critical role it plays in marine safety, losing its staff,” said Abram. “Is our biggest fear coming true? I worry it is.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaSeascape: the state of our oceansAmericasEmploymentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This year I’ve only seen four swifts over where I live in Prestwich. I used to see dozens, and was delighted to hear their screams as they flew over my garden.What is my party so afraid of? The £35 charge on each new house from the building lobby? Being seen as “woke”? Myopic decisions like this one make a mockery of Labour’s pledges on the environment.For thousands of years swifts have migrated from Africa to spend their summers with us, but gradually their traditional nesting places in the nooks and crannies of old buildings have gone. Their numbers have declined bymore than 60% in the last few decades. The government should reverse this shortsighted decision as soon as possible to prevent further embarrassment and losing voters to the Greens and Liberal Democrats.Alan QuinnPrestwich, Greater ManchesterHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is important, however, that the debates about how to achieve this are placed in the context of the recent increases in the state pension age (Passed over, targeted, fined – but is the magnificence of family carers finally being recognised?, 25 May). Between 2010 and 2018, raising women’s state pension age from 60 to 65 years reduced state expenditure over that period bya total of £77bn. Since then, it has risen to 66 years for all.Starting in April 2026, it will rise to 67 years. In March this year the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated that this fiscal saving will be £10.4bn in 2029-30, including a net saving on pension credit and winter fuel allowance of £0.2bn. Rachel Reeves please note.Since 2010, the need to remain in paid employment to an older age has been accompanied by cuts in social care services. Meanwhile, the carer’s allowance has remained the lowest benefit in the system. Nearly 30% of those whose caring responsibilities would entitle them to receive it are ineligible because of its complex interactions with the benefits received by those they care for. It is vital that this Labour government does not avert its eyes from the health and wellbeing of both young and older family carers.Hilary LandEmerita professor of family policy,University of BristolI am grateful to John Harris for highlighting Ed Davey’s book about the huge stresses on families who care for family members with learning disabilities. In my professional life it was often brought home to me by parents almost wistfully commenting on the “luck” of others whose adult offspring had died before them, so they no longer needed to worry about their future care. Or the parents who said that the government just wanted their children to die, so that they would no longer be a financial burden to the state.In retirement, I have friends whose grandchildren have significant needs, and I’m appalled that services have been cut back to a point where families are collapsing, with respite care almost nonexistent. Perhaps Ed Davey could introduce a family home stay scheme for politicians, so that they could at least have some experience of, for example: the permanently disturbed nights; managing on a poverty-level income; rarely having access to public toilets with appropriate changing facilities; and the uncertainty about what would happen if they were ill or injured, and unable to provide care for day-to-day needs.As budgets are being slashed, this group of people, the carers and the cared for, are too often seen as easy targets for cuts, as they are either unable, or too exhausted, to shout loudly enough.Dr Sally CheseldineRetired consultant clinical psychologist,Balerno, EdinburghI have been a full-time carer for my husband, who suffered a major stroke 21 years ago. In that time we have seen our named care manager disappear, any physio support disappear, council respite homes disappear and private domiciliary care companies desperate for workers and tripling their fees.Private care homes, if they offer respite care at all, charge £1,900 per week for non-nursing care. This can seldom be booked in advance and smaller homes can’t cope with powered wheelchairs. This leaves me and thousands of others with no constant support, leading to fatigue and burnout.Unpaid carers in the UK save the government£184bn a year, but we are not on their radar. Shame on you, Labour. My next vote is definitely going to Ed Davey and the Liberal Democrats, who have been consistent in their policies.Lucy RutherfordExeter, DevonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This may all be true, and it is sad to see the loss of jobs in the Senegalese artisanal fishing industry.Yet it is a very one-sided picture. Rising fish prices in Senegal are part of a global trend, driven in part by rising consumption in rich countries as people shift their diets from beef to other sources of protein. Poorer countries, such as Senegal, that traditionally rely upon fish have also seen changes in diet, with fish beingincreasinglyreplaced by poultry and barbecued meat. Similarly, the recent increase in food insecurity in Senegal has less to do with an increase in fishmeal export and more to do with the Russia-Ukraine war, which hascauseda huge disruption of Russian and Ukrainian exports of oil, wheat and fertilisers.The article frames fishmeal export from Senegal as not just bad for small-scale fishers but for the country as a whole. Yet fishmeal exports alsogeneratebadly needed employment, foreign currency and tax revenues in Senegal and neighbouring countries.None of the above is to suggest that the Senegalese fishing industry does not warrant serious attention in terms of its social and ecological impact. But it is not clear that calls for Turkish fisheries to source their fishmeal elsewhere would benefit the Senegalese economy.To quote the late economist Joan Robinson: “The misery of being exploited by capitalists is nothing compared to the misery of not being exploited at all.”Elliott GreenProfessor of development studies,London School of EconomicsHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I think that is all I have to say for now.”Ngũgĩ explored the troubled legacy of colonialism through essays, plays and novels including Weep Not, Child (1964), Devil on the Cross (1980) and Wizard of the Crow (2006). Considera giant of the modern African pantheon, he had been a favourite for the Nobel prize in literature for years. After missing out on the prize in 2010 to Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa, Ngũgĩsaid he was less disappointedthan the photographers who had gathered outside his home: “I was the one who was consoling them!”Born in 1938, whileKenyawas under British colonial rule, Ngũgĩ was one of 28 children, born to a father with four wives. He lived through the Mau Mau uprising as a teenager, during which the authorities imprisoned, abused and tortured tens or even hundreds of thousands of people. During the conflict, Ngũgĩ’s father – one of the Gikuyu, Kenya’s largest ethnic group – was forced off his land, and two of his brothers were killed.This struggle formed the backdrop to the novel that made his name: Weep Not, Child. Published in 1964, just a year after Kenya gained independence, it tells the story of the education of Njoroge, the first of his family to go to school, and how his life is thrown into turmoil by the events which surround him.Ngugi wa Thiong’o: ‘I don’t think we were meant to come out alive’Read moreA series of novels, including short stories and plays followed, as Ngũgĩ became a lecturer in English literature at Nairobi University. There he argued that the English department should be renamed, and shift its focus to literature around the world. “If there is need for a ‘study of the historic continuity of a single culture’, why can’t this be African?” he wrote in a paper. “Why can’t African literature be at the centre so that we can view other cultures in relationship to it?”In 1977, he published his fourth novel, Petals of Blood, and a play, The Trial of Dedan Kimathi, which dealt with the troubled legacy of the Mau Mau uprising, but it was his co-authoring of a play written in Gikuyu, I Will Marry When I Want, which led to his arrest and imprisonment in Mamiti maximum security prison.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Daniel A. Anderson“In prison I began to think in a more systematic way about language,”he told the Guardian in 2006. “Why was I not detained before, when I wrote in English?” He decided from then on to write in Gikuyu, that “the only language I could use was my own”.Released in 1978, exile followed in 1982, when the author learned of a plot to kill him upon his return from a trip to Britain to promote his novel Caitani Mutharabaini, translated as Devil on the Cross. He later moved from the UK to the US, where he worked as a professor of English and comparative literature at the University of California, Irvine, and headed its International Centre for Writing and Translation.Ngũgĩ continued to write in Gikuyu, despite his troubled connection with his homeland; an arrest warrant was issued for the fictional main character of his 1986 novel Matigari, which was also banned in Kenya. Returning to Nairobi with his wife Njeeri for the first time in 2004, two years after the death of Daniel arap Moi, Ngũgĩ was greeted by crowds at the airport. But during the trip,men wielding guns broke into their apartment, raping Njeeri and beating Ngũgĩ when he tried to intervene. “I don’t think we were meant to come out alive,”he told the Guardiantwo years later.His novel Wizard of the Crow,translated by the author into English in 2006, returned to the subject of African kleptocracy, being set in the imaginary dictatorship of the Free Republic of Aburiria. He said the “most beautiful sentence in the entire novel” was “a translation from Gikuyu by the author”.He continued totranslate his own works from Gikuyu, and was nominated for the international Booker prize in 2021 for his epic novel-in-verse The Perfect Nine. He was the prize’s first nominee writing in an indigenous African language and the first author to be nominated for their own translation.Ngũgĩ had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1995 and underwent triple heart bypass surgery in 2019.Ngũgĩ had nine children, four of whom are authors: Tee Ngũgĩ, Mũkoma wa Ngũgĩ, Nducu wa Ngũgĩ, and Wanjiku wa Ngũgĩ.“Resistance is the best way of keeping alive,”he said to the Guardian in 2018. “It can take even the smallest form of saying no to injustice. If you really think you’re right, you stick to your beliefs, and they help you to survive.”Explore more on these topicsNgugi wa Thiong'oFictionAfricaKenyanewsShareReuse this content"

It amounted to 80% and 50% of their respective populations at the time.Some of their skulls were taken toGermanyfor racist experiments and were stored in German hospitals, museums and universities for decades.Namibia’s president, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, told a memorial event in the parliament’s gardens on Wednesday that the government would continue to push for reparations from Germany.She said: “We should find a degree of comfort in the fact that the German government has agreed that German troops committed a genocide against the … people of our land.“We may not agree on the final quantum, but that is part of the complex negotiations we have been engaged in with the German government since 2013 … We must remain committed that as a nation, we shall soldier on until the ultimate conclusion is reached.”In 2021, Germany officiallyrecognised the atrocities as a genocideand agreed to pay Namibia €1.1bn (then £940m) to fund development for the Herero and Nama. It said this was a gesture of “reconciliation”, but not compensation or reparations. Germany returned the skulls and other human remains to Namibia in 2011 and 2018.Descendants of genocide victims said this was not enough and called on the German governmentto negotiate with them directly.Germany ruled Namibia, then known as South WestAfrica, from 1884 to 1915, when it was taken over by South Africa during the first world war. It became independent in 1990.Between 1904 and 1908, German troops shot, tortured or drove tens of thousands of Herero and Nama people into the Kalahari desert to starve, after they rebelled against colonial rule. Their descendants are now politically marginalised.Germany’s ambassador to Namibia, Thorsten Hutter, said in a speech at the memorial: “It is a stark reminder of the pain and suffering that was inflicted by German imperial troops during the colonial era … We cannot change the past, but as the people who are living today, it is our responsibility to remember those atrocities that were committed.”He told the local newspaperthe Namibian: “I believe we are on a very good path to forge forward, which includes the issues of reconciliation.”Herero and Nama representatives said more people in Namibia and worldwide should learn about the genocide. Hoze Riruako, a Herero chief, said it was a precursor to the Holocaust, but “people are not aware of what has happened here to the same level”.Last year, Namibia declared 28 May would be a genocide remembrance day and a public holiday. It was chosen as it was the day in 1907 when Germany decided to close its concentration camps after an international outcry.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this storyExplore more on these topicsNamibiaAfricaGermanyColonialismReparations and reparative justicenewsShareReuse this content"

Six soldiers were killed instantly, while two more later died from their wounds, according toEl Universal.Jalisco’s state attorney general has taken charge of the investigation, while a special military taskforce searches the area for more explosive devices.Mexico: ‘Noah’s Ark’ of animals flees cartel violence for new home on coastRead moreShortly before the explosion, the army had reported finding and destroying621 IEDs in Michoacánduring operations so far.The border region between Michoacán and Jalisco is the site of aviolent strugglebetween Mexico’s most powerful criminal group, the Jalisco New Generation cartel, and local groups that are resisting its incursion into their territory.Various criminal groups have reportedly recruited ex-military personnel from Colombia who are experts in explosives, leading to a proliferation of improvised mines to control territory throughout the region.This incident marks the highest military death toll from an IED since their use took off – but it isnot the only one.In December 2024, four soldiers were killed by mines in two incidents in nearby municipalities of Michoacán. And in January that year, four more were killed when an army convoy entered a town in Jalisco.The mines have also claimed civilian lives in Michoacán,from a teacherwhose vehicle set off a mine in January, to several lime farmers – includinga 15-year-old in February.Aside from using them as mines, criminal groups have also taken to attaching IEDs to drones and dropping them on opponents from above.Overall, according to Mexican military dataobtained by Insight Crime, IED seizures have soared from almost none in 2021 to well over 1,000 every year since.Though their use has spread acrossMexico, it remains concentrated in the border area between Michoacán and Jalisco, which accounts for roughly 40% of all seizures.The mines have sown terror in the region,contributing to the forced displacement of some communities.Explore more on these topicsMexicoAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Samples collected from two birds found they tested positive for H5N1, a strain of bird flu.The farm’s owners sued over the order, but the Canadian federal government argued they were following a “stamping out” policy in order to keep avian flu at bay, in line withadvice from the World Health Organization.According tocourt documents, the owners conceded that 69 of their ostriches died from the flu, but argued that the rest were free of symptoms and claimed that there had been no further deaths since January.Karen Espersen, the owner, said she welcomed expressions of support from Kennedy, Oz and the US billionaire John Catsimatidis, who are lobbying the Canadian government to reverse the order.She said that Oz had told her he would be willing to take the birds to his ranch in Okeechobee, Florida. “He said: ‘You know if by chance you want to move [them] to the States, I got 900 acres,’” she said.While Espersen says she wants the birds to stay inCanada, if they can’t fight the order at the supreme court, they are open to moving the birds to Oz’s ranch.She said: “We are not against our government … but we’re very, very saddened our government [does not believe the birds are well].”Oz told the New York Post that he, Kennedy Jr and Catsimatidis are “sticking our necks out” for the ostriches. “It doesn’t help anyone to kill the birds,” Oz told the outlet.Kennedy has sent a letter to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), which issued the order, to reconsider.But the CFIA has been clear on the need to cull the birds in order to protect Canadians. In a statement, it told the Guardian that its response is to protect human and animal health and “minimize impacts on the $6.8 billion domestic poultry industry and Canada’s economy”.In the US, bird flu has been spreading among animals andegg prices have been soaringas a result and amid concerns of price fixing.BC has been the epicentre of a bird flu outbreak in Canada. Millions of birds have been culled at hundreds of farms in an infection period that has lasted over three years. North of the border, however,egg prices have not spikedas they have in the US due to the resiliency of smaller farms and the country’s supply management system.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationCanadaDonald TrumpRobert F Kennedy JrBird fluHealthAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

We are facing a discredit of climate policies. I don’t think we are facing climate denial,” he said, referring to the increasingly desperate attempts to pretend there is no consensus on climate science that have plagued climate action for the past 30 years. “It’s not a scientific denial, it’s an economic denial.”This economic denial could bejust as dangerousand cause as much delay as repeated attempts to deny climate science in previous years, he warned in an exclusive interview with the Guardian.‘A future on our terms’: how community energy is lighting up Latin AmericaRead moreAs the climate crisis has gathered pace, temperatures have risen and the effects of extreme weather have become more obvious, scientists have been able to draw ever more clearly the links between greenhouse gas emissions and our impacts on the planet. So the argument has shifted, Corrêa do Lago believes, from undermining or misrepresenting the science to attempts to counter climate policy.“It is not possible to have [scientific] denialism at this stage, after everything that has happened in recent years. So there is a migration from scientific denial to a denial that economic measures against climate change can be good for the economy and for people.”The rise of populist politicians around the world has fuelled a backlash against climate policy, most clearly seen in the presidency ofDonald Trumpin the US, where he has set about cancelling policies intended to boost renewable energy and cut greenhouse gases, and dismantling all forms of government-sponsored climate-related institutions, including scientific research labs.Corrêa do Lago wants to spur a new global effort to persuade people that remodelling the economy away from a reliance on fossil fuels and towards a clean energy future will reap benefits for all people. “The new populism is trying to show [that tackling the climate crisis does not work],” he said. “It’s the turn of those who believe in the fight against climate change to show and to prove that fighting climate change is possible, and that it can come with economic advantages and with a better quality of life.”Corrêa do Lago is an economist by training – the youngest of five brothers, all of whom became economists. “My mother was horrified with our lack of originality,” he joked.He has been a career diplomat, having joined Brazil’s foreign service in 1983 and serving previously as ambassador to India and Japan. He is also a veteran of the Cop talks – the annual “conference of the parties”, which will take place this year in Belém, near the mouth of the Amazon, in November.“Most of the answers have to come from the economy,” said Corrêa do Lago. “Because we have now enough science, enough demonstration of how climate change can affect people’s lives. Now we need answers [in the form of policy measures]. We need economists to rally.”View image in fullscreenWorkers constructing an avenue, named Liberdade, or Freedom, before Cop30 in Belém, Brazil.Photograph: Jorge Sáenz/APOver the past two decades, economists have begun to take on the challenge of the climate crisis, after the 2006 landmark review by Nicholas Stern, the former chief economist of the World Bank, which found it would be cheaper to tackle emissions than to allow them to run unchecked. That contradicted the conclusions of some previous economists, who had claimed it was not worth trying to move away from fossil fuels, or it would be too expensive.Since then, multiple reports have proved the same point. Most recently, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the UN Development Programme produced a joint report this year, with the final version to come out next month, showing thattackling the climate crisis would materially increase economic growth, rather than being a necessary cost.But much mainstream thinking on economics does not take the climate crisis into account. Most governments preparing budgets, for instance, do not include climate impacts in their estimates, and nor do businesses. Many of the economic estimates of climate damage are also far too modest. For Corrêa do Lago, this shows that much more needs to be done.“Climate has not been incorporated into economic theory in a satisfactory way yet,” he said. “Because it’s a very disturbing element.”Corrêa do Lago also faces the task ofcorralling 196 nations into producing new national plans on greenhouse gas emissionswithin the next few months, and meanwhile Brazil is already wrestling with thelogistical challengesof holding Cop30 in a rainforest. There was controversy earlier this year over a road being built through the forest to the city, though Brazilian officials said the road had already been planned before Cop30 was awarded to Belém. There are also concerns about the environmental credentials of the Brazilian president as his government continues to approve mines and oil drilling projects.Will Cop30 in Belém help or harm the Amazon?Read moreBut those pale in comparison with geopolitical headwinds.Trump will not attend the talksand has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, and his actions have emboldened countries that wish to derail progress. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Argentina, Venezuela and a host of other countries, including petrostates and populist-leaning governments, are all possible mischief-makers. Other major economies may be less overtly disruptive but also could fall well short in their commitments, with equally damaging effects.Each country is supposed to prepare a nationally determined contribution (NDC), a complex document setting out targets on greenhouse gas emissions to 2035 and sometimes beyond, and policies intended to meet them. But so far only a handful of countries – not including the EU, China, Japan or India – have submitted their NDCs, even though the deadline passed in February.The UK’s plan was submitted last year, along with Brazil’s.Brazil and last year’s hosts, Azerbaijan, are working on a “roadmap” that will set out what countries must do to achieve the financial goals that will also be a key issue. The outline will be ready before governments gather in the Amazon in November.For Corrêa do Lago, the hope is that the world can come together to solve the existential crisis of the climate in the way governments did 40 years ago to tackle the hole in the ozone layer. “Climate change is much more complex, and the gases act for much longer, and the impact on the economy is infinitely larger than the elimination of the gases that deplete the ozone layer. But the ozone layer is the only example of the phenomenon that connected human action could change the direction [of an environmental crisis].”If we fail? “The alternative is accelerating climate change.”Explore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisBrazilAmericasUnited NationsClimate science scepticism and denialClimate financenewsShareReuse this content"

But it delivered none last year, with responsibility quietly handed over to the country’s 23 provinces.Amnesty said the switch was “hindering access to abortion services for women”, and that more than half of the provinces reported a shortage of misoprostol, and almost all reported shortages of mifepristone and combipack.According to the Argentine Network for Access to Safe Abortion, the change is having the biggest impact inprovinces where politicians are anti-abortionor have fewer economic resources.Project Mirar, an initiative that monitors implementation of the abortion law, said provinces had struggled to negotiate prices as effectively as the state, and that some did not have the budget to buy the drugs. One report found that in some cases women had been forced tobuy the medication themselves, which it said could cost about $160 (£120).View image in fullscreenA priest holds a rosary during a protest against legal abortion in Buenos Aires last year. The Catholic church has always condemned legal abortion.Photograph: Cristina Sille/ReutersAmnesty has warned that reproductive health policies being pushed by Argentina’s far-right government are linked toProject 25, the ultra-conservative policy blueprint being championed by the Trump administration in the US.Mariela Belski, director of Amnesty InternationalArgentina, said she believed that “Argentina has been used as a testing ground for several of the policies featured in the Heritage Foundation’s 2025 plan”, including restricting access to abortion and limiting broader sexual and reproductive rights.“It is part of a global backlash that seeks to dismantle hard-won gains secured by women. It is also happening under Donald Trump’s leadership in the United States and in countries such as Hungary,” said Belski.Argentina legalised abortion in all cases up to 14 weeks of pregnancy in 2020, after sweeping protests known as the“green wave” movement. Previously, the procedure was permitted only in cases of rape or if the woman’s health was at risk.View image in fullscreenAn anti-abortion protester. His T-shirt depicts Javier Milei with the slogan: ‘In defence of life, liberty and private property’.Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/GettyThe legalisation heralded a success for women’s rights in Argentina and regionally. Between 2021 and 2023,283,000 voluntary and legal abortionswere provided by Argentina’s public sector, whileabortion-related deaths more than halvedbetween 2020 and 2022.But Milei has dismantled dozens of public policies relating to women’s rights since taking power. He hasclosed the ministry of women, genders and diversity, slashed programmes aimed atcombating gender violence, and drasticallycut funding for contraceptives.The Argentinian leader told an audience ofhigh-school pupilsthat abortion should be considered “aggravated murder”, and declared to theWorld Economic Forumthat feminists were “promoters of the bloody, murderous abortion agenda”.On the campaign trail, Milei said pro-choice Argentines were “brainwashed by a homicidal policy” and vowed to launch a referendum to overturn the abortion law.In February 2024, a small group of legislators from Milei’s La Libertad Avanza party went further still, filing a bill in congressto repeal the landmark 2020 abortion law. The bill was quickly withdrawn, but in December a high-ranking member of the government said that apush to repeal or change the lawcould go ahead this year.In Tucumán, a conservative province in north-west Argentina, healthcare providers say they are witnessing a rise in unsafe abortions amid supply delays and misinformation.View image in fullscreenWomen in Buenos Aires demonstrate in support of safe and legal abortion access to mark International Safe Abortion Day in 2023.Photograph: Mariana Nedelcu/ReutersAdriana Alvarez, a gynaecologist who provides abortions at a public hospital in Tucumán, said supplies had repeatedly been disrupted over the past year.“We’re now seeing, as we saw many years ago, unsafe abortions. They are being driven underground,” she said. “We’ve gone backwards.”Amnesty said it had received 120 complaints from women requesting help and reporting being obstructed in trying to access abortions last year, up from 32 in 2023. Between January and April this year, Amnesty said it had received reports of 160 such cases.Alvarez said women were arriving at the clinic with “fear in their eyes”. “They say they don’t want their family to find out, or to go to certain hospitals because people work there that they know,” she said.Argentina holds historic abortion vote as 1m women rally to demand changeRead more“We have women who come and ask if they are still allowed to have an abortion,” she said. “They’re scared of going to jail.”Those most affected are the poorest and most vulnerable women in society, with some susceptible to misinformation on social media, healthcare professionals warned.Soledad Deza, a lawyer and president of Fundación Mujeres x Mujeres, which helps women access abortions, said the shift in official policy had confused women about the legality of abortion.“There has been so much discourse around thinking of abortion as homicide that women do not know if they are exercising a right or committing a crime,” she said.Milei’s anti-abortion rhetoric has also prompted growing numbers of doctors in Argentinato refuse to carry out terminations, according to medical professionals across the country.Julieta Bazán, a doctor in Buenos Aires, said professionals – whether ultrasound staff, nurses or doctors – “no longer want to guarantee” abortion rights due to discrimination and a lack of resources. The “noticeable” abortion pill shortage was a “violation of our law”, she said.Explore more on these topicsReproductive rightsRights and freedomAbortionWomen's rights and gender equalityArgentinaAmericasSexual healthWomennewsShareReuse this content"

His seven-person medical teamis on trialin San Isidro, part of the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, over the conditions of his home convalescence, described by prosecutors as grossly negligent.After Makintach’s departure, the two remaining judges decided to temporarily suspend the trial until tomorrow.The trial had already been suspended for a week due to allegations that the judge was involved in covert filming of the legal proceedings.Prosecutors launched a criminal investigation, which included search operations.At yesterday’s hearing, before the evidence was presented, Makintach denied any wrongdoing, claiming she had merely given an “informal interview” about the case and that she had been the target of “media ridicule”.However, a1-minute-50-second trailershown by public prosecutor Patricio Ferrari revealed a far more sophisticated production level.Amid excerpts of news reports on the death of the Argentine football legend, the judge is shown from several angles arriving at and walking around the San Isidro courthouse where the case is being heard.According to prosecutors, the footage was shot on Sunday, 9 March – two days before the trial began – without authorisation or a record of the visit.The caption reads: “Five years later: a death, an idol, a judge, a trial.” Makintach is filmed entering her office, sitting down, looking into the camera, before the title of the miniseries appears: “Divine Justice”.The next show was allegedly filmed from inside the courtroom – something that technically should not have been allowed – and shows Makintach at the centre of the frame.Then comes the phrase “The judge behind D10S,” a reference to Maradona​’s “divine” nickname, playing on the Spanish word for God (Dios) and the iconic number 10 shirt worn by one of the world’s greatest players.As the trailer was played, the defence lawyer Rodolfo Baque jumped out of his chair to shout “trash!” at the judge. Gianinna Maradona, Maradona’s daughter, tried to calm him, before she and Maradona’s former partner Verónica Ojeda both began sobbing uncontrollably.View image in fullscreenGianinna Maradona surrounded by reporters arrives at the court on Tuesday.Photograph: Francisco Loureiro/ReutersProsecutor Ferrari accused Makintach of behaving “like an actress and not a judge”. He said the miniseries would feature the judge as the main protagonist across its six episodes.The judge sat with her head bowed, biting her lip and eventually said she had “no choice” but to recuse herself as one of the case’s three justices.Maradona died at his home in Buenos Aires, where he was recovering from surgery to remove a blood clot from his brain, performed just days earlier. The cause of death was heart failure and acute pulmonary oedema.Prosecutors have described the medical care Maradona received as “reckless, inadequate, and unprecedented”, arguing that his death could have been prevented. The charges against his medical team relate to the decision to allow him to recover from major surgery at home, and the conditions of the care he received there.The seven defendants could face prison terms ranging from eight to 25 years if convicted of homicide with possible intent.Gianinna Maradona has claimed her father was kept in “a dark, ugly and lonely” place and that his carers were more interested in money than his welfare.On​ Thursday, the two remaining judges are expected to announce whether the trial will proceed – and if so, whether it will continue with just ​the two ​o​f them or with a ​new third member​ – or be declared void.Some of the plaintiffs have called for a new trial, saying they felt proceedings had been tainted by scandal.“Everyone now feels that this is compromised,” said Mario Baudry, Ojeda’s lawyer. “It’s healthiest to start over from scratch.”Explore more on these topicsArgentinaDiego MaradonaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Then the Nationals went nuclearRead moreLey had to look after both her own supporters and those who backed Angus Taylor, the new shadow defence minister, inthe tight Liberal leadership ballot.Littleproud had to force generational change in the Nationals, as he faces growing unhappiness and loose chatter of a challenge from former frontbenchers Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack.Ley saidher choicesreflect the full range of philosophical traditions, values and perspectives within the Coalition, and promised to harness her team’s full “intellectual and philosophical firepower”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailSome of the appointments are promising.Julian Leeser returns as the shadow attorney general, after quitting the frontbench over Peter Dutton’s position on the voice to parliament. James Paterson and Andrew Hastie move to broaden their experience, taking on finance and home affairs respectively, while Tim Wilson returns to shadow cabinet in industrial relations. Angie Bell and Andrew Bragg both move up the ranks.Ley punted conservative diehards Sarah Henderson, Tony Pasin and Claire Chandler, and promoted up-and-comers Maria Kovacic and Zoe McKenzie. Promising talent including Aaron Violi missed out this time.For his part, Littleproud moved Joyce and McCormack on, talking up generation renewal while promoting Ross Cadell and Anne Webster.Liberal Jane Hume was among the biggest losers of Wednesday’s announcement. Smart, capable and energetic, Hume paid the price for Dutton’s work-from-home policy,a political stink bombthat went off just in time to alienate voters who thought their own flexible work arrangements were under threat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said Hume would still have a lot to offer from the backbench.Similarly, Nationals defector Jacinta Nampijinpa Price’s Doge portfolio is gone, and she is demoted out of shadow cabinet with defence industry and defence personnel. She angered both the Liberals and the Nationals by switching party rooms to run on Taylor’s ticket, only to sit out the vote for deputy leader after he lost to Ley.More broadly, theCoalitionis showing early signs of moving away from Trump-inspired policy, recognition of how badly links to the unpopular US president played for Dutton at the election. While we shouldn’t expect a return to the Make Australia Great Again agenda any time soon, Paterson is sure to be tough on wasteful spending in his new job in the finance portfolio.Immigration faces a Coalition reset too. Dan Tehan is moved to energy, and Queenslander Paul Scarr takes on managing overseas arrivals and international students. Scarr, a smart, details-oriented lawyer, is expected to bring an economic focus to the portfolio, putting aside the culture wars of the past term.Net zero by 2050 policieswill be an early test of any newfound Coalition harmony. Both parties are split on carbon emissions, even as Labor promises to use the next three or six years to push ahead with the transition to renewables.Leaders rarely win many friends in frontbench reshuffles. In addition to winning back millions of voters lost on 3 May, Ley and Littleproud need this lineup to heal party wounds and aid the long road back to relevance with voters.It will be anything but easy.Tom McIlroy is chief political correspondent for Guardian AustraliaExplore more on these topicsCoalitionLiberal partyNational partySussan LeyDavid LittleproudAustralian politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

As a result, hybrid work (working some days remotely and some days in the office) tends to be beneficial to productivity, or at least is not detrimental to productivity,” the report said.Studies show working from home lifts job satisfaction, and that employees were willing to sacrifice 7-8% of their pay in return for the additional flexibility and to avoid long commutes, the PC said.“Remote work also reduces breaks and sick days, and results in less distractions, all of which are typically found to be beneficial for productivity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the race for second place was a closely fought contest between the Socialist party (PS) and Chega.With 99% of the votes counted on election night itself, the provisional results had the PS and Chega tied on 58 seats each, although the socialists had a slightly larger share of the vote.But when the overseas votes were counted and added to the national tally on Wednesday, Chega reached a final total of 60 seats and won 22.76% of the vote, while the PS stayed at 58 seats but maintained its marginally higher share of the vote (22.83%).The far-right party, which was founded in 2019by the former football pundit André Ventura, has capitalised on widespread dissatisfaction with Portugal’s mainstream left and right parties as the country continues to suffer a housing crisis, stressed health and education systems, and an average monthly wage of €1,602 (£1,346). It has seen a dramatic rise in support over the past few years, winning 1.3% of the vote in 2019, 7.2% in 2022, and 18.1% last year, when its seat count shot up from 12 to 50.Ventura thanked his supporters as the final results came on Wednesday evening, saying his party’s historic performance represented a win for the entire country and showed that its political system had “changed forever today”.“What a great victory!!! Thank you to all the Portuguese who trusted us!” he wrote on X. “This historic victory is also yours, it is Portugal’s!”.The PS’s dire performance – down 20 seats on last year’s result – had already led its leader, Pedro Nuno Santos, to announce his resignation hours after the polls closed.Carlos César, the president of the PS, accepted his party’s relegation to third place a few hours before Wednesday’s final results were published, saying the writing had been on the wall for his party since election night.‘It’s a really big threat’: Portuguese minorities on the rise of the far rightRead more“We will have time, later, to reflect and to correct our paths and to once again deserve the increased trust of the Portuguese people,” he said, adding that once a new leader was chosen at the end of June, the party would have to prove that it was “an instrument of participation and innovation”.Chega’s delight at eclipsing the PS will be tempered by the knowledge that it is no closer to government because of Montenegro’s enduring refusal to strike any deals with the party.“Governing with Chega is impossible for three reasons,” Montenegro has previously said. “It isn’t reliable in its thinking; it behaves like a political weathervane, always changing its mind, and it’s not suited to the exercise of government.”The small Liberal Initiative party – which could throw its weight behind Montenegro, bringing the AD nine extra seats – has alsocategorically refusedto do anything that would help Chega into power.If invited to form a new government by the president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Montenegro’s minority government will face another fragmented and awkward legislature.The early election was triggered in March after the prime minister used a confidence vote in his government to try to head offgrowing scrutiny relating to a data protection consultancythat he founded in 2021 and which he transferred to his wife and sons the following year.Faced with questions over possible conflicts of interest, the prime minister – who has denied any wrongdoing or ethical breaches – said he hoped the vote would “end the atmosphere of permanent insinuations and intrigues”. Buthe failed to win the confidence of MPs and a fresh election was called.The electoral campaign had focused onissues such as housing, public services and safety. Immigration – one of Chega’s priorities – has also risen up the agenda, and Montenegro’s caretaker government was recentlyaccused of pandering to the far rightafter it announced the expulsion of 18,000 irregular migrants earlier this month.Chega’s vows to clean up politics – and its hardline stance on immigration and people abusing the benefits system – have recently been undermined by the kind of corruption and sleaze scandals it has been railing against.In January, Ventura’s party expelled one of its MPs after he was accused of stealing suitcases at several airports. Another member of the party was caught drunk-driving the same month, while a third has been charged with paying for oral sex with an underage male who was 15 at the time.Explore more on these topicsPortugalThe far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We will rebuild.”Matthias Ebener, a spokesperson for local authorities in the southwestern canton of Valais, said one person was missing, adding: “An unbelievable amount of material thundered down into the valley.”The rubble of shattered wooden buildings could be seen on the flanks of the huge mass of earth in the drone footage.Buildings and infrastructure in Blatten were hit hard by the rockslide, Ebener said.

Those who died included a 16-year-old and two girls who were believed to be under five years old, according to emergency services.Two children, aged three and five, were in critical condition and were taken by helicopter to a Tenerife hospital, while a three-month-old baby who was having trouble breathing was among those taken to a local hospital.As news of the tragedy broke, the country’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, expressed his “solidarity and sympathies” to the victims and their families and his “full support to those working to ease their pain”.“The tragedy that unfolded in El Hierro should move us all,” he said in a post on social media. “Lives lost in a desperate attempt to find a better future. We must rise to the occasion. It is a matter of humanity.”It was the latest tragedy to unfold on the perilous Canary Islands route, which last year claimed more than 10,400 lives, according to the NGO Caminando Fronteras.As the EU seeks to crack down on migration in the Mediterranean, people have increasingly resorted to reaching Europe via the Atlantic – one of the mostdangerous crossingsinto Europe – setting off in unstable vessels that are often unfit to face the fierce ocean currents.After arecord numberof people risked the route last year, arrivals in the Canary Islands have fallen by a third, government figures from 1 January to 15 May showed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was his third visit to the German capital since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022 and his first since Merz entered office.Merz avoided commenting on speculation as to whether Germany would deploy Taurus missiles, which was prompted by his pronouncement that range restrictions were no longer in place, enabling Kyiv to strike Russian military targets over the border.Neither leader would detail the specific weapons that would be manufactured in Ukraine, saying it was prudent to keep the information as secretive as possible.Zelenskyy said he expected the first weapons to be ready by June 2026.The expectation is that Berlin will supply Ukraine with the technical components to build and maintain its own long-range weaponry, including rockets and cruise missiles, with a range of up to 2,500km. This could enable Kyiv to better defend itself, and also save Berlin from accusations – at home in particular – that it is a war monger, helping to placate sceptics within elements of Merz’s government who fear Germany being dragged into a wider-scale conflict.The two leaders said they believed all the stops had been pulled out to solve the conflict through diplomatic means, repeatedly emphasising their conviction that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was not interested in ending the bloodshed. But they said they would continue to pursue a negotiated peace, referring to possible talks in Geneva.View image in fullscreenFriedrich Merz shakes hands with members of the Ukrainian delegation alongside Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/ReutersGermany has long supported Kyiv and is the second-biggest deliverer of weapons after the US, but relations between Zelenskyy and Merz’s predecessor, Olaf Scholz, often felt decidedly cool, and Kyiv was evidently repeatedly frustrated by the speed of Berlin’s decisions.Merz said while in opposition that he would back Ukraine in office, and Wednesday’s meeting was noticeably warmer and less tense than those between Scholz and Zelenskyy. The two leaders used the informal version of “you” to address each other, as well as referring to each other by their first names. When Zelenskyy’s microphone appeared not to be connected to the in-house interpreter, Merz quipped “German technology”, and laid a supportive hand on the Ukrainian president’s arm.As well as focusing on Germany’s continued support for Ukraine, the visit was also expected to be used to discuss efforts to bring about a ceasefire in the conflict that has run for three-and-a-half years, the German government spokesperson, Stefan Kornelius, said earlier in the day.Almost immediately on entering office earlier this month, Merz took a train to Kyiv with his French and British counterparts, Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer, as a sign of their solidarity towards Zelenskyy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He and Merz are then due to travel to the western German city of Aachen on Thursday, where the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is to receive a prize. Starmer is also due to attend, and the four leaders are expected to hold further talks there.Ukraine war briefing: Drones target Moscow forcing suspension of some flightsRead moreBefore the Berlin encounter, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, called Merz’s recent plansto build the strongest conventional army in Europe“very worrying”. Speaking at a security conference in Moscow, Lavrov said the announcement was reminiscent of “the periods of the previous century when Germany twice became the leading military power and how much trouble this brought”.There has been heightened speculation that Merz will promise to deliver longer-ranged weapons systems to Ukraine, such as Taurus missiles, after he said on Monday there were no longer any range restrictions on the weapons Germany sends to Kyiv to defend itself against Russia.However, the German government has since sought to clarify its position, saying these range restrictions had already been lifted.Merz is expected to offer his Ukrainian counterpart a multibillion-euro package including additional air defence capabilities, more weapons and financial aid with which Ukraine can buy US military equipment. It is unclear whether the package will be in addition to the €3bn (£2.5bn) in aid already agreed in March by the outgoing government.There are also expectations that a longer-term approach to helping Ukraine will be adopted. This would probably include Berlin supplying Ukraine with the technical components necessary to build and maintain its own long-range weaponry, including rockets and cruise missiles. This would enable Kyiv to defend itself more effectively without Berlin having to be concerned about being labelled a “war monger”. This in turn would make support for Ukraine more palatable to Merz’s domestic audience, among whom there is concern about Germany being dragged into a wider-scale conflict.Explore more on these topicsUkraineGermanyVolodymyr ZelenskyyFriedrich MerzRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Gaza health officials said at least one civilian had been killed and 48 injured in the incident.In a statement, GHF downplayed the episode, claimed there had been no casualties, and said it had distributed 14,550 food boxes, or 840,262 meals, according to its own calculations.Video of masses of people running in one directionBut GHF had no experience distributing food in a famine zone, and as of Wednesday, its leadership remained opaque, if not deliberately obscure. A number of executives and board members have refuted links to the group or stepped down, including Jake Wood, the ex-Marine who previously headed the group. When he resigned on Sunday, he said that it “isnot possible to implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence, which I will not abandon”. The group named John Acree, a former senior official at USAID, as its interim executive director.Both a Geneva-based company and a Delaware-based company tied to the organisation are reportedly being dissolved, a GHF spokesperson told an investigative Israeli media outlet, increasing speculation over its initiators and sources of funding. The New York Times has reported that the idea for the group came from “Israeli officials in the earliest weeks of the war” as a way to undermine Hamas.And the US state department has also distanced itself from GHF’s operations, with a spokesperson saying she could not speak to the group’s chaotic rollout or what plans could be made to extend aid to hundreds of thousands more people in Gaza who would not receive aid.“This is not a state department effort. We don’t have a plan,” Tammy Bruce, the state department spokesperson, said during a briefing on Tuesday when asked about plans to extend aid deliveries to those in the north of the Gaza Strip. “I’m not going to speculate or to say what they should or should not do.”She added that any questions about the group’s work should be addressed solely to the group.“The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has an email,” Bruce said. “You can – they should be reached out to, and that’s what I’d recommend regarding plans to expand, plans to make assessments of what’s worked and what hasn’t at this point and what changes they might make. And what the goal is – clearly the goal is to reach as many people as possible.”But when contacted by the Guardian, the group said it couldn’t provide a representative for an interview and did not immediately respond to inquiries about its current leadership, where it was registered or its links to US security contractors.The group did defend its food distribution, denying Palestinian crowds had been fired upon or that anyone had been injured at its distribution sites.A statement sent to the Guardian from GHF said that under its protocol “for a brief moment the GHF team intentionally relaxed its security protocols to safeguard against crowd reactions to finally receiving food”.The group in part blamed the “pressure” on the distribution site due to “acute hunger and Hamas-imposed blockades, which create dangerous conditions outside the gates”.The statement did not address Israel’s role in preventing deliveries of aid.“Unfortunately, there are many parties who wish to see GHF fail,” the group said.1:42Gunfire heard as thousands rush to receive aid at Gaza distribution centre – videoThe UN and other humanitarian organisations refused to work with GHF, arguing that doing so would compromise efforts to reaching civilians in all conflict zones, and put at risk both their teams and local people.“Yesterday, we saw tens of thousands of desperate people under fire, storming a militarized distribution point established on the rubble of their homes,” said Jonathan Whittall, the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.Others have described the effort as an attempt to use deliveries of aid as a political weapon.Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s top diplomat, said that the bloc opposed the “privatisation of the distribution of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid cannot be weaponized.”Explore more on these topicsGazaTrump administrationIsrael-Gaza warUS politicsPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Current verification is undertaken by a UN nuclear inspectorate, the International Atomic Energy Agency.“I want it very strong where we can go in with inspectors, we can take whatever we want, we can blow up whatever we want, but nobody getting killed. We can blow up a lab, but nobody is gonna be in a lab, as opposed to everybody being in the lab and blowing it up,” Trump said, adding that he believed he was very close to an agreement.The US president’s remarks implied, but did not confirm, that – subject to the new intrusive verification inspectorate – Iran would be allowed to continue to enrich uranium. The issue has been Tehran’s key demand in five rounds of talks between Iran and the US, which have been mediated by Oman.Iran’s nuclear chief, Mohammad Eslami, on Wednesday said the country was willing to see US inspectors enter its nuclear sites, but he insisted sovereignty required it to be entitled to enrich uranium, and not rely on imports.In a sign of the importance Iran places on retaining the right to enrich uranium, foreign minister Abbas Araghchi threatened to end all talks with European officials over its nuclear programme afterPeter Mandelson, the UK ambassador to Washington, appeared to side with previous US calls to eliminate the country’s uranium enrichment facilities.It was not clear if Lord Mandelson’s remarks during a question and answer session at the Atlantic Council in Washington revealed an unannounced change in UK policy or if, in seeking to side with US policy, he had spoken in a way to allow misinterpretation.The two sides remain at loggerheads over Iran’s continued ability to enrich uranium, which the US fears leaves open a path to an Iranian nuclear bomb.After Mandelson’s comments, Araghchi posted on social media on Wednesday: “If the UK position is ‘zero enrichment’ in Iran, there is nothing left for us to discuss on the nuclear issue.”He said such a request was a clear violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and undermined Britain’s commitments in the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPoA), the agreement to contain Iran’s civil nuclear programme that the UK and other world powers signed with Iran in 2015.Under the current JCPoA, Iran is entitled to enrich uranium to up to 3.75% purity, but the country gradually dismantled the previous UN inspection regime in protest at Trump taking the US out of the JCPoA in 2018.The British Foreign Office said when asked for comment: “We remain committed to taking every diplomatic step to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, including through snapback [of sanctions] if necessary. That is the UK’s longstanding position, which has not changed.“We have urged Iran to engage with President Trump’s offer of a negotiated solution and we continue to liaise closely with our allies and partners on this in support of regional stability and to secure peace in the Middle East.”No date has been set for a sixth round of talks. Iran has already offered to revert to much lower levels of enrichment, and for its stocks of highly enriched uranium to be put out of use, probably in a third country such as Russia.Explore more on these topicsIran nuclear dealIran's nuclear programmeIranForeign policyPeter MandelsonUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A Red Cross field hospital said injuries from the scene included women and children with gunshot wounds.Footage showed throngs of people shouting and pushing into the building while others threw bags of flour and boxes into the crowd.“Hordes of hungry people broke into WFP’s al-Ghafari warehouse in Deir al-Balah, centralGaza, in search of food supplies that were pre-positioned for distribution,” WFP said in a statement, which warned of “alarming and deteriorating conditions on the ground”.“Humanitarian needs have spiralled out of control after 80 days of complete blockade of all food assistance and other aid into Gaza,” the statement said. “Gaza needs an immediate scale-up of food assistance. This is the only way to reassure people that they will not starve.”Short clip showing people running and a helicopter in the sky firing flaresA UN envoy compared the limited aid being allowed into Gaza to “a lifeboat after the ship has sunk”. Sigrid Kaag, the acting UN special coordinator for the Middle East, told the UN security council that people facing famine in Gaza “have lost hope”.The 11-week siege and a continuing tight Israel blockade meanmost people in Gaza are desperately hungry. Medics and aid workers in the devastated Palestinian territory have said for months that malnutrition is spreading. Bakeriesoperated by the UN World Food Programmehave closed owing to a lack of cooking gas, andprices are soaringfor the limited food available in shops and markets.Crowds of people running over a collapsed fenceThe chaotic scenes came as Gaza health officials said at least one civilian had been killed and 48 injured in a separate incident at a food distribution point in the south of the territory on the previous day. Israeli troops opened fire at the newly established site as a large crowd gathered there on Tuesday.Witnesses to that incident said Israeli forces started shooting after crowds of Palestiniansbroke through the fencesaround the centre managed by a US-backed group, chosen by Israel to ship food into Gaza, which lost control of its distribution site. An Israeli military helicopter was seen firing flares and bursts of gunfire were heard in the distance. In one video, a large crowd of panicked civilians, including women and children, can be seen running away, trampling the fencing.Footage showed hundreds of Palestinians queueing alongside barbed-wire fences shortly before the incident. As the food distribution began, thousands of starving Palestinians rushed into the site, causing at least two of the fences at the entrance queue to collapse quickly. Later footage shows all the entrance row fences collapsed in the panic that followed.Ajith Sunghay, the head of the UN human rights office for thePalestinian territories, said most of the injured people were hurt by gunfire. Gaza’s health ministry said at least one person was killed.The Israeli military said it fired “warning shots” near the compound to restore control, but denied firing towards people.In a statement released on Wednesday, Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has been authorised by Israel to take over food distribution operations to bypass the UN aid mechanisms into the Palestinian territory, said: “No shots were fired at Palestinian crowds and there were no casualties.”Annotated satellite imageThe accounts of the events of Tuesday came as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said an airstrike earlier this month had killed Mohammed Sinwar, the Hamas chief in Gaza who took the position after the death of his elder brother Yahya last year. Both were planners of the 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel. Tuesday also marked the 600th day in captivity for the remaining Israeli hostages seized that day.Satellite imagery of the Gaza food distribution centre, reviewed by the Guardian, suggests the incident took place inside an areamarked by the IDFfor evacuation as recently as Sunday.Images and videos shared by the Israel Defense Forces in preparation for food distribution showed a large clearing constructed with fortifications around it, amid the bombed-out ruins of southern Gaza. Two routes with fencing were erected for entrance and exit, with the ones for entrance having five narrow fenced rows that crowds squeezed themselves into.Map of evacuation areas and food distribution pointsRecent imagery shows tables lined up end to end inside the clearing, where several armoured IDF vehicles and at least eight aid trucks were visible. Interior photos of the aid trucks showed stacks of brown boxes shabbily packed, with stickers bearing “GHF”.Children and women were caught in the crowd, and a large dust cloud from the scrambling was visible. Some Palestinians managed to get their hands on boxes of food and run away, while others grabbed what food items they could and left.Two of the boxes opened appeared to contain oil, pasta, beans, noodles, biscuits, flour, tinned food, sugar and tahini. Some videos appeared to show people lugging away bits of wood on foot and on the back of donkey carts.View image in fullscreenPalestinians receiving food packages from the US-backed foundation in western Rafah.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesIsraelimposed a blockade on all suppliesin March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters, which the group denies. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the strip faced starvation.The IPC estimatedthat nearly 71,000 children under the age of five were expected to be “acutely malnourished”, with 14,100 cases expected to be severe in the next 11 months.Annotated satellite imageThe UN and other humanitarian organisations have rejected the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people and allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population. They have also said there was a risk of friction between Israeli troops and hungry people seeking supplies.The organisations added that the newly formed group had no experience and so would not be able to handle the logistics of feeding more than 2 million people in a devastated combat zone, a prediction the dangerous scenes on Tuesday appeared to confirm.1:42Gunfire heard as thousands rush to receive aid at Gaza distribution centre – videoThe head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, said on Wednesday that the new – US-backed – distribution model was a waste of resources and a distraction from “atrocities”.“We already have an aid distribution system that is fit for purpose,” Lazzarini said. “The humanitarian community in Gaza, including Unrwa, is ready. We have the experience and expertise to reach people in need. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking towards famine, so humanitarian [work] must be allowed to do its life-saving work now.”GHF said on Wednesday there were “many parties” that wished to see them fail. The US president, Donald Trump, said his administration was working on accelerating food deliveries to Gaza.A group of NGOs, including ActionAid, said this month: “Aid that is used to mask ongoing violence is not aid, it is in fact humanitarian cover for a military strategy of control and dispossession.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

It can unfortunately happen to every one of us.”In a speech given at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, Arbel Yehoud, a freed hostage, said: ‘‘The Israeli government stands before a single choice: saving lives or abandoning them.”The October Council – made up of 1,500 families of Israelis who were killed or captured in the 7 October massacre – protested on Wednesday morning outside the residence of the Knesset speaker, Amir Ohana, in Tel Aviv. The protesters demanded earlier elections and the establishment of a state commission of inquiry.The October Council submitted a bill proposal to Ohana, calling for a dissolution of the current Knesset. The proposal states that “the government has turned its back on the families” and accused the cabinet of “outright announcing that it will not investigate the greatest disaster the State of Israel has ever known”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If the Israeli government does not heed calls for an immediate ceasefire, sanctions should be imposed, they say.The writers Horatio Clare, Kapka Kassabova and Monique Roffey organised the letter, with input from a dozen British writers, basing the text on anoriginal by Karim Kattan, published in Liberationon Monday evening, and signed by 300 Francophone writers.It opens with a poem, titled A Star Said Yesterday, by the Palestinian poet Hiba Abu Nada, who was killed by an Israeli airstrike in October 2023. “And if one day, O Light / All the galaxies / Of the entire universe / Had no more room for us / You would say: ‘Enter my heart, / There you will finally be safe.’” In the poem, Abu Nada “imagined for the people of Gaza a cosmic refuge – something utterly unlike the constant lethal danger they now face”, reads the letter.The letter goes on to say that Palestinians “are not the abstract victims of an abstract war. Too often, words have been used to justify the unjustifiable, deny the undeniable, defend the indefensible. Too often, too, the right words – the ones that mattered – have been eradicated, along with those who might have written them.”The term “genocide” “is not a slogan”, it adds. “It carries legal, political, and moral responsibilities.”The letter quotes arecent statementpublished by the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights, which says: “While states debate terminology – is it or is it not genocide? – Israel continues its relentless destruction of life in Gaza, through attacks by land, air and sea, displacing and massacring the surviving population with impunity.”The Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, has said previously that “the charge of genocide levelled against Israel is not only false, it’s outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it”.More than 53,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since 7 October 2023, according to the Gaza health ministry. More than 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas-led attack on Israel.“Just as it is true to call the atrocities committed by Hamas against innocent civilians on 7 October 2023 crimes of war and crimes against humanity, so today it is true to name the attack on the people of Gaza an atrocity of genocide,” the letter states.“We refuse to be a public of bystander-approvers,” it continues. “This is not only about our common humanity and all human rights; this is about our moral fitness as the writers of our time, which diminishes with every day we refuse to speak out and denounce this crime.“In taking this stand, we assert without reservation our absolute opposition to and loathing of antisemitism, of anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli prejudice. We reject and abhor attacks, hate and violence – in writing, speech and action – against Palestinian, Israeli, and Jewish people in all and any form. We stand in solidarity with the resistance of Palestinian, Jewish, and Israeli people to the genocidal policies of the current Israeli government.”Other signatories include Scottish Pen, Jonathan Coe, Susie Orbach, Kevin Barry, Benjamin Myers, Andrew O’Hagan, Sarah Bernstein, Philip Marsden, Fiammetta Rocco, Lucy Jones, Monique Roffey, India Knight, Nick Laird, Nina Stibbe, Seán Hewitt, Xiaolu Guo, Chris Power, Joe Dunthorne and Marina Warner.“This genocide implicates us all,” the letter concludes. “We bear witness to the crimes of genocide, and we refuse to approve them by our silence.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesZadie SmithIan McEwannewsShareReuse this content"

It is leading to a really serious fracturing of trust, which in some cases is irreparable,” he said.In a new report on social housing repairs and maintenance, theHousingOmbudsman Service reported a 474% increase in complaints about substandard living conditions between 2019/20 and 2024/25, with 72% identified as stemming from poor practice.Despite social landlords spending a record £9bn on repairs and maintenance in 2023/24, the ombudsman – which resolves disputes between residents and social landlords – ordered £3.4m in compensation for poor living conditions in 2024/25.“We’ve seen an unprecedented increase in complaints, which far exceeds the rising complaints in other sectors. What we’re seeing is exponential in comparison to other ombudsmen,” Blakeway said.The report is based on a review of hundreds of cases and more than 3,000 responses to a call for evidence. It features dozens of examples of bad practice, including a child’s bedroom window being boarded up for four years rather than replaced and collapsed ceilings containing asbestos left unrepaired for two years.View image in fullscreenAwaab Ishak died in December 2020 after being exposed to mould at his family’s social housing flat.Photograph: Family Handout/PAAgeing, poor-quality housing stock and the rising cost and complexity of repairs were two of the key drivers behind the rise in complaints. Almost half (45%) of social homes in England were built before 1964, and the percentage with damp and mould has risen from 4% in 2019 to 7% in 2023.Blakeway said policies had not kept pace with living standards, and called rules that say kitchens and bathrooms need only be replaced every 20 and 30 years respectively “a statement absent of aspiration from the world’s sixth wealthiest nation”.He added: “The baseline set for the quality of social housing is completely detached from the reality of consumer experience elsewhere. It’s completely inadequate in the 21st century.”The report found that landlords were “effectively rationing repairs services”, with one landlord’s policy referring to doing some repairs only when “resources are available” and others saying they would deal with emergencies only.It also found incidents of cases being closed before hazards were resolved because of “unevidenced claims that the resident had denied access”.Blakeway called for a “transformative overhaul” of the sector, including a national tenant body to strengthen the rights of residents and increase landlord accountability, as well as long-term funding for the sector.“These homes are only getting older, so we need a fundamental rethink on how we do maintenance and the investment required to preserve the social housing legacy which previous generations have worked hard to build,” he said.He called the model for maintaining existing social homes “unsustainable” and “a significant risk to the government’s vital housebuilding ambitions”.The government has announced plans to build 1.5m homes to tackle the country’s housing crisis, but there are reports ofinternal disputes over the level of funding for social housing.Awaab’s law, named after two-year-old Awaab Ishak, who was killed by mould in a social housing flat in Rochdale in 2020, is due to come into force from October, but the government has beencriticised for delaying its full implementationto 2027.From October, social landlords in England will have 24 hours to make emergency repairs, including to damp and mould, but will have until 2027 to begin fixing other hazards immediately, including asbestos and contaminated water supplies.Blakeway called the law “desperately needed” but still too reactive. “It improves the response, but it doesn’t prevent the issues,” he said.“Where is our aspiration? Landlord systems just haven’t modernised to move from a reactive approach to maintenance to a predictive approach, and that often creates long delays to repairs,” he added.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing,Communitiesand Local Government said: “Everyone deserves to live in a safe, secure home and despite the dire situation we have inherited, we are taking decisive action to make this a reality.“We will clamp down on damp, mould and other hazards in social homes by bringing in Awaab’s law for the social rented sector from October, while we will also introduce a competence and conduct standard for the social rented sector to ensure staff have the right skills, knowledge and experience to do their jobs effectively.”Explore more on these topicsSocial housingHousingEnglandSocial exclusionCommunitiesGrenfell Tower firenewsShareReuse this content"

Lennon said voters were very clear they believed serious environmental crimes needed to be policed and punished.“I think the bill will give people hope,” she said. “I think it’s really important to renew hope and put environmental protection at the top of the agenda.“This should give confidence to policymakers, and ensure the public knows we’re making sure our laws are fit for purpose, and closing gaps and loopholes. We just don’t talk about the nature emergency: we have a robust legal framework too.”More than 50 MSPs from all the major parties in the Scottish parliament, including the Conservatives, have supported Lennon’s decision to table the bill, which will soon go to an initial vote to confirm it can progress.Environmental campaigners are critical of theScottish government’s recent track record on the climateand nature conservation, with promised legislation watered down and spending cut. Even so, ministers in Edinburgh support Lennon’s bill in principle.Maurice Golden, a Scottish Tory MSP who backs the legislation, said the mere fact of its implementation would force companies and public agencies to be far more rigorous on environmental issues to avoid breaching it.“The context of this is an international one. We don’t want Scotland being seen as a soft touch,” he said. “What we will see, as a result of this law, is that in order to reduce the risks of malpractice, companies are going to up their game.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

He did so outside the Turkish consulate, a political institution, which provides further evidence he was not seeking to persuade others to dislike Islam, but express his personal criticism of Turkey and its stance on Islam.“His protest was specifically political and thus, it is submitted, requires the highest protection of freedom of speech.”Prosecuting, Philip McGhee said Coskun was not being prosecuted simply for the burning of the Qur’an, but for “disorderly conduct”.McGhee said of Thorne’s argument: “There is simply no misconduct in this case.”Judge McGarva ruled there was no abuse of process and dismissed the application.McGhee added that the decision to prosecute does not affect the ability of others to criticise religion. The prosecutor had earlier said Coskun had deliberately chosen the time and location of his demonstration.He went on: “His actions gave rise to a very clear threat to public order and went beyond a legitimate expression of protest, crossing the line to pose a threat to public order.”Turkey-born Coskun, who is half-Kurdish and half-Armenian, travelled from his home in the Midlands on 13 February and set fire to the Qur’an at about 2pm, the court heard.Coskun had posted on social media that he was protesting against the “Islamist government” of Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who the defendant allegedly said “has made Turkey a base for radical Islamists and is trying to establish a sharia regime”, prosecutors said.Coskun, who is an atheist, believes that he protested peacefully and burning the Qur’an amounted to freedom of expression, the court heard.Before his trial, in a quote released through the Free Speech Union, he said: “Encountering such treatment in a country like England, which I truly believed to be a place where freedom prevailed, was a real shock to me.”His legal fees are being paid for by the Free Speech Union and the National Secular Society.The Free Speech Union said it is defending him “not because we’re anti-Islam, but because we believe no one should be compelled to observe the blasphemy codes of any religion, whether Christian or Muslim”.The prosecution and defence have finished their cases, but a further hearing will take place on Thursday afternoon, with a verdict likely to come on a later date, the court heard.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Merseyside police said detectives had been granted more time to question the man, with an extension until Thursday.The force has identified 79 people who were injured in the incident on Water Street on Monday, with 50 treated in hospital. Of those, seven remained in hospital for treatment on Wednesday afternoon, all in a stable condition, police said.1:08CCTV footage shows cars moving through groups of Liverpool fans before collision – video“I’m pleased to say that the number of people in hospital is reducing as they continue to recover from the awful incident,” Det Supt Rachel Wilson said. “I want to reassure the public of Merseyside that detectives are making significant progress as we seek to establish the full circumstances that led to what happened.”The police and Liverpool council have said that traffic management plans were in operation at the event, including rolling road closures and hostile vehicle measures.The Merseyside police assistant chief constable Jenny Sims said on Tuesday: “We had worked extensively with event organisers and key partner agencies in the months ahead of the potential parade, and a robust traffic management plan was put in place, which included a number of local authority road closures throughout the route and the city centre.“This included Water Street, which was closed to traffic. It is believed the driver of the Ford Galaxy car involved in the incident was able to follow an ambulance on to Water Street, after the roadblock was temporarily lifted so that the ambulance crew could attend to a member of the public who was having a suspected heart attack.”​It is understood planning for this year’s parade began in February and was subject to rigorous testing which met national standards. ​The budget was​ also increased significantly ​from previous parades to enhance security, with​ costs met in full by Liverpool FC.​“Hostile​ vehicle ​mitigation​” measures ​were in place along the 15km route. The plan included road closures and traffic diversions as well as road closure signage, traffic cones, accredited traffic stewards and ​traffic ​management ​vehicles, which were supported by police vehicles at key junctions.As a final barrier, the measures included a 3.5 tonne HGV, used to prevent access from hostile vehicles to Water Street. This was an identified “red route” for emergency vehicle access.Map of area where the collision occurred.However, many fans who attended the parade have said they had feared something could happen as “vehicles were edging and pushing through crowds” who had lined the streets to watch.Paul Marsden, 57, a quality and risk manager from Flint, who had been watching the parade nearby, said: “I have to say, I wasn’t surprised. I saw time and again vehicles edging and pushing through crowds leading up to the parade and during it. I warned my sons to stay back because I could recall the Nice terror attack ploughing through crowds.”He added: “I understand police and authorities want to keep parade access open for as much as possible but there needs to be lessons learned. When hundreds of thousands of people are close together, the traffic must be cordoned off with barriers protecting the whole route and not just the endpoints.”Phil Williams, from Sunderland, who was watching the parade with his 15-year-old son Harry, said he had not seen “any traffic control measures to prevent him and other cars coming along there the way they did”.“I’m absolutely staggered that the road closures didn’t go further,” he added.Adrian Littlermore, 59, from Winchester, said that even outside the city centre, pedestrians were being “pushed into the road”.He said: “You could tell the police there weren’t happy and were asking each other who was letting the cars through. There were probably 20 let through by the time we left and it was sectioned off so badly they were practically driving into the crowds.“Police on the ground were doing their best, I don’t fault them at all, but it was clear it wasn’t under control. I’m not sure at one point, at the planning stage, if there was a breakdown in communication, but there were cars going where they weren’t supposed to be.“There were people having to move their feet so the wheels didn’t go over them and people with buggies just having to stand in front of them to get between them and the cars. The drivers looked scared stiff as well, they didn’t want to be there. It wasn’t the fault of the police there, but it was like a free-for-all.”On Wednesday the prime minister visited Merseyside police headquarters and met the deputy chief constable , assistant chief constable, the police and crime commissioner, Emily Spurrell, and the metro mayor, Steve Rotheram.At the start of the meeting, Keir Starmer said: “Thank you all for making time. It’s really important for me to be here. The scenes on Monday were just awful, to see how incredible joy at an amazing achievement turned to horror in a moment.“Steve, the mayor, has been keeping me informed and updated, along with my team, but it’s really important to be here to go through this first-hand with you, so thank you for making time and ensuring that I get to see the detail in the way that I’d like to.”Rotheram said later that those who had assisted after the incident “encapsulated the true spirit” of the city.“The response from so many to such a shocking incident has shown the very best of our region at a very difficult time,” he said.“Scousers reacted, as I knew that they would, offering food and drink, warmth, somewhere to rest, even lifts across the country, and simple gestures like somewhere to charge phones or to help contact loved ones.“As the injured recover and the city returns to normality, I hope that in time people will remember a spectacular parade of colour and joy.“Thank you once again for those that assisted in whatever capacity and from wherever you come from, because you encapsulated the true spirit of this place that we’re so lucky to call home.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsLiverpool (UK news)Liverpool (Football)newsShareReuse this content"

Mahmood has insisted that she must take drastic action to cut prison overcrowding or risk the collapse of the criminal justice system.Recommendations from David Gauke’s sentencing review, which proposed less jail time for thousands of offenders including some violent criminals and domestic abusers, wereaccepted in principle by Mahmoodlast week.These recommendations would allow prisoners in England and Wales to be eligible for releaseafter serving a third of their sentence, and would drop short custodial sentences for nearly all offenders and allow suspended sentences for up to three years.On Wednesday morning, Rowley told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme that the plans would “generate a lot of work for police”.“We’ve asked the Ministry of Justice for the data so that we can understand the exact detail of the types of offenders who will in the future be in communities, so we can work through what the consequence of that are,” he said.Rowley said the decision would further stretch the resources of police forces still struggling to recover from financial cuts.“We’re carrying the scar tissue of years of austerity cuts, and forces are much smaller when you compare the population they’re policing than they were a decade or 15 years ago,” he said.Responding to Rowley, a government source said that police, including Rowley himself, had been consulted by officials and politicians in the months leading up to the publication of the review. Rowley met Mahmood last week before the sentencing review was published, it is understood.“The department and David Gauke consulted with police. The justice secretary accepted the recommendations ‘in principle’, but always said that further detail would come forward with the bill. The impact assessment will be published when the bill comes before parliament,” the source said.Officials from the Ministry of Justice are currently drawing up legislation based on the elements that were passed in principle before parliament. They hope that a bill could be put forward before summer recess.Police remain concerned that the principles have been drawn up before the impacts upon policing have been taken into account. A police source said: “More criminals in the community will result in more work for police officers. After a decade of keeping things on an even keel, the cash reserves have been eaten through.”Rowley also joined the head ofMI5and the National Crime Agency in writing to the justice ministry to predict that plans to release prisoners early could be to the “net detriment to public safety”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They predicted the next spending round could jeopardise Keir Starmer’s promise to halve knife crime and violence against women and girls, and to appoint 13,000 additional frontline officers.In a further development, police chiefs in England and Wales have said they want fewer, larger forces, amid financial shortages and difficulties dealing with fraud and updating technology.The current structure of 43 geographical forces was established in the 1960s and there have long been concerns that the model is not fit for purpose.As the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) published the police data strategy for 2025 to 2030 on Thursday, force bosses called for a redesign of the structure of policing in England and Wales.The NPCC chair, Gavin Stephens, said: “We need police forces that are strong and capable to be able to use technology … that are able to respond to a range of threats that might emerge in their local area and be resilient to those.“At the moment, the system is not resilient, so I would absolutely argue for bigger, capable forces led by a stronger national centre.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationUK criminal justicePoliceMark RowleyShabana MahmoodMetropolitan policeMI5newsShareReuse this content"

The Qataris have given the president aBoeing747-8, a stretch model of the jumbo that is more than 18ft longer than the much older 747-200B that flies as the current Air Force One.0:41Airplane gifted by Qatar 'much too big', laments Donald Trump – video“Frankly, it’s much too big,” Trump told reporters during a question-and-answer media session in the Oval Office at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, as he tried to explain why he regarded it as a gift to the nation rather than a perk for him as an individual.Trump is stretching his pardon power – to the delight of his Maga acolytesRead moreHe called the new jet a “beautiful, big, magnificent, free airplane for the United States air force”. Trump continued: “They tried to say: ‘Oh, it’s Trump’s airplane.’ Oh, yeah, sure. It’s too big, frankly, it’s much too big.”The original offer from Qatar set off a firestorm ofcriticismof Trump, fromboth political parties, particularly following his visit to the country earlier this month where he focused most vigorously on trade and business deals. The US senator Cory Booker and other prominent Democratsslammedthe arrangement and Chris Murphy, the Connecticut senator, called the gift “the definition of corruption” and “wildly illegal”.Asked on Wednesday whether the jet is definitely going to become Air Force One, the official plane of the US president, Trump said only that the aircraft was in the US and “being re-fitted for military standard”.He admitted he doesn’t know how much the re-fitting will cost but guessed “a hell of a lot less than building a new one”. He again criticized Boeing, the troubled US aircraft manufacturer, for delays in replacing the current jet used as Air Force One, which dates back to the early 1990s, apparently necessitating an expedited replacement from another country.This article was modified on 28 May 2025 to clarify the context in which Donald Trump said the jet gifted byQatarwas too big.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpQatarBoeingnewsShareReuse this content"

The wide-ranging bill will extend tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term, create new deductions for tips, overtime and car loan interest and fund mass deportations, while slashing federal social safety net programs.Hinson drew a chorus of boos when she told the audience in the town of Decorah that she was “proud” to have voted for the bill. “This is your time,” she said over the din. A similar outburst occurred from the audience at mention of Doge, which Hinson said she had received positive feedback about during an event elsewhere.Republican senator Tommy Tuberville launches run for Alabama governorRead moreThe crowd broke into cheers when a constituent who identified himself as Steve Peterson referred to Trump’s acceptance ofa jet from Qatarandpromotion of his own memecoinand asked Hinson: “Could you help me understand why you are silent about this corruption?”“I think it’s really unfair to imply that I like to see corruption in Washington DC. I reject that premise wholeheartedly. I am here answering your questions in public because I care about transparency,” replied Hinson, who added that the jet was acquired from Qatar “ethically”.First elected in 2020, Hinson’s north-east Iowa district leans towards the GOP, but has been represented by Democrats in the past. At least one attendee at her town hall identified herself as a Democrat, and the county party noted that Hinson would be holding events in the district on Wednesday.Similar scenes have played out at town halls held by Republican lawmakers in Iowa and elsewhere. The state’s long-serving senator Chuck Grassley wasgrilled last monthby constituents over his support for Trump’s hardline immigration policies, while in Georgia, policeused a stun gun on two peopleduring a town hall held by Marjorie Taylor Greene, a fervent Trump supporter.Democrats hope the public discontent is a sign that voters are ready to sweep them back into the majority in the House next year, and the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, which coordinates House campaigns, reportedly advised lawmakers to stop holding town halls.Hinson was not alone in facing questions over her support for Trump’s Big Beautiful bill, which passed the House narrowly and awaits consideration by SenateRepublicans.On Tuesday, Mike Flood, a Republican congressman, faced a raucous crowd at his town hall in Seward, Nebraska, and admitted he was not aware that the bill contained language that could prevent federal judges from enforcing injunctions or restraining orders, several of which have been issued against Trump administration policies.“I am not going to hide the truth. This provision was unknown to me when I voted for that bill,” said Flood, who added he had expressed his disapproval to senators.Explore more on these topicsRepublicansDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This spring, he’s back in the Mexican state of Tlaxcala frantically searching Facebook for a job on one of the thousands of farms across the US that primarily employ guest workers like him.Mendez is one of the more than 300,000 foreign agricultural workers who comes to the US every year on an H-2A visa, which allows him to temporarily work plowing fields, pruning trees and harvesting crops in states from Washington to Georgia, Florida to New York, Texas to California. But as federal immigration policies change rapidly, farmers and workers alike are uncertain about their future.“Without [this guest worker program], I believe agriculture in the US would decline a lot because people there don’t want to do the work,” Mendez said.As the fate of the hundreds of thousands of undocumented farm workers remains in limbo amidDonald Trump’s mass deportation threats, and the administration’s H-2A policies are undecided, the future of these guest workers remains unclear. Their numbers grow each year – and they are increasingly central to an industry historically dominated by undocumented workers. The industry isn’t creating new jobs either.Farmers agree with farm workers like Mendez. They say they cannot attract other workers to their rural fields.The debate over guest workers is dividing Republican support.Jonathan Berry, who was nominated to be the solicitor at the Department of Labor, wrote thelabor chapterforProject 2025, the rightwing proposal to overhaul the government from the Heritage Foundation thinktank. That section advocates for replacing H-2A workers with local workers and automation. While technology could replace some specific farm tasks, many crops still depend primarily on human labor, and small farmers say they can’t afford to invest in equipment that could take more than a decade to pay off. Other co-authors of the chapter, such as economist Oren Cass, do not think the jobs should be eliminated, but thatfarmers should improve working conditions to attract citizensto them instead.On the other hand, Trump’s power depends on a coalition that includes agricultural communities, whovoted for him at almost 80%in 2024, according to Investigate Midwest, a journalism non-profit. Agribusiness alsodonated more than $24mto his re-election. Farm groups insist US citizens are unwilling to do the arduous labor and that eliminating H-2A workers could collapse the food system. They generally advocate for loosening regulations for H-2A workers, like reducing wage and housing requirements. Trump heeded their calls before. In 2019, hisDepartment of Labor unsuccessfully proposedremoving some regulations on the H-2A.HarvestseasonapproachingAs seasonal harvests begin, farmers nationwide are bringing over workers.At Crist Bros Orchards in Walden, New York, H-2A workers diligently prune back apple tree branches covered with white flowers freshly burst from pink buds so that each future apple will get the same access to the sun. At the packing house, some load last season’s apples out of refrigerators on to conveyor belts while others check for irregularities before packaging.The orchard has been in the Crist family since 1883, and Jenny Crist now runs it alongside her brother and parents. She said their first wave of workers came this past March and are preparing the orchards for harvest, when more workers come to pluck apples off the trees. By the end of the year, more than 150 H-2A workers will have passed through the compound to help produce the apples sold at supermarkets down the east coast.H-2A workers prune apple trees at Crist Bros Orchards in Walden, New York, on 28 April 2025.Photograph: Tareq Saghie/Puente News Collaborative“[H-2A is] providing labor that allows us to have a farm 70 miles north of New York City, and provide food in the United States, and employ people year-round,” Crist said. “Without it, we would certainly not be farming apples. My guess is that this would probably be houses.”The H-2A visa was created by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, a huge measure that simultaneously cracked down on employers hiring immigrants without work authorization and provided “amnesty” to close to 3 million immigrants without legal status. The law says that farmers must demonstrate an attempt to hire locally first and pay H-2A workers above the minimum wage. Unlike local workers, H-2A workers must also be provided transportation to and from their homes, housing for the season and daily transportation.Labor leaders argue farmers prefer H-2A workers, despite their costs, because they are easily exploitable. Since the visa is connected to their employment, workers cannot find a job elsewhere, making their ability to be in the country completely dependent on an employer who can revoke it at any moment, and sometimesholds on to their passports, against DOL requirements.This reluctance to leave an abusive worksite can be compounded by the fact thatmany H-2A workers arrive with debtthey have accrued from paying recruiters to get here. Employers are required to pay all recruitment costs, but recruiters’ practices go largely unregulated since they operate internationally.The situation of agriculture workers in the US is really bad already, but what they’re going to do is legalize this oppression.The DC-basedEconomic Policy Institute, a liberal thinktank, has said this amounts to a program that exploits and silences migrant workers, replacing year-round workers in the process. In some cases, US prosecutors have accused farmers andrecruitersof using the H-2A program to engage in forcedlabor trafficking.An abandoned camp stands in Socorro, Texas, where seasonal farm workers passed through as part of the controversial Bracero program, on 14 April 2025. The H-2A program is the successor to the Bracero program.Photograph: Tareq Saghie/Puente News Collaborative“The situation of agriculture workers in the US is really bad already, but what they’re going to do is legalize this oppression,” said Carlos Marentes, executive director of the El Paso-based Centro de Los Trabajadores Agrícolas Fronterizos. “In the H-2A program, the way they’re proposing to get rid of the regulations and any guarantees that workers get is going to look like legalized slavery. The industry understands that they need a labor force, but they [want] a labor force that is going to be afraid, that is going to be grateful because the employer is providing you a job.”Undocumentedworkersleftbehind?If mass deportations go forward as promised, growers and ranchers will be even more desperate for these workers. Undocumented workers compose about 40% of the agricultural workforce, according to theUS Department of Agriculture.These longtime farm workers say that the system is designed to replace them with this more vulnerable group, limiting their work opportunities and decreasing their union’s power by giving farmers an alternative labor pool.“It’s very clear to us that the deportation of undocumented workers is to clear the field for bringing in H-2A workers instead of having these farm worker families that are part of our community now for over 20 years and providing them [legal] status to continue being productive community members,” said Rosalinda Guillen, a farm union leader in Washington state who grew up in the fields and founded Community to Community, a local non-profit. “Everybody in this country is an immigrant and has had the opportunity to build community and root themselves and all of a sudden the families that came here from Mexico don’t?”In 2023, a bipartisan coalition in the House of Representatives introduced the Dignity Act, which aimed to address this by extending legal status to long-term farm workers while at the same time expanding the H-2A visa. The proposal eventually failed, though, afterRepublicans reversed course on it.Workers still neededIn Minnesota’s Red River valley, Scott Field runs Field Brothers Farm with his brother John, growing grains, beans and sugar beets on the same land his family has worked for five generations. His local community has shrunk as younger generations moved to cities, leaving the Field brothers dependent on H-2A workers.“There is just flat out nobody out here available to work,” Scott Field said.With housing and transportation factored in, Field says they spend more than $30 an hour on H-2A workers. It would be easier if they could just employ them as US citizens, he said as he detailed why.“These are people who are working, making money, spending money in our communities, and paying taxes. Talk about a revitalization of Rural America if they made it easier for them to come here and stay with their families,” Field said.Changes to the H-2A visa would also probably be felt in Mexico, whereover 91% of the H-2A workers come from. Some have small subsistence farms, or are part of the 2 million people who became landless with the 1994 onset of theNorth American Free Trade Agreement, and depend on their seasonal incomes to provide their families with basic necessities.Workers conduct the final inspection before packaging at Crist Bros Orchards in Walden, New York, on 28 April 2025.Photograph: Tareq Saghie/Puente News CollaborativeFlavio Vázquez has worked at Crist Bros Orchards for the last five years, earning more than double in an hour packing applesthan what he could in a day in his home in the Mexican state of Morelos. According to 2020estimates, more than half of Morelos’s population lives in poverty despite unemployment being below 2%. The fact that the visa allows him to escape poverty doesn’t mean that it is ideal for him, though.Vázquez must spend eight months a year living between a warehouse and a dorm 2,500 miles away from his loved ones, relieved to be earning a higher income, but at a cost. While he enjoys his job in New York’s Hudson valley, he wishes he could bring his family and build a permanent life.“In Morelos, the situation is difficult, so I come here to stabilize the community there economically and to have resources for my family,” Vázquez said, looking resigned as apple-scanning machinery roared in the background.“In Mexico, you leave your children, your wife, your parents, who support you emotionally. I would feel a lot more comfortable with my family here.”This story was co-published withPuente News Collaborativein partnership withPalabraand the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University at the City of New York (Cuny).

It reported $44.1bn in revenue in the quarter ending in April, up 69% from the previous year.The company exceeded investors’ predictions of $43.3bn in revenue. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.81, under investor expectations of an adjusted earnings per share of 88 cents. The company also reported $39.1bn in data center revenue, up 73% from the year prior.The company is a bellwether for the business of artificial intelligence, both in its cutting-edge hardware and the new regulatory headwinds it is facing, and investors are watching closely.“Nvidia beat expectations again but in a market where maintaining this dominance is becoming more challenging,” emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said. “The China export restrictions underscore the immediate pressure from geopolitical headwinds, but Nvidia also faces mounting competitive pressure as rivals like AMD gain ground on cost-effectiveness metrics for certain AI workloads.”The Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement: “Global demand for Nvidia’s AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure – just like electricity and the internet – and Nvidia stands at the center of this profound transformation.”The chipmaker said it expects to see $45bn in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026.Nvidia’s quarterly reports for the past year have shown explosive growth. The company faces increasing pressure from the US.Donald Trump’s April announcement that the administration was tightening export rules on computer chips effectively banned Nvidia from selling its H20 AI chips to China, a major source of revenue.“H20 products were designed primarily for the China market,” the company’s first quarter earnings report read. As a result, Nvidia said it expects to miss out on $8bn in revenue in the second quarter.Still, Huang seemed optimistic about Trump’s plans to allow companies to potentially export more limited capacity chips to China.“The president has a plan, he has a vision and I trust him,” Huang said.That said, Huang warned that missing out on the potential $50bn AI market in China risks US leadership in the global AI infrastructure race. “China is one of the world’s largest AI markets and a springboard to global success,” Huang said on the earnings call.“China’s AI moves on with or without US chips,” he said. “It has the compute to train or deploy an advanced model. The question is not whether China will have AI – it already does. The question is whether one of the world’s largest AI markets will run on American chips.”The companyrevealedin a recent SEC filing that the change would cost the company $5.5bn in charges. The company said it saw just $4.6bn in charges “associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 diminished” in the first quarter. The charges came in at just under expectations because they were able to reuse some materials.In aninterviewwith Ben Thompson, Huang said the move was “deeply painful” and couldresult in $15bn in revenue loss.In just the first quarter, the company was also “unable to ship an additional $2.5bn of H20 revenue”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In that sense, the $4.5bn H20 impact during the quarter ultimately highlighted Nvidia’s adaptability to changing market conditions – a trait that will remain critical throughout the rest of the year, at minimum.”Analysts also say they think negotiations between the US and China “could yield positive results for Nvidia”, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.“There is one chip in the world fueling the AI Revolution and its Nvidia … that narrative is clear from these results and the positive commentary from Jensen,” said Ives. “This is a very important guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the Trump tariff war playing out.”While the company’s business in China remains up in the air, analysts seem heartened by recent demand for Nvidia chips in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Nvidia was among the beneficiaries of the AI windfall that arose from Trump’svisitto the region, which resulted in Saudi Arabia committing to $600bn to US companies.Nvidia said it will sell hundreds of thousands of AI chips to Saudi Arabia, including 18,000 of its latest chip, Blackwell, to a Saudi sovereign wealth-fund backed startup called Humain.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyNvidiaQuarterly resultsnewsShareReuse this content"

The president also said he was “not happy about certain aspects of it, but I’m thrilled by other aspects of it” and confirmed he would be negotiating the legislation.The remarks come after Musk said he was “disappointed to see the massive spending bill, which increases the budget deficit … and undermines the work that the Doge team is doing” in comments made to CBS as part of a longer interview due to run on its Sunday morning programme this weekend.‘Nonsense and stupid’: Trump’s tariff war will cause global damage, says Grosvenor bossRead moreMusk had been leading the “department of government efficiency” (Doge) since January, which was given the task of cutting state spending. He later announced in April he would bestepping back from the Trump administrationafter Tesla’s earnings plunged, andspending millions of dollarsin a supreme court race that his Republican candidate ultimately lost.Musk now appears to be hitting out at Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was narrowlyapproved last weekby the House of Representatives.The bill pushes ahead with a number of Trump’s campaign promises, including extending tax cuts for individuals and corporations and ending clean energy incentives enacted under Joe Biden.It also involves about $1tn (£741bn) in cuts to benefits aimed at supporting struggling households, including a health insurance scheme for low-income families, Medicaid, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) food stamps.However, the bill also funds the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico, as well as staff and facilities for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. Even when taking cuts into account, the bill is expected to add about $2.3tn to the deficit, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.Musk told CBS: “I think a bill can be big, or it can be beautiful. But I don’t know if it can be both. My personal opinion.”The comments will fuel rumours of a growing rift between the billionaire and the US president, whom Musk helped bankroll last year. In total, Musk’ssuper political action committee donated $200mto Trump’s presidential campaign before the November election, which many credit with helping to return Trump to the White House.Musk also has business interests at stake, with Trump’s bill due to end a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles and to impose a $250 annual registration fee for owners. The Tesla boss has previously called for an end to those incentives, although that was months before the EV maker’s earnings started to wobble.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tesla’s stock has also suffered, with the company losing about a quarter of its market value since Musk took a top spot in Trump’s administration at the start of the year.Musk’s criticism is likely to fuel opposition by hardline Republicans, whothreatened to block Trump’s legislationas it passes through the US senate unless the president rolls out deeper cuts that would reduce the national debt. One key senator, Rand Paul from Kentucky, told Fox News Sunday that the bill’s cuts were “wimpy and anaemic” and would “explode the debt”.However, Trump has already been treading on politically sensitive territory by supporting a bill that makes big cuts to programmes he promised to protect. He pledged multiple times on the campaign trail last year that he would not touch basic safety nets, including Medicaid.Some of the president’s “make America great again” supporters, including the former White House strategist Steve Bannon, have also warned against such a move, with one Missouri senator, Josh Hawley, saying that cutting health insurance for the working poor would be “politically suicidal”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskDonald TrumpUS taxationUS politicsUS economyTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

The world’s richest person claimed that he was back to working around the clock at his companies – to the point of sleeping in conference rooms and factory offices once again.Musk has been telegraphing a pivotback to his businessesfor months, but in recent appearances, he has repeatedly distanced himself from his unpopular stint in Washington while proclaiming that his new sole focus is his tech empire. It is a drastic turnaround for Musk, who spent most of the last year constantly at Trump’s side promoting far-right ideology online, appearing on stage at political rallies and pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the Republican party.The shift, which comes amid public and investor backlash against Musk’s political ambitions, was apparent earlierthis week as SpaceXlaunched and lost control of its Starshipprototype rocket. Musk gave a round of media appearances to the Washington Post, Ars Technica, CBS News Sunday Morning and a YouTube aerospace influencer, all of which featured him emphasizing his dedication to his companies or attempting to explain away the shortcomings of hisheavily criticized“department of government efficiency”.“The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,” Musk told the Washington Post on Tuesday. “I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.”Musk additionally told the Post that Doge had been turned into a “whipping boy” that was criticized for anything that went wrong under theTrump administration. In Ars Technica, Musk admitted: “I think I probably did spend a bit too much time on politics.”A White House official confirmed on Wednesday night that Musk was leaving the Trump administration, and told Reuters that his “off-boarding will begin tonight.”Musk did not have a formal conversation with Trump before announcing his departure, Reuters reported, citing a source with knowledge of the situation. The source added that Musk’s exit was decided “at a senior staff level.”Trump confirms he’ll be negotiating his signature tax bill after Musk criticismRead moreBashing Trump’s tax billThe turn from Trump’s self-appointed “first buddy” back to the familiar territory of space travel and tech has taken place as Doge facesnumerous legal challengesand remains widely unpopular.Although Musk successfully seeded the government with his allies and helped gut regulators that would oversee his companies, Doge’s central promise to slash $2tn worth of fraud and waste has been an obvious failure. Doge’s cuts, while devastating to government services,humanitarian aidand the federal workforce, have amounted to little in terms of actual budget savings. Much of the savings it has claimed on its “wall of receipts” have alsoturned out to be false, including the cancellation of an $8bn contract that in reality was an $8m contract.Musk’s answer for Doge’s shortcomings appears to be casting the blame on some of his familiar foes: politicians and bureaucrats. In doing so, however, he has increasingly split with the Republican party – though notably stopped short of any criticism of Trump himself.Musk’s split with Congressional Republicans has been starkest on X, the social media platform that he owns. Musk’s posts have fully leaned into the narrative that Doge’s actions were successfully reducing waste, but that Congress hamstrung its operations through actions like approving Trump’s tax bill, which isexpected to add $2.3tnto the deficit.Musk told CBS that he was “disappointed to see the massive spending bill, which increases the budget deficit …  and undermines the work that the Doge team is doing”.Now, Musk claims, he will focus on saving humanity through technologies like self-driving cars, interplanetary rockets and humanoid robots – exactly the products his companies need investors to believe in.“I have come to the perhaps obvious conclusion that accelerating GDP growth is essential,” Musk posted on Friday in response to a thread calling the GOP bill “disastrous” and demanding term limits on Congress. “Doge has and will do great work to postpone the day of bankruptcy of America, but the profligacy of government means that only radical improvements in productivity can save our country.”In a separate exchange, he replied to a conversation between two users with large followings who routinely praise his leadership and business acumen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Numerous polls showed his overall popularity declining even as people supported the premise of reducing government inefficiencies. Musk’s prominent involvement in a Wisconsin supreme court election intensified opposition to his influence, while international demonstrations made him the face of the administration. Musk also found few friends within the Trump administration, with report after report ofheated clasheswith senior officials and some Republican political operatives warning his brand had become too toxic for the party.The pushback against Musk affected his businesses, causing Tesla sales to plummet to the point that the company’s board reportedlybegan considering replacing him as CEO. While Musk denied those claims, in recent weeks he has very loudly reaffirmed his dedication to leading his businesses.“Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,” he posted on Saturday. “I must be super focused on 𝕏/xAI andTesla(plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.”While only a few weeks ago Musk’s posts on X were a nonstop stream of invectives against Democrats, fringe theories about immigration and demands to gut the judicial system, his online output has also changed. His posts this week have been heavily focused on SpaceX’s ambitions to go to Mars and Tesla’s self-driving car program, stopping only occasionally to promote attacks against “the woke mind virus” orfeud withthe government of his native South Africa.As Musk moves away from full-time politics and tries to win back investor confidence, he has also doubled down on his habit of making grandiose predictions of how his technologies will transform the world. Echoing a long list of previous claims that havemissed deadlines and so far failed to come to fruition, he has promoted new endeavors like Tesla’s humanoid robots as crucial to the future of civilization.“Once you have humanoid robots, the actual economic output potential is tremendous. It’s really unlimited,” Musk said on stage at the Saudi-US Investment Forum on 13 May. “Potentially, we could have an economy 10 times the size of the global economy, where no one wants for anything.”Rather than dwell on a year of missed targets and intense backlash, Musk is back to selling a future where anything is possible.Lois Beckett contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS newsElon MuskTrump administrationArtificial intelligence (AI)US politicsDonald TrumpTeslaanalysisShareReuse this content"

That was the moment when Cold Palmer finally emerged, decided that enough was enough and took an icy hold on a final that was in danger of running away from Chelsea. That was the moment when disaster was averted, Betis’s hopes of winning the Uefa Conference League faded and it became clear that Todd Boehly, Behdad Eghbali and the rest of Chelsea’s leadership team would be on the pitch at full time, drinking it all in after claiming their first piece of silverware in the men’s game since their takeover in 2022.Chelsea’s billion-pound boys take charge and show clinical cutting edge | Nick AmesRead moreThe predictability of the outcome did not make the feeling any less sweet for Boehly and Eghbali after a season that began with their differences getting a very public airing. Really, though, this was all about one very special individual. There have been countless signings under thisChelseaownership but none as smart as the £40m spent on buying Palmer from Manchester City.He is a unique talent, a maverick whose personality and skill defined this contest. So what if Chelsea still resemble Cole Palmer FC in times of trouble? They would have been lost without him accepting the responsibility of scrubbing out Betis’s 1-0 lead by sparking a turnaround with gorgeous assists for Enzo Fernández and Nicolas Jackson.There could be no better demonstration of why Palmer deserves to hear the Champions League anthem before his next European assignment. It was an astonishing five minutes from the 23-year-old. Betis chased their first European trophy but the financial gulf told in the end. There was no romance in Manuel Pellegrini, the 71-year-old Chilean, and his band of Premier League cast-offs running out of steam succumbing to a 4-1 defeat after further strikes from Moisés Caicedo and Jadon Sancho, who will hope he has done enough for his loan from Manchester United to be made permanent.View image in fullscreenNicolas Jackson puts Chelsea into the lead after Cole Palmer’s second sublime assist in five minutes.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesThe weird thing is that Chelsea were booed off at half-time. They were appalling during the first half, falling behind to a sloppy goal and offering nothing in attack. Enzo Maresca, who delighted insticking it to his criticsafter clinching Champions League qualification last weekend, got his initial tactics badly wrong. Malo Gusto, a right-back by trade, had a nightmare as an auxiliary midfielder. Betis led through Abde Ezzalzouli and could have had more. It was just as well that Chelsea emerged with more intensity in the second half.It had been a relief to focus on the football after two daysmarred by idiotic violence involving supportersof both sides in the city centre. The longing came from Betis, who were thrilled to be in their first European final. Chelsea, by contrast, did not fill their allocation.Maresca tells Chelsea players European trophy can build ‘winner mentality’Read moreThey struggled during the first 30 minutes. The mind went back to Gary Neville branding Chelsea “billion-pound bottle jobs” after they lost to Liverpool’s kids in last season’s Carabao Cup final. The touches were loose and the early tactical battle was won by Pellegrini targeting the space left by Gusto drifting inside from right-back. The Frenchman was one of five changes from Maresca and was culpable when Betis scored in the ninth minute, a slack pass into midfield intercepted, leaving Isco to send Ezzalzouli through to fire a low shot past Filip Jörgensen.Chelsea were shambolic. Ezzalzouli was tormenting Gusto. Isco, a European champion on five occasions with Real Madrid, was running the show. Jörgensen saved from Marc Bartra and Benoît Badiashile made a vital block to deny Johnny Cardoso.Maresca, who calls Pellegrini his footballing father, used the break to correct his error of leaving out Reece James. The captain came on for Gusto and gave Chelsea more poise on the right. The mood shifted, Betis tiring. Antony was the Antony of Manchester United on the Betis right. Ezzalzouli limping off was a blow for Pellegrini.View image in fullscreenMoisés Caicedo, Chelsea’s player of the season, fires in the fourth goal to cap a fantastic night for the club.Photograph: Darko Vojinović/APChelsea took control in midfield, Fernández and Caicedo dominating. But still we waited for Palmer. He has struggled since Christmas. The goals and assists have dried up. He picked a good moment to stir. His influence grew and Chelsea were level when he lifted in a feathery cross for Fernández, who ghosted in to head past Adrián.Now Palmer was irrepressible. Soon he twisted past the Betis substitute, Jesús Rodríguez, and slammed in another cross from the right for Jackson to chest home.

Diggs reportedly has been romantically linked to rapperCardi B, who was present on the yacht.Patriots new head coach Mike Vrabel addressed the matter to begin his press conference on Wednesday.Bradshaw: Steelers should leave Rodgers to ‘chew on bark and whisper to gods’Read more“It’s something that we’re aware of and obviously we want to make great decisions on and off the field,” Vrabel said on Wednesday prior to voluntary OTAs at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.“We’re hoping that with our time here on the field today, and that when we don’t have a script, and we’re on the call-out periods that we’re making great decisions. So the message will be the same for all our players that we’re trying to make great decisions. Any conversations that I’ve had with Stefon will remain between him and I and the club.”Signed to a three-year, $69m contract, Diggs was not present for Wednesday’s practice. He is rehabilitating a torn ACL sustained last October while playing for the Houston Texans.“The timelines, and the prognosis, we’re working hard to get him back and be ready to go. When he’s here, we’ll coach him and have him ready to go,” Vrabel said.Diggs, 31, is a two-time All-Pro and four-time Pro Bowl selection. Since entering the league in 2015, he is third in receptions (857), trailing only Travis Kelce (939) and Davante Adams (919). From 2018 through 2023, he posted six consecutive 1,000-yard seasons.Diggs had 107 receptions for 1,183 yards and eight touchdowns for the Buffalo Bills in 2023. He was traded to the Texans last offseason and got off to a fast start with 47 receptions for 496 yards and three touchdowns in eight games before being injured.The dynamic wideout is expected to give young quarterback Drake Maye a reliable No 1 target and improve the New England offense, which finished last in passing yards last season (2,995).Explore more on these topicsNew England PatriotsNFLCardi BUS sportsShareReuse this content"

After demolishing Raducanu 6-0, 6-1in the third roundof the Australian Open in January, Swiatek now holds a 5-0 record against the Briton.Before the match, during an interview with Tim Henman for TNT Sports, Raducanu’s ad hoc coach Mark Petchey was asked what his charge would have to do well in order to defeat Swiatek. His answer was immediate and blunt: “Everything.”The pressure that Swiatek places on her opponents to play past their limits was immediately evident on Raducanu’s serve as she went big at the very first moment. After missing a 180kmh first serve on the opening point, the same speed as her fastest first serve after nearly three hours on court in her first‑round match, Raducanu successfully landed a 158kmh second serve. The 22‑year‑old confidently navigated her first service game well, looking to impose herself with her forehand.Those positive feelings did not last. On Swiatek’s serve, Raducanu took an advanced return position on both first and second serves as she tried to put pressure on her opponent’s second serve, an essential tactic for any player who wishes to hurt the Pole. In the end, even dealing with the topspin behind Swiatek’s second serve on the high-bouncing clay was a struggle.View image in fullscreenIga Swiatek was dominant in her victory over Emma Raducanu.Photograph: David Winter/ShutterstockAlthough she was relatively erratic early on in tough breezy conditions, Swiatek gradually settled down and established total control of the exchanges. The 23-year-old continually forced Raducanu into defensive positions, suffocating her opponent with the weight of her heavy topspin forehand. Raducanu tried to step forward and take the ball on the rise, but Swiatek’s topspin constantly spun up high outside her strike zone and neutered her ball.It is easy to suggest that a clear underdog should be able to swing freely and without pressure, but Swiatek has produced these dominant results againstalmostevery single player on the tour at one time. Time and time again, she has shown that the incessant pressure she imposes on her opponents is usually enough.Not only did she dictate the vast majority of the match from the baseline, when Raducanu tried to take control of points Swiatek soaked up the Briton’s first strike with her supreme defence. Forced to attack as early as she can and aim closer and closer to the lines, Raducanu’s errors piled up.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu was unable to cope with Iga Swiatek’s shotmaking.Photograph: Christophe Ena/APAs Raducanu neatly stated before the match, Swiatek makes her side of the court feel narrow due to her defensive skills and her opponents’ side feel wide thanks to her massive weapons. This was plain for all to see on another difficult afternoon for Raducanu, as the four-time French Open champion marched on.Taking positives from such an emphatic defeat is difficult, but Raducanu’s progress over the past few months, both on clay courts and within her game in general, has been undeniable. She will return to the top 40, around No 37, and should head to the grass-court season confident in her abilities to make deep runs on one of her favourite surfaces.Still, these stark defeats against the best players in the world have shown how wide the gulf remains between them and the significant work Raducanu has ahead of her to narrow it.Ons Jabeur hits out at lack of women’s matches in French Open primetime slotsRead moreElsewhere, Aryna Sabalenka, the top seed, followed the lead set by Swiatek, her great rival, with a dominant performance of her own as she eased into the third round with a 6-3, 6-1 win against Jil Teichmann.In the men’s draw, the second seed Carlos Alcaraz continued to build momentum in his title defence as he advanced to the third round with a 6-1, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory against Fabian Marozsan.Casper Ruud, the seventh seed and two-time French Open finalist, endured a shock 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-0 defeat by Nuno Borges of Portugal. Afterwards, he disclosed that he had been struggling with a knee injury for some time.“It’s hopefully nothing too serious,” Ruud said. “For the last couple of weeks I’ve been kind of struggling a little bit with knee pain on and off. That’s why I decided to pull out of Geneva after Rome, do my best, and heal to be ready here. When you’re practicing, leading up to the tournament, it’s easier to avoid certain movements that are painful. Everything is not painful. But certain movements out there are kind of what makes it painful.”Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025Emma RaducanuIga SwiatekFrench OpenTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Yunus Musah allasked to be left off of the teamfor various reasons, with Pulisic citing the workload of two straight 50-game campaigns with Milan, while Robinson was ruled out with a case of knee tendinopathy (an overuse injury that he had been managing for much of the second half of the Premier League season).Fulham announced on Wednesday that Robinson would undergo a surgical procedure on his knee and would use the summer to recover. Musah, according to head coach Mauricio Pochettino, asked out of the team due to “personal reasons”.InWednesday’s episode of Unfiltered Soccer, the podcast co-hosted by Donovan and Howard, Donovan decried the absences despite his own experience with experiencing burnout over the course of his playing career.Pulisic’s surge to Balogun’s plunge: how USMNT stars fared in Europe this seasonRead more“I understand very clearly what it’s like to need a break,” said Donovan, who took time away from soccer in 2013 – a decision that then-US head coach Jürgen Klinsmann said contributed to thedecision to cut Donovanfrom the 2014 World Cup team. “If there’s something serious going on in your life, in your family, mentally, whatever, I get it. I’m going to assume for the sake of this conversation that’s not going on. If they would actually come out and give reasons, it would help us, but none of them want to say anything publicly. I think it would help them publicly to say ‘this is why.’”In the episode, which was likely recorded before the announcement of Robinson’s surgery, Donovan said that reasons related to fatigue and burnout fall flat when set against the players’ performances for their club teams to end the season.Milan, home to Pulisic and Musah, was a focus given that the last game of their season was largely meaningless, with the team already mathematically out of European competition next season.“The problem I have with Christian in the last few weeks is he’s still playing for Milan,” Donovan said. So, if you’re if you’re tired and you’re burned out and whatever [and] you guys are still playing for a Champions League spot, fine. I get it. They had nothing to play for this weekend. Zero.”In the case of Robinson, Donovan pointed out that the left-back withdrew from national team consideration ahead of this year’s Nations League finals due to injury concerns, yet started for Fulham in games immediately before and after the international break.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fine. You’ve had a long season. You’ve performed great,” Donovan said. “Why are you starting and playing 90 minutes the last two games for Fulham if your knee’s so messed up?” What are you doing? What kind of message is that sending? If you are really injured and that’s no problem, you’re totally fine. We respect that. Everyone has to make the decision that’s best for them.“My biggest thing with these guys right now is the national team is not a priority for them. I’m not going to say they don’t care. There’s levels of caring. It’s just not a priority.Howard, along with Donovan, expressed dismay that Pochettino would not have a chance to have the full team together in a tournament setting before the World Cup, but that “I’m putting a ton of this on US Soccer.”“There needed to be people on planes in restaurants in Milan, at restaurants in London, buying bottles of red wine for sporting directors saying, “Listen, I understand you have priorities. Let me tell you about my priorities,” Howard said, referring to the federation’s relationship with the clubs where US players ply their trade. This relationship between clubs and international federations is typically at least somewhat collaborative, with Fifa enforcing laws governing the availability of players to national teams. “I don’t necessarily know that dialogue has been had with sporting directors. And by the way, if it has, then it just shows that US Soccer has no gravitas and no power. [In that case] those sporting directors basically said, ‘Who is this? I don’t have time for this call. I’ll speak to you never.’ And hung up the phone.”US Soccer has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsUSAUS sportsMilanFulhamnewsShareReuse this content"

He closed out his round with four consecutive pars.Before this week, Woods’s best result on the AJGA circuit was a share of 25th place at the Junior Invitational at Sage Valley in March.Woods has competed with his father in the last five editions of the PNC Championship – a 36-hole event featuring two-player teams made up of a major champion and a family member - and last December they finished runners-up for a second time.The elder Woods has been sidelined since undergoing surgery in March to repair a ruptured achilles tendon and is expected to miss the rest of the PGA Tour season.Explore more on these topicsGolfTiger WoodsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Harry Maguire led the side. Casemiro, Patrick Dorgu, André Onana, Ayden Heaven, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Højlund started while Alejandro Garnacho and Bruno Fernandes, both linked with summer moves, played from the bench as part of 11 half-time changes.It was Maung Maung Lwin, a Burmese winger for Thai League 1 club Lamphun Warriors, who netted a 71st-minute winner for the south-east Asian team. United could not shake off their season’s travails, including last week’sloss in the Europa League final, and played disjointedly. Several youth products were given their turn, which heartened Amorim amid his disappointment at the result.He said: “No injuries and a tough pitch. We don’t have it in us not to choke in every exercise, in every game – that is what happened. We should win these kind of games, no matter what. We need to bring that inside of us in every game.“The important thing is no injuries with this weather and to arrive here in this day. It is not an excuse, we should perform better. I liked the young kids, they try. That’s enough for me in the moment. They want to play more but we have to rotate everybody to play. They did well.”United play another friendly in Hong Kong on Friday to end a tour reportedly set to earn the club £8m. Before Wednesday’s opening game, the club’s chief executive, Omar Berrada, had put a positive spin on United’s end to the season and what lies ahead in the transfer window.“I can’t talk about specifics, but I can say that we’ve been planning for many months now,” Berrarda told MUTV. “We were ready for all the different scenarios, so now we know what we need to do.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mikel Arteta made the 26-year-old his primary midfield target this summer asArsenalattempt to bridge the gap after three successive runners-up finishes in the Premier League.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreDespite working on a deal to sign him for several months, reports in Spain had suggested Zubimendi was wanted by thenew Real Madrid manager, Xabi Alonso, who coached him when he was in charge of Sociedad’s reserve side. But it appears that he will join Mikel Merino – who left Sociedad for around £32m last summer – in north London next season.Negotiations over the structure of payments for his release clause are believed to have been resolved, with Arsenal confident of announcing Zubimendi as their first signing since theappointment of Andrea Bertaas the club’s new sporting ­director in March.Jason Ayto, who served in an interim capacity after the surprise departure of Edu to Nottingham Forest in November, is set to leave the Emirates Stadium having reverted back to his role as assistant sporting director on Berta’s arrival. The Italian is understood to haveheld talks with representatives of Nico Williamsin one of his first acts after being appointed at the end of March, with the Spain forward, who has a release clause of £58m, one of several attacking options on Arsenal’s radar.Signing a new centre-forward is the next priority, with Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig and Sporting’s Viktor Gyökeres the two preferred targets. Arsenal decided against a move for the Slovenia forward Sesko last summer but the 21-year-old said this week that he wants to “play for a club that suits me, that brings out the best in me”.Arsenal are also in talks about extending the contracts of several key players with Bukayo Saka, ­William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhães all about to enter the final two years of their deals.

Kelleher will be allowed to leave this summer in his search for regular first-team football providing Liverpool’s valuation is met.The Premier League champions want more than £20m for the Republic of Ireland international,who has impressedwhen deputising for Alisson and remains under contract until 2026. WithGiorgi Mamardashvili arrivingfrom Valencia this summer, Kelleher’s first-team opportunities are likely to reduce further next season should he remain at Liverpool.Men’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from Europe’s top five leaguesRead moreBrentford have contactedLiverpoolabout signing the 26-year-old as they look to replace Mark Flekken, who is expected to join his compatriot Erik ten Hag at Bayer Leverkusen. Brentford signed Sepp van den Berg from Liverpool last summer and while in a good position to secure Kelleher they face competition.Heitinga has been granted permission to discuss a return toAjax, where he started his career and was interim coach in the second half of the 2022-23 season, after emerging as their first choice to succeed Francesco Farioli. The Italian quit Ajax after their astonishing collapse in the Eredivisie title race when blowing a nine-point lead with five games to go.The former Ajax and Everton defender has impressed as Liverpool’s assistant first-team coach this season and when coaching West Ham under David Moyes in 2023-24. Arne Slot is reluctant to lose Heitinga, who was courted by West Brom this year, but would not block his opportunity to become a head coach for the first time.Slot said last week: “If Ajax would be smart they would consider him. He is ready to take on a job like that. If John is smart, he would stay here one more season.”Everton, meanwhile, are trying to sign Carlos Alcaraz on a permanent basis from Flamengo before the terms of his loan deal expire this weekend.Alcaraz joined David Moyes’ team on loan in February with Everton having an option to buy the Argentina midfielder for around €15m (£12.6m) before 31 May. Following an encouraging start to his Everton career, that includes scoring the winner at Newcastle on the final day of the season, Moyes wants the 22-year-old on a permanent deal as he attempts to overhaul the squad this summer.Everton officials are in talks with their Brazilian counterparts over finalising the transfer on the terms originally agreed, and have until Saturday to sign Alcaraz at that price. The club also hope to extend Idrissa Gueye’s second spell on Merseyside with the midfielder’s current contract due to expire at the end of next month.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolAjaxBrentfordTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

TheWalesmanager said: “It’s a positive [to have winners in the squad]. But when I was at a club, anyone who went away for international football and came back it was: ‘Forget about what you’ve just done. Focus on what we’re doing here. Every meeting, every part of football you thought you’d just learned there, forget about it. Get back on track here.’“It’s the same here with international football. You’ll have a moment where you can congratulate players and I love them being on a high. But I also have to be responsible for players that perhaps haven’t had the season they would have expected.

There is no place for the 18-year-old Manchester United striker Gabriele Biancheri, who will join Canada’s senior squad on Sunday.Biancheri, whose mother is Canadian and father is Italian, has been capped by Wales at under-19 level and was part of Wales’s recent training camp in Spain, but Bellamy had no plans to bring him into his latest squad. Wales are relaxed about the teenager’s situation and are happy for him to gain further experience.Wales are without Joe Allen, who retired this month. The 35-year-old reversed his decision to retire from international duty last year, but has stepped away a second time. Wales were staring at a first defeat under Bellamy when Allen’s wayward pass allowed North Macedonia to take a stoppage-time lead in Skopje in Marchuntil David Brooks’s 96th-minute equaliser.“I knew he was going to retire,” Bellamy said. “When we conceded, it was like: ‘There’s no way this is going to be his last touch for us.’ Even if I would delay it after we play this one in June, you are not finishing that way.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sign up now!Barry GlendenningWed 28 May 2025 11.58 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 13.06 EDTShareFRAZZLED FERDINANDIn the preliminaries before kick-off between Aston Villa and Paris Saint-Germain at Parc des Princes last month, TNT Sports landed something of a coup. Having got celebrity Villa fan Prince William to agree toa pre-match interview, Rio Ferdinand and Ally McCoist were dispatched to ask His Royal Highness The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge for his thoughts on how the game might unfold. While both former footballers have reached an age where they no longer have forelocks worthy of the name left to tug, Rio was so impressed with William’s knowledge of gegenpressing, xG and heat maps that he issued a stark warning to the heir to the throne. “Do not go into a punditry job because I could be out of the game,” he joked, as those armchair viewers the length and breadth of the country who are forced to pay top dollar for TNT subscriptions if they want to watch European football dared to dream.While there is no evidence to suggest that Prince William subsequently sent an equerry to hand one’s curriculum vitae into the network’s personnel department in the hope of earning a place in the gantry alongside Darren Fletcher and Lucy Ward on co-comms, today it was revealed that Rio is out of the punditry game anyway. The former Manchester United defender has quit TNT after a decade’s service to focus on making YouTube videos in which he says “geezer” a lot, hawking branded snapbacks and chilling with his family. His final outing with Woodsy, Resh, Fletch, Sav, Luce, Coisty, Jules, Crouchy and Owen Hargreaves will be at the Bigger Cup final between PSG and Inter at the Allianz Arena. It is to be hoped he marks the occasion by engineering another one of those ludicrous scenarios where he makes sure the cameras are rolling before studiouslynotstepping on a club-branded carpetin a preposterously performative show of respect.“Since retiring from football, it has been a privilege talking about the game I love for a decade for sports fans watching BT Sport and TNT Sports,” he announced in a statement on his Social Media Disgraces. “I want to acknowledge the tremendous support from the team behind the scenes, whose hard work often goes unseen but has been essential to our success. As I turn the page to the next chapter, I carry with me countless memories. I am excited about what the future holds, spending more time with my family, focusing onRio FerdinandPresents and my other business interests.”Whether it was stating the bland and blindingly obvious at great and tedious length, repeatedly parroting “Ballon d’Or!” at the top of his voice in praise of a player who would go on to be overlooked for the award in question, or abandoning any small pretence at professionalism by reducing the commentary of a recent dramatic finale to the status of FanZone homage, Ferdinand has carved out a unique and lucrative niche in the punditry pantheon over the past decade. While TNT have yet to announce how they plan to fill the gaping void that will be left by the absence of his searing football insight and top-tier banter, subscribers can at least rest easy, safe in the knowledge that the inevitable montage of his “best bits” shown at the end of Saturday night’s Bigger Cup broadcast should be mercifully brief.QUOTE OF THE DAY[Mikel Arteta] had time to get a nine, he had time … Manchester United played five finals in the last five years. The United that everyone laughs at played five finals. In the last three years of building that building, you didn’t reach a final, so I do understand when people ask the question. Surely you should compete for a trophy, being in the final?” – Thierry Henry doesn’t hold back in outlining frustrations at Arsenal’s failure to sign a goalscorer, reach a final or win a trophy this season.View image in fullscreenThierry, you rascal.Photograph: Dylan Martinez/ReutersFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS“Entries onThe Knowledgeare always worth reading, but theclip showing Jeff Astle’s tap-inagainst Leeds after an outrageous non-offside call was especially entertaining. The referee’s howler was the main feature, of course, but three cameos really made it memorable: the old chap in the St John’s ambulance uniform, chuckling away at Astle’s celebration; Don Revie showing untameable outrage by the old-school method of pursing his lips and shaking his head; and the highlight, a fleeting shot of a man in a suit, who could only be Arthur Scargill, being hauled off the pitch protesting against the injustice of it all.

The 23-year-old produced gorgeous assists for Enzo Fernández and Nicolas Jackson asChelsea, who were already on a high after qualifying for the Champions League last weekend, fought back from 1-0 down and claimed their first trophy since being bought by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital three years ago.Chelsea and Cole Palmer storm back at Real Betis to win Conference LeagueRead more“Hopefully, it can be a starting point to build a winner mentality,” Maresca said. “You need to win games, you need to win ­competitions. The ­trophy is going to make us better. But also, I’m very proud about the path or the journey we have done in the ­Premier League.“It’s the most ­difficult competition in the world. You have to be ­consistent in 38 games. With the youngest squad in the history of the Premier League, it’s something unbelievable.”Chelsea were poor in the first half but fired back in the second half, rounding off a resounding win with goals from Jadon Sancho and Moisés Caicedo. Palmer had stolen the show.“I was sick of getting the ball and going backwards and sideways,” the attacker said. “I thought when I next get the ball I’m going to go. The first one, there was a bit of space and I’ve seen Enzo running at it so put it over the top. It is a good feeling for us and the fans, we just picked up the intensity.”Chelsea’s focus now turns to competing in the expanded Club World Cup, which takes place in the US this summer. Maresca batted aside a question about whether his side are contenders to win the Champions League next season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Swiatek is attempting to win her fourth successive French Open singles title, a feat that has never been achieved by a female player in the open era.Swiatek dismantles Raducanu to maintain quest for fourth French Open title in a rowRead more“Iga played really well today,” Raducanu said. “I think every time we have played she plays really well. It puts a lot of pressure on me from the beginning, makes me feel like I have to maybe do something extra or I just don’t know what to do in the moment. It does shift the dynamics of the match a bit, and then it’s very difficult to stay with her as she grows in confidence. It just shows, I guess, the distance that I have to improve.”Although she has performed well against lower-ranked players recently, Raducanu has one win and 10 defeats in her matches against players in the top eight in her career, winning only one set in those 10 defeats. She has lost all five of her matches against Swiatek, who has won every time in straight sets. Along with her far superior level and achievements, Swiatek notes that Raducanu just feels like a good matchup to her.“There are players that just have the ball; that for some of us it’s a little bit easier, others don’t like it,” Swiatek said. “There are some players that you just kind of know what you’re going to do a little bit. I just think it’s a [good] matchup.”Despite how comprehensively she was beaten on the biggest stage, Raducanu enjoyed a positive clay-court season and she has made genuine progress. She has improved on the surface and gained a greater understanding of how to optimise her game, which should only help as she shifts to the grass-court season. It is clear, however, that her game is still too underpowered against the top players, which is only accentuated on slower surfaces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We warn you: if necessary, the police will be even more ruthless today!”The local authorities were forced to act after bottles and smoke bombs were thrown by groups of rivals fans with police with shields moving in to keep people apart. Water cannon was used and videos of fans throwing chairs and beer mugs at each other were circulated on social media.One man, who was wearing a Chelsea badge and appeared to have a Chelsea tattoo on his leg, was seen bloodied after being involved in an altercation with apparent Betis supporters. One photograph showed the man being attacked by a belt-wielding assailant.There were also interventions on Tuesday night after trouble erupted. Footage on social media showed police using pepper spray on Chelsea supporters.The Gazeta Wroclawska reported that a brawl happened at about 11pm in the city’s market square, leaving it resembling “a battlefield” before the mess was cleaned up overnight. The Polish outlet reported that four Spanish supporters were detained on Tuesday by police. Officers were searching for nine other supporters involved in brawls.“The uniformed officers reacted immediately after the incident, which prevented further escalation of the conflict and negative behavior,” said Senior Constable Lukasz Dutkowiak, from the provincial police headquarters in Wroclaw.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bardet crossed the line three seconds after Del Toro, with Carapaz in third.“I imagined I could win a stage with the maglia rosa,” Del Toro said. “The Giro has been very good so far. The fight for the podium is incredible. Today I realised that I will never give up. I will always try to win. I have nothing to lose.“It wasn’t any easier today than yesterday. With the team, we expected some attacks to take place on the Mortirolo. We didn’t want to let all the GC riders go. I went across to them and I took it easy a bit. I caught them in the descent.

That to me is just a joke,” Bradshaw said in a radio interview with 103.7 The Buzz in Arkansas on Tuesday. “What are you going to do? Bring him in for one year, are you kidding me?”Bradshaw then appeared to allude to Rodgers’s alternative beliefs,such as his use of ayahuasca.“That guy needs to stay in California,” said Bradhsaw. “Go somewhere and chew on bark and whisper to the gods out there.”Aaron Rodgers keeping options open: ‘Dealing with a lot off the field’Read moreThe 41-year-old Rodgers parted ways with the New York Jets earlier this year, and has been linked to the Steelers, who are without an established starter at quarterback. But Rodgershas given mixed signalsabout whether he wants to continue his career.“I’m in a different phase of my life,” Rodgers said in April. “To make a commitment to a team is a big thing. And I don’t think it’s fair to the Steelers or anyone while I’m dealing with a lot off the field.”Rodgers’ tenure with the Jets was brief and rocky. After a torn achilles ended his 2023 debut after just four snaps, he returned in 2024 to start all 17 games. Though he threw for 3,897 yards and 28 touchdowns, the Jets finished just 5-12, and Rodgers ranked outside the top 25 in most efficiency metrics. The team sputtered to a 3-7 record in one-score games.Bradshaw was also dismissive of the way the Steelers treated Kenny Pickett, the quarterback they drafted with the No 22 overall pick in 2022 before treading him to the Philadelphia Eagles in 2024.“I liked Kenny Pickett,” Bradshaw said. “I liked him at Pitt. I know him, I know what he’s like. When they got him to Pittsburgh, they didn’t protect him, they didn’t get him an offensive line. They wanted to run the football, but they didn’t have an offensive line that could protect and they didn’t have weapons. He had no wide receivers to speak of.“Then they throw a kid in there for two years, and you’ve got an offense that doesn’t fit and doesn’t work, and they can’t run because their offensive line’s not even good enough for a run-blocking team. Now, they’re saying Kenny Pickett is a failure. He wasn’t a failure, the Steelers were a failure.”Bradshaw played 14 seasons for the Steelers and was namedNFLMVP in 1978. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1989 and has built a successful broadcasting career since his retirement from playing.Explore more on these topicsAaron RodgersPittsburgh SteelersNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

And in his search for answers, Pochettino seems to be staring directly at one of the oldest, simplest types of analysis.“You need to fight, you need to show attitude, the right attitude, but not only that, perform, and be brave,”he saidof the players coming into camp prior to the Gold Cup.That says one simple thing to me. Pochettino thinks the current USMNT crop does not have the asset most prized by sports radio hosts: that dawg in them.It’s hard to say he’s wrong. While we’ve seen this USMNT generation produce some brilliant moments and disciplined results, we’ve seen them fall apart just as much. For as joyous as Pulisic is to watch when he’s playing with a chip on his shoulder and a spring in his step, he’s equally as miserable cutting the figure he did against Panama in March. There are two wolves inside you, etc. And while this generation of players may have a claim to being the most talented USMNT ever, talent does not win matches or even score goals. There’s a reason you still have to play the game.So in comes a curious mixture of longtime mainstays and fresh blood. There are five players without a cap on the Gold Cup camp roster, many more with little international experience, and in total, 16 players fromMLSfrom the 27-man group – players who were called upon in place of European-based players thatcouldmake it, like Sargent and Joe Scally.Pochettino is still looking for pieces he thinks the USMNT is missing. And MLS is where he’s looking.An international coach looking for talent in his team’s domestic league shouldn’t be a shock, but it’s been the opposite of how USMNT rosters have been constructed for the last five years. Since Jürgen Klinsmann’s dismissal in 2016 and Bruce Arena’s ill-fated return, USMNT roster-building has looked a little bit like a new Football Managersave. Younger and younger additions were celebrated, then damn-near required. Rosters with heavy representation from European clubs (good) were cheered, while MLS mainstays (bad) were trashed. Only three MLS players started for the US in their games at the 2022 World Cup. At Copa América 2024, that number dropped to zero.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Neither did March’s Nations League finals.So, in comes Diego Luna, he of a particular testicular fortitude. Patrick Agyemang, despite Charlotte’s woeful MLS form of late, is back, and so is Max Arfsten, who went from a “hey, you’re here” addition to the Nations League roster to starting the third-place match. Matt Freese, DeJuan Jones, Jack McGlynn, Brian White are there too. And in one of the more ridiculous karmic twists, Gregg Berhalter’s son Sebastian earns his first call-up on the back of a legitimately stunning run of form with the Vancouver Whitecaps.Are these players the talent that’s going to carry the USMNT over the hump and into World Cup glory next summer? Maybe not. It’s still a longshot to go from a Gold Cup camp participant to a World Cup roster in a year.But Pochettino isn’t necessarily looking for talent. He’s looking for players that know how to win. The ones who will do anything to get a result despite not having a famous name on their back or a world-renowned club crest on their chest. Once upon a time, the USMNT specialized in that type of player. Now Pochettino seems to be searching for them once more.Crucially, Pochettino may be the only coach that could do exactly this type of reversion for the US. Could you imagine Gregg Berhalter calling in a roster this heavily laden with MLS players in 2025? Can you imagine the response from fans and media ifanyAmerican coach that hypothetically took the reins of the national team two years before the ‘26 World Cup did this? The digital rivers would run red.But Pochettino has the CV to go against this particular grain of USMNT fandom. The man who’s managed Lionel Messi, Harry Kane, and many more has taken stock of the players at the United States’ disposal and decided he needed a closer look at MLS.There’s no guarantee this particular gambit works. But it’s a fascinating search for an old identity being initiated by a man many thought would pluck the USMNT from the mediocrity of its past.Explore more on these topicsUSAMLSUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

Game 5 is on Thursday in New York.Man charged with stabbing Knicks fans at Indiana brewery during playoff seriesRead more“I’m excited about it, it’s going to be a lot of fun,” Haliburton said of the chance to clinch the series in Madison Square Garden. “It’s a great environment to play in.”Pascal Siakam added 30 points while Haliburton had four steals in his second career postseason triple-double. Obi Toppin’s three-pointer with 46 seconds left sealed the game.“I was just trying to aggressive and respond, I felt like I let the team down in [the Game 3 loss], it’s a big win for us,” said Haliburton.The Pacers have not lost consecutive games since 10 March. History is with the Pacers: teams leading playoff series 3-1 have a 283-13 record of progressing.Jalen Brunson scored 31 points for the Knicks. Karl-Anthony Towns had 24 points and 12 rebounds, and OG Anunoby finished with 22 points. But the Knicks couldn’t rally from another double-digit deficit. It marked the first time in the series the home team won.Nearly a dozen former Pacers players, including Jermaine O’Neal and Lance Stephenson, joined Haliburton’s father in the heavily gold-clad crowd. So did WWE Hall of Famer Triple H, rappers Rob 49 and 50 Cent and singers John Mellencamp and Jelly Roll. The Knicks had their own fan section featuring film director Spike Lee and actors Timothee Chalamet and Ben Stiller.What they witnessed was one of the most entertaining games of this postseason. Both teams were shooting at a clip of 70% long into the first quarter as the Pacers raced to a 43-35 lead. New York stormed back in the second quarter reclaiming the lead three times, the last at 64-63. But Haliburton helped Indiana close the half on a 6-0 run to make it 69-64 as he finished the half just two rebounds short of a triple-double.Indiana then opened the second half with an even more aggressive style that spurred a 9-2 run and closed the quarter on a 9-4 spurt to extend the margin to 102-91. Siakam scored the final five points of a 9-3 run early in the fourth to give Indiana a 1110-96 lead.New York got as close as six three times in the closing minutes, but Towns limped to the bench after hurting his left knee with 2:11 to play and finished the game.Haliburton’s father was back in the arena after being banned from watching live followinga confrontation with Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpoearlier in the playoffs. Haliburton was asked if his father’s presence had helped him.

Indiana won the game 93-58.Clark was called for a flagrant-1 foul on her longtime rival Reese during the game, which led to a brief confrontation between the players. The pair’s rivalry started in college and has continued into the WNBA. Clark is white and Reese is Black, and there has beenracist and misogynistic abuse onlinearound their relationship.Clark later said she did not hear any racist remarks during that game, but acknowledged that it was loud in Indiana’s arena throughout the game.The Caitlin Clark-Angel Reese rivalry is becoming a mirror for American bigotryRead more“It’s super loud in here, and though I didn’t hear anything, I think that’s why they’re doing the investigation,” Clark said earlier this month. “That’s why they’re looking into it. That doesn’t mean nothing happened, so I’ll just trust the league’s investigation, and I’m sure they’ll do the right thing.”Reese brushed aside questions about the investigation before Tuesday night’s game against the Phoenix Mercury, saying she was “focused on the game today” and more concerned about helping the Sky earn their first win of the season after an 0-3 start.Chicago coach Tyler Marsh echoed his star forward’s feelings.“We appreciate the investigation being done and we hope that the league continues to make the steps necessary moving forward to ensure a safe environment for everyone, all players included,” Marsh said. “But tonight, the focus is on the game.”Both teams had previously issued statements supporting the investigation, as did theWNBAplayers association. The WNBPA did not issue any immediate comment after the league’s announcement.“We appreciate the swift and thorough process undertaken by the WNBA to investigate these allegations, which were not substantiated,” Pacers Sports & Entertainment CEO Mel Raines said on Tuesday. “At Gainbridge Fieldhouse, we are committed to providing the best possible basketball experience for players and fans where hate speech has absolutely no place. Indiana is home to the world’s greatest fans, and we look forward to an exciting season of Fever basketball.”Reese was asked earlier this month if she was able to provide the WNBA with details about the incident. She did not offer specifics on if she had done so, saying “that’s not a me question.” She also did not reveal what type of comments were made, or any other specifics about what prompted the investigation. But moments earlier, in that same availability with reporters, Reese said she was receiving widespread support from across the league because of the alleged incident.“Obviously, there’s no place in this league for that,” Reese said at that time. “I think the WNBA and our team and our organization has done a great job supporting me. ...

It was only after her death that Walton realised Aimee had been lured into a dangerous community – and that others may also be victims of itWed 28 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 08.07 EDTShareAdele Zeynep Walton knew something was wrong when she stumbled out of her caravan in the New Forest at 8am – she was camping with her boyfriend – and, through her sleepy fog, saw her parents’ car driving towards her. Initially annoyed by the idea of a family walk so early in the day, she then noticed that the car was veering off the track and, as it drew closer, her mother looked “hysterical”. “Straight away,” she says. “I was like, ‘It’s Aimee.’”Aimee, Walton’s younger sister, was 21 and had suffered from poor mental health for some months. She loved music technology and art – her accomplished self-portraits dot the walls of the family’s home in Southampton, where her bedroom has been left exactly as it was before her death. She was such a big fan of the singer Pharrell Williams that he called her up five times to dance on stage at his concerts. But, with her mental health deteriorating, she had become harder and harder to reach. For two months, “we didn’t know where she was, what she was doing,” Walton says.In the New Forest, on that morning in October 2022, Walton found out the awful truth: Aimee had been found dead in a hotel room in Slough, Berkshire. She appeared to have taken her own life. In the days, weeks and months that followed, Walton and her family would learn that Aimee’s path to thehotel had been laid with the help of a complex network of online connections.View image in fullscreenShe loved music and art … some of Aimee’s self-portraits in the family home.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianWalton, 25, a journalist, pieced together that Aimee had spent time on a pro-suicide forum that the Guardian has chosen not to name. The site has beenconnected to at least 50 deathsin the UK, and is nowbeing investigatedby the regulator Ofcom under theOnline Safety Act. According to the police investigating her death, it was on this forum that Aimee learned how to procure the substance that killed her, and how she met a man who flew from the US to Heathrow to accompany her while she died. (He was initially charged with assisting suicide, but no further action was taken.)Sitting in the garden of her parents’ house in Southampton, Walton explains how she came to write about what had happened. Her book,Logging Off: The Human Cost of Our Digital World, is partly the story of her sister, and partly a much broader call to arms to ordinary web-browsing, doom-scrolling, social-media-posting mortals to wake up to the harms that a largely unregulated digital world permits and perpetuates.“I thought: I need to pour all my efforts into digging deeper into this. Why are the general public not aware of these constant harms that are happening? Because it is constant. Pretty much every month I learn of a new family … And it’s like, we’ve been going on about this to MPs. Why is this still happening?” She mentions Vlad Nikolin-Caisley, also from Southampton, who died after reportedly using the same suicide forum that Aimee used; earlier this month,a woman was arrestedon suspicion of assisting his suicide.When the pre-inquest review into Aimee’s death happens in June, Walton hopes that the online factors will be brought within the scope of the inquest, and that at the inquest itself in September, “online harms” will be cited as a cause of, or contributing factor to, her sister’s death.It’s a phrase she learned only recently. “Until we lost Aimee, I didn’t know what ‘online harm’ meant,” she says. She first heard the term fromIan Russell, father of Molly, and campaigner for online safety.Molly Russellwas 14 when she took her life after viewing images and videos of self-harm, and, unusually, the coroner reported that online activity had “contributed to her death in a more than minimal way”. Walton hopes that the coroner investigating Aimee’s death will take a similar view, because she believes the word “suicide” alone heaps disproportionate responsibility on to Aimee, while leaving the digital world unaccountable and unregulated.View image in fullscreen‘We can become vulnerable at any point in our lives’ … a photograph of Aimee.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianShe initially described her sister’s death as “suicide” – but says that no longer feels like a faithful representation of Aimee’s demise. Because if suicide is a self-directed, injurious behaviour, how far can a person be judged to be self-directed when acting under the influence of a purposeful online community? And is a person really choosing freely, Walton asks, when algorithms, which continued to show Aimee content relating to self-harm, power a darkening circle of interest and exposure?“That’s where I have a difficulty with calling it suicide,” Walton says. “My feeling is that Aimee was groomed into making the decision.”Her own emergent literacy around these ideas has turned Walton into a campaigner – she works withBereaved Families for Online Safetyand is a youth ambassador forPeople vs Big Tech. “We need to name the problem and fight against it,” she says. “Because otherwise it fuels the feeling that it’s an individual responsibility to keep ourselves safe online.”Walton says the police reported that the man who was with Aimee in the hotel had shared a room with her for 11 days before she died. While the room filled up with Aimee’s notes, written in such distress that, Walton says, they are illegible, he later told the police he was “working”. Then there was the toxic substance, which Aimee is said to have obtained fromKenneth Law, a Canadian national who has beenlinked to 88 deaths in the UK, and who is under investigation by the National Crime Agency.The forum itself was founded by two men, according to a New York Times investigation, who run a number of websites for “incels”. Wanting to retrace her sister’s last steps, Walton visited the forum herself. “A lot of the posts are basically saying, ‘Your family don’t care about you’, ‘You should do it’. ‘When are you going to catch the bus?’ is a phrase they use.”Walton believes that what takes place on the forum “is a type of radicalisation into an extreme action that people otherwise might not even have considered.” She is haunted by the possibility that the man who was with Aimee when she died was “living out a sick fantasy as an incel who wants to see a young and vulnerable woman end her life”.Before Aimee’s death, Walton felt neutral about technology. But, now, she believes that “the digital world is a warped distortion of our offline world, one that intensifies its pitfalls and maximises its risks”. Walton’s consideration of victims of online harms in her book ranges widely – fromArchie Battersbee, who had accessed TikTok the day he suffered a catastrophic brain injury, toMeareg Amare Abrha, a university professor in Ethiopia who was killed following inciting posts on Facebook. She also considers the Amazon workers who have sought to unionise in a battle to improve pay and conditions, as well as “Tony”, her 90-year-old neighbour who suffered digital exclusion and whom Walton taught to use a smartphone.“For so long there was this facade of technology equals progress, technology equals innovation. That’s what I really want the book to challenge,” she says. She hopes that Trump’s inauguration, “wherethe tech guys[Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk] were lined up, was a shift for people in realising how closely these networks of power are connected”.View image in fullscreen‘Campaigning enables survivors to regain control’ … Aimee’s bedroom at their family home.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianBut, sometimes, she says, she feels like the digital equivalent of a 1970s climate scientist. And she is the first to admit that her relationship with technology is complex – as was Aimee’s. Her earliest memories of their playing together are set around the family computer in their parents’ bedroom.“There’s a video of us playing, aged one and three – Chadwick and the Sneaky Egg Thief. A colouring-in game. We’d play it over and over … We grew up playing Stardoll, Club Penguin, The Sims, FarmVille. All my prominent childhood memories with Aimee involved digital technology,” she says. “Whether it’s Xbox, Nintendo, the computer … We were doing photoshoots on the ‘digicam’ from the age of eight. Just for fun!”In a sense, Walton says, she leads “a double life”. Her book has clearly made her question her own habits. She lived in a tracksuit while writing it, but none of herInstagramposts about the project show this. She uses an app to help her reduce her screen time. She posts onTikTokabout logging off. Then again, video calls enabled her family “to grieve collectively” after her sister’s death – many of her relatives live in Turkey.Promoting the book has made it harder to stay offline. “I’m a hypocrite!” she says, because “my screen time this week is nine and a half hours.”A day? “It’s disgusting,” she says. “I am normally six hours.”And, anyway, she says, “I don’t want to present myself as perfect, like, ‘I’ve got it all under control, guys’. Because every day I’m trying again. We are up against a system that is rigged to capture our attention.”Online suicide forum investigated under new UK digital safety lawsRead moreIn the book, Walton writes that “campaigning enables survivors to regain control where it’s been taken from them”, and I wonder if it functions like that for her, because the process sounds exhausting. “Did I say that?” she says, surprised. “But, if I wasn’t doing this, where would that anger go? It would fester inside me and make me ill. I need to get it out of me.”She has recounted what happened to Aimee to support groups, her local MP (first Royston Smith, then Darren Paffey), to Peter Kyle, secretary of state for science, innovation and technology. “When we talk about online safety, often it’s child safety. And I find it really important, representing Aimee, to say, it’s not just children. We can become vulnerable at any point in our lives. And, if we only look at children’s safety we are going to see a generation get to 18 and not know how to lead safe and healthy digital lives,” she says.“I feel it’s my duty to Aimee, because I wish I could have protected her.” Her eyes are shiny with tears that don’t fall, when she says: “I’m doing what I am doing out of love for her that a lot of the time she wouldn’t let me give to her. And I think this is something that’s common with people who are struggling with their mental health. She didn’t want people to know how much she was struggling.”It can’t have been easy to make space to grieve between writing and campaigning. “Some days I’m like, I can’t really deal with this. Or, I just need a day in bed. Because my body is catching up with all the emotional stuff … Some days I cry because I wish I didn’t have to do this. I wish I was having my 20s and having a laugh.“But this is my concern: people in power will only act if they feel what this grief feels like. I would not wish that on anyone. But if Mark Zuckerberg, for example, lost a child to online harms, then he’d be like, ‘Oh my God, I need to wake up.’”Logging Off: The Human Cost of Our Digital Worldby Adele Zeynep Walton is published by Trapeze on 5 June (£20).

Losing them can mean more than just downtime from work. Here’s what to do in the event the worst happens.What to do if your laptop is lost or stolenTry to locate itusing MicrosoftorApple’s Find Mydevice service, lock it remotely and mark it as lost to help secure your data.Remove it as a trusted device for services you use, including your Apple or Microsoft account, cloud accounts, shops or other browser-based apps.Change your passwords for key accounts, including your Apple or Microsoft account. Start with your email to prevent thieves using it to gain access to your other accounts through password resets.Report the theft to the police by calling 101 in the UK and give them a description of the laptop, make, model, colour and serial number, which may be on the box or in your Apple or Microsoft account.Contact your insurance provider if you have cover, your laptop may come under some home contents policies.Tell your bank about any credit cards you may have details of stored on your laptop.Contact the laptop’s manufacturer to report the theft so it can blacklist its serial number, which may prevent it being activated and used by someone else.What to do as soon as you get a new oneWhen you get a replacement laptop – either new or secondhand – there are a number of things you can do to help in the event it goes missing:Set a strong password or long pin that cannot be easily guessed, set up and use any face or fingerprint scanners and make sure the screen is set to lock after a short period, usually when the screen turns off.Turn on device encryption in your privacy and security settings if not already enabled.Set up two-step verification for your Microsoft or Apple account, as well as any others you use.Turn on “Find My” in aWindows 10 or 11’s security settingsor iniCloud settings on a Mac, which will help you locate a lost laptop, remotely lock it and mark it as lost with a message on its screen for anyone who finds it.Back up your data regularly. On a Windows laptop you canuse Windows Backupto store files and settings on Microsoft’s OneDrive cloud service (5GB free). On a Mac you canuse Time Machineto back up the laptop to an external drive orsync your apps and files with iCloud(you can store 5GB for free). Alternatively, copy files to an external drive but be sure to encrypt it first before backing up any sensitive documents.Host important documents in the cloud. Microsoft and Apple have cloud services, but there are many others including Google Drive, Dropbox and Proton Drive.Take note of your laptop’s colour, model number and serial number, and store your proof of purchase somewhere safe.Consider putting the laptop on your home contents insurance, which may need it to be added to the high-risk or high-value items list, particularly if you take it out of the home. Otherwise, there is dedicated laptop or gadget insurance, with multiple cover levels including theft.Explore more on these topicsLaptopsLost or stolenConsumer affairsComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The president also said he was “not happy about certain aspects of it, but I’m thrilled by other aspects of it” and confirmed he would be negotiating the legislation.The remarks come after Musk said he was “disappointed to see the massive spending bill, which increases the budget deficit … and undermines the work that the Doge team is doing” in comments made to CBS as part of a longer interview due to run on its Sunday morning programme this weekend.‘Nonsense and stupid’: Trump’s tariff war will cause global damage, says Grosvenor bossRead moreMusk had been leading the “department of government efficiency” (Doge) since January, which was given the task of cutting state spending. He later announced in April he would bestepping back from the Trump administrationafter Tesla’s earnings plunged, andspending millions of dollarsin a supreme court race that his Republican candidate ultimately lost.Musk now appears to be hitting out at Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was narrowlyapproved last weekby the House of Representatives.The bill pushes ahead with a number of Trump’s campaign promises, including extending tax cuts for individuals and corporations and ending clean energy incentives enacted under Joe Biden.It also involves about $1tn (£741bn) in cuts to benefits aimed at supporting struggling households, including a health insurance scheme for low-income families, Medicaid, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) food stamps.However, the bill also funds the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico, as well as staff and facilities for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. Even when taking cuts into account, the bill is expected to add about $2.3tn to the deficit, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.Musk told CBS: “I think a bill can be big, or it can be beautiful. But I don’t know if it can be both. My personal opinion.”The comments will fuel rumours of a growing rift between the billionaire and the US president, whom Musk helped bankroll last year. In total, Musk’ssuper political action committee donated $200mto Trump’s presidential campaign before the November election, which many credit with helping to return Trump to the White House.Musk also has business interests at stake, with Trump’s bill due to end a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles and to impose a $250 annual registration fee for owners. The Tesla boss has previously called for an end to those incentives, although that was months before the EV maker’s earnings started to wobble.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tesla’s stock has also suffered, with the company losing about a quarter of its market value since Musk took a top spot in Trump’s administration at the start of the year.Musk’s criticism is likely to fuel opposition by hardline Republicans, whothreatened to block Trump’s legislationas it passes through the US senate unless the president rolls out deeper cuts that would reduce the national debt. One key senator, Rand Paul from Kentucky, told Fox News Sunday that the bill’s cuts were “wimpy and anaemic” and would “explode the debt”.However, Trump has already been treading on politically sensitive territory by supporting a bill that makes big cuts to programmes he promised to protect. He pledged multiple times on the campaign trail last year that he would not touch basic safety nets, including Medicaid.Some of the president’s “make America great again” supporters, including the former White House strategist Steve Bannon, have also warned against such a move, with one Missouri senator, Josh Hawley, saying that cutting health insurance for the working poor would be “politically suicidal”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskDonald TrumpUS taxationUS politicsUS economyTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

They take turns posing with a cat, passing it casually from one to the other. But as the camera settles, it becomes clear this is no house cat – it’s a lion cub. One woman, in a red cocktail dress, lifts the animal to her face and blows a kiss at the camera, a glass of wine balanced in her other hand.Clips such as this are flooding Instagram and TikTok, offering a glimpse into Thailand’s booming captive lion trade. According to a new report by theWildlifeFriends Foundation Thailand and the Oxford Wildlife Trade Research Group the number of lions in captivity has more than tripled since 2018 – a trend fuelled in part by the rising popularity of exotic pets among the country’s wealthy elite. A growing network of lion farms cater to this demand – many of them run by amateurs with little experience in wildlife care.View image in fullscreenLion breeder Patamawadee Chanpithak plays with cubs in the nursery at her farm. Photograph: Ana Norman BermudezSitting cross-legged on the floor of her nursery, lion breeder Patamawadee Chanpithak giggles as three cubs – just weeks old – clumsily crawl over her lap, nudging her with closed eyes as if trying to suckle. The room smells of kitten formula.“We were very inexperienced when we started,” she says, recalling how five of her first six cubs died within days. To date, she has sold more than 80 lions across the country.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenSocial media posts advertising cubs for hire for photoshoots and for saleSome buyers are Thai and some are foreigners, she says, but all of them are wealthy – lion cub prices inThailandstart from $5,000 (£3,700), with white cubs fetching up to $15,000. Keeping a lion is costly, requiring reinforced enclosures and up to 10kg of fresh meat a day.Most buyers want their lions as young as possible. While there are customers who buy directly from farms, breeders also work with agents who aggressively promote cubs on social media – not just to sell, but also to rent them out for photoshoots and parties.View image in fullscreenCustomers interact with a cub inside a ‘lion cafe’ in Bangkok. Photograph: Ana Norman BermudezThe problems begin once the animals grow. “Some people buy a lion and then can’t handle it,” says Patamawadee. “They ask us to buy it back.”The report suggests this “buy-back” system has become central to the farms’ business model, offering the experience of owning a lion without the long-term commitment. Older lions may be used for breeding or passed on to zoo-like venues, generating profit at every stage of life.I don’t agree with people keeping lions as pets. Our climate is too humid for them. Skin infections are commonTaweesak Anansiriwattana, Thai vetRegular transfers between facilities make it difficult to track individual lions, contributing to the gap between official records and actual figures. The report identifies at least 444 lions in captivity – up from 138 in 2018, and more than the 342 registered with Thailand’s Department of National Parks, Wildlife and PlantConservation. Researchers say the real number is probably significantly higher, as many sales and breeding activities go unregistered.View image in fullscreenCubs are not just sold, they are also rented out for photoshoots and parties. Photograph: Ana Norman Bermudez/LightRocket/Getty ImagesDespite attempts to control the trade, a number of loopholes have allowed it to flourish. In 2019, the government introduced the Wild Animal Preservation and Protection Act to regulate the ownership of non-native Cites-listed species such as lions, which previously had little protection. According to the report, the law had the unintended effect of boosting the trade in lions by creating a legal pathway with significant gaps in oversight. While lion ownership requires a licence, breeding does not – anyone who legally owns lions can also breed them. Cubs don’t need to be registered until they are 60 days old, and hybrid species such as ligers are excluded from the law altogether. The result is a thriving industry, with the trade in lion cubs alone estimated at more than $1m (£740,000) a year.Taweesak Anansiriwattana, a Bangkok vet known by his customers as Dr Vee, sits in his office in a clinic on the outskirts of the city. “I don’t agree with people keeping lions as pets,” he says. Over the past five years, he has treated more than 25 privately owned lions. “Our climate is too humid for them. Skin infections are common,” he says, adding that malnutrition is also widespread. “People feed them chicken, but they need organs like liver and intestines to survive.” Though owners are required to build enclosures measuring a minimum of 3 metres by 3 metres, fewer than half of the households Dr Vee has visited meet these standards.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAdult animals, including valuable white lions, and cubs at a breeding farm. Photographs: Ana Norman Bermudez“There are serious animal welfare challenges,” saysTom Taylor, operations chief at Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailandand co-author of the report. “Some of these facilities keep lions in cramped and barren enclosures without sunlight, on concrete substrate, and poor-quality food, resulting in a life of misery.” To meet demand, breeders often separate cubs early to force mothers back into oestrus. Inbreeding is common, especially with white lions and hybrids, which are considered more valuable.Lions, which are not native to Thailand, are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. While the country’s captive population offers little benefit to conservation, Taylor warns it is becoming fertile ground for trafficking, fuelling demand that puts wild lions at risk. “We have received credible reports from traders indicating that lions in Thailand are being illegally exported, both as live animals and dead for their body parts,” he says, adding that lion parts may be filling the market gap left by the more tightly restricted tiger trade.View image in fullscreenA Thai woman was charged with illegal possession of lion cub after a video showing the animal in a car gained 2.6m views. Photograph: Thailand Central Investigation BureauPublic safety is also a significant concern, as seen in news reports of lions escaping from private enclosures or being taken into public spaces. In 2024, a viral video of a man driving a pet lion in a convertible car caused widespread concern. In response, the director general of the department of national parks said the government was considering changes to the law, including restrictions on lion ownership.‘It shouldn’t be that easy’: inside the illegal wildlife trade booming on social mediaRead moreThe report calls for an urgent ban on private ownership and commercial breeding, tougher licensing requirements, and limits on lion cafes and photo opportunities – arguing these practices promote the glamorisation of exotic pets. “Many people are drawn to the idea of owning a lion without fully understanding the ethical, financial and safety implications,” says Taylor, adding that similar trends are emerging with other non-native species, including ring-tailed lemurs and red pandas. “We hope this report encourages the public to think about where these animals come from, the conditions they are kept in, and what happens when they grow too large and dangerous to handle.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsThe age of extinctionIllegal wildlife tradeAnimalsThailandWildlifeAsia PacificAnimal welfarefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Another false claim was thatPakistan’s powerful military chiefhad been arrested and a coup had taken place. “We’ll be having breakfast in Rawalpindi tomorrow,” was a widely reshared post in the midst of hostilities, referring to the Pakistani city where its military is headquartered.Many of these claims were accompanied by footage of explosions, crumbling structures and missiles being shot from the sky. The problem was, none of them were true.‘Global trend in hybrid warfare’Aceasefire on 10 Maybrought the two countries back from the brink of all-out war after the latest conflict, which marked the biggest crisis in decades between the nuclear-armed rivals, and was ignited after militants opened fire at a beauty spot in Indian-controlled Kashmir, killing 26 people, mainly Indian tourists. India blamed Pakistan for the attack – a charge Islamabad has denied.Yet even as military hostilities have ceased, analysts, factcheckers and activists have documented how a fully fledged war of disinformation took place online.Misinformation and disinformation was also being circulated widely in Pakistan. The Pakistan government removed a ban on X shortly before the conflict broke out, and researchers found it immediately became a source of misinformation, though not on the same scale as in India.View image in fullscreenA fake image on X purporting to show fighter planes on fire in Udhamphur, India.Photograph: XRecycled and AI-generated footage purportedly showing Pakistani military victories was shared widely on social media and then amplified by both its mainstream media, respected journalists and government ministers to make fake claims such as the capture of an Indian pilot, a coup in the Indian army and Pakistani strikes wiping out India’s defences.There were also widely circulated fake reports that a Pakistani cyber-attack had wiped out most of the Indian power grid and that Indian soldiers had raised a white flag in surrender. In particular, video game simulations proved to be a popular tool in spreading disinformation about Pakistan “delivering justice” against India.A report into the social media war that surrounded the India-Pakistan conflict,released last weekby the civil society organisation The London Story, detailed how X and Facebook “became fertile ground for the spread of war narratives, hate speech, and emotionally manipulative disinformation” and “drivers of nationalist incitement” in both countries.In a written statement, a spokesperson for Meta, the owner of Facebook, said it had taken “significant steps to fight the spread of misinformation”, including removing content and labelling and reducing the reach of stories marked as false by their factcheckers.While disinformation and misinformation were rampant on both sides, in India “the scale went beyond what we have seen before”, said Joyojeet Pal, associate professor at the school of information at the University of Michigan.Pal is among those arguing that the misinformation campaign went beyond the usual nationalist propaganda often seen in both India and Pakistan: “This had the power to push two nuclear armed countries closer to war.”View image in fullscreenFake images claiming to show India’s Narendra Modi stadium in ruins were shared and debunked on X.Photograph: XAnalysts say that it is evidence of a new digital frontier in warfare, where an onslaught of tactical misinformation is used to manipulate the narrative and escalate tensions. Factcheckers say misinformation including the repurposing of old footage and widespread fake claims of military victories mirrored much of what had come out of Russia in the early days of the Russia-Ukraine war.The Washington DC-based Centre for the Study of Organized Hate (CSOH), which tracked and documented the misinformation coming from both sides, warned that the weaponisation of misinformation and disinformation in the the most recent India-Pakistan conflict was “not an isolated phenomenon, but part of a broader global trend in hybrid warfare”.Raqib Hameed Naik, the executive director of CSOH, said there had been “a pretty catastrophic failure” on the part of social media platforms to moderate and control the scale of disinformation that was being generated from both India and Pakistan. Of the 427 most concerning posts CSOH examined on X, some of which had almost 10m views, only 73 had been flagged with a warning. X did not respond to request for comment.Fabricated reports from India first emerged largely on X and Facebook, Naik said, often shared or reposted by verified rightwing accounts. Many accounts openly supported the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government, led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, which has a long history of using social media to push its agenda. BJP politicians also reposted some of this material.View image in fullscreenDeepfake videos putting words into the mouths of Narendra Modi and other Indian politicians have been exposed on the same platforms that shared them.Photograph: XAmong the examples circulating were a 2023 video of an Israeli airstrike on Gaza that was falsely claimed as an Indian strike on Pakistan, as well as an image of an Indian naval drill from the same year presented as evidence that the Indian navy had attacked and taken over Karachi port.Video game imagery was passed off as real-life footage of India’s air force downing one of Pakistan’s JF-17 fighter jets, while footage from the Russian-Ukraine war was claimed to be scenes of “massive airstrikes on Pakistan”. Doctored AI visuals were circulated widely to show Pakistan’s defeat and visuals of a Turkish pilot was used in fabricated reports of a captured Pakistani pilot. Doctored images were used to fabricate reports of the murder of Pakistan’s popular former prime ministerImran Khan.Many of these posts first generated by Indian social media accounts gained millions of views and the misinformation spread to some of India’s most widely watched TV news.‘Fog of war accepted as reality’India’s mainstream media, which have already suffered a major loss of credibility owing to their heavy pro-government stance under Modi, are facing difficult questions. Some prominent anchors have already issued apologies.Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), an Indian human rights organisation, has filed formal complaints to the broadcasting watchdog for “serious ethical breaches” of six of the country’s most prominent television news channels in their reporting of Operation Sindoor.Teesta Setalvad, the secretary of CJP, said the channels had completely abandoned their responsibilities as neutral news broadcasters. “Instead, they became propaganda collaborators,” she said.Uneasy India-Pakistan ceasefire holds but is a return to war inevitable?Read moreKanchan Gupta, a senior adviser to the Indian ministry of information and broadcasting, denied any government role in the misinformation campaign. He said the government had been “very alert” to the issue of misinformation and has issued explicit advice to mainstream media reporting on the conflict.“We set up a monitoring centre which operated 24-7 and scrutinised every bit of disinformation that could have a cascading impact, and a fact check was put out immediately.Social mediaplatforms also cooperated with us to take down vast numbers of accounts spreading this disinformation. Whatever was in the ambit of the law to stop this was done.”Gupta said that “strong” notices had since been issued to several news channels for a violation of broadcasting rules. Nonetheless, he emphasised that the “fog of war is universally accepted as a reality. It is a fact that in any conflict situation, whether overt or covert conflict, the nature of reportage tends to go high-pitch”.Explore more on these topicsIndiaPakistanWar reportingSouth and central AsiaKashmirSocial mediaDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not Grand Theft Auto, Shakespeare’s MacbethIf Shakespeare were around today, he’d be making open-world shooters with the same depth and diversion as his playsKeith StuartWed 28 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 10.03 EDTShareLast week, the Guardianspoke to the team behind Lili, a video game retelling of Macbeth, shown at the Cannes film festival. The headline quote from the piece was “Shakespeare would be writing for games today”, which I have heard many times, and does make a lot of sense. Shakespeare worked in the Elizabethan theatre, a period in which plays were considered popularist entertainment hardly worthy of analysis or preservation – just like video games today! The authorities were also concerned about the lewd and violent nature of plays and the effect they may have on the impressionable masses – ditto!But if we agree that a 21st-century Shakespeare would be making games, what sort would he be making? If our central thesis is that Shakespeare would be interested in mass, popular entertainment, then – if we’re talking pure revenue – he would be making casual smartphone games: Tencent’s multiplayer arena battle game Honor of Kings, for example, made$2.6bn (£1.9bn) last year. However, while the Bard was certainly interested in royalty and honour (and making money), it’s hard to see Hamlet working as a multiplayer arena-based online battle game structured into an endless series of fast-paced skirmishes. Our titular hero would barely get out the words, “O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!” before being vaporised in a scorching barrage attack. For similar reasons, I can’t see Shakespeare making battle royale games such as Fortnite because, while he certainly liked a battle and lots of deaths, there’s not a lot of room for narrative complexity or rousing military rhetoric when the sole aim is to shoot as many people as possible while dressed as a giant banana orSabrina Carpenter.No, I think if Shakespeare was magically reincarnated in the first quarter of the 21st century, there is only one genre he’d be working in: the open-world role-playing adventure. Here, he’d have the time and space to weave complex narratives involving dozens of characters and diverse environments. King Lear’s moors would become a desolate explorable wasteland, much like the post-apocalyptic hellscapes of Fallout or Death Stranding; Macbeth’s castle would resemble the haunted dungeons of Elden Ring or The Witcher 3; the Verona of Romeo and Juliet would be a beautiful, troubled take on GTA’s Los Santos. Shakespeare’s major thematic obsessions – war, revenge, madness and the nature of free will – are all major elements in fantasy RPGs; his ability to weave in all classes, from the lowest peasants to the most vainglorious kings, is reflected in the social strata of the great open-world titles. Shakespeare’s histories mixed real-life and fictional characters, as does the Assassin’s Creed series, titles that are also interested in the classic Shakespearean concerns of identity, disguise and illusion.View image in fullscreen‘This castle hath a pleasant seat’ … The Witcher 3, an open-world RPG of the sort that might inspire a reincarnated Bard.Photograph: CD Projekt REDMore broadly, open-world games have the same sort of freewheeling structure and psychological flexibility as Shakespeare’s plays. They have subplots and side quests, they have nonlinear timelines and complicated, morally ambiguous characters; they are expansive and baggy, and wide open to varied interpretation. Vitally, open-world games let the spectator into the narrative as a viewer and an actor; similarly Shakespeare wanted his audiences to be drawn into the action, using asides, quips and monologues to break down the divide between stage and pit. Loud, opinionated and combative, video game players have much more in common with Shakespeare’s Elizabethan audiences than polite modern theatregoers.This potential intersection between Shakespeare and open-world games is quietly gaining traction. A few years ago the RSC employed three artists to considerthe interplay of live theatre with technologyand one of them, the digital artist Adam Clarke, tested ideas for hosting Shakespeare performances within Minecraft. More recently, we saw the brilliant documentaryGrand Theft Hamletabout an attempt to stage Hamlet within Grand Theft Auto during the Covid lockdowns.

Rather than other players, they fight a variety of monsters and explore locations lifted directly from the Elden Ring universe. After each match, they also gain upgrade materials to modify future runs and advance the game’s story, similar to a rogue-like game … so it’s a Fortnite/Elden Ring/Hades experience? This is getting complicated.View image in fullscreenRace against time … Elden Ring Nightreign.Photograph: Bandai NamcoEvery session is an engagingly frantic race against time to craft an on-the-fly strategy that takes you across the whole map. Each match is split into three days: on the first two, you pick areas to rush through, besting local bosses to gain minor buffs to your strength or loot weapons with powerful passive abilities, before escaping the rapidly closing ring that saps your health and is sure to end your run. Each night culminates in a larger and far more challenging fight than you’ve faced thus far, amping up the pressure even further.It’s quite the stressful slog, but day three is what you’re battling towards. As the day dawns, you step into a barren arena, ready to face one of several tough-as-nails mega bosses specifically designed to be tackled by multiple players.Nightreign is overwhelmingly designed for three-person teams. Youcanchoose to head out on your own, but doing so is a severe challenge. There’s no one to get you back up if you accidentally die rolling into a boss’s attack, and many of the enemies designed to be tackled by a team of allies frequently overwhelm you.View image in fullscreenBest not to tackle this on your own … Elden Ring Nightreign.Photograph: Bandai NamcoUltimately, this is a game all about momentum. The feeling of pressure as you navigate the world is palpable. Every second, you’re constantly questioning yourself: am I wasting too much time by checking what’s around this corner? Can we take down this boss quickly enough to warrant the reward? It’s an incredibly stimulating experience, as you rush to analyse your equipment and make build-defining decisions on the fly, but so much has been modified for the sake of speed that the nuance typical to FromSoftware games is somewhat lost.There’s no choice of stats when levelling up, for example, with levelling now reduced to the mash of a button when you reach a rest point. And while the world has been painstakingly populated with smaller enemies, beyond taking down a couple in the first few seconds of a run to hit level 2, there’s little point engaging with them, since tackling bosses is the main way to get more powerful.This momentum gives Nightreign its “just one more run” feel, but the pace feels more rapid than necessary, reducing much of the world to a distraction that wastes your precious time. It’s also why the bugs present in the review version we played feel particularly frustrating. Spending five minutes tackling a dragon that then flies through a wall and ends up being untargetable feels particularly unfair.One of the more loathed mechanics from the Dark Souls series is the requirement for you to run back to the boss arena every time you die. When this was updated for Elden Ring, allowing you to respawn right outside the arena, fans rejoiced. Yet the Nightreign experience is such an extreme move back in the other direction that it feels almost Sisyphean. Every run requires you to spend around 35 minutes to reach the final boss, but those bosses often have unique mechanics that can wipe out unsuspecting teams in just a couple of hits. Dying to a new move you’ve not seen before, requiring you to spend another 35 minutes rolling that boulder back up the hill, feels grossly disrespectful.Considering the success of Elden Ring in applying FromSoftware’s dense level design ethos to an open world, it’s disappointing that the developer appears to have missed the mark with Nightreign. Where that game iterated, Nightreign takes shortcuts. It is billed as a standalone release, yet so much environmental content is carbon-copied from Elden Ring – often thrown in haphazardly – that the world feels more like a particularly polished fan-created mod than a whole new title.FromSoftware’s experiment in upending its established gameplay formula is admirable, and taking down gargantuan foes alongside friends really adds to the joy you feel at finally besting what at first felt like an insurmountable task. It’s just a shame that the game’s skewed pacing and overreliance on Elden Ring’s pool of assets so greatly mars the experience.Elden Ring Nightreign is out Friday 30 May; £34.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

Luckily F1 25 – crafted, as ever, in Birmingham by Codemasters – has many. There’s the return of Braking Point, the game’s story mode; a revamp of My Team, the most popular career mode; a tie-up with the forthcoming F1: The Movie; and perhaps most intriguing of all, the chance to race round three tracks in the reverse direction to normal.F1 25 feels like something of a culmination – last year’sF1 24, for example, introduced a new physics model which required tweaks after launch, but has now been thoroughly fettled, so F1 25’s essential building blocks of car handling (and tyre wear) plus state-of-the-art graphics (this year, Codemasters has moved on from previous-gen consoles) are simply impeccable.View image in fullscreenImpeccable graphics … F1 25.Photograph: Electronic ArtsThis has freed the company to delve into the sort of fantasy elements that you can find in games but not real life. Chief among those is the aforementioned third instalment of Braking Point, which follows the fortunes of the fictional Konnersport team. Over 15 chapters it knits together a deliciously tortuous soap opera-style storyline with some cleverly varied on-track action.More fundamentally, the most popular of the career modes – My Team, which ramps up the management element by casting you as the owner of a new team – has received the bulk of Codemasters’ attentions. This time around, you stay in your corporate lane and drive instead as either of the two drivers you’ve hired, which makes much more sense than previously. As does separating research and development, meaning you must allocate new parts to specific drivers. Further effective tweaks render My Team 2.0, as Codemasters calls it, much more convincing and realistic.As ever, you can jump online, against various standards of opposition, or on to individual tracks, or play split-screen against a friend. But there’s a new mode called Challenge Career, which lets you play timed scenarios offline, then post them to a global leaderboard. It’s a nice idea, designed to take you out of your driver-aids comfort zone, but the scenarios will only get going properly after launch, so the jury remains out on its merits. A number of scenarios from F1: The Movie will also be delivered as post-launch episodes, but it’s pretty cool to be able to step into a Formula One car as Brad Pitt playing a fictional racer.For diehard Formula One fans, though, the chance to race around Silverstone, Zandvoort and Austria’s Red Bull Ring in the wrong direction (with the tracks remodelled to accommodate new pit lanes and the like) might just be the clincher. Reversing the tracks’ direction completely changes their nature in a deliciously intriguing manner.With a real-life rule-change next year due to change the cars radically, Formula One currently feels like it’s at a generational peak, and F1 25 is so brilliantly crafted and full of elements that generate an irresistible mix of nailed-on realism and fantasy that it, too, feels like the culmination of a generation of officially licensed Formula One games.

Hundreds of thousands of the six million Syrians who fled abroad during 14 years of war have returned. Yet the mood has inevitably grown more sober, and last week Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, warned that the fractured country could be weeks away from “potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions”.Mr Rubio was defending Donald Trump’s abrupt decision to lift sanctions after meeting the country’s new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa – a former al-Qaida fighter who until months ago had a $10m US bounty on his head, but who is also, in Mr Trump’s considered view, a “young, attractive guy. Tough guy”. Whatever the trigger, the suspension of some sanctions by the US, and the lifting of some EU and UK measures, was essential to allow a country devastated by civil war to recover. It may also reduce opportunities somewhat for Russia and Iran to reassert their influence.Turkey is a longtime backer of Mr Sharaa, who came to power as leader of the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which led the military operation to oust Mr Assad. Other governments are less keen, but may be concerned that they cannot afford for him to fail, after watching Syria being torn apart – and dealing with the fallout. Israel ignored that lesson, launching hundreds of attacks on Syria, but has dialled them down since Mr Trump’s embrace of the new leader. It should also withdraw fromthe territory it has seized.Many Syrians too have concluded that while Mr Sharaa is not the leader they would have chosen, he is the one they have – backing him for fear of the alternative. The government has only limited control of the country. Violence remains rife. Minority communities are understandably terrified afteratrocities in March. The Syrian government had called for reinforcements as Assad loyalists ambushed security forces, but fighters who converged on Latakia province slaughtered hundreds of mainly Alawite civilians. Mr Sharaa blamed “individual actions”. Islamic State, thriving since Mr Assad’s fall, has seized upon Mr Sharaa’s rapprochement with the US as arecruitment tool, hoping to persuade foreign fighters and others that they will be sold out.Politically, too, there is deep unease. Thenew constitutionconcentrates power in the executive. Mr Sharaa says that Syrians will be able to choose their leaders – but not for at least four years. While his cabinet contains members of minority communities – Alawite (Mr Assad’s sect), Druze, Kurdish and Christian (the only woman in the team) – thekey positionsare held by HTS figures.Speaking in Aleppo on Tuesday, the president declared that “our war against tyranny has ended, and our battle against poverty has begun”. Though it will take time for relief from sanctions to be felt, and though the gradual loosening is sensible given concerns about the leadership, a new Syria cannot be realised without their relaxation. Infrastructure has been destroyed. Half the population remains displaced. Unemployment is high and food prices are rising. Syria is the world’sfourth most food-insecure country, with seven out of 10 people – more than 16 million – in need of humanitarian assistance.These material needs are matched by the demand for accountability and reassurance through transitional justice. Syrians will not feel safe until perpetrators are held to account for the viciousness of the Assad regime andfor March’s horrific crimes. Those who are warily engaging with Mr Sharaa must remember, and remind him, that containing violence cannot be separated from the tasks of economic and social progress and political inclusion.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

First, the court fears it will look pathetically weak if it becomes the first supreme court in history to have a president defy its rulings in a wholesale way. With that in mind, the court seems to be taking pains to avoid provokingDonald Trump’s defiance – it has issued several decisions upholding the president’s actions while in other cases, it has given him lots of wiggle room even as it objected to his administration’s moves.Then there’s the court’s second, big worry – that it will look pathetically weak if it doesn’t stand up to the most authoritarian president in US history.Many legal expertscriticize the court for not standing up more to Trump, even though he has brazenly attacked the court and many lower-court judges, hasdefied severaljudicial ordersand has, according to numerous judges, repeatedly violated the law – whether by deporting immigrants without due process or by freezing funds approved by Congress.The court’s six conservative justices have let themselves seem like Trump’s chumps because they’ve often bowed to him instead of standing up and ruling against him. The foremost example is last year’s supreme court ruling giving Trump astonishingly broad immunity from criminal prosecution.Trump’s revenge spree on Harvard echoes well beyond education | Jan-Werner MüllerRead moreThe image-conscious chief justice,John Roberts, and his court have to decide which of two paths to take. One path – which the court’s conservative supermajority seems to be following – is to issue pro-Trump rulings to avoid inciting his ire and defiance. That approach might spare the court the Maga movement’s anger, but historians will look dimly on the court for bending in Trump’s favor – they’ll accuse it of complicity and sacrificing principle for not blocking Trump moves that,many legal experts,conservative,centristandprogressive, say, violate federal law and the constitution.The court can choose a more courageous path: stick to principle and not shrink from ruling against Trump. That might spur the bull-headed president to defy the court, but under that scenario, historians would praise the justices for upholding the law and the court’s constitutional role and for not letting themselves become stooges for a power-hungry president.The Roberts court has given us some hope, but not much. In a surpriseruling at 1am one April night, it seemed to develop a few inches of backbone by ordering the Trump administrationnot to deportseveral dozen Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador without first giving them due process.That was a promising ruling, but on the other side of the ledger, the court has often bowed to Trump, for instance, by overturning a lower court ruling and letting Trumpfire 16,000 probationary federal employeesand by letting his administrationsuspend $65min teacher-training grants. Moreover, the rightwing supermajority did Trump a big favor by letting himprovisionally remove the headsof two independent agencies, the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protections Board. That hurried ruling, made without full briefing or arguments, indicated that the court’s conservatives are eager to overturn a unanimous, 90-year-old supreme court decision that limits presidents’ ability to fire officials at independent agencies. In this way, the Roberts court is giving more power to our dangerously authoritarian president.Let’s not forget how weak the court has looked for failing to act firmly to assure the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, an immigrant from El Salvador who even Trump administration officials acknowledged was deported illegally. On 10 April, the court issued a wimpy decision that called on the Trump administration to“facilitate” Ábrego Garcia’s return– it stopped short of using the district court’s more muscular language to“effectuate” his return. More than six weeks have passed since the high court called on Trump to bring back Ábrego García, but Trump hasn’t done so. His administration has sidestepped outright defiance by pretending that it is seeking to facilitate Ábrego García’s return.Not only that, Trump has smeared the justices bysaying: “THE SUPREME COURT WON’T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!” Trump has also savaged several federal district court judges, calling one a “radical left lunatic” anddenouncing othersas “MONSTERS WHO WANT OUR COUNTRY TO GO TO HELL”.With their hard-right ideology, the court’s supermajority evidently sympathizes with many of Trump’s moves and has blessed such moves far more often than many legal scholars would like. In doing so, the court has emboldened Trump to take even more actions that push – and often overstep – the boundaries of what is legal. In a worrisome development, the court has, at least thus far, shown surprisingly little concern about Trump’s defiance of district court judges’ orders and his authoritarian effort to assert his dominance over the two, other theoretically co-equal branches of government: the judiciary and Congress.For its own good and for the nation’s good, the supreme court needs to step up and do its utmost to stop Trump’s lawlessness and his unprecedented efforts to defy district court rulings and lash out against the judiciary. Trump hascalled forimpeaching judges who ruled against him, and as his tirades against judges have increased, the number of judges who havereceived threatshas soared.The court needs to issue some strong, clarion decisions that make clear to the nation that Trump has shown repeated contempt for the constitution, the rule of law and the judiciary. The justices should move quickly to issue an outrage-filled ruling that finds that Trump violated law firms’ free speech rights by punishing several firms for taking cases he didn’t like or employing lawyers he didn’t like. The justices should also move swiftly to issue a strong ruling in favor of Harvard University and against Trump’s vindictive assault – an assault that violated Harvard’s first amendment rights by seeking to suppress speech and ideas that Trump doesn’t like and by trying to dictate much of Harvard’s hiring, curriculum and admissions policies.A hidden measure in the Republican budget bill would crown Trump king | Robert ReichRead moreThe court should also issue a forceful ruling that demolishes Trump’s arguments that he caninvoke the 1798 Alien Enemies Actto deport alleged Venezuelan gang members en masse without due process. The court should trumpet the absurdity of Trump’s claim that Venezuelan immigrants constitute an invasion force the way, for instance, British troops constituted an invasion force during the war of 1812.The court should also shoot down Trump’s efforts to gut federal agencies and freeze funding by making it emphatically clear that those efforts violate Congress’s article I spending power. The conservative supermajority should also rethink its intention to overturn the 1935 ruling that limits presidents’ ability to fire members of independent agencies. That ruling sought to ensure that those agencies didn’t become partisan puppets that do whatever a president wants – something that no one should want when the nation has such a vengeful and capricious president.With the Roberts court slated to issue a flood of rulings by early July, the justices have an important choice: to bend to Trump or to grow a real backbone. Does the Roberts court want to be remembered as cowardly enablers who helped the most authoritarian and lawless president in history consolidate power? Or do the justices want to be remembered as determined defenders who stood up to an authoritarian bully to protect our laws, our constitution and our democracy?Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsUS supreme courtOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsLaw (US)John RobertscommentShareReuse this content"

Christian Pulisicisn’t there. Neither is Antonee Robinson, Tim Weah, Weston McKennie, or Gio Reyna. Yunus Musah is missing for personal reasons. Josh Sargent is out for “football reasons.”Mauricio Pochettino doesn’t have this name, he doesn’t have that name. He also doesn’t have much time. That was already the case when he took on the US job with just two years to go before a home World Cup, but the situation seems all the more pressing now, a year away from the international game’s signature event and only a couple months removed from some Concacaf Nations League results that were, well,a bit catastrophic.Pulisic’s surge to Balogun’s plunge: how USMNT stars fared in Europe this seasonRead moreFans want to see Pochettino and his team right the ship. They want to see the results they’ve envisioned for the better part of a decade sincethat nightin Trinidad in 2017. They want goals. They want glory. And in his search for answers, Pochettino seems to be staring directly at one of the oldest, simplest types of analysis.“You need to fight, you need to show attitude, the right attitude, but not only that, perform, and be brave,”he saidof the players coming into camp prior to the Gold Cup.That says one simple thing to me. Pochettino thinks the current USMNT crop does not have the asset most prized by sports radio hosts: that dawg in them.It’s hard to say he’s wrong. While we’ve seen this USMNT generation produce some brilliant moments and disciplined results, we’ve seen them fall apart just as much. For as joyous as Pulisic is to watch when he’s playing with a chip on his shoulder and a spring in his step, he’s equally as miserable cutting the figure he did against Panama in March. There are two wolves inside you, etc. And while this generation of players may have a claim to being the most talented USMNT ever, talent does not win matches or even score goals. There’s a reason you still have to play the game.So in comes a curious mixture of longtime mainstays and fresh blood. There are five players without a cap on the Gold Cup camp roster, many more with little international experience, and in total, 16 players fromMLSfrom the 27-man group – players who were called upon in place of European-based players thatcouldmake it, like Sargent and Joe Scally.Pochettino is still looking for pieces he thinks the USMNT is missing. And MLS is where he’s looking.An international coach looking for talent in his team’s domestic league shouldn’t be a shock, but it’s been the opposite of how USMNT rosters have been constructed for the last five years. Since Jürgen Klinsmann’s dismissal in 2016 and Bruce Arena’s ill-fated return, USMNT roster-building has looked a little bit like a new Football Managersave. Younger and younger additions were celebrated, then damn-near required. Rosters with heavy representation from European clubs (good) were cheered, while MLS mainstays (bad) were trashed. Only three MLS players started for the US in their games at the 2022 World Cup. At Copa América 2024, that number dropped to zero.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Neither did March’s Nations League finals.So, in comes Diego Luna, he of a particular testicular fortitude. Patrick Agyemang, despite Charlotte’s woeful MLS form of late, is back, and so is Max Arfsten, who went from a “hey, you’re here” addition to the Nations League roster to starting the third-place match. Matt Freese, DeJuan Jones, Jack McGlynn, Brian White are there too. And in one of the more ridiculous karmic twists, Gregg Berhalter’s son Sebastian earns his first call-up on the back of a legitimately stunning run of form with the Vancouver Whitecaps.Are these players the talent that’s going to carry the USMNT over the hump and into World Cup glory next summer? Maybe not. It’s still a longshot to go from a Gold Cup camp participant to a World Cup roster in a year.But Pochettino isn’t necessarily looking for talent. He’s looking for players that know how to win. The ones who will do anything to get a result despite not having a famous name on their back or a world-renowned club crest on their chest. Once upon a time, the USMNT specialized in that type of player. Now Pochettino seems to be searching for them once more.Crucially, Pochettino may be the only coach that could do exactly this type of reversion for the US. Could you imagine Gregg Berhalter calling in a roster this heavily laden with MLS players in 2025? Can you imagine the response from fans and media ifanyAmerican coach that hypothetically took the reins of the national team two years before the ‘26 World Cup did this? The digital rivers would run red.But Pochettino has the CV to go against this particular grain of USMNT fandom. The man who’s managed Lionel Messi, Harry Kane, and many more has taken stock of the players at the United States’ disposal and decided he needed a closer look at MLS.There’s no guarantee this particular gambit works. But it’s a fascinating search for an old identity being initiated by a man many thought would pluck the USMNT from the mediocrity of its past.Explore more on these topicsUSAMLSUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

How long before she replaces herself with a robot?Wed 28 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 08.19 EDTShareIimagine students at the US Military Academy at West Point are trained to handle unexpected situations, but I’m not sure anyone could have prepared them for the bonkers speech Donald Trump delivered to graduates on Saturday. I wish I could point you to a government transcript, but the White House recentlystarted removing official transcriptsof the president’s public remarks, replacing them withcurated videosinstead. I imagine (just a hypothesis!) that this is to make Trump seem more coherent.One of the “highlights” of the disjointed ramble Trump delivered at West Point was his thoughts on trophy wives: “I must tell ya. A lot of trophy wives, doesn’t work out [sic],” he mused in the middle of an anecdote about a divorced real estate developer (not him). This has raised a few eyebrows; particularly as Michael Wolff’s 2018 book about Trump claimed the president used to boast that Melania was his “trophy wife.”I don’t know if Trump ever really thought that Melania was some sort of compliant accessory to be paraded around. If he did, I’m sure he’s now seen the error of his ways. Melania has made it clear to everyone that she is unbothered, unbossed, and entirely uninterested in pretending to care about either her husband or her role as first lady. It’s claimed that as of early May, Melania had spentfewer than 14 daysat the White House. Trump is her useful idiot husband, she’s not his trophy wife.Melania is certainly collecting her own trophies, however. I’ve got to hand it to the woman: she’s mastered the art of making enormous amounts of money with the minimum amount of effort. Last year, she released what columnist Pamela Paul described as a “book-adjacent object” titled Melania, which one imagines she did not write herself. Last week, she announced that theaudiobook was narratedwith an AI-generated version of her voice. Now we’ve officially got an AI Melania voice, can it be long before we get a full-on MelanAI? A realistic AI-powered robot who does all the boring first lady things that Melaniaclearly hates doing– and doesn’tswat Trump’s handaway in public.Explore more on these topicsMelania TrumpOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The US president’s claims of white genocide conflict with the actual racial persecution and massacres that took place during the two centuries of colonisation and nearly 50 years of apartheid in South Africa.It is not enough to be affronted by these claims, or to casually dismiss them as untruths. These statements are a clear example of how language can be leveraged to extend the effects of previous injustices. This mode of violence has long been used against Indigenous Africans. And it cannot simply be met with silence – not any more.The Kenyan writer Mzee Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o wrote: “Language conquest, unlike the military form, wherein the victor must subdue the whole population directly, is cheaper and more effective.”African nations learned long ago that their fates are inextricably linked. When it comes to interactions with the world beyond our continent, we are each other’s bellwether. In 1957, the year before my birth,Ghanabecame the first Black African country to free itself from colonialism. After the union jack had been lowered, our first prime minister, Dr Kwame Nkrumah, gave a speech in which he emphasised that, “our independence is meaningless unless it is linked up with the total liberation of Africa”.Shortly after, in 1960, was the Sharpeville massacre inSouth Africa, which resulted in 69 deaths and more than 100 wounded. In Ghana, thousands of miles away, we marched, we protested, we gave cover and shelter. A similar solidarity existed in sovereign nations across the continent. Why? Because people who looked like us were being subjugated, treated as second-class citizens, on their own ancestral land. We had fought our own versions of that same battle.I was 17 in June 1976, when the South AfricanSoweto uprisingtook place. The now-iconic photo of a young man, Mbuyisa Makhubo, carrying the limp, 12-year-old body of Hector Pieterson, who had just been shot by the police, haunted me for years. It so deeply hurt me to think that I was free to dream of a future as this child was making the ultimate sacrifice for the freedom and future of his people. Hundreds of children were killed in that protest alone. It is their blood, and the blood of their forebears that nourishes the soil of South Africa.The racial persecution of Black South Africans was rooted in a system that was enshrined in law. It took worldwide participation through demonstrations, boycotts, divestments and sanctions to end apartheid so that all South Africans, regardless of skin colour, would be considered equal. Nevertheless, the effects of centuries-long oppression do not just disappear with the stroke of a pen, particularly when there has been no cogent plan of reparative justice.Despite making up less than 10% of the population, white South Africans controlmore than 70% of the nation’s wealth. Even now, there are a few places in South Africa where only Afrikaners are permitted to own property, live, and work. At the entrance to once such settlement, Kleinfontein, is an enormousbust of Hendrik Verwoerd, the former prime minister who is considered the architect of apartheid.Another separatist town, Orania, teaches only Afrikaans in its schools, has its own chamber of commerce, as well as its own currency, the ora, that is used strictly within its borders. It has been reported that inside the Orania Cultural History Museum there is a bust of every apartheid-era president except FW de Klerk, who initiated reforms that led to the repeal of apartheid laws.Both Kleinfontein and Orania are currently in existence, and they boast a peaceful lifestyle. Why had the America-bound Afrikaners not sought refuge in either of those places?Had the Black South Africans wanted to exact revenge on Afrikaners, surely, they would have done so decades ago when the pain of their previous circumstances was still fresh in their minds. What, at this point, is there to be gained by viciously killing and persecuting people you’d long ago forgiven?According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs,half of the population of South Africa is under 29, born after the apartheid era and, presumably, committed to building and uplifting the “rainbow nation”. For what reason would they suddenly begin a genocide against white people?Ramaphosa was blindsided by Trump with those unfounded accusations and the accompanying display of images that were misrepresented – in one image, pictures of burials were actually from Congo. Trump refused to listen as Ramaphosa insisted that his government did not have any official policies of discrimination.“If you want to destroy a people,” Archbishop Desmond Tutu once said,“you destroy their memory, you destroy their history.”Memory, however, is long. It courses through the veins of our children and their children. The terror of what we have experienced is stored at a cellular level. As long as those stories are told, at home, in church, at the beauty and barber shop, in schools, in literature, music and on the screen, then we, the sons and daughters of Africa, will continue to know what we’ve survived and who we are.Mzee Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o wrote: “The process of knowing is simple. No matter where you want to journey, you start from where you are.” We journey forward with a history that cannot be erased, and will not be erased. Not while there are children dying in the mines of the Congo, andrape is being used as a weapon of war in Sudan.Our world is in real crisis; real refugees are being turned away from the borders of the wealthiest nations, real babies will die because international aid has been abruptly stopped, and real genocides are happening in real time all across the globe.John Dramani Mahama is president of the Republic of GhanaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The result was weirdly coyJennifer Jasmine WhiteSexologists? Tick. ‘Up against the wall’ practice sessions? Tick. But Virgin Island obscured the real truth about intimacyWed 28 May 2025 11.51 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 13.55 EDTShareChannel 4’s latest attempt to straddle the line between televised humiliation and light titillation came to an end this week. Virgin Island documented a two-week bootcamp for 12 “courageous virgins”, whisked off to Mamma Mia!-style surrounds and delivered into the hands of self-proclaimed experts with job titles such as “emotional intimacy coach”, “surrogate partner therapist” and “sexological bodyworker”. These professionals were meant to help them overcome physical and emotional hang-ups around sex, andoffered a kind of hands-on, public therapy that for most of us previously existed only in nightmares.Having watched the entire series across an especially sedentary weekend, I’m in no position to doubt that this sometimes made for maddeningly good TV. From tutorials in oral sex to animal role-play, the whole affair resembled a sun-kissed gameshow with a few premature ejaculations scattered in for good measure. At the end of the series, only one contestant had lost their virginal status, and it briefly seemed possible that the grinning individual in question might be presented with a Bullseye-style prize for doing so – a Nissan Micra for your victory in the boudoir, perhaps?Miles from the mainland, with nothing but deep-rooted psychological trauma or diagnosable medical disorders to get in the way, Virgin Island positioned itself as a locus of pure fantasy. Unfortunately, this was also its downfall. Turning sex into a series of uncomfy routines to be memorised and performed (classes included practising ‘“smooth transitions” from one position to another, or learning exactly when during a dinner date to kiss your partner’s hand in the manner of a serial killer), the show seemed unable to admit that sex is not only a physical challenge but a social phenomenon, one bound up with unpredictability, rejection and power.View image in fullscreen‘Sexological bodyworker’ Thomas with Emma, another contestant on the show.Photograph: Channel 4Still, the oddly evacuated social politics of sex kept cropping up. Cast member Charlotte spoke about trying to work through issues with shame, but had few qualms about humiliating others, openly repulsed by the “horrible stretch marks” of civil servant Ben. When anxious Emma, 23, was paired with confident, middle-aged “sexological bodyworker” Thomas, she was visibly uncomfortable. The optics of their pairing – and how unlikely it was to help Emma – seemed not to matter.Then there was Zac, the villain of the piece. In one scene, he dished out a range of objectifying compliments to the women of the show. These women had little interest in finding out whether they would be winners (“banging body”) or losers (“good sense of humour”) in Zac’s personal hotness Olympics, but on he went regardless. Zac seemed to have almost no issues around sex, other than his lack of it. He described his intense impatience as his coach delayed penetrative sex, seemingly keen to race through the steadily paced structure of the programme in which individuals graduated through various sex acts only if and when the experts deemed them ready. His best explanation was, fascinatingly, that perhaps she was intimidated by him. Having said as much, Zac was kindly asked to put on his clothes, but beyond this, Virgin Island seemed totally uninterested in engaging with the behaviours and dynamics actually exhibited by the group.Desire is complex, unpredictable and often indecipherable even by those experiencing it. Nothing about this could have been neatly resolved in six hours, but a gesture to the relationship between what happens in the bedroom and what happens beyond it might have helped. True to the neoliberal navel-gazing that so defines our times, Virgin Island invited its contestants to look only inwards, but more interesting lessons might have been learned if they had observed their relationships with one another, too.They might have noticed a grimly gendered divide, in which many of the women were indeed intimidated by men, a situation unlikely to be helped by the “up against the wall” practice session where nervous participants were made to forcefully push partners up against a pillar, with as much allegedly sexy conviction as they could muster. What are the connotations of a move like that? Why might some people, sometimes, like it, and some people, sometimes, not? TV producers, fearful of dull detail, might be sceptical, but for my money, those conversations would have produced the most revealing content yet.From childhood trauma to fantasies of worship, it was clear that for absolutely everyone on the island, sex was inseparable from power. Why, then, couldn’t the programme admit it? Maybe because to open up a conversation about power would risk admitting the odd imbalance at play as paid professionals take an ambiguous pleasure in laying hands on often vulnerable bodies, all while denying a transaction is taking place. The show had little choice but to remove power from the conversation lest it, ironically, expose itself. Perhaps most unexpectedly of all though, in doing so, Virgin Island often boxed itself into a dull little corner of denial. Pretending that sex is a matter for the bedroom alone?

(Great, let’s go after those as well!)Because avoiding paying tax is pretty much the point of the system for wealthy individuals and large companies.For example, right now, numerous commentators who are against the changes to super are also saying we needto cut company taxto ensure competitiveness. Less mention is made that many large companies pay little or no tax, including in some of the most profitable sectors in Australia.My colleagues at the Australia Institute found that from 2014-15 to 2022-23 Queensland LNG projects delivered $310.1bn total income for gas companies but they paid just $966m in company tax – or just 0.3% of total income (and all of that was paid by just one company).If the graph does not display click hereWhen huge multinational companies are able to earn such huge incomes but pay bugger all tax, the problem that needs to be addressed is not that our 30% company tax rate is rendering Australia “uncompetitive”.Yes, we need to reform our tax system. But suggest gas companies should pay more tax and the chin-scratchers will say “hmmm not like that, something, something Hawke, Keating … bipartisanship!That’s because most commentary about our economy values profits as sacrosanct and more important than wages:If the graph does not display click hereThe same applies to individuals – wealthy ones matter more, especially when it comes to superannuation.We’re told the real evil is taxing “unrealised capital gains”. These are the increases in the value of the assets held in your super that you have yet to sell (or “realise”).And look, I can understand how bad it would be.Imagine if, for example, Centrelink had a record of every share you owned and every six months calculated their value, or if you had to let Centerlink know if the value of your non-financial assets went up by more than $1,000.Outrageous! Unprecedented! Communism!You would think after nearly three years of being wrong, the RBA might start to question its economics. But no | Greg JerichoRead moreOh wait, sorry, actually that’s whatpeople on the age pension already have to do.We have a system where it is considered right thatthe poorest people in Australia are penalised if their assetsgo above $314,000 but where parts of the media come out against a proposal that if someone’s super goes up $314,000 in a year from $3m they should pay $4,462 (1.4%) in tax.Please. The only reason there is so much outrage over this is if the rich and vested interested are annoyed people might realise just how big of a rort they have going.Currently these massive unrealised capital gains in super can keep going up and people pay no tax on them (unrealised, you see!) and then when they are retired they can sell them (ie realise them), and then pay … errr zero tax.Under these changes they would have to pay 15% on the share of earnings above $3m.Yeah, end of times.Heck even normal capital gains outside of super gets a great deal. If you have held an asset for over a year you will get a 50% tax discount on the profit.Earn $250,000 in capital gains, you get $125,000 tax free.Earn $250,000 in income, you get $18,200 tax free.Little wonder the rich love capital gains. The 0.2% of taxpayers who make $1m each year account for 41% of all capital gains:If the graph does not display click hereThe average salary of people with an income of $1m or more is around 16 times the average of people earning less than $100,000; the average capital gains is 234 times larger:If the graph does not display click hereThe very rich, their media supporters and financial advisers are worried we might start wondering how much revenue is being lost each year from giving them these tax breaks.Well, we know the answer – in 2025-26 around $33bn in tax breaks for capital gains tax and superannuation go to the richest 10% – or around two-and-a-half times what it would cost to funddental in Medicare:If the graph does not display click hereSo here we are – tax reforms meaning companies that pay bugger all tax demanding cuts in the company tax rates, and the richest 0.5% demanding they not get a slightly lower tax break on the super earnings.Don’t be fooled into thinking they are caring about you. Instead think of what could be done if Australia’s tax system was better designed – better schools, better hospitals, better infrastructure.Right now, Australia’s tax system works to give the wealthiest in society the smoothest of rides. These super changes will force them to go over a very small speed bump.They should be supported and they also should be just the start.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsGrogonomicsLabor partycommentShareReuse this content"

The waves in front of me were growling and my gut responded in kind. Instead of listening to it, I wrestled into a wetsuit and pulled the goggles I’d had since year 5 over my head. I signalled my friend to start recording. Then, I walked in.By walked, I mean slipped. Violently. The ocean licked me off the rocks and sucked me under with glee. After a few seconds of panicked tumbling, I surfaced with a mouthful of salt water. My friend laughed. I laughed, then coughed, then laughed again.I was overjoyed because she had just recorded a moment I was sure would capture my crush’s attention. It was a mission I was willing to complete at any cost. Even if that cost was my dignity. Or even, my life.Do you trust Mark Zuckerberg to solve your loneliness with an ‘AI friend’? No, me neither | Emma BrockesRead moreI didn’t know it at the time, but I was suffering from an illness known as Downbaditis. Put simply, it is a state of spiritual psychosis triggered by a crush and/or intense courting period. Victims of Downbaditis display an insatiable need for validation from their chosen suitor. Ironically, a suitor’s ineligibility may worsen symptoms. These include, but are not limited to: overhyping hobbies, appearing effortlessly hot on Instagram Stories and pretending you have ever gone for an “ocean swim”.Being “down bad” is not a new experience. Usher wrote about it in 2001 with U Got It Bad. The entire plot of The Great Gatsby revolves around Jay throwing lavish parties for Daisy’s affection. Charli xcx extrapolated on this well-worn tradition in her sleeper hit Party 4 U. She even secured a cake, champagne and a party bag with purple pills, no less. Perhaps she’d watched The Matrix with her betrothed but she never got around to asking red or blue? It’s hard to know but one thing’s for sure: she was suffering from a critical case of Downbaditis.The modern strain of Downbaditis can be traced back to the invention of Snapchat Stories. It was the first time regular people could post their most banal daily goings-on without the judgment of a full Facebook post. You had permission to post every little thing, because it disappeared after 24 hours and could only be replied to via direct message. It felt so chill, so flippant, so unscripted, so real. You could pretend to love Drake without your friends pointing out you only knew Hotline Bling because it played on loop at the Foot Locker you worked at in 2016.Last week, I invited my Instagram community to share stories of times they had fallen prey to Downbaditis. The responses came in thick and fast. Some were vintage – like the woman who went to high school Christian group meetings despite being “1,000% an atheist”. Another played the clarinet for the entirety of her secondary education because there was a hot guy in the band. A third school-age memory was from someone who memorised every single AFL player’s name in primary school so they could talk to the boy they liked. The illness is lifelong, you see.They grew all the more deranged as time wore on. Like the woman who wore off-the-shoulder tops for an entire year because her crush said he “liked shoulders”. One respondent started learning Afrikaans after a first date. Another lied and said that they saw whales because their crush liked them. “It wasn’t whale season,” she said ominously. “And he knew”.A 14-step guide to taking a (fleeting) break from social media | Eleanor LimprechtRead moreI also asked my audience to share times they had clocked that they were on the receiving end of someone’s Downbaditis. One woman told me that her friend was seeing a guy who seemed sweet. “On one of their first dates, he offered to order them some dinner. She said she’d like some chicken nuggets. They locked in and all was well until his flatmates came home. They couldn’t believe their eyes because he’d been vegan for six years.”What I learnt while receiving responses was that Downbaditis strikes everyone. Every gender, every age. It is non-denominational and that is what makes it so dangerous. It is often only diagnosable after the fact. For me, I barely clock my Downbaditis until it’s too late and I’ve bought a surfboard.Subscribers to attachment theory could argue that Downbaditis is a sign of anxious attachment. It could be. It could also be a feature of the human condition. At its core, Downbaditis is just yearning. A creative strain, for sure. To yearn is a treat – it means you are alive and open. Married people blow up their whole lives to feel it again. So I say yearn while you can. Take up Spanish to impress someone, like one guy I spoke to. “I learnt it on Duolingo to impress a Chilean girl,” he told me. “And now, whenever I see a loaf of bread, a voice of regret in my head sighs ‘el pan’.”It hurts, but it’s a lot more exciting than plain old bread.Lucinda Price is a writer, presenter and comedian who goes by the name FroomesExplore more on these topicsSocietyOpinionSocial mediaRelationshipscommentShareReuse this content"

If we don’t act now, it might be lost for everJohn McDonnell calls for grassroots leadership challenge to Starmer’s governmentWed 28 May 2025 10.24 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 13.55 EDTShareIjoined theLabourparty 50 years ago. Back then, as a young man, I was proud that I was becoming part of a movement motivated by the highest ideals. I felt I was joining a group of like-minded people who wanted to change the world for the better and that, whatever setbacks might occur, we were on the right side of history.I devoted my life to securing the election of Labour governments that would transform our society. I was a working-class kid, born in the slums of Liverpool to a father who was a docker and a mother who was a cleaner, and I gained all the benefits of Labour’s policies: the security of aParker Morris-standardcouncil house and the care of the NHS when I was sick. As a trade union branch secretary, my dad and his fellow members exercised their rights and their solidarity to secure the wage levels that lifted the families of workers out of poverty.No matter how tough it was through the worst of the Thatcher period and especially during the harsh years of Tory austerity, the light of hope still burned in me that eventually Labour would return to power, and we would be able to get back on the righteous path of social advance for everybody.Keir Starmer was elected leader of the party on the policy platform that Jeremy Corbyn and I developed, and then he promptly dropped virtually everypolicy promise he made. My concern was that dropping a radical programme and narrative in favour of a mealy mouthed politics meant that the Starmer administration would deliver a timid move forward at best. But even then, I held to the belief that the desperate nature of the Tory inheritance would force him to change course.I wrote articles and made speeches arguing that there was still hope because by the middle of Labour’s term, it was highly likely these mediocre policies would have proved ineffective, with the risk of the administration under Starmer becoming deeply unpopular. At that stage, I thought, the argument for an alternative strategy would be overwhelming. That was when the broad church of the left and progressives in the movement would have a key role to play.What I didn’t appreciate was that once elected, the Starmer government wouldn’t just be an administration of timid reform, but would rapidly instigate a series of policies that drove a knife into the heart of what I believed Labour stood for when I joined the party.Labour was founded to eliminate poverty and secure equality. After the first king’s speech, the government didn’t just fail to address the major cause of child poverty in Britain at the moment – the Conservatives’ two-child benefit cap – but demanded that Labour MPs vote against its abolition. This was the first time the political incompetence and callousness of the new administration’s decision-makers were put on display. To then remove the whip from me and six colleagues for voting to scrap the capshowed a remarkable combination of arrogance and lack of judgment.At the same time, the public got view of the distasteful sight of Labour ministers accepting gifts, tickets and donations from the rich and corporate carpetbaggers. For that scandal to be followed by the government cutting the benefits of the poorest in our society was nauseating for many Labour supporters.Following this up with the debacle of the changes to the winter fuel allowance and the brutalattack on disabled people’s benefitshas disillusioned Labour voters on a scale not seen before in the recent history of the party. It has opened the door to the divisive and destructive opportunism of Nigel Farage, who has now said he wouldscrap the two-child cap.Justifying this negation of the historic role of Labour byadhering to an anachronistic fiscal ruledoesn’t just make the government appear tin-eared. It makes it look inflexibly incompetent.What we are now witnessing is a panicked, half-hearted policy retreat, while the backroom boys – Morgan McSweeney in the leader’s office and Nick Parrottin the deputy leader’s office– fight between themselves.All this against a backdrop ofdefending the exportof F-35 fighter jet parts that enable the Israel Defense Forces to continue bombing Gaza and a Labour prime ministerechoing the language of Enoch Powell.Unless party members, affiliated unions and MPs stand up and assert themselves to take back control of Labour, in the next period of its history we may not only lose a government. We could also lose a party.John McDonnell is the independent MP for Hayes and Harlington.

Why was it met with a shrug in France?Pauline BockWhatever the explanation for the incident, the reaction points to backward French attitudes – including from the president himselfWed 28 May 2025 08.51 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 14.16 EDTShareThe French president’s plane has just landed in Hanoi. Its door is open and Emmanuel Macron is standing looking at his wife, Brigitte, who is still inside. Two hands – hers –push his face. Macron seems to bring his arms up in defence, and steps back.Dumbstruck, the president turns and sees the cameras on the asphalt. He’s being filmed. In a split second, his shock morphs into a smile. He waves, charmingly, at the journalists: he’s back in control. As Macron and his wife walk down the plane’s stairs, he offers her his arm. She doesn’t take it.The strange moment was caught by Associated Press cameras, and immediately went viral, being shared around the world. Questioned by the French press, which woke up to the images on Monday morning, the Élysée Palace originallyclaimedthat the video was a deepfake, then admitted the scene was real but was simply a “moment of closeness” shared by the presidential couple. They were “decompressing one last time before the start of the visit, larking around”, a source close to the presidentbriefedthe French press. “But that was enough to feed the conspiracy theorists.”Macrondoubled downlater during the day, explaining that he and Brigitte were “bickering, or rather joking”, and that he had been “taken by surprise” by the cameras: “The video becomes a sort of geoplanetary catastrophe. In the world we live in, we don’t have a lot of time to lose. This is all a bit of nonsense.” French TV commentators were left wondering why the Élysée would deny that the whole scene happened: “It becomes newsworthy because the Élysée lied about it,” aBFMTV journalist noted. Yet the French media immediately accepted Macron’s “squabble” explanation and moved on, the story no longer leading news websites and broadcasts.French political journalists have long applied the “bedroom rule” to their coverage: what happens in the bedroom, or in romantic relationships more generally, is private and therefore not newsworthy. This has begun to change since the #MeToo movement, thanks to a younger generation of journalists keen to highlight that the private can be political, too, but the attitude remains prevalent inFrance– even more so if the person in question is the president.There were political reasons, too, to deflect attention from the video – the president is being frequently targeted by online conspiracy theories, and pro-Russia news sources have been leading on the video. Macron said: “For three weeks, people have looked at videos of me and think that I have shared a bag of cocaine with Keir Starmer, that I have fought with the Turkish president, and, now, that I am having a domestic dispute with my wife. None of that is true, yet these videos are real. Everyone should calm down.” TheÉlysée Palace’s denialin response to the “cocaine bag” story was funny and straight to the point: the palace’s X account simply tweeted a photo of the “cocaine bag”, which was really just a tissue, and commented: “That’s a tissue. To blow your nose.”The incident also reignited speculation around the circumstances of Brigitte and Emmanuel’s relationship. Some people on social media were quick to point out that he was 15 and Brigitte was his 39-year-old theatre teacher when they met. Macron has brushed it off several times over the years, speaking about theinevitability of their love, and a certain amount of PR was fed to the press back in 2017, when he was first elected. Themedia then spokeof their “20-year age difference” and of him being a “year 12 student” when they met. It is, in fact, a25-year age gap, and he was in year 10, not 12. Watching the video, it was hard not to wonder what the response would have been if the roles were reversed: what if an older man were to be filmed pushing his younger wife in the face? Would that be met with a shrug that it’s no big deal? The power and gender dynamics are different in each case – he is the president, after all – but all forms of partner-on-partner violence deserve attention.There is no way to know what transpired between them at that moment, but optics do matter, especially in the leader of a country. To imply that it is normal for a “squabble” to become physical, even if in this case there was an innocent explanation, is unhelpful at best.That Macron doesn’t see the potential problem in the video points to a narrow, obsolete understanding of couple dynamics and domestic violence. He has twice proclaimed gender equality to be the “great cause” of his presidential mandates before refusing toproperly fund it; he hasspoken in supportof the French actor Gérard Depardieu, who has recently beenfound guiltyof sexual assault and is soon to beon trial againfor rape; and to this day, the former interior minister and current justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, who was accused of sexual assault (the case has nowbeen dismissed), has remained in Macron’s cabinet.It would have been easy enough to turn this moment into a public health message. He could have simply said that he’s all right, thanks for your consideration, but that men who do experience violence should feel no shame in seeking help, using it as an opportunity to discuss domestic violence prevention. Instead,he mockedthe “fools” who thought anything could be amiss.Pauline Bock is a French journalist based in ParisExplore more on these topicsEmmanuel MacronOpinionBrigitte MacronFranceVietnamcommentShareReuse this content"

Yet unfortunately, passengers had to disembark at Surbiton andboard a rail replacement busas a result of engineering work.The incident highlights that this is a moment of maximum vulnerability in the push for greater nationalisation in Britain. SWR is the first train company to be nationalised under this Labour government, which has plans to renationalise nearly all services in Englandby 2027. But at the launch, the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said shecouldn’t promisethat nationalisation would yield lower fares. If services don’t improve and fares don’t fall, critics will have their attack line ready: “We told you nationalisation doesn’t work – just look at the trains.”It is critical that public ownership is seen to deliver better value for money, lead to reinvestment to improve services and genuinely meet the transportation needs of communities across Britain. Success or failure will shape attitudes towards it for years to come. Success could build momentum for bringing other essential services under democratic control. Failure will provide ammunition for privatisation advocates across every sector.The case for change is overwhelming. Since privatisation, rail fares haverisen by a fifthin real terms, while analysis by the thinktank Common Wealth in 2023 found UK passengers payfive timesas much per kilometre as those in France, where rail is publicly owned. Overall, privatised rail costs taxpayers£1bn more annuallythan public ownership would. This is extraction, not efficiency.Between 2006 and 2022, anestimated 65%of train operating company profits were paid out in dividends to shareholders, while passengers endured cancelled services and eye-watering fare increases. Our railways have become engines of profit for investors and overseas state enterprises, with the Italian, French and Hong Kong governments owning major franchises alongside global asset managers such as BlackRock. Labour’s approach must address three critical challenges to ensure that nationalisation delivers tangible benefits rather than disappointment.First, the government must not stop at train operators. In 2022-23, the rolling stock companies, which lease trains and carriages to operators, saw theirprofits treble, with more than £400m paid to shareholders and profit margins rising to a whopping 41.6%. As the RMT union found,87% of Britain’s rolling stockis controlled by just three companies. Without nationalising rolling stock companies as well, train operating companies being brought into public ownership will continue to be beholden to enormous lease payments to private companies, as we saw between 2016 and 2024, when such paymentsrose by 78%in real terms (compared with staff costs, which attract much more controversy but only rose by 11%). These firms are extracting enormous profits while the public sector bears the risk. Nationalisation should mean bringing the entire system under democratic control, including the trains.Second, passengers must feel real benefits quickly. Travellers boarding these trains will not initially notice any difference, because the changes that matter – reinvestment rather than extraction, service improvements over dividend payments – will take time to materialise. Meanwhile, any delays, cancellations or fare increases will be attributed to public ownership, regardless of their actual cause. Plans forautomatic refundsfor late trains are a start, but change for commuters must not end there. The new public operator should freeze fares immediately and introduce simplified, integrated ticketing across the network. Revenue that previously flowed to shareholders should fund service improvements – more staff, better cleaning and extended opening hours at stations. Visible changes will build public support for broader transformations.Third, the government cannot simply replace private managers with civil servants. This means recruiting rail professionals and devolving decision-making to regional teams, rather than centralising everything in London. Most importantly, it means embedding passenger representation and worker participation from day one.There are signs thatLabourunderstands the scale of the challenge. The party has committed to establishing Great British Railways as an integrated public body, moving beyond the fragmented structure that has plagued the network since privatisation. But integration on paper is not enough. It must translate into coordinated investment, simplified passenger experience and democratic accountability. Only when the entire system operates under public control can passengers fairly judge its performance.Labour’s rail nationalisation represents more than transport policy – it’s a test case for 21st-century public ownership. For this to succeed, passengers must pay less for better services, workers must have a voice in their future and communities must benefit from integrated planning rather than fragmented profit maximisation.As Common Wealth’sresearch has shown, the economic case for rail nationalisation is clear. Now comes the harder task of making it work in practice. This requires courage to challenge vested interests, operational expertise to improve services and democratic innovation to ensure public ownership serves the public.If nationalised operators deliver visible improvements while keeping costs under control, public support will grow and opposition critique will ring hollow. But if it is business as usual with a different logo, we’ll have squandered a once-in-a-generation opportunity to prove that public ownership works.The prize is enormous: affordable, reliable rail transport that serves communities rather than shareholders. The risk is equally significant: discrediting public ownership for years to come.

The concept communicates to consumers that we play a significant role in limiting the impacts of climate change through small daily personal choices. The carbon footprint has merit, encouraging the use of keep cups, the offsetting of emissions for a long-haul flight, improving our recycling habits, saving the planet one Tupperware container at a time. Yes, little things do add up. We have real impact.When you realise this globally applied term was coined by an advertising firm working for British Petroleum, the landing changes.The firm Ogilvy & Mathercreated the carbon footprint to deflect from the climate impact of fossil fuel giantsand instead place members of the public under the microscope. If you shame a person’s habits, you create division and distraction among the class of people threatening to take community action against you. It’s as sinister as it is genius.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailOn Tuesday, Meg O’Neill, the chief executive of Woodside,attacked young Australians for our “ideological” standwhen it comes to the fossil fuel industry. When speaking at the Australian Energy Producers conference, she said: “It’s been a fascinating journey to watch the discussion, particularly among young people who have this very ideological, almost zealous view of, you know, fossil fuels bad, renewables good, that are happily plugging in their devices, ordering things from [online fast-fashion stores] Shein and Temu – having, you know, one little thing shipped to their house without any sort of recognition of the energy and carbon impact of their actions … So that human impact and the consumer’s role in driving energy demand and emissions absolutely is a missing space in the conversation.”As a 26-year-old and a member of generation Z, I am proud to say I have never made a purchase from the fast-fashion stores O’Neill mentions. I will also be the first to admit that I am consuming more than I should be and have made purchases from questionable stores in the past. Acknowledging this flaw is important; we should all be striving to make more environmentally friendly choices. However, pointing out this prime example of a straw man argument is the more pressing point. This is the blatant scapegoating of young people while directly destroying our climate.Woodside boss says young people ‘ideological’ on fossil fuels while ‘happily ordering from Temu’Read moreMeg O’Neill, is it easier to blame young people for “plugging in their devices” than speak to Woodside’sspilling of an estimated 16,000 litres of “hydrocarbons”off Western Australia’s north-west coast into the Indian Ocean just weeks ago? Yes, it may be a “zealous” view that young people hold in wanting to stop your North West Shelf gas project, a potential“carbon bomb” that would extend gas production until 2070, both exacerbating the climate crisis andrisking ancient First Nations art at Murujuga. I would love to hear you explain how an individual buying a bathmat or earrings online compares with the74m tonnes of CO2that were emitted due to the sale and burning of Woodside gas last year alone.While O’Neill thinks the “missing space in the conversation” is the consumer’s role in energy demand, I would argue the real silence in the discussion is how fossil fuel giants and the Albanese government justify approving projects that will drastically affect the planet my generation will inherit, and what part of your moral conscience allows you to blame us for it.This relentless attempt to shift responsibility and divide us is no longer viable. We see through the spin, we can cut through the noise. There are many powerful young people advocating for a better world, one which values our planet more than the millions being funnelled into the bank accounts of big oil and gas bosses who would rather we kept quiet.

After months of acrimonious negotiations with private health insurers and a failed search for buyers, the global investment firm has walked away. This is a “canary in the coalmine” moment for the private hospital sector.Brookfield’s exit suggests that private hospitals, at least in the near term, are no longer a safe bet for private equity investors. The reasons are complex but not new. The sector has been under pressure since 2016, when shares in Healthscope and RamsayHealthCare tumbled amid falling demand for private health insurance – a trend not seen since the early days of Medicare.Australians were questioning the value of private cover as premiums soared, out-of-pocket costs ballooned, and insurers quietly trimmed the list of services they would fund. Complaints surged. Confidence eroded. This was bad news for private hospitals. Healthscope was de-listed from the stock exchange and bought by Brookfield.In response, the federal government introduced reforms: capping premium increases, introducing tiered gold, silver and bronze policies, and trying to make specialist fees more transparent. But these measures have largely failed to restore trust or affordability, as witnessed by the events of the last few days.The fall of Healthscope: bad luck, bad decisions, or is Australia’s private health model sick?Read moreThe pandemic has only deepened the cracks. Elective surgeries were cancelled, demand for private care dipped and, when it returned, it did so in a landscape reshaped by inflation and workforce shortages. By late 2022 inflation had peaked at 7.8%, squeezing household budgets and prompting many to delay or forgo care – especially in the more expensive private system.At the same time, hospitals faced rising costs for supplies and consumables, while medical fees continued to climb. Nursing shortages, exacerbated by burnout and shifting work-life expectations, made it harder to maintain services.Though inflation has since eased, many of these pressures remain. Health workforce retention is still a major concern. Medical out-of-pocket costs continue to rise. And the public remains sceptical about the value of private healthcare.What happens next for Healthscope depends on who takes over. Any new owner is likely to cut costs, potentially closing smaller, less profitable hospitals. Patients will need to go elsewhere.Public hospitals are facing growing demand from an ageing population, with a renegotiation of the national health reform agreement, the key funding deal between the commonwealth and the states. In Victoria the state government has injected $9.3bn into public hospitals, a sign of the growing strain across the board.The reasons why Healthscope is in trouble give us some clues about what we might do to ensure sustainability of the sector. There will always be fights about funding, whether it is private health insurers and private hospitals, or governments and public hospitals.Brookfield’s decision raises urgent questions about how we fund and regulate private healthcare in Australia. The opaque and often adversarial contracts between private insurers and hospitals need greater oversight. Financial risk must be more evenly shared. And we need smarter, more localised workforce planning to address chronic shortages.Ultimately, the private system must reckon with its value proposition. While it may offer shorter wait times, care from senior specialists and private rooms, these benefits are increasingly offset by unpredictable and rising out-of-pocket costs. And when hospitals are owned by private equity firms, as in the case of Healthscope, there’s growing concern, backed by international evidence, that quality of care will take a back seat to profit.The question now is whether we treat Healthscope’s collapse as an isolated failure – or as a catalyst for deeper reform.Anthony Scott is a professor at the centre for health economics at Monash UniversityExplore more on these topicsHealthOpinionBusiness (Australia news)HospitalsPrivate health insuranceCost-of-living crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

She was in her late 20s, so the story goes, on holiday with her young family in Florida, and flicking through a magazine, when she saw an advert for the “Monique”: a breast-enhancing bra insert, or what we’d now call a chicken fillet. It sounds like the unlikely start of a business empire, but what began there would ultimately grow into Ultimo, the lingerie brand established by Mone and her first husband, Michael. For a time it looked set to compete with the big guns of the underwear world. The Rise and Fall of Michelle Mone is a gripping two-part documentary, which first examines how Mone rose to fame and entered the heart of the political establishment, before moving on to look at her more recent nosedive into scandal and a different sort of notoriety, in next week’s episode.As Mone built her brand of bras out of a small warehouse in Glasgow, she also constructed her own legend. This is a tale of tits and assets, then, but in the way that all great BBC documentaries can be, it is also a story of culture and politics, and a broad portrait of an era, as well as a focused portrait of a person. Mone found success and fame during the late 90s, at the tail-end of Cool Britannia, in a decade still flashing the Vs of girl power, its cleavage squeezed in, up and out. By all accounts, Mone knew how to spin a yarn and put that talent to good use. Ultimo was pitched as the plucky Scottish David to the big lingerie Goliaths such as Gossard and Playtex. The documentary reports she liked to claim that Julia Roberts wore an Ultimo bra in the movie Erin Brockovich, a tale which passed into myth. The costume designer on the film denied this. Publicly, she was seen as a tough, tenacious girl-done-good in the largely male world of big business.On the surface, this is a retelling of the Michelle Mone fairytale. She grew up in poverty in Glasgow’s East End and left school at 15 with no qualifications. She grafted her way into the business world, working her way up from selling fruit and veg, via a modelling career and eventually landing on lingerie. The documentary is detailed enough that it tracks down a childhood friend and a modelling colleague, as well as talking to former contacts and advisers. It even interviews Selfridges’ lingerie buyer in the late 90s, Virginia Marcolin, who gives a convincing account of the persistent woman she met back then, who was determined to get her product into one of the biggest department stores in the UK.You can see what people saw in Mone. Quite literally, in fact. There is lots of footage from that time, as she was keen on having cameras around to document her rags to riches story, and to keep the brand, and herself, in the public eye. There are ample clips of her launching the Ultimo bra, trying to expand into Australia, and her then-new house, in which her first marriage was beginning to show signs of trouble. She talked about that, too, on TV, on chatshows, on panels. She became a celebrity, and in Ultimo’s careful choice of models, sometimes famous themselves, the brand fed the celebrity machine. It was a successful ecosystem of notoriety, but whether it was as successful a business as it appeared is one of the many questions asked here.In some ways, this is a parable of fame. Mone courted it and won it, but eventually learned that once you turn on the faucet of public attention, trying to turn it off again is a sisyphean task. Even as the Ultimo launch succeeds, there are hints of choppy waters under the smooth public image. The documentary makers question Mone’s relationship with the truth and say that of the more than 50 people who worked for Ultimo they approached, none would speak on camera, and those who did, gave less-than-flattering accounts of the workplace and asked for their identities to be hidden.How the Michelle Mone scandal unfolded: £200m of PPE contracts, denials and a government lawsuitRead moreNow, Mone is perhaps less famous for her business acumen than she is for her involvement in the lucrative “VIP lane” PPE scandal with her husband, Doug Barrowman, which was brought to public attentionby a Guardian investigation(both deny any wrongdoing and have never been arrested or charged, though do stay for the legal notes at the end of episode two, which are unusually entertaining). It builds towards their notorious interview with Laura Kuenssberg, at the end of 2023, and the second episode is a great success as an investigative thriller, carefully laying out the claims that have been made against them. But this also works as a cultural artefact, and surely Mone, of all people, would appreciate that the story makes very good television.The Rise and Fall of Michelle Mone aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewMichelle MonereviewsShareReuse this content"

He was so hot he had to run to the car for a blast of the air-con’Interview by Harry Thorfinn-GeorgeWed 28 May 2025 10.19 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 13.15 EDTShareThe idea for Pink Man was born when I went to the first giant mall that opened in Bangkok. It was a warehouse on the outskirts of town that was so huge you got lost among stacks of products. Normally I would go to the supermarket with a small basket, but the trolleys I saw there were so big you could lie down in them. I saw a family in front of me filling one and I thought: “How many days will it take them to finish that? How much money do you need to fill this?” It reminded me ofDuane Hanson’s hyperreal sculpturesof American families but also how his art reflected his time. I thought my art should reflect my time, too.I was born in 1961 and lived by the canals with rice fields right in front of me. I couldn’t believe how society had changed within my lifetime, how it had happened right in front of my eyes. In many ways my art is a reflection of my life. When I pass away you can look at my art and you will see my life.The first Pink Man series, Pink Man Begins, was in 1997, two months before theAsian financial crisis. I photographed the performance artist and poet Sompong Thawee pushing an empty pink trolley in Silom, the financial district in Bangkok, while wearing a bright pink suit. At the time I felt there was something wrong with Thai society. People were becoming crazy, wanting to be rich and always talking about money. A new set of values were emerging at odds with the predominantly agricultural society I had grown up in, where Buddhism – the predominant religion – teaches you to live a humble life. Pink Man, in his tasteless pink suit, is a personification of consumerist greed. His empty cart represents how we will always feel empty no matter how much we consume. I wanted to question if this was the direction our country wanted to go in.It was difficult to set up the shot – rice fields are not meant for shopping trolleys!This photograph was taken in 1998 when the Thai government began promoting its AmazingThailandtourism campaign as a response to the economic downturn. Its idea was that tourism was an industry that was free because Thailand already had everything: culture, nature and beaches. I wanted to challenge the idea that tourism doesn’t cost anything: no, it costs. When bars, noise and traffic come to a small fishing village people have to change their way of life to serve tourists. Pink Man is a critique of consumerism, and tourism is just another form of consumerism.I took Pink Man to the Chiang Mai Social Installation festival in 1998. I wanted him to push his trolley silently outside Thae Pae Gate, the entrance to the old town and a popular tourist attraction. I didn’t make an announcement, I wanted it to happen spontaneously and see the public’s reaction. People were surprised and confused: they thought he was trying to sell something or that he was part of a commercial.We were travelling together, so I took the opportunity to take photos at tourist markets, hotel resorts and this rice field, which became Pink Man on Tour. It was not easy for Sompong because it was very hot in his cheap pink suit and he almost fainted. We had to stop because he was exhausted and ran back to the car to blast the air-con. It was difficult to set up the shot because we had to drag the trolley across the rice field, but rice fields are not meant for shopping trolleys!After years of doing Pink Man, I felt sorry for Sompong. I thought he got bored of posing for me, so I tried using a different actor, but there was something missing. Sompong has an anger in his aura, just like how city people try so hard to make money but are still not happy. In 2018, I received an invitation to a gallery in New York and I knew this was the place to end Pink Man. The consumerism he represents was born in America, so it felt cyclical. I photographed pink body bags next to the trolley which became The Last Man and the End of His Story.My Pink Man photos have been exhibited around the world. I think he was so successful because at the time there was no real contemporary photography in Thailand.Photographywas considered a decorative art, but my teacher at Srinakharinwirot University taught me that photos can reflect ideas, be conceptual, experimental, and deal with current issues. Pink Man was a benchmark that helped push Thai photography into the contemporary.Manit Sriwanichpoom’s CVView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Manit SriwanichpoomBorn:Bangkok, Thailand, 1961.Trained:Visual art at Srinakharinwirot University with major in photography.Influences:Robert Frank,Duane Michals,Caravaggio.High point:“The seriesHorror in Pinkin which I Photoshopped Pink Man into black and white news photos of the6 October massacrein 1976 [a violent crackdown against students who were protesting the return to Thailand of former military dictator Thanom Kittikachorn] that hadn’t been shown before.

It’s not just the setting but the rare joy of seeing a majority-Black audience and roster at a literary event. It’s a festival infused with the magic and fire born of resistance.James was one of many authors who shared that, were it not for the festival, he wouldn’t be the literary giant he is today. It was after one of Calabash’s now-legendary open mic sessions that he secured his first publishing deal. No surprise, then, that people waited in snaking lines, some for well over an hour, to get their three minutes on the mic.View image in fullscreenLudicrously picturesque … the view from Jakes hotel, Treasure Beach.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyFor festival-goers, one of the most anticipated readings of the weekend was from Safiya Sinclair’s National Book Critics Circle award-winningHow to Say Babylon– on home soil for the first time. Her book chronicles growing up in 80s and 90s Jamaica as a Rastafarian girl, and she read a haunting passage about deliberately stepping on a rusty nail after being ostracised at school. This was at a time when the legacy of Jamaica’s first prime minister Alexander Bustamante, and his infamous 1963 command to “Bring in all Rastas, dead or alive” still loomed.The Calabash literary festival was founded in 2001 by poet Kwame Dawes, novelist Colin Channer, and producer Justine Henzell (whose family own and run Jakes, the beachfront hotel where the festival is hosted). What began as a small event in Jakes’ lobby with only 150 guests now attracts thousands, a quarter of a century later. And, unlike most literary festivals, Calabash is completely free to attend. “Passion is the only price of entry,” its website states – though adds that “voluntary contributions are welcomed”.The festival’s allure is undeniably amplified by its ludicrously picturesque setting: piercing blue skies, crashing waves and endless rays of sunshine frame the stage from which authors speak. If you thought Treasure Beach a sleepy town full of beach bums, fishers, locals and ex-corporate types who have traded in their careers for psychedelic retreats, you wouldn’t be entirely wrong. But as the festival begins, a rebellious spirit is ushered in. The weekend’s format is simple: readings arranged around specific themes, punctuated by a handful of headline talks.The crowd at Calabash is a world unto itself, made up of authors and book lovers from across the Caribbean, as well as from the UK, US, Canada and South Africa. A new wave of influencers were also in attendance, including prominent bookstagrammers like Trinidad-based @bookofcinz and South Africa’s @pretty_x_bookish, who now play an increasingly important role in elevating Caribbean and diasporic literature.View image in fullscreenInfused with the magic and fire … audience members at the 2025 Calabash literary festival.Photograph: Calabash literary festivalStandout sessions from the weekend includedCaleb Femi, a former young people’s poet laureate and the author of Poor. He brought south-east London to Calabash with four poems from his sophomore collection The Wickedest – a portrait of one party night told through the eyes of flirtatious guests, unwanted intruders and their fearless leader. Laughter echoed throughout. Danez Smith, author of Homie and Don’t Call Us Dead, read work that could melt even the coldest of hearts – opening with a tribute to the gully queens (Jamaica’s trans community), thanking their lesbian friends for teaching them how to love, and sharing poetry in the form of a love letter to their formidable grandmother. Mary-Alice Daniel gave perhaps the most brilliantly absurd reading of the weekend, sharing surreal poems and a hilarious piece of prose about the loss of her toe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

On Friday and Saturday, the festival turned into a party, with live performances and DJs that didn’t start until midnight. And Sunday afternoon closed with a moving celebration of the 50th anniversary of Burning Spear’s album Marcus Garvey, a tribute to the power of roots reggae as a form of cultural memory and resistance.Over dinner that final night, there were discussions about how such a small island has managed to have a gargantuan, global cultural footprint, especially within the world of literature. Dawes, one of the organisers, pointed to Jamaica’s history of rebellion, including the largest of slave uprisings, as the root of its spiritual and creative fire.“Jamaica was the site of the most virulent practices of the transatlantic chattel slavery,” Dawes says. “While we can speak of the negative legacy of this truth we can also speak of the restorative and inventive power of resistance and rebellion [that has] allowed this small population of 2.5 million people to have an absurdly outside global impact as a culture.”“Despite the hardships of history,” he adds, “there is a necessary confidence that is part of the Jamaican spirit.”The nextCalabash literary festivalwill take place in 2027Explore more on these topicsBooksJamaicaFestivalsMarlon JamesIan McEwanPoetryFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Insiders and regulars like KT Tunstall explain why the live music venue is so loved by audience and artistsRachel KeenanWed 28 May 2025 06.21 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 06.22 EDTShare‘Lewis Capaldi said to me recently: ‘All I ever wanted was to get my name on the steps at King Tut’s,’” says Judith Atkinson, one half of the couple behind the music venue that has long been where Glaswegians find their new favourite band.Celebrating 35 years this year, King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut was whereOasiswere discovered by Alan McGee and soon signed to his record label Creation. The Verve and Radiohead played in the same two-week period as that gig in 1993, while Manic Street Preachers, Florence + the Machine and entire scenes of Scottish alternative music have got a leg up there since. “When I was growing up you didn’t dream about playing Glastonbury – but you dream about playing King Tut’s, the thing that’s within your reach,” says Scottish singer-songwriterKT Tunstall. “It’s such a big deal.”Small music venues like this have been in crisis since the pandemic due to rising costs for rent and utilities – according to the Music Venue Trust, 125 grassroots venues permanently closed in 2023, the worst year on record, followed by another 25 in 2024. And yet, thanks in part to a live music empire the owners have built around it, King Tut’s is thriving, despite only having space for 300 people.View image in fullscreenA step up … the stairs at King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut.Photograph: PRStuart Clumpas, who founded the venue in 1990 alongside his wife Atkinson, reckons it has something to do with Glasgow’s dismal climate. “Scotland is an indoor entertainment society because of the weather,” he says. “The only way to go, ‘Hey I’m going to go out for a night’ and be guaranteed it’s going to happen and work is to go to something indoors.”He remembers that fabled Oasis night, when the band drove from Manchester to try their luck and play an already-filled support slot. From the bouncer almost not letting them in, to venue staff refusing to let them perform, each story is different. Clumpas sets the record straight: “It was another support band who said they can’t play, not us,” he says. “They went, ‘Fuck off, it’s too small a stage.’ You can’t put three drumkits on the stage the size of King Tut’s.” But Oasis did manage to perform, and the rest is history.Another legendary band would never have been booked, though, if it was up to Atkinson and not venue booker Geoff Ellis. “He kept booking this band calledRadioheadand they only ever did 150 people,” Atkinson says, “I remember saying to him: ‘Why do you keep booking that bloody Radiohead, Geoff?’ That’s why I’m not a booker!”But Atkinson’s experience in promoting gigs meant she was well placed to spot local up and coming artists, including future indie legendsBelle and Sebastian. “They used to come in a lot and hang out,” she says, and the band once struck up an impromptu live set in the pub area below the main venue. “They were playing Boy With the Arab Strap and the whole pub was sitting at their tables jiggling to this song. I just went: wow, we’re in a scene!”Blur got much shorter shrift. “I do likeBlurnow, I’m very fond of them. But they played King Tut’s when they’d been tipped to be the next big thing. They were so obnoxious because they were on the front cover of all the magazines that week – they were so full of it. I was only in my mid-20s but I was able to be like, ‘Guys, you’re going to meet the same people on the way down as the way up.’ They came back and played about six months later and their tail was between their legs. God, they were polite.”View image in fullscreen‘You dream about playing King Tut’s’ … KT Tunstall.Photograph: Eoin CareyWhen you enter King Tut’s, history surrounds you. Downstairs in the pub the walls are adorned with memorabilia from gigs past, and on the stairs up to the venue each step shows an artist and the year they played. Tunstall has her name painted on the 2005 step next to Simple Minds, Arctic Monkeys and Texas. “It’s definitely one of the proudest notches on my belt,” she says.That gig was around when her debut album Eye to the Telescope was released – the next year, she received three Brit nominations, winning for British female solo artist. She reckons the venue’s success comes down to the kind treatment she received from the owners, along with the sound quality. “Your job on stage is to just try and whip up that energy to the point where everybody feels extremely present and connected to each other, and at some venues it’s hard to do that,” she says. “But at King Tut’s, you’re halfway there already. Thank God they don’t freshly paint it every three years – it’s like all the energy is kind of soaked into the walls in that place.”Another Scot,Nina Nesbitt, says “it feels like a moment when you go there” to play – her first time was in 2013, the year before her debut album Peroxide (a Scottish chart topper). “Touring at that [grassroots] level is really difficult mentally and physically,” she says. “You’re not really getting much sleep and you’re sitting in dressing rooms with no windows, and it’s quite depressing. The shows are amazing, but everything else is tough. Sometimes you don’t evenhavea dressing room.” But at King Tut’s, “they really do take care of their artists. They have a lovely little dressing room, I think they have fairy lights in it. Little things go a long way, and put you in a good mood for the show.”View image in fullscreen‘There’s just a real vibe about the place’ … Courteeners performing in 2015.Photograph: Ross Gilmore/Redferns/Getty ImagesGeneral manager Davie Millar says he is still visited by famous faces who have made it big since their King Tut’s debut. Liam Gallagher set the video for his single Come Back to Me at the venue – Millar has a cameo – and the 1975 “just popped in for a drink” recently. “There’s just a real vibe about the place. Bands like Manic Street Preachers and the Killers who played here many years ago, it’s a real privilege for them to say ‘yeah, we’d love to come back and play’.”As well as its famous patrons, King Tut’s has benefited from being a small part of a much bigger operation. Clumpas, the founder, and Ellis, the booker, founded Scottish festival T in the Park in 1994 as a joint venture between DF Concerts – Clumpas’s entertainment business he started in Dundee in the 80s – and Tennent’s Lager (it later became TRNSMT festival). After Ellis took over as chief executive of DF Concerts in 2001, Live Nation acquired a majority stake in 2008 – all of which means that King Tut’s has a financial security that is rare for a grassroots venue.‘The whole ecosystem is collapsing’: inside the crisis in Britain’s live music sceneRead moreIt’s also unique in that it doesn’t have outside promoters putting on their own gigs: all the booking are still done in house. Millar clearly sees all that as a privilege, too: “We’re just going to keep doing what we’re doing: continually finding artists, giving them a platform to be able to create and share their art.” He says the fundamentals won’t change – “People buy tickets because they love coming to live shows” – so what’s next? “Another 35 years. I truly believe that.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockGlasgowMusic industryIndieScotlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet the rumbles and grumbles emanating from public screenings suggests a disgruntled consensus is forming around the concluding instalment: that this is an altogether disjointed way to resolve the affairs of Ethan Hunt and his IMF crew, and a shaky way to ignite the movie summer season. Ninety minutes in which nothing happens over and over again, followed by 70 minutes of M:I B-roll.‘Breath-stoppingly tense’: which Mission: Impossible film is the greatest?Read moreTo better diagnose this latest glitch in the Hollywood machine, we need to return to the relighting of the fuse. This was the franchise to whichTom Cruiseretreated in the wake of the commercial underperformance of 1999’s Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia – the two most rigorous turns of this star’s career, films in which Cruise allowed himself to be rattled and be seen to be rattled, only to be met with widespread public and awards-circuit indifference. The Mission: Impossibles, by contrast, would be the sort of 4DX-coded sure thing for which audiences have routinely turned out, a creative safe space, even as the films’ constituent set pieces pushed their prime mover into performing ever riskier business to ensure bums on seats.In those early films, the character of Hunt was as much martyr and marked man as saviour or secular saint, targeted at every turn by directors with comparably forceful visions. The sensationalist De Palma revelled in the set-up’s potential for spectacle; and while, in retrospect, the motorbike-and-mullet combo of 2000’s M:I 2, directed by John Woo and set to a bruising Limp Bizkit beat, was bound to date rapidly, the sometime animator Brad Bird, in Ghost Protocol, had the bright idea of turning the series into a live-action cartoon, with Cruise defying gravity and nature alike by hanging off the side of the Burj Khalifa and personally outrunning a sandstorm.View image in fullscreenTom Cruise attends the Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning Mexico premiere.Photograph: Toya Sarno Jordan/Getty Images for Paramount PicturesThe last four films, however, bear the imprint of screenwriter turned director Christopher McQuarrie, who concluded that what this series needed was a little more conversation, overseeing the construction of a vast story framework for his star to dangle off one-handed. That approach reaches its apotheosis inThe Final Reckoning, but the scaffolding now overwhelms the spectacle. The attempt to solder eight films together ends in much-rewritten incoherence – see Ving Rhames’s confused sendoff – and, worryingly, results in missions being described rather than shown. You wonder whether the insurers blanched after Cruise crocked an ankle shooting 2018’s Fallout; now we’re left with folks talking at length in nondescript rooms. Is this a Mission: Impossible movie, as advertised, or some M:I-themed podcast?The spectacle, when it tardily follows, is subpar; nothing rivals the train derailment in 2023’s Dead Reckoning, which perversely benefitted from McQuarrie’s yen for stringing matters out. A soggy deep dive, cramped and claustrophobic, offers another (this time depressurised) chamber piece; during a rote subterranean shootout, we learn world-ending AI generators can apparently be stored in complex cave systems. (I mean, how long’s the extension cable?) The biplane conclusion feels more like the M:Is of yore, but chiefly reminds you of Top Gun: Maverick’s superior engineering. Too often, McQuarrie has deferred to Cruise and his exhausted stunt coordinators; as a result, the series’ bank of memorable images has dwindled.Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning review – world-saving Tom Cruise signs off with wildly entertaining adventureRead moreAt this length, other flaws become apparent. While the cast expanded once the series set up shop in London, the supporting players now have far less to do, save raise sporadic eyebrows in Hunt’s direction. McQuarrie has penned great intros for his women (Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Hayley Atwell), but they’re then stranded because Cruise is neither Cary Grant nor Colin Farrell. (Onscreen chemistry remains his most impossible mission.) Making artificial intelligence the villain in 2025 is a resonant choice, but it’s never developed beyond abstract concept; the human big bad (the ever-underused Esai Morales) is an afterthought. Late M:I is mostly All About Tom, or as the credits frame it: Tom Cruise in A Tom Cruise Production.Maybe the star still has enough goodwill in the tank to get the series over the line financially, but creatively, The Final Reckoning is a busted flush: the fact it’s been outperformed on opening weekend by alive-action Lilo & Stitchseems in some way telling. For his part, Cruise has earned the right to stand alone and unbowed atop the BFI Imax like the world’s most celebrated Antony Gormley figure; his stardom has only been reaffirmed over the course of the past quarter-century. But it’s a problem when your publicity stunts generate punchier images than anything in the film you’re promoting. That long-lit fuse flickered out before it reached the explosives; and in any event, the gelignite has been swapped for flannel and waffle.Explore more on these topicsMission: ImpossibleAction and adventure filmsTom CruisefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Musically it is very fine indeedTim AshleyWed 28 May 2025 10.32 EDTLast modified on Wed 28 May 2025 10.33 EDTShareOpera Holland Parkopens this year’s season with a new production of The Flying Dutchman, directed byJulia Burbachand conducted byPeter Selwyn. The company’s first everWagnerstaging, it aims high and doesn’t always succeed, though the best of it, both musically and theatrically, is unquestionably impressive.Burbach essentially stages it as a psychological horror story (which it is), making Eleanor Dennis’s Senta the central protagonist rather than Paul Carey Jones’s charismatic Dutchman, and heightening the opera’s sense of the uncanny by blurring the lines between reality and illusion as she dreams of escaping the normative confines of the world around her.Using both auditorium and stage for her setting, Burbach hauls us into Senta’s vivid imagination. Holland Park theatre’s tarpaulin roof has been extended to form the backdrop for the vertiginous platforms of Naomi Dawson’s set, so we seem to be sitting beneath the unfurling sails of some monstrous ship ourselves. Sailors haul ropes through the aisles and doss down on staircases, while ghostly, faceless figures move wraith-like among the audience.View image in fullscreenVertiginous … The Flying Dutchman by Opera Holland Park.Photograph: Ali WrightNot all of it works. Burbach is strong on Senta’s increasing disquiet at the erratic behaviour of Neal Cooper’s Erik, whose bristling resentment marks him out as potentially abusive. Yet her relationship with her equally dangerous father Daland (Robert Winslade Anderson), who would gladly sell her to the Dutchman for the latter’s wealth, is under-characterised and doesn’t hit home as much as it should. During the overture, Burbach confusingly and unnecessarily fills both stage and auditorium with women who may be Senta’s predecessors in trying to save the Dutchman’s soul. And the ending, deliberately enigmatic as to what redemption might consist of, or indeed whether it is even possible, is anticlimactic after what has gone before.A couple of tweaks to the score are odd – a choral refrain from Senta’s ballad transferred to the close of Act I, and Daland’s crew and the Norwegian women are missing from the final scene. But there are some terrific performances. Dennis, radiant in tone, is outstanding and entirely convincing as a restless visionary in the grip of forces beyond reason. Carey Jones captures the Dutchman’s spiritual and moral anguish with singing of great emotional depth and verbal subtlety. Cooper makes a fiercely intense Erik, less lyrical than some, which works well with Burbach’s view of the character. Winslade Anderson, meanwhile, sounds suave, tellingly masking ambition behind glibness. Conducting a reduced orchestration by Tony Burke, Selwyn took time to settle on opening night, though the gathering tensions and hurtling momentum of the final two acts were superbly done. There was fine playing from the City of London Sinfonia, and theOpera Holland ParkChorus, sensational throughout, have done little finer.Until 14 JuneExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicOpera Holland ParkreviewsShareReuse this content"

In a culture of lookism, being seen is understood as tantamount to existing, even to survival. But being seen is complicated. Both the current exhibitions at Autograph grapple with this through photographs by two women of the same generation working in portraiture.Eileen Perrier’s A Thousand Small Stories occupies the ground-floor gallery. Since the 1990s, Perrier’s work has centred on setting up temporary photographic studios, in homes, hair salons, on the streets of Brixton and Peckham in London, and at a metro station in Paris. Her 2009 exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in London displayed large-format Polaroid portraits taken in pop-up studios at Petticoat Lane market and in the nearby 23-storey tower block Denning Point. The travelling portrait studio has been a device Perrier has used for 30 years, to take photography into diverse communities and tackle the politics of beauty and identity. This is the first survey of her work.View image in fullscreenClose-up … from the series Red, Gold and Green, 1996-1997 by Eileen Perrier.Photograph: Eileen Perrier/© Eileen Perrier. Courtesy the artist and Autograph, LondonPerrier makes portraits that don’t rely on beauty but find it everywhere. She doesn’t flatter – in fact the lighting and poses in her pictures in some series are direct references to school photographs, such as Grace (2000) in which her subjects, including the photographer and her mother, share the physical trait diastema (a gap between the teeth). Perrier’s subjects are mostly regular people, commuters, passersby. In these quick encounters with ordinary lives, Perrier gives glimpses of beauty where you don’t look for it.An image of two women on a leather chesterfield, from the series Red, Gold and Green (made between 1996 and 1997 in the homes of three generations of British Ghanaians), scintillates with shining confidence, from the women’s style to the polished ceramics gleaming on the dresser behind them. The makeshift red cloth Perrier has hung up behind them is a reminder that this is a studio, too, where an unexpected moment of beauty, through the alchemy of the camera, becomes an eternity.There’s an unresolved paradox in Perrier’s pictures, between the artifice of beauty and the photographer’s constant quest to find it. Perrier acknowledges this, between celebrating beauty and critiquing it, right from the start of her career. One of the earliest works in the show belongs to her documentary portrait series, Afro Hair andBeautyShow. Between 1998 and 2003, Perrier photographed women attending the annual show at Alexandra Palace, one of the venue’s biggest events of the time.It’s a document of evolving styles, creativity and the importance of self-expression through hair. While making the portraits, Perrier also began collecting and photographing products for black hair and skin from London shops and photographing them. She turned these grooming goods into a wallpaper that also charts a controversial side of the beauty industry: Dear Heart promises skin lightening, hair relaxant for children is marketed as Beautiful Beginnings.View image in fullscreenUnravelling self-image … from the series Belonging and Beyond, 2025, by Dianne Minnicucci.Photograph: © Dianne Minnicucci, courtesy the artistPerrier is positioned through this show as an important counter to a Photoshopped, retouched reality, in a culture of beauty and image worship. Upstairs Dianne Minnicucci’s small exhibition of new works – made as part of a residency funded by Autograph – picks up on the impact of white-centric beauty standards on women of colour. Minnicucci confesses to not being comfortable in front of the camera herself – she has portrayed her family and domestic scenes with an intimate, autobiographical tenor but had never ventured in front of the lens herself.Her show, Belonging and Beyond, is about a personal struggle with self-image, compounded by photography, and now using photography as a means to unravel and understand it. Like Perrier, Minnicucci began by dismantling and reconstructing her studio – bringing it into the classroom of Thomas Tallis school, south-east London, where she is head of photography. Working alongside her students for six months, inviting them into the work as collaborators, Minnicucci was forced to practise what she’d preached – to embrace discomfort.A series of wistful black and white self-portraits sees Minnicucci try to break through this awkward confrontation, all of them shot in Lesnes Abbey Woods. We see her figuring out what to do with her body, her hands, her gaze. Half-masked by spiky shrubs and trees, thesepictures have a quiet, self-conscious grace. Minnicucci dressed in white in this misty atmosphere looks shyly away from the camera, tentative, uncertain. This is not really about the images but what the process reveals. In a film accompanying the images, Minnicucci realises where her trepidation in taking self-portraits as a black woman might come from: “Because I haven’t been exposed to those images, maybe that’s why?”Eileen Perrier’s A Thousand Small Stories, and Dianne Minnicucci’s Belonging and Beyond areboth at Autograph, London, until 13 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsPhotographyArtBeautyBritish identity and societyreviewsShareReuse this content"

She said: “Paul Danan was clearly much loved and is very much missed. Mr Danan had a long history of drug misuse and struggles with his mental health. His death was caused by a combination of drugs, both prescription and illicit.“Paul had struggled with his mental health for many years. I don’t have any evidence before me that Paul intended to take his own life at this time. Therefore, the conclusion is misadventure.”In a statement his mother, Beverley Danan, told the court: “Paul helped so many people from all walks of life but just couldn’t help himself in the same way. His smiling face and love of life will always be remembered.”Danan had been due to appear for a plea hearing at Warrington magistrates court on 16 January after being charged with being in possession of cocaine and cannabis, according to court documents. He was also accused of driving while under the influence of drugs on 2 October last year in Warrington, Cheshire.Danan discussed his substance abuse and recovery on ITV’s The Jeremy Kyle Show in 2019, which he said began when he was a teenager. He said he had to “work hard at it every day to keep in recovery”.Calum Best, the son of the footballer George Best, who took part in reality shows with Danan, described him as one of the “funniest, kindest, and most authentic people I’ve known”.A statement from Independent Creative Management said: “Paul was a beacon of light to so many.

They got the chance to record their own version of the rhythm and blues song My Girl Sloopy, with a 17-year-old Derringer as frontman – renamed Hang on Sloopy, it reached No 1 in the US in 1965. After Ohio State University’s marching band started playing it at college football games, it got another boost in popularity and eventually, in 1985, Ohio designated it the state’s official rock song.The McCoys had another US Top 10 hit with the follow-up, a cover of Little Willie John’s Fever. Come On, Let’s Go reached No 22 the following year and the group recorded five albums together.The McCoys then partnered with blues rocker Johnny Winter for the group Johnny Winter And, who made the first recording of another Derringer rock classic: Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo. The definitive version came in 1973, performed by Derringer for his debut solo album All American Boy. This raunchy and swaggering hard-rock track reached No 23 in the US, and later earned high-profile syncs on the soundtracks to Richard Linklater film Dazed and Confused and the fourth season of Stranger Things.View image in fullscreenDerringer performing with his band Derringer at the Oakland Coliseum, California, in 1977.Photograph: Gregg Cobarr/Getty ImagesAlso in 1973, Derringer returned to the top of the US charts thanks to his production and guitar playing for the Edgar Winter Group (fronted by the brother of Johnny Winter), on the hard-rocking instrumental Frankenstein. He also contributed to their No 14 hit Free Ride the same year.Derringer continued to release studio albums, eventually numbering 14 in all, but his most high-profile work came as a guitarist and producer for others.By 1973 he’d already played on a couple of songs on Alice Cooper’s 1971 album Killer, and begun a fruitful partnership with Todd Rundgren, appearing on a number of his albums over the years. He later played on the Steely Dan albums Countdown to Ecstasy, Katy Lied and Gaucho, and, in collaboration with Jim Steinman, two of the biggest power ballads of the 1980s: Air Supply’s Making Love Out of Nothing at All and Bonnie Tyler’s Total Eclipse of the Heart.Derringer went on to work with another Steinman acolyte, Meat Loaf, on the album Blind Before I Stop and the TV show Way Off Broadway, and played lead guitar on the Steinman-penned Left in the Dark, the lead single from Barbra Streisand’s 1984 album Emotion.Another repeat collaborator was “Weird Al” Yankovic, including on his Grammy-winning Michael Jackson spoof Eat It. More cheerfully silly work was in the world of American wrestling, with Derringer writing Hulk Hogan’s theme song Real American and producing tie-in albums for the World Wrestling Federation.The 1980s and 90s brought a partnership with Cyndi Lauper – Derringer played on her album True Colours and A Night to Remember, and joined her touring band.He later went on three world tours with Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band, and recorded albums with his wife Jenda, including one with their children Lory and Marn. Derringer continued to tour throughout his life, and his most recent album Rock the Yacht, another collaboration with Jenda, was released in 2023.Explore more on these topicsPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

LaBella’s lawsuit,filed in California on Tuesday, alleges that on 2 May 2023 Costner improvised a scene in which Juliette would be raped, one day after Hunt and LaBella filmed a scripted scene in which Juliette was raped by a different character.Hunt refused to perform the new scene, the lawsuit alleges, and LaBella was summoned to set, without knowing that Hunt had declined and left.According to her complaint, LaBella was not warned that the new male actor had been directed to mount her, pin her down and “violently” rake up her skirt. LaBella alleges that Costner told her to “lay down” in a wagon before he directed the male actor “to repeatedly perform a violent simulated rape” on her while Costner “experimented with different takes of the rape action”.LaBella’s suit alleges that the scene violated contractural protocols negotiated by the performers’ union Sag-Aftra, which requires that all performers are given 48 hours notice and must consent to any scenes involving nudity or simulated sex.She claims she was not given the required notice and that she did not consent, as stipulated in her contract. She also claims the film’s intimacy coordinator was not present, which was mandatory under Hunt’s contract and applied to LaBella as her stand in.Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 1 – Costner casts himself as wildly desirable cowboyRead moreThe lawsuit also claims the set was not closed; only a minimal crew is meant to be present for sensitive scenes involving nudity, sex or rape. LaBella’s suit claims “the scene was broadcast publicly on monitors for the entire crew to witness … anyone could walk by and observe the scene being performed.”LaBella’s suit states that the scripted rape scene, filmed the day before, involved rehearsals and the presence of an intimacy coordinator, and the set was closed for the actors’ privacy.LaBella is suing for damages for sexual harassment, a hostile work environment and breach of contract, claiming she immediately felt “shock, embarrassment and humiliation” and began attending therapy in June 2023.“I was left exposed, unprotected, and deeply betrayed by a system that promised safety and professionalism,” LaBella said. “What happened to me shattered my trust and forever changed how I move through this industry.”Costner denied the allegations. In a statement given to Variety and Deadline,his attorney Marty Singer said the actor-director“always wants to make sure that everyone is comfortable working on his films and takes safety on set very seriously”, and said LaBella’s claim has “absolutely no merit, and it is completely contradicted by her own actions – and the facts”.Singer said the scene had been explained to LaBella, and after a rehearsal, she had given a “thumbs up” to a stunt coordinator, indicating her consent. He also claimed LaBella had been in “good spirits” afterwards and produced a text message that LaBella allegedly sent to the stunt coordinator after the shoot which read: “Thank you for these wonderful weeks! I so appreciate you! I learned so much and thank you again. I’m really happy it worked out the way it did to. Have a great rest of the shoot and yes talk soon!”LaBella’s lawsuit claims that she had complained to colleagues about the experience but, because production was still under way, she felt she “had to continue working and keep up a professional attitude”.Costner has partly self-funded the first two Horizon films, putting up US$38m of the estimated US$100m budget.Chapter 1was released in June 2024 but flopped at the box office, making $38.7m globally. Chapter 2 premiered at theVenice international film festivalin September 2024 but a general release date is yet to be announced.Explore more on these topicsKevin CostnerWesternsLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

He was at the festival speaking about his book What Does Israel Fear from Palestine? – a question he answers succinctly in his panel. “The very existence of Palestine is what Israel fears.”Describing his daily life, Shehadeh told the audience how Israeli settlers had attacked a nearby Palestinian village, firebombing houses and cars “with the help of the Israeli army”.Israel Defense Forces checkpoints made the hill walking he loves difficult but, he said, “this is nothing compared to what’s happening in Gaza”.“We hear the planes, the jet fighters … they streak through the sky on the way to Gaza to kill more people,” he told Australian writer Abbas El-Zein, who moderated the session. “And so we cannot complain.”View image in fullscreen‘I don’t think Hamas could have carried out October 7 without extensive dehumanisation of Jews and Israelis’: Ittay Flescher at the Sydney writers’ festival with Michael Visontay.Photograph: Jacqueline Edmont/Sydney writers’ festivalIttay Flescher, an Australian Jewish writer and peace activist, joined the festival via video link from Jerusalem, where he moved with his family from Melbourne in 2018. The audience was warned before the session began that earlier in the evening Flescher had had to evacuate his home because of incoming rockets from Yemen.Flescher, who is the education director at Kids4Peace Jerusalem, an interfaith movement for Israelis and Palestinians, said a key element in working towards peace was combating the dehumanisation of the other side that has occurred in the region.“I don’t think Hamas could have carried out October 7 without extensive dehumanisation of Jews and Israelis … And what Israel has done in Gaza, not just killing Hamas, but killing so so many innocent men, women and children that were not connected to Hamas … and now the limiting of food into Gaza and the starvation, that can’t happen without extensive dehumanisation.”Peter Beinart, an Jewish American political commentator, echoed the need for humanisation of the other, and listening to voices across the divides of the conflict in his sold-out event on Sunday.“Palestinians lack permission to narrate,” he said, echoing the literary greatEdward Said.View image in fullscreen‘Every person I know from Gaza has lost count of the number of people who’ve been killed’: Peter Beinart.Photograph: Jacquie Manning/SWF“There is this process in which, as a Jew, from the moment you can remember you’ve been talking about Palestinians, but you’re never listening to Palestinians or actually meeting with Palestinians. And I think this is a recipe for both ignorance and dehumanisation,” Beinart told Debbie Whitmont.Beinart said he wrotehis recent book, Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza, to try to offer “a voice that my mind comes from … from love and from Jewish solidarity, to say to the people in my life that I love that I think something has gone horribly, horribly wrong”.“When I look at what’s happening in Gaza, a place where most of the buildings and the schools and the universities and the mosques and the churches and the bakeries and the agriculture have been destroyed, and people have been displaced from their homes … every person I know from Gaza has lost count of the number of people who’ve been killed,” he said.“It seems to me this is the most profoundchillul hashem –desecration of God’s name – that I have witnessed in my entire life, and it will constitute not just a moral crisis for the Jewish people but for those of us who take Judaism seriously.”‘The league tables of horror’At a packed – and occasionally tense – session on Friday morning, the British Jewish barrister and author Philippe Sands and Michael Gawenda, the former editor of the Age, spoke about antisemitism and xenophobia.Gawenda argued that many Jewish Australians working in the arts had been refused work because of their political stance on Israel.“They feel like they are being rejected on the basis that they are Jews, Jews of a particular kind. And I think that there’s evidence that this is widespread in Australia ... It’s widespread in the arts, I’m absolutely convinced of that.”Gawenda’s comments prompted a heated question from an audience member about the experience of Arab Australians who had missed out on opportunities due to their pro-Palestinian stance, namingKhaled SabsabiandAntoinette Lattoufas examples.Sabsabi had been selected as Australia’s representative at the 2026 Venice Biennale but was dumped by Creative Australia over past works that involved imagery of Hassan Nasrallah, the now-dead Hezbollah leader, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks.Of Sabsabi, Gawenda said: “With his cancellation, there was a huge uproar ... Letters were signed, petitions were signed calling it out, including by Jews who would have been opposed to his views. There were no letters or petitions supporting these young Jewish artists, none. They got no support at all. Lattouf got heaps of support, as she should have. I think it was a mistake what the ABC did.”View image in fullscreenMichael Visontay, Philippe Sands and Michael Gawenda.Photograph: Jamie Williams/SWFSands, who is a king’s counsel, spoke about the risks of a sense of competition between marginalised groups, and of antisemitism being weaponised by politicians for their own political ends.“The concern about creating the league tables of horror is that it leads to an instrumentalisation of what’s going on. And what I really worry about right now is that what’s going on is instrumentalising antisemitism for other purposes,” he said.Tension among the audience was heightened when the first question from the crowd came from a woman asking about the “Zionist lobby”, which she said had put “its tentacles into everything” – an antisemitic trope that attracted gasps and furious comments from other members of the audience. The question was shut down by the moderator.Rage and griefFor many in Australia with family and cultural ties to the region, art has become a place to express their rage and grief.The Lebanese Australian writerSara Haddad, the Lebanese Palestinian poet Hasib Hourani and the Palestinian Australian playwrightSamah Sabawidiscussed with moderator Micaela Sahhar their texts of home and identity against the backdrop of the Israeli bombardment and blockade of Gaza. All three works were published after 7 October 2023.‘The world does not care if we all die’: hunger and despair in the ruins of Gaza CityRead moreSabawi started writing Cactus Pear for My Beloved, which tells the story of her family’s expulsion from Gaza and settling in Queensland over 100 years, in 2016. It was intended as a celebration of her father and her home. By the time she got to writing the author’s note, in December 2023, “a lot of Gaza was fast turning into rubble”.“My family was on the run, my grandfather’s home destroyed. Much of our neighbourhood was gone. And then my father, watching the news, fell and broke his ribs,” Sabawi said. After her father died in 2024, the book “became an obituary for both”.Haddad began writing The Sunbird, a novel following a Palestinian woman’s memory as a child in the Nakba and then adulthood in Australia, in response to Israel’s bombardment of Gaza.She started her novel in December 2023, after seeing the words written by Dr Mahmoud Abu Nujaila on a whiteboard in his hospital in Gaza: “Whoever stays until the end will tell the story. We did what we could. Remember us.” Haddad finished the book in January and self-published.“Watching this for many years … I knew that Israel had what it wanted and what it needed, and it wasn’t going to stop. They were not going to stop. And so I knew that I had to do everything I possibly could to speak as loudly as I could.“I wrote the book very quickly. I had a deadline. I knew it was urgent.”Explore more on these topicsSydney writers' festivalIsrael-Gaza warSydneyAntisemitismIslamophobiaAustralian booksReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Either way, the latest instalment of the Barbican’s celebrations for the centenary of20th-century musical giant Pierre BoulezfeaturingEnsemble intercontemporain(his own crack team for new music) drew only a paltry audience. The man himself was dismissive of such difficulties: “You always find 200 fanatics,” he once observed. “What is important is to increase the number.” (Composer, conductor, visionary – but Boulez was no PR maven.)The fanatics, at least, were there – though they hadn’t come for Boulez himself, if the polite response to a thrillingly anarchic performance of his Sur Incises after the interval was anything to go by. Under rising-star conductorNicolò Umberto Foron, its moments of freefall reverberation were a delicious release from the ultra-precise rhythmic flurries of three pianos, thunderous in their lower register.Instead, it was the first half that generated excitement: a taut, intensely focused performance ofshouting forever into the receiver, for which British composerHannah Kendallwon an Ivor Novello award in 2023, followed by the world premiere of composer, saxophonist and bandleaderCassie Kinoshi’s [Untitled].Kendall’s piece is a haunting exploration of Cuban writer Antonio Benítez-Rojo’s concept of the “Plantation Machine”. Much of the finely textured score functions as pitched white noise around crackly walkie-talkie speech in French and English. At its most memorable moment, the orchestral instruments fall silent, leaving only music boxes cranking out extracts of classical hits and harmonicas producing vivid note-clusters on every exhalation like an ethereal musical life-support machine.Kinoshi’s [Untitled] was a noisier, funkier affair, incorporating virtuosic live turntabling byNikNak, whose whirlwind scratches cut deeply across the orchestra’s dense textures, as well as video by French artistJulien Creuzetand solo choreography fromtyroneisaacstuart. Musically, it was exquisitely paced. Momentum gathered through the hefty bass of lower strings, fiendish trumpet curlicues were picked up by a cello screaming high up the fingerboard and two flutes combined in a moreish, barline-defying groove. At the heady climax, the orchestra was suddenly cut, leaving only a symphony of squelches, echoes and loops from the turntable, spinning out overhead.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicPierre BoulezreviewsShareReuse this content"

When the idea of the opera was first mooted, Wagner’s great-granddaughter Eva approved it, “as long as Cosima doesn’t come out of it very well”. She doesn’t, almost no one does, and certainly not the extraordinary and appalling figure of Houston Chamberlain.Chamberlainis so little known that he could be a figment of librettists Lutz Hübner and Sarah Nemitz’s imagination, yet the opera’s historical veracity is impeccable. The English Germanophile, a failed scientist and admirer of Wagner, inveigled his way into Cosima’s household, eventually marrying Wagner’s daughter Eva. He was, through his writings on German supremacy, a crucial architect of the antisemitism and hatred that Kaiser Wilhelm II and Adolf Hitler admired and upheld.View image in fullscreenAn authentic piece … Avner Dorman’s Wahnfried.Photograph: Matthew Williams-EllisFrom the outset, when Chamberlain appears as a naive and ridiculous bumbler who believes that the order of the world is for the strong to kill the weak, the tenor of the narrative is chilling and deeply disquieting, despite moments of clowning black humour. As Dorman observed at the time of the world premiere in Germany in 2017, the same horrors are being perpetrated in the world today – and so much ignored – making Longborough Festival Opera’s UK premiere and director Polly Graham’s brilliant production important and all the braver.The irony in the opera’s title is implicit. Wagner named his home inBayreuth, Bavaria, Wahnfried, meaning free from delusion, but this is a portrait of madness writ large against a background of blood-red velvet drapes. The deluded fervour first of the Wagnerites and then of Mark Le Brocq’s Chamberlain – simply a tour de force – is monstrous. Le Broq andSusan Bullock’s imperious Cosima are a hateful pair, their philosophy of hate for the Jews carefully delineated. It’s Chamberlain who pushes Cosima to banish her daughter Isolde, spirited into a Tardis-like box with the demand that she reimagine herself in keeping with the true Wagner ethos; he too insists on her brother Siegfried’s homosexuality being hidden. Andrew Watts’s impassioned aria to his lover is a focal point, while the picture of Siegfried’s hardly idyllic marriage to Winifred Williams – the better known figure here for her insidious cosying up to Hitler, sung by the formidable Alexandra Lowe – is a further marker of the authenticity of the piece.View image in fullscreenImpeccable stagecraft … Susan Bullock as Cosima with Mark Le Brocq as Houston Chamberlain.Photograph: Matthew Williams-EllisWritten in 20 scenes, each setting flagged up on a small blackboard, the driving energy of the second of two acts is the more convincing. Dorman’s music, multifaceted in its references – Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Wagner himself – is incisive, with often brittle instrumentation, and dynamically paced by conductor Justin Brown. The impeccable stagecraft carries the evening, but there are two characters who haunt Chamberlain to inject a further dimension. Hermann Levi – the Jew who conducted the Bayreuth premiere of Parsifal, the opera that became core to the family wrangling – is sympathetically portrayed, embracing the terrible and ever-present contradictions, perhaps an alter ego for Dorman. But it is the mischievous figure of Oskar McCarthy’s Wagner-Daemon, the composer’s familiar after death, whose disapproval brings a lighter note. It’s his final judgment that Chamberlain, who aspired to be counted alongside Kant, Goethe and Wagner himself, will – like all Wagner’s heroes – ultimately be a failure. It was Dorman, taking a bow at the curtain call, who was greeted as a hero.Until 14 JuneExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Since then, her acclaimed graphic novels have focused mainly on herself and her family.Fun Homein 2006 (exploring her closeted, funeral-director father’s suicide and her coming out) was followed byAre You My Mother?(psychoanalysis and her relationship with her mother) andThe Secret to Superhuman Strength(her compulsive exercising, from karate and crunches to snowshoeing).These three erudite, pensive and observant works spend most of their time looking back. Where the modern Bechdel is present, she is mostly sketching, editing and narrating her past, and contemplating how everyone from Jack Kerouac and Virginia Woolf topaediatrician Donald Winnicottcan help her shed light on it.In Spent, by contrast, we meet an Alison Bechdel who lives largely in the present. She writes and draws in rural Vermont, campaigns for progressive causes and hangs out with her friends and her wife, Holly. Yet this book-Alison is not quite the real Bechdel. In Spent, Alison’s father was a taxidermist, not a mortician; Bechdel’s two brothers have been replaced by aMaga-loving sister. In our world, Fun Home has been made into a Tony-winning musical and is being (slowly) developed into a movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal. The equivalent in Spent is Death and Taxidermy, a graphic memoir whose very loose TV adaptation (dragons and cannibalism feature, alongside Aubrey Plaza and Benedict Cumberbatch) is on to its third season.The book-Alison has mixed feelings about its success, but the royalties help fund the pygmy goat sanctuary she runs with Holly, and give her the leeway to prevaricate as she plans a new work: $um, an accounting of money and her life, with a little help from Karl Marx. Progress is slow: headlines about Trump’s first term blare from her device screens, the goats are grabbing every opportunity to breed, Holly is increasingly keen to film everything for her social feeds and Covid has the world in its grip. America is atomised, with “a zillion streaming options with six people tuned into each of them”, Alison says. “No wonder the country’s a mess.”Yet Spent is anything but a book about a writer’s lonely lot. Alison’s liberal community bustles with gossip and life. There are vets to befriend, new neighbours to meet, anticolonial Thanksgiving dinners to attend and speeches to give against book banning. Just down the road, her friends Ginger, Lois, Sparrow and Stuart share a house, this quartet – in another metafictional twist – having wandered over from the panels of Dykes to Watch Out For.Spent, then, feels less like a fictionalised autobiography and more a gathering of threads from Bechdel’s life and work, a celebration of and a rumination on where she has landed in late middle age, and how some of her fictional creations might live alongside her.Writing about herself from a greater fictional distance seems to have given the author more room to have funThat doesn’t mean first-time readers won’t enjoy it. Bechdel’s acutely observant line drawings – here enriched with warm colour by the real-life Holly – lend themselves wonderfully to the alternately comfortable, intimate and awkward interactions of her cast as they gather around tamari-roasted turnips and fennel flambé to shoot the breeze. There’s always been a spark to Bechdel’s work, despite its often serious themes, and writing about herself from a greater fictional distance seems to have given her more room to have fun. Dramas and mishaps unspool with a lightly comic charm that belies the darkness in the world outside, from Alison’s optimistic side-hustle (she pitches a reality TV show based on ethical living) to Sparrow and Stuart’s experiment as a throuple with old friend Naomi (a vegan purple dildo is delivered with a wink by a FedEx driver).Yet it’s longtime fans who will get the most from Spent. There’s a real joy to seeing characters return, their shapes a little baggier, their hair greyer, but their spirits the same. If you’ve treasured sharing Bechdel’s days spent hunched over her diary as a pale and anxious child, or cycling up theAdirondacksas a fitness-mad thirtysomething, it’s poignant to meet an Alison whose fierce self-analysis has mellowed a little. There’s a pathos, too, in seeing once-young radicals engage with a younger generation, in the form of Sparrow and Stuart’s daughter JR, who has returned to Vermont after the collapse of her polycule.Spent isn’t perfect. At times Alison’s world, with its “Shmetflix” and “Schmamazon” and “sage and sawdust” gluten-free stuffing, seems broad pastiche. There are stretches where you feel like you’re watching comfortably off semi-retirees cosplaying as agricultural workers. Yet while Spent may lack some of the raw power of Bechdel’s earlier work, this wise and playful tale has deep roots. On a flight back from pitching half-interested streaming networks about her reality TV show Alison soars over the “intriguingly wrinkled landscape of the south-west”, asks for a pencil and starts drawing over a TV script, the “rasp of graphite on paper … opening the flat page into another dimension”.It’s a neat epiphany and a lovely summary of the craft of comics, and it feels thoroughly earned. By the end of Spent, Alison has learned that she can’t do everything, but that perhaps doing something – and being in the moment with people you love – is enough. It’s an almost cosy conclusion, undercut by what we know but the book-Alison does not: that Trump will return, not long after her account has finished. Will Alison keep her newfound joie de vivre? I hope we get to find out.Spent: A Comic Novel by Alison Bechdel is published by Jonathan Cape (£20). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Luckily F1 25 – crafted, as ever, in Birmingham by Codemasters – has many. There’s the return of Braking Point, the game’s story mode; a revamp of My Team, the most popular career mode; a tie-up with the forthcoming F1: The Movie; and perhaps most intriguing of all, the chance to race round three tracks in the reverse direction to normal.F1 25 feels like something of a culmination – last year’sF1 24, for example, introduced a new physics model which required tweaks after launch, but has now been thoroughly fettled, so F1 25’s essential building blocks of car handling (and tyre wear) plus state-of-the-art graphics (this year, Codemasters has moved on from previous-gen consoles) are simply impeccable.View image in fullscreenImpeccable graphics … F1 25.Photograph: Electronic ArtsThis has freed the company to delve into the sort of fantasy elements that you can find in games but not real life. Chief among those is the aforementioned third instalment of Braking Point, which follows the fortunes of the fictional Konnersport team. Over 15 chapters it knits together a deliciously tortuous soap opera-style storyline with some cleverly varied on-track action.More fundamentally, the most popular of the career modes – My Team, which ramps up the management element by casting you as the owner of a new team – has received the bulk of Codemasters’ attentions. This time around, you stay in your corporate lane and drive instead as either of the two drivers you’ve hired, which makes much more sense than previously. As does separating research and development, meaning you must allocate new parts to specific drivers. Further effective tweaks render My Team 2.0, as Codemasters calls it, much more convincing and realistic.As ever, you can jump online, against various standards of opposition, or on to individual tracks, or play split-screen against a friend. But there’s a new mode called Challenge Career, which lets you play timed scenarios offline, then post them to a global leaderboard. It’s a nice idea, designed to take you out of your driver-aids comfort zone, but the scenarios will only get going properly after launch, so the jury remains out on its merits. A number of scenarios from F1: The Movie will also be delivered as post-launch episodes, but it’s pretty cool to be able to step into a Formula One car as Brad Pitt playing a fictional racer.For diehard Formula One fans, though, the chance to race around Silverstone, Zandvoort and Austria’s Red Bull Ring in the wrong direction (with the tracks remodelled to accommodate new pit lanes and the like) might just be the clincher. Reversing the tracks’ direction completely changes their nature in a deliciously intriguing manner.With a real-life rule-change next year due to change the cars radically, Formula One currently feels like it’s at a generational peak, and F1 25 is so brilliantly crafted and full of elements that generate an irresistible mix of nailed-on realism and fantasy that it, too, feels like the culmination of a generation of officially licensed Formula One games.

They graced some NME covers, they played Glastonbury, but even at the height of their success they could definitely pop to the shops without getting mobbed. Still, you’re always Dylan-big to your biggest fans, and Charles (Tim Key) is exactly that. He’s also a reclusive lottery winner, giving him the motive and the means to stage a private reunion gig for an audience of one on a remote island.Basden and Key starring in a film about a folk band reunion might have you expecting something a little bit sketch comedy, but this turns out to be a different beast: a funny but also melancholy piece of work. It’s more interested in maintaining a consistent and sincere emotional connection than in wild virtuoso showboating.As superfan Charles, Key blends a bit of the pleasant oddness he always brings to his acting roles with the verbal playfulness familiar to admirers of his poetry. Charles has a galloping case of verbal diarrhoea; like a perpetual talk radio DJ, he overflows with continual jokey non-jokes – “Houston, we have chutney, and it’s not a problem” – and is seemingly petrified of the possibility of leaving dead air.Basden does excellent work as a character, in contrast, whose face does the talking: a spiky presence, all low cut T-shirts, wounded ego and rounded shoulders. It’s a perfect performance both as an actor and, when the songs come along, as a musician. Basden wrote the music here and it is played and sung completely straight; it’s all rather beautiful. And while she might be a bigger name, Mulligan has a lot less to do than either of them: she is entirely plausible as a woman who was once part of the duo and now makes jam in Portland with her geek-chic birdwatching husband. You’ll leave wanting your own island, your own gig and your own lock of Carey Mulligan’s hair.The Ballad of Wallis Island is in UK cinemas from 30 MayExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsFolk musicCarey MulliganTim KeyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Rather than other players, they fight a variety of monsters and explore locations lifted directly from the Elden Ring universe. After each match, they also gain upgrade materials to modify future runs and advance the game’s story, similar to a rogue-like game … so it’s a Fortnite/Elden Ring/Hades experience? This is getting complicated.View image in fullscreenRace against time … Elden Ring Nightreign.Photograph: Bandai NamcoEvery session is an engagingly frantic race against time to craft an on-the-fly strategy that takes you across the whole map. Each match is split into three days: on the first two, you pick areas to rush through, besting local bosses to gain minor buffs to your strength or loot weapons with powerful passive abilities, before escaping the rapidly closing ring that saps your health and is sure to end your run. Each night culminates in a larger and far more challenging fight than you’ve faced thus far, amping up the pressure even further.It’s quite the stressful slog, but day three is what you’re battling towards. As the day dawns, you step into a barren arena, ready to face one of several tough-as-nails mega bosses specifically designed to be tackled by multiple players.Nightreign is overwhelmingly designed for three-person teams. Youcanchoose to head out on your own, but doing so is a severe challenge. There’s no one to get you back up if you accidentally die rolling into a boss’s attack, and many of the enemies designed to be tackled by a team of allies frequently overwhelm you.View image in fullscreenBest not to tackle this on your own … Elden Ring Nightreign.Photograph: Bandai NamcoUltimately, this is a game all about momentum. The feeling of pressure as you navigate the world is palpable. Every second, you’re constantly questioning yourself: am I wasting too much time by checking what’s around this corner? Can we take down this boss quickly enough to warrant the reward? It’s an incredibly stimulating experience, as you rush to analyse your equipment and make build-defining decisions on the fly, but so much has been modified for the sake of speed that the nuance typical to FromSoftware games is somewhat lost.There’s no choice of stats when levelling up, for example, with levelling now reduced to the mash of a button when you reach a rest point. And while the world has been painstakingly populated with smaller enemies, beyond taking down a couple in the first few seconds of a run to hit level 2, there’s little point engaging with them, since tackling bosses is the main way to get more powerful.This momentum gives Nightreign its “just one more run” feel, but the pace feels more rapid than necessary, reducing much of the world to a distraction that wastes your precious time. It’s also why the bugs present in the review version we played feel particularly frustrating. Spending five minutes tackling a dragon that then flies through a wall and ends up being untargetable feels particularly unfair.One of the more loathed mechanics from the Dark Souls series is the requirement for you to run back to the boss arena every time you die. When this was updated for Elden Ring, allowing you to respawn right outside the arena, fans rejoiced. Yet the Nightreign experience is such an extreme move back in the other direction that it feels almost Sisyphean. Every run requires you to spend around 35 minutes to reach the final boss, but those bosses often have unique mechanics that can wipe out unsuspecting teams in just a couple of hits. Dying to a new move you’ve not seen before, requiring you to spend another 35 minutes rolling that boulder back up the hill, feels grossly disrespectful.Considering the success of Elden Ring in applying FromSoftware’s dense level design ethos to an open world, it’s disappointing that the developer appears to have missed the mark with Nightreign. Where that game iterated, Nightreign takes shortcuts. It is billed as a standalone release, yet so much environmental content is carbon-copied from Elden Ring – often thrown in haphazardly – that the world feels more like a particularly polished fan-created mod than a whole new title.FromSoftware’s experiment in upending its established gameplay formula is admirable, and taking down gargantuan foes alongside friends really adds to the joy you feel at finally besting what at first felt like an insurmountable task. It’s just a shame that the game’s skewed pacing and overreliance on Elden Ring’s pool of assets so greatly mars the experience.Elden Ring Nightreign is out Friday 30 May; £34.99Explore more on these topicsGamesPlayStation 5Xbox series S/XPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

I had a fat Penguin book of trivia (1991 edition) balanced on my knees, gifted by a past guest who’d written on the yellowing flyleaf: “This is your only entertainment.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

No electricity. No running water – just space for sleeping and access to a loo, 100 metres away. In other ways it has everything you really need.North Devon mapBothies are more often associated with Scotland. But since 2015, the National Trust has opened a scattering of bookable “camps with walls” in the south-west, including Heddon Orchard and Foreland (a converted stable). This spring the NT unveiled a new one at West Challacombe, above the seaside village of Combe Martin, where five-star views cost from just £15 a night for exclusive use. Well-spaced along North Devon’s Exmoor coast, these three spots make it easy to plan a low-cost bothy-to-bothy walking weekend, using theSouth West Coast Pathor other trails. Both Combe Martin and Lynton (between Foreland and Heddon) can be reached by bus from Barnstaple station, so you don’t need a car. And, although wild-feeling, each bothy is within walking distance of a pub.View image in fullscreenWest Challacombe bothy.Photograph: Sarah Baxter“The bothies are about getting more people into nature – we’re fighting to keep affordable accommodation down here,” said Amy U’Ren, the National Trust’s Volunteering & Community Officer for West Exmoor. She was showing me and my husband around the green, gorse-bright slopes of West Challacombe, 41 hectares (100 acres) of former sheep pasture that the NT is slowly working to make more biodiverse. “It’s exciting – we’re at the start of the project,” Amy added. “It’s about restoring nature and natural processes: sowing wildflowers, digging ponds, reconnecting rivers to floodplains, using pigs, cows and Exmoor ponies for grazing – all to create a mix of habitats.” So far, 20,000 trees have been planted here.In the midst of all this sits the bothy, an old stone barn freshly fitted with sleeping platforms and full-width doors that fling open to the outside world. The loo is a quarter-mile away, in an outbuilding of 15th-centuryWest Challacombe Manor– a rather more refined National Trust place to stay. But we were more than content. Having toured the sweeping site, we sauntered into Combe Martin for vital supplies – wine and beer – and climbed up to raise a toast atop Little Hangman cliff. It was the early evening of dreams, low sun scattering diamonds on the Bristol Channel, ferocious headlands rolling on either side. Then we headed back to the bothy for a camping-stove supper as night not so much fell as exploded, the moon so bright it cast our shadows on the grass.Dew-glistened grass, songbirds in the blossom, blush-blue skies. It was like stepping into a Coleridge poem. The perfect day for a walkI didn’t sleep well, thanks to my wafer-thin mat and the spine-tingling calls of owls. But what a morning! Dew-glistened grass, songbirds in the blossom, blush-blue skies. It was like stepping into a Coleridge poem. The perfect day for a walk.From West Challacombe it’s about seven miles east along the South West Coast Path to the Heddon Valley, and 9.5 miles from there to Foreland Point – a spectacular two-day hike. But we decided to plot a bolder route. We’d parked at Heddon the previous day and then walked to West Challacombe via the coast path, up 318-metre Great Hangman, England’s highest sea cliff. Our plan was to follow a different course back, across the top of 349-metre Holdstone Hill, and continue through to Foreland, stay there, then return to Heddon for our last night, making the most of Exmoor’s combe-dipping, stream-tracing trails. It sounds tiring and complicated on paper, but in reality it felt in keeping with bothying’s adventurous spirit.View image in fullscreenSarah Baxter on the South West Coast Path near Heddon’s Mouth.Photograph: Sarah BaxterIt was a glorious mix too, combining the best of the coast path – hidden Woody Bay, idyllicLee Abbey Tea Cottage– with other gems. For instance, though only millimetres from the official coast path on the Ordnance Survey map, the broad higher path east of Heddon, rising towards a Roman fortlet, affords a remarkably different perspective. Likewise, the route into Lynton viaHollerday Hill: here you get a gull’s eye lookout over the Valley of Rocks, before a leafy path leads to the remains of Hollerday House, mysteriously burned down in 1913 – some say by suffragettes.The full moon glared like a second sun – no need for torches. It was pure magic, and if we hadn’t been bothying we’d have missed it allWe were weary by the time we finally found Foreland bothy, hidden in a cleft with a sea view. Despite being tired, we still hiked the mile to Countisbury’sBlue Ball Inn– money saved on accommodation allowed for splurges on dinner. As we strolled there, a low sea mist cast the shore into romantic soft focus and deer grazed in the golden rays. On the return, at nautical twilight, a peachy ribbon blurred the horizon, while the full moon glared like a second sun – no need for torches.

First we headed east, passing an Australian, also on her third day – though, in her case, day three of a full 630-mile South West Coast Path hike.

We had lunch atWatersmeet, a fishing lodge turned National Trust tearoom in a deep, wooded valley where blue tits eat your crumbs, then picked up the coast path again at Lynton, this time following the classic route back to Heddon. It rained briefly, which made the sessile oaks’ mossy, twisted fingers seem all the more fairytale.It dried up by the time we climbed the primrose-lined path to the bothy itself. Heddon Orchard is especially popular with families, Amy had said – there are nature trails and a beach nearby, and theHunters Innpub opposite. Indeed, sitting outside the bothy with the book of Penguin trivia, I watched Derek, the pub’s peacock, peering through the guest-room windows like the most majestic peeping Tom. Then a buzzard soared. And wood pigeons began to coo. And the sun sidled out of the valley, a fascinating slow creep from light to shade. Entertainment?

It’s the sort of cooking that feels generous but effortless; everything simmers away in one big pan, and produces a sauce that’s rich and thick from the potato starch but lemony and fresh-tasting, too. I also often find myself craving an entire cucumber for lunch, so I love today’s salad for its simplicity and for its big flavours. I really enjoy writing recipes that I believe people will come back to again and again, and I think this is definitely one of those.Olive oil and lemon-poached fish with grated courgette salad (pictured top)I love serving this with a simple courgette salad to cut through the richness, as well as a dollop of creme fraiche, if you fancy it. This is a perfect lunch or dinner when you want things to feel a bit special without any drama. I haven’t added any extra herbs, so the dish has a cleaner flavour, but if you’d like to add some parsley, chives or mint, they’d be a great addition.Prep10 minCook30 minServes4150mlextra-virgin olive oil2 bay leaves, or a few thyme sprigs1 lemon, 2-3 slices cut off, the rest juiced, plus extra lemon wedges to serveSea salt and black pepper4–5 medium cyprus potatoes, or 400g new potatoes –I peel them, so they have that clean, waxy texture, but if you prefer them unpeeled, that’s fine, too6 small banana shallots,peeled and trimmed4 thick sustainably-sourced cod fillets, or hake, haddock or any firm white fish2 courgettesCreme fraiche, to serve (optional)Pour the olive oil and 600ml water into a wide, high-sided pan (about 28cm), then add the bay leaves, a few slices of lemon and a good pinch of salt. Slice the potatoes into 1½cm-thick coins, halve the shallots lengthways, then drop them into the pan, too.Bring to a gentle boil and cook for eight to 10 minutes, until the potatoes and shallots are just tender. Make four indents in the mix for the fish fillets, then nestle them in; the liquid needs to come about halfway up the fish, so if need be top up with a splash more water.Cut out a circle of baking paper to fit the pan, then lay it over the fish and vegetables. Turn down the heat to medium and leave to bubble gently for six to eight minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish. The sauce should have reduced slightly, and the starch from the potatoes will have thickened it; if it still looks a bit watery, carefully lift out the fish and potatoes, and simmer the sauce for a few minutes more to reduce.Meanwhile, grate the courgettes into a bowl and season with salt, pepper and the juice of the remaining lemon.Serve everything straight away, topping the fish with a dollop of creme fraiche, if you fancy, and with extra lemon wedges on the side.The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

Use a vegetable peeler to pare the lemon zest into nice wide strips.In a small saucepan on a medium heat, melt the butter with the pine nuts. As the butter melts, the pine nuts will begin to toast; keep a close eye on them, though, because you don’t want the nuts or butter to burn, although a little browning does add a lovely, nutty depth.Once the pine nuts are golden, stir in the harissa and lemon peel, leave to bubble gently for a minute, then take off the heat. Squeeze in the juice of half the lemon and season with a little salt, if needed.Transfer the cucumber and celery to a bowl and drizzle over the olive oil, the juice from the remaining lemon half, and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat, then spoon on to a platter; now’s the time to add the tuna, if using. Dollop over the yoghurt, then spoon the warm harissa-pine nut butter on top.

Just two ingredients – chocolate and aquafaba – come together to create a waste-saving treat. Bean water has a mild savoury taste, but the dominant flavour here is chocolate, which, without the addition of extra fat (usually in the form of cream), becomes incredibly intense, amplifying its sheer chocolatiness.Aquafabahas magical properties that mean it behaves like egg whites when whisked, creating an airy foam that can be used for everything from mayonnaise to mousse. According to Ada McVean in an article askingWhat is Aquafaba?for McGill University in Montreal, the water-soluble proteins and sugars in the beans leak into the water during cooking, giving it a similar composition to egg whites; it also contain saponins, which help it foam so well.Aquafaba chocolate mousseThe other week, I was on a panel about the magic of food, and one of the first questions we were asked was how to balance taste, health and convenience, to assist people to cook healthily and diversify their diets. Well, this dish is a perfect example: it’s not only healthy, but it is also incredibly delicious, fun and easy to make. Dark chocolate is low in sugar and rich in minerals such as iron, magnesium and zinc, and has been linked to various health benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease.Personally, I enjoy a row of super-dark chocolate every afternoon as a little pick-me-up, and it always makes me smile to think that it’s good for me.Chocolatemelts at body temperature, which is possibly one reason it feels so satisfying on the tongue. However, it is also heat-sensitive: if it is overheated, it will split and turn oily, so always melt chocolate gently, ideally in a heatproof bowl set over a larger pot of hot but not boiling water.120g aquafaba(ie, from a 400g can of chickpeas)¼ tsp cream of tartar or1 tsp lemon juice(optional, and only if the aquafaba is struggling to form firm peaks)100g dark chocolate, plus a little extra for grating on topIn a clean, grease-free bowl, use an electric whisk to beat the aquafaba to stiff peaks, then keep whisking for at least five more minutes, to ensure the aquafaba is firmly set (unlike egg whites, it is hard to over-whisk). If the aquafaba struggles to form stiff peaks, add the cream of tartar or lemon juice, although that shouldn’t be necessary.Gently melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of hot but not boiling water, stirring occasionally until smooth. Take off the heat and leave to cool slightly – this prevents it seizing up when mixed with the whipped aquafaba. Gently fold a third of the whipped aquafaba into the chocolate to loosen it, then carefully fold in the rest, keeping as much air in the mix as possible.Spoon into four small serving glasses or ramekins and chill for at least eight hours, or overnight. Before serving, top with grated chocolate, if you like. The mousse will keep in the fridge for three to five days.Explore more on these topicsDessertWaste notFoodFood wasteVegan food and drinkChocolateBeans, pulses and legumesfeaturesShareReuse this content"
