Or was it that blue sky day in September 2001 when the planes hit the twin towers? These images from the last 25 years chronicle modern history in the makingJonathan FreedlandSat 27 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTShareAt the turn of the century there was a modest debate, mainly conducted on the letters pages of the newspapers – back then, still the prime forum for public discussion – as to when, exactly, the new millennium and the 21st century began. Most assumed the start date was 1 January 2000, but dissenters, swiftly branded pedants, insisted the correct date came a year later. As it turned out, both were wrong.The 21st century began in earnest, at least in the western mind, on a day that no one had circled in their diaries. Out of a clear blue sky, two passenger jets flew into the twin towers of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 and so inaugurated a new age of anxiety – a period in which we have lived ever since.The historian Eric Hobsbawm had already spoken of the short 20th century, which ran from the start of the first world war in 1914 to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. It was followed by the long decade of the 90s, which came to resemble a contented pause,a holiday from history, until it was rudely terminated on that bright New York morning.The sight of it is still shocking. Nearly 25 years later, the portrait of an ash-covered sculpture, depicting a businessman and his briefcase, is as unsettling now as when it first appeared. Never mind that he was always a statue. The frozen Manhattan man, intact while everything around him lies in ruins, could be one of the petrified figures of Pompeii, a fully preserved emissary from a previous world: the world before 9/11.For a while, it seemed as if the new era would be entirely defined by the 11 September attacks and the response to them. The “war on terror” declared by George W Bush threatened to remake the globe according to the preferences of the nation that, after the expiry of the Soviet Union, was now a solo hegemon: the US. After the invasion of Afghanistan, which would see US troops installed in the country for two decades, came the US-­led conquest of Iraq and the toppling ofSaddam Hussein– along with his statue – bringing death and devastation there and roiling both the Middle East and politics across much of the democratic world, including Britain.The slogan of the hour was “the clash of civilisations” and plenty believed that struggle would dwarf all others in the new century. The reverberations of Iraq were certainly felt for many years, whether in the Arab spring, the birth of Islamic State or the persistent threat of violent jihadism. But that struggle has had to share space in the 21st century with others.Not that that was obvious right away. At first, it seemed as if hope might edge out fear, that the new millennium might see change for the better.Barack Obamawon a Nobel peace prize before he’d really done anything, in recognition of the optimism he stirred through his winning 2008 campaign, captured here in an image of the politician who, as he liked to remark, didn’t look like any other US president.These have been turbulent years, roiled by culture wars, a long-delayed reckoning over race and vast movements of peopleEasy as it was to deride that feelgood sentiment as“hopey, changey”,morevibe than reality, there was a lot of it about. Science and technology, especially, were thought to be full of promise. For some, that meant the excitement of the Large Hadron Collider, the biggest machine ever built. For others, it was the prospect of instant forms of social connection, delivered by a new breed of young, nerdy men able to turn 1s and 0s into magic. Just look at the image here of Mark Zuckerberg and fellow Facebook founder Chris Hughes, delightedly unaware that it was not the computer on Zuckerberg’s lap they had just opened, but Pandora’s box.For a while, the optimism held, with tech and its birthing of social media celebrated as a remedy for all manner of ills, even the one that had announced the arrival of the century. The men of violence had brought 9/11, but a decade laterFacebookand Twitter seemed to be harbingers of democracy, enabling those Arab spring uprisings, and others, against hated dictatorships.It would not work out that way, and not only because of the long shadow cast by the war on terror. On another September day, in another steel-and-glass citadel of finance, there came another collapse, one whose impact is still felt. The implosion ofLehman Brotherswas at the centre of a global crash that marked the end of an economic holiday from history that had endured since the 90s.The stagnation that followed, with wages static or falling in real terms, created the backdrop for the political upheavals that marked the next two decades. Yet it was far from the only shock the world had to absorb.The climate crisis was a constant throughout, as it is in this collection, making its presence felt in fire and flood, whether submerging Pakistan or New Orleans. (Bush’s catastrophic mishandling of that disaster is one more reason why he has been lucky in his latest successor: if it weren’t for the current occupant of the White House, W’s place as the most reviled US president of the early 21st century would have been assured.)In 2020, we were struck by a global pandemic that can still seem like a collective bad dream. To look at a photograph such as the one here of an elderly Spanish couple, separated for a hundred days and by sheets of plastic, is to ask: did that really happen?‘There are images no leader ever wants to be seen’: 33 pivotal US presidential moments captured on cameraRead moreThere are other pictures that look now like early warnings of trouble to come. The “separation wall” encircling theWest Bankis a reminder that, after the failure of peace talks at Camp David in 2000, there has been a further 25 years of Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to add to the decades that went before, culminating in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza that exploded on 7 October 2023 and has only recently paused. Similarly, the image from Ukraine in 2014 appears now like a premonition of the Russian invasion of 2022.These have been turbulent years, roiled by culture wars and a long-delayed reckoning over race – how extraordinary now to recall that taking the knee began with a single athlete making a single gesture – and by vast movements of people. The agony of today’s refugee crisis is distilled in the sight of a two-year-old child,Alan Kurdi, face down on a beach. That cauldron of discontents was stirred further by tech platforms that were no longer about old friends reconnecting, but about strangers dividing against each other, their sources of information filtered along partisan lines, until they could be persuaded to believe almost anything, and usually the worst.All of those currents fed into the movement that has defined the last decade or so, embodied by Boris Johnson and his notorious Brexit bus – a lie on wheels – and, of course, by the man who is the face of these times:Donald Trump. That movement is nationalist populism and it feeds on the many plagues of the 21st century, from stalled or declining living standards to social media, adroitly channelling unease and fear into hostility towards migrants, minorities and each other. Gaze upon the titans of tech come to pay homage to Trump as he returned to the White House in January and you see we are living through what the Italian writer Giuliano da Empoli calls “the hour of the predator”.Yet there are enough images of wonder here to believe the rest of the 21st century might be different: look at the selfie taken by theMarsrover to be reminded of what we are capable of. The next 25 years are no more preordained than the last. Like the cameras that captured these extraordinary moments, they are in our hands.Picture captions by Felix Bazalgette and Gabrielle SchwarzLiberty Plaza, New York, 2001By Susan MeiselasView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Susan Meiselas/Magnum PhotosWhen news came of the first plane crashing into one of the twin towers on 11 September 2001, Susan Meiselas cycled downtown with her camera – “moving toward what everyone else was desperately fleeing from”, with “no sense of the scale of what had happened”.For her, this image stands out as a rare moment of “stillness amid the chaos”. It shows a lifesize statue of a businessman, Double Check (1982) by John Seward Johnson II, surrounded by debris in Liberty Plaza Park, across from the World Trade Center. Initially Meiselas couldn’t tell if it was a real person.Today, she sees the statue as a symbol of the attempt to make sense of the enormity of 9/11 and its terrible aftermath: George W Bush’s “war on terror”. “A lot has happened as a consequence. Even the endless lines of security at the airport – these are small reminders of our distrust of each other.”GSAn Iraqi man comforts his son, 2003By Jean-Marc BoujuView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jean-Marc Bouju/APOn 31 March 2003, an Iraqi man and his four-­year-­old child were arrested by American forces and taken to a prisoner of war camp near the southern Iraqi city of Najaf. French photojournalist Jean-Marc Bouju snapped the moment just after they had removed the man’s handcuffs, so he could comfort his distressed son.The image won the World Press Photo of the year award, and captured for many the cruelty of the US’s invasion of Iraq. The hooded figure, attempting to preserve some humanity in an overwhelmingly hostile situation, foreshadows the infamous images of abused prisoners taken by American soldiers in Abu Ghraib prison, which would hit the headlines not long after.FBToppling of Saddam Hussein’s statue, 2003By Sean SmithView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianThe image of Saddam Hussein’s statue being pulled down in Baghdad as American forces entered the city on 9 April 2003 became one of the iconic images of the war. It was promoted by the Pentagon as a symbol of Iraqis joyously greeting the overthrow of their hated dictator.“I’m happy with the picture,” photographer Sean Smith says, “but not with things that may be ascribed to it – as a defining moment, say, because it wasn’t.” Even at the time, Smith felt “uneasy about becoming part of a false narrative”. He had been in Baghdad for months, as war had inched closer, and got to know many Iraqis. He knew the situation was more complex: “This wasn’t the liberation of Paris.” Most of the crowd that day, he remembers, were journalists staying in an overlooking hotel. “It was getting to their deadline time,” he remembers, “and they wanted a headline.”Looking back, Smith is also saddened by the illusion of finality the photograph represents. When he returned to Iraq for work years later, one conversation about the invasion stuck with him. When an American soldier argued that it had been necessary for the freedom of the Iraqis, an Iraqi interpreter replied, “All I know is that everyone knows someone who’s died.”FBSeparation Wall, West Bank, 2004By Alessandra SanguinettiView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alessandra Sanguinetti/Magnum PhotosIt is a symbol of one of the most enduring conflicts of the century. In 2002, during the second intifada, the Israeli government started to build what is known as the Separation Wall: a barrier between Israel and the West Bank, which it has occupied illegally since 1967. This image shows children dwarfed by an eight-metre-high section of wall at Abu Dis, a Palestinian village in the suburbs of Jerusalem cut off from the rest of the city. The permits Palestinians need to cross the wall are hard to obtain, so movement is severely restricted.The barrier, which has been deemed illegal by the International Court of Justice, was “presented as a security measure”, explains Emma Graham-Harrison, the Guardian’s Middle East correspondent, after a spate of suicide bombings targeting Israeli civilians. “However, it also functioned as both a land grab and a key step in enforcing separation. In some ways, it was a template for what Israel attempted to do with its fence enclosing Gaza: the idea that you could contain Palestinians physically without having to engage with them as fellow human beings or consider their political aspirations.”GSFacebook founders Mark Zuckerberg and Chris Hughes, 2004By Rick FriedmanView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rick Friedman/Corbis via Getty Images“I got a call from an editor,” Boston-based photographer Rick Friedman recalls: “‘I need you to go over to Harvard and photograph these two kids with their computers.’” It was 14 May, a few months after Zuckerberg and Hughes had founded a social media site that, in its earliest iteration, invited students to rate the attractiveness of female classmates. Friedman recallsthe young pair were “very agreeable”, but also remembers thinking, “Is this some kid trying to get a date with his computer?”FBChicken processing plant, 2005By Edward BurtynskyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Edward Burtynsky, courtesy of Flowers Gallery, LondonIt is sometimes said we are living in the Chinese century. Rapid industrialisation has seen China grow into an economic superpower – the “world’s factory” –accounting for up to 30% of global manufacturing output. Edward Burtynsky, whose acclaimed photographs document the effects of human industry around the globe, began working there in 2002. On one visit, struck by the number of chicken farms, he became curious about China’s food industry.This image shows one of the country’s largest poultry-processing facilities, the Jilin Deda factory in Dehui city, where products were being prepared for export to Japan. “I’m always trying to find ways to represent in one frame the larger-than-life scale of what’s happening,” Burtynsky says.GSDisaster girl, 2005By Dave RothView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoe Roth/Dave RothThe concept of a meme as a self-replicating nugget of information was first popularised by Richard Dawkins in the 1970s in the context of genetics. But it was in this century that memes took off online, and became household names.This image, declared “one of the most famous memes in history”, has humble origins. In 2005, Zoë Roth, AKA “Disaster Girl”, and her amateur photographer father were watching a local fire department training exercise, in which a donated house had been set on fire. Her father told her to smile and snapped the image. Drawn to the “evil” smile, people Photoshopped in other disasters – the Titanic, the Hindenburg.FBMan during Hurricane Katrina, 2005By Robert GalbraithView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Robert Galbraith/Reuters“George Bush does not care about Black people,” a 28-year-old Kanye West announced during a telethon to raise money for disaster relief in the wake ofHurricane Katrina. Making landfall on the Gulf coast on 29 August 2005, it flooded 80% of New Orleans, killing 1,500 people and displacing roughly 1.5 million – but it was the deeper faultlines in American society, brutally revealed by the disaster, that came to define it.As former MP Oona King, who visited the city shortly after the disaster, wrote, “The remarkable thing about Hurricane Katrina was that, like a bolt of lightning, it clearly and unavoidably illuminated the chilling impact of race.”FBParis, Lindsay and Britney behind the wheel, 2006Photographer unknownView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bauer-Griffin/GC Images“This photo became the moment that defined an era,” wrote Paris Hiltonon Instagramin November 2024, marking the 18th anniversary of this famous paparazzi shot of her with Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears at the height of their fame, crammed in the front seat of Hilton’s car outside the Beverly Hills hotel. The photo was splashed across the papers; in the New York Post, it ran with the headline “Bimbo Summit”.At the time, it was the quintessential image of 2000s celebrity glamour. All three women have since spoken out about their treatment by the media: the misogynistic scrutiny and judgment that spread far beyond celebrity circles. “They loved pitting women against each other,” Hilton has said. “It was so vicious.”GSRangers taking away a mountain gorilla, 2007By Brent StirtonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Brent Stirton/Getty ImagesThe Democratic Republic of Congo’s Virunga national park, Africa’s oldest conservation area, is exceptionally biodiverse – and one of the most dangerous places to work. Since 1996, more than 200 rangers have been killed in a series of conflicts.Photographer Brett Stirton took this picture after seven rare mountain gorillas were killed by hostile gunmen wanting to warn rangers not to disrupt illegal charcoal manufacturing in the area. Locals and park workers carried the bodies to a burial site. “Everyone was silent,” Stirton recalled later. “It was very reverent.”Not all is lost. Last year,analysispublished in the journal Science found conservation efforts around the world were helping stem the decline of biodiversity. “Our results clearly show there is room for hope,” one co-author said.FBLarge Hadron Collider, 2007By Simon NorfolkView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Simon NorfolkOne of this century’s biggest scientific discoveries took place in theLarge Hadron Collider, the world’s most powerful particle accelerator, which opened at Cern in Geneva in 2008. This photo was taken when construction was under way.Still the largest machine ever built, it consists of a 27km ring of superconducting magnets in a tunnel 100 metres underground. The magnets, chilled to a temperature lower than in outer space, are used to propel high-energy particle beams into collisions. By studying the results of these, particle physicists hope to answer questions about the essential workings of the universe. In 2012, they made a major breakthrough: the discovery of the Higgs boson, the so-called “God particle”.GSSteve Jobs with the first iPhone, 2007By Kimberly WhiteView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kimberly White/Corbis via Getty ImagesIn January 2007,Steve Jobsunveiled the first iPhone. “We are all born with the ultimate pointing device – our fingers – and iPhone uses them to create the most revolutionary user interface since the mouse,” the Apple CEO said. (For his demo, seen here, he had to follow a carefully planned “golden path” to avoid glitches; the software wasn’t yet finished.)The touchscreen smartphone was released six months later, totally transforming the way we communicate. Today more than 1.4bn iPhones are in use globally.GSLehman Brothers staff, 2008By Kevin CoombsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kevin Coombs/ReutersThis photo of staff at the Lehman Brothers offices in London’s Canary Wharf was taken on 11 September 2008. Over the past year, the global financial system had been showing cracks. Now Lehman was in trouble, with its share price plummeting and rumours of a buyout.“This meeting was called just before lunch,”said Gwion Moore(back left, minus the grey-suit banker trousers because his work clothes were at the cleaner’s). “A couple of senior bankers made a speech, saying, ‘We’re not going bankrupt, get back to work.’”Four days later, Lehman did go bankrupt. “Trust evaporated and funds stopped flowing around the world,” says economic historian Catherine Schenk. What followed was the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. “It reminded us that, as in 1930, failures in the richest countries could spark a financial crisis that had repercussions in markets everywhere.”GSConstruction of the Burj Khalifa Tower, Dubai, 2008By Philippe ChancelView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Philippe Chancel, courtesy of Eric Franck fine art/Rio fluency/Polka galleryShown here in the last stages of its construction – and already towering over everything that surrounds it – theBurj Khalifain Dubai has held the record for the world’s tallest building since opening its doors in January 2010. The neofuturist mega-scraper, with its 163 floors reaching 828 metres high, is not just a dizzying feat of engineering: it’s a symbol of the equally dizzying, oil-fuelled rise of the Gulf states in the 21st century.In this era of expansion, flashy development projects have become a major tool of soft power: what the critic Rowan Moore has called a “cultural and architectural arms race”. The race is still on: the Burj Khalifa is soon to be eclipsed by the Jeddah Tower in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, which is scheduled for completion – with a height of 1,000 metres – by 2028.GSBarack Obama on the campaign trail, 2008By Damon WinterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Damon Winter/The New York Times/Redux/eyevine“It was one of those moments that gets stuck in your head,” Damon Winter recalls. “Part of it was the irony that a memorable photo could come from such a banal setting – a podium in front of an American flag.” Yet everything lined up, from the shaft of light to Obama’s smile, and today the image captures something of the optimism and dynamism of his 2008 campaign – qualities absent from many other campaigns of the century. “It was a very optimistic time,” Winter says. “The country was experiencing this momentous change.”Unlike other politicians Winter had covered, Obama “seemed like the same person on stage as he was when interacting with people. It seemed to me that he was really interested in people.”FBNorthern lights over the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, 2010By Lucas JacksonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nasa/Nature Picture Library/AlamyIn spring 2010, after 187 years of silence, the Eyjafjallajökull volcano on the south coast of Iceland began a powerful eruption. It spewed fine volcanic ash high into the atmosphere, which began blowing towards the UK and western Europe. Almost all flights in the region were grounded due to fears that the ash would clog and stall jet engines.Stranded in Iceland, photographer Lucas Jackson was able to capture this spectacular image of the northern lights playing over the erupting volcano. “When you’re a photographer,” he told the Guardian in 2010, “it’s really rare to actually be exactly where you want to be to take the shot. We were laughing about how crazy it all was.”FBPakistan floods, 2010By Daniel BerehulakView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Daniel Berehulak/Getty ImagesIn the summer of 2010, record-breaking rains led to extreme flooding in Pakistan. At the peak, one-fifth of the country was submerged. Nearly 2,000 people died and more than 20 million were affected, with homes and crops lost. Though unprecedented at the time, such severe flooding has since become a recurring event, including this summer.As temperatures rise across the world, floods are becoming more frequent and intense. Unsurprisingly, poorer nations and communities are most affected. But, as UN secretary general António Guterres warned earlier this year, “No country is safe.”GSFukushima disaster,2011Photographer unknownView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mainichi Shimbun/ReutersOn 11 March 2011, a massive 9.0 undersea earthquake off the north-­east coast of Japan triggered a tsunami that killed an estimated 20,000 people. More than a million buildings were damaged, including theFukushimaDaiichi nuclear plant, where three reactors went into meltdown after flooding of the power supply disabled the cooling systems. It was the worst nuclear accident in history after Chornobyl.Several workers were injured in explosions at the facility and more than 100,000 people in the wider region were evacuated to avoid radiation exposure. It’s estimated that 2,313 “indirect deaths” resulted from physical and mental stress, and that 29,000 people remain displaced.GSTahrir Square, 2011ByMoises SamanView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Moises Saman/Magnum PhotosThe central Cairo roundabout known as Tahrir Square became the symbolic centre of the Arab spring in early 2011, though the movement itself had began the year before in Tunisia, after market seller Mohamed Bouazizi, a target of government harassment and corruption, set himself on fire outside a governor’s office.“The Arab world was ripe with hope,” wrote Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Yet “these expectations were quickly shattered”. The assassination of Khashoggi that year, on the orders of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reflected the wider slide into violence: Syria, Libya and Yemen have since suffered years of brutal civil war, and Egypt remains under the iron-fisted rule of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who came to power after the protests.FBBoy in Liberia being treated for Ebola, 2014By Daniel BerehulakView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times/Redux/eyevineFrom late 2013 to 2016, the worstEbolavirus outbreak in history killed more than 11,000 people in the west African countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. The fatality rate for recorded cases was 40%, attributed to poor standards of care, mistrust of medical authorities and an international response prioritising containment over treatment.Daniel Berehulak photographed James Dorbor, eight, being carried into a clinic in the Liberian capital of Monrovia in September 2014;his health had deterioratedduring a three-hour wait to be admitted. His father was not allowed to embrace him when medical staff finally took him in, carrying him, Berehulak said, “like he was a bag of garbage”.GSMigrants above a golf club in Morocco, 2014By José PalazónView image in fullscreenPhotograph: José Palazón/ReutersIn 2014, Melilla – a tiny slice of Spanish territory in Morocco – became emblematic of the rise of “Fortress Europe” policies in the 21st century. Human rights activist José Palazón captured the moment a group of men attempting to cross Melilla’s border became stuck on a razor wire fence for hours while Spanish golfers continued their game below. Eight years later, Melilla would become the site ofa massacrein which at least 37 people trying to cross into Spain were killed by border guards.Palazón shared his photo on Twitter, with the caption: “Immigrants on the fence, expulsions and a game of golf. Only in Melilla.” The surreal image of inequality quickly went viral. “It seemed like a good moment to take a photo that was a bit more symbolic,” he later said.FBPriest at Ukraine’s Maidan protests, 2014By Jérôme SessiniView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jérôme Sessini/Magnum PhotosRussia’s devastating war onUkrainecan be traced back to “Euromaidan” – the anti-government protests, centred in Kyiv, that began in November 2013 after then president Viktor Yanukovych gave in to Russian pressure and withdrew from an agreement that would have brought the country closer to the EU. On the uprising’s bloodiest day, 20 February 2014, Jérôme Sessini, who had arrived just a day before, documented what he saw – “not even thinking about the danger” – including this Orthodox priest blessing protesters at a barricade. More than 50 of them were shot dead that day.GSOscars selfie, 2014ByEllen DeGeneresView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ellen DeGeneres/Getty ImagesThe origins of the term “selfie” are humble: an Australian man posting a substandard picture of his bruised lip to an online forum in 2002. “Sorry about the focus,” he wrote. “It was a selfie.” The next year, sales of phones with front-facing cameras began to increase and by 2013 “selfie” was Oxford Dictionaries’ word of the year.Organised by Ellen DeGeneres at the Oscars, this selfie broke the internet. Eleven years on, it might be cursed: Kevin Spacey would face damning sexual abuse allegations, Brangelina broke up.FBItalian rescue, 2014ByMassimo SestiniView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Massimo Sestini/eyevineThe number of people risking crossing the Mediterranean to Europe, fleeing wars and persecution in the Middle East and Africa, rose dramatically in the mid-2010s. In 2013, the Italian government launched its search-and-rescue operation Mare Nostrum, after hundreds died in two shipwrecks off Lampedusa.Shot from a helicopter, Massimo Sestini’s image shows 500 people on a boat 25km from Libya’s coast, before they were rescued by Italy’s navy as part of an operation controversially halted that year. At least 20,000 have died or disappeared in the Med since.GSThe death of Alan Kurdi, 2015By Nilüfer DemirView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nilufer Demir/Dogan News Agency/AFP/Getty ImagesOn 2 September 2015, photojournalist Nilüfer Demir saw the body of a toddler, Alan Kurdi, on a beach near Bodrum, Turkey. “There was nothing left to do for him,” she said later, “except take his photograph. And that’s exactly what I did.”Alan was born in Syria in 2012. His family had been trying to reach Greece, but soon after their boat launched, it overturned and Alan and his mother drowned. “I was holding my wife’s hand,” his grief-stricken father later told the media, “but my children slipped through my hands. It was dark and everyone was screaming.”Demir’s shocking image quickly spread. But, despite protests, a spike in donations to charities and western governments promising to do more, the Med remains the world’s deadliest border.FBCaitlyn Jenner, 2015By Annie LeibovitzView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Annie Leibovitz /Trunk ArchiveIt was a high point in the movement for trans visibility. In June 2015,Caitlyn Jennermade her public debut in a portrait by Annie Leibovitz on the cover of Vanity Fair. It instantly had positive support and Jenner became the fastest person to hit 1 million Twitter followers, before facing a backlash when she came out as a Trump voter.Since then, trans rights have been rolled back in the US and UK, but support remains strong. Earlier this year, the world’s largest trans pride march took place in London, with a 100,000-strong crowd.GSUsain Bolt’s Olympics “triple triple”, 2016By Cameron SpencerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images“There you go, I’m the greatest,” said Usain Bolt when he achieved an unprecedented three consecutive Olympic golds (in 2008, 2012, 2016) in three races. Here, in the Rio 100m semi-final, “Lightning Bolt” seems to have found time to flash the camera a smile. He was in fact checking whether the runner to his left was catching up: “I saw I had him covered,and I smiled.”GSThe Brexit bus, 2016By Jack TaylorView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jack Taylor/Getty ImagesBrexit is, for many, the ground zero of what Marina Hyde called “an age of gathering chaos and rising disbelief” in the UK.The “Brexit bus”, reportedly masterminded by Dominic Cummings but closely associated with Boris Johnson, became the subject of bitter arguments and a symbol of the chaos that has engulfed the UK since. Its slogan, claiming the UK sent £350m a week to the EU, was disputed, with the UK Statistics Authority deeming it “a clear misuse of official statistics”.Research by the Nuffield Trusthas shown Brexit has in fact put unprecedented strain on the NHS.FBColin Kaepernick taking the knee, 2016By Marcio José SánchezView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Marcio José Sánchez/APOn 1 September 2016, during a San Francisco 49ers pre-season game, the quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeled while America’s national anthem was played, in protest at police violence against Black people. His gesture was adopted byteammates– this photo shows him with Eli Harold and Eric Reid – then spread across the world, becoming linked to the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in spring 2020. The gesture was highly controversial: Kaepernick was ousted from the league a year later and has never again played for an NFL team.FBAn assassination in Turkey, 2016By Burhan OzbilicView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Burhan Özbilici/AP“We die in Aleppo, you die here,” shouted Turkish off-duty riot squad officer Mevlüt Mert Altıntaş after killing the Russian ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, at a gallery in Ankara, in protest at the actions of the Russian military in Syria.

It was one of the largest single-day protests in US history, and nine months later its energy fed into the#MeToo movement, which began as a disquieting story of one Hollywood producer’s abuse of women and soon turned into a global reckoning.GSAmazone, 2017By Andreas GurskyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Andreas Gursky/DACS, 2025, courtesy of Sprüth MagersIn 2017, the eminent German photographer Andreas Gursky, known for his vast, detailed, era-defining landscapes, trained his camera on anAmazonwarehouse in Arizona packed full of goods destined for customers. This century has seen internet shopping go from a niche experiment – in 2000, the Guardian reported that anxieties about postage time had led to a “collapse” of online pre-Christmas book sales – to one of the most common ways to make a purchase.FBSophia the Robot, 2017By Giulio Di SturcoView image in fullscreenPhotograph: @ Giulio Di Sturco“It was super weird,” recalls Giulio Di Sturco of his visit to a Hong Kong lab to photograph Sophia the Robot. “Pieces of robots everywhere, five guys working like mechanics – to think the future might be built in this kind of space.”The idea that Sophia represented a major leap in AI was big news: the next year, she became a citizen of Saudi Arabia – the first robot to be granted legal personhood anywhere. There were sceptics, however, and ChatGPT’s arrival in 2022 might suggest the future of AI is in chatbots and datacentres instead. But Di Sturco believes the humanoid robot’s time is still to come. “They were on the edge of something interesting,” he says.FBMegan Rapinoe, 2019By Franck FifeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter decades in which their game was dwarfed by men’s, women are winning fans for their playing and inclusivity. Megan Rapinoe’s victory pose after scoring for the US in the 2019 World Cup went viral: a symbol of both her athleticism and her advocacy on issues including LGBTQ+ rights and mental health.GSStormzy headlining Glastonbury, 2019By Samir HusseinView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samir Hussein/WireImage“This is the best night of my entire life,” a 25-year-oldStormzytold the crowd during his historic set at Glastonbury in 2019, as the first Black British solo act to headline the festival. Wearing a Banksy-designed union jack stab vest, Stormzy crafted a set that both celebrated Black British culture – with guest performances from Ballet Black, WAR collective and Dave – and critiqued racism in the UK. Praised by everyone from David Lammy, Zadie Smith and Jeremy Corbyn to Adele and Ghetts, the performance went out of its way to educate its audience and reference the many acts that had come before to make it possible. “This was about arrival,” Smith wrote in the New Yorker, “of a king and his court and the many, many people who have hoped for this day.”FBCovid kiss, 2020By Emilio MorenattiView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Emilio Morenatti/APThis photo shows the emotional reunion of Agustina Cañamero and Pascual Pérez, a couple in their 80s, in a nursing home in Barcelona in June 2020. Husband and wife had been separated for 102 days in the first lockdown – their longest time apart in 59 years of marriage. The image has come to symbolise how lives worldwide were upended by Covid.The global health emergency was declared over in May 2023, and may feel like a distant memory. Yet more than seven million people have died to date, and many others are dealing with grief or long-term health issues. “Most of my generation have been affected in deep, developmental ways and that’s going to affect us for ever,” 21-year-old student Eoin O’Loughlin told the Guardian, in a 2023 series on the “Covid Generation”.GSStorming of the Capitol, 2021By Victor J BlueView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victor J Blue/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesOn 6 January 2021, in the wake of Joe Biden’s election win, a crowd began to peel off from Trump’s fiery speech in which he accused the Democrats of stealing the election from him. Photographer Victor J Blue followed them as they broke into the Capitol buildings, and took this picture after they had been expelled – police officers, running out of pepper spray, were letting off fire extinguishers in an attempt to discourage protesters from breaking back in, which accounts for the “smoke” at the centre of the photo.FBLife on Mars, 2021By PerseveranceView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nasa via APWas there once life on Mars? And could the planet, asElon Musk believes, offer us a home when Earth becomes uninhabitable? It’s no surprise its exploration has been the dominant story of the 21st-century space race so far. Nasa’s Perseverance rover landedin February 2021, searching for signs of past life, so we can better understand the planet’s habitability.This selfie, taken in 2024, is “such a nice encapsulation of what Nasa’s mission is all about”, says project scientist Katie Stack Morgan. Stitched together from 62 images (which is why the rover’s arm is missing), it shows Perseverance alongside the helicopter Ingenuity – the first aircraft to complete a powered, controlled flight on another planet. As for colonising the Red Planet, Stack Morgan points out we might first “ask whether we have been good stewards of our own planet”.GSGreek wildfire, 2021By Konstantinos TsakalidisView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Konstantinos Tsakalidis/Bloomberg/Getty Images“At that moment,” said 81-year-old Panayiota Kritsiopi, “I was shouting not only for myself, but for the whole village.” She was photographed as a huge wildfire on the Greek island of Evia forced thousands to flee and eventually burned more than half the island. Miraculously, Kritsiopi’s home would be spared; the fire reportedly stopped a metre from her house.That year was quickly surpassed by 2022, then 2024, as Europe’s hottest on record, while this summer saw the worst wildfire season in European history.FBActivists throwing soup at Van Gogh, 2022Photographer unknownView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images“It was surreal,” recallsJust Stop Oilactivist Anna Holland (right) of the day they and Phoebe Plummer approached a Van Gogh painting in the National Gallery, London, can in hand. “Almost before I knew it, we were throwing the soup.”The stunt was part of a wave of climate action that has flourished this century, focused on symbolic targets such as this (safely protected behind glass). Though the pair were sentenced to prison under Britain’s increasingly draconian protest laws, they inspired fellow soup throwers worldwide.FBThe death of Queen Elizabeth II, 2022By Ben StansallView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesThe queen’s death on 8 September 2022, at 96, ended a 70-year reign – the longest of any UK monarch.Some 250,000 people joined the (very British) queue to see her lying in state ahead of the funeral, itself watched by 29 million TV viewers in the UK.Here, her son, Charles III – at 73, the oldest person to succeed the throne – walks beside her coffin in Westminster Abbey. His grief is palpable, but beyond loss there is uncertainty: what next?GSIVF rhino foetus, 2023By Jon A JuárezView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jon A JuárezIn March 2018, tragedy struck: Sudan, the last northern white male rhino, died. With only two females left, the species was functionally extinct. Then, a flash of hope: a foetus created using sperm taken from males before they died.Sadly, the mother died of an unrelated infection. But tests showed the tiny foetus would probably have survived. Said photographer Jon A Juárez, “Though the story is bittersweet, the foetus proves the science works. If we support scientists’ efforts, we can still correct our course and make the planet a better place.”GSTaylor Swift’s Eras tour, 2024By Emma McIntyreView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Emma McIntyre/TAS24/Getty Images for TAS Rights ManagementThere was a period when Taylor Swift’s Eras tour – 149 shows in 51 cities over 21 months – seemed like it would never end. Neither did the appetite of her global fanbase, who packed out stadium after stadium for 3.5-hour performances of Swift’s greatest hits. When the international juggernaut finally concluded in December 2024, it was the highest-grossing concert tour of all time: more than $2bn in ticket sales. Her supremacy was confirmed.The success of the tour also reflected the post-pandemic boom in major live music events, driven by fans craving joy and connection, as well as by artists seeking to supplement their incomes in the era of streaming. Meanwhile, it’s often said that our century has seen the death of the monoculture. Swift, it seems, is one of the last stars standing.GSTrump assassination attempt, 2024 …By Evan VucciView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Evan Vucci/AP“Let me get my shoes,” were Trump’s first words to the Secret Service agents bundling him away, after a sniper’s bullet grazed his ear.

Both are wearing ski masks and T-shirts bearing Nazi symbols.The German videos – titled Balaclava Kitchen – started in 2014 andran for monthsbefore YouTube took down the channel for violating its guidelines.But it offered a glimpse of how far-right groups have seized on cultural production – from clothing brands to top 40 music – to normalise their ideas, in a process that researchers say has hit new heights in the age of social media.“It’s frightening, honestly,” said Katherine Kondor, a researcher with the Norwegian Center for Holocaust and Minority Studies. “You can be radicalised sitting on your couch.”In affiliation with the Center for Research on Extremism (C-REX), Kondor is leading a six-country projectlooking at howthe extreme right uses aesthetics, from fitness influencers to memes and stickers, to spread their views across Europe.From Sweden to Spain, researchers found that extremist messaging was woven through cultural aspects of everyday life, both online and offline.“In Hungary we have some examples of extreme right bands becoming mainstream because they’re on the top 40 chart. I mean, what’s more normal than being on the top 40?” Kondor said.Member of far-right AfD party charged with making Nazi salute at ReichstagRead more“I have a stepson who sometimes sends videos and then I go down the rabbit hole to see who created them and it turns out it’s a far-right influencer.”So-called“tradwives”, referring to female content creators who promote traditional gender roles on social media, are another example.As the numbers of women embracing the concept online surges, the content’sfar-right rootshave been increasingly obscured. Even so, the views they often promote – from anti-feminism to a nostalgia for an imagined past – continue to boost far-right aims.These cultural elements serve as gateways, at times helping to reel people into extremism, Kondor said. “I think there’s a mistaken idea that people join the far right because they believe in that ideology and want to meet like-minded people,” she said. “But that’s not how it works.”While there are some who are driven by prejudices against certain groups or specific beliefs, or others who tag along with friends who are already involved, many are lured by the subcultures that encase these movements, she said.“They start listening to a band that they really like and start going to concerts of that band. Then they start meeting people there and it can escalate in that way,” Kondor explained.“When people find things that work for their aesthetic or their vibe, or they find music that they really like, that can really influence a person.”The link between extreme ideas and the cultural tools they opt to use is not always straightforward, she added, citing the example of a group of far-right extremists in the Netherlands with a penchant for hosting wine-tasting events.“They’ve also started their own food delivery,” she said. “It’s just wild that you can be ordering food from the far right and not know.”Extremists have long used culture to foster a sense of belonging among its members and gain attention among the wider public, said Greta Jasser, a research associate at Germany’s Institute for Democracy and Civil Society, which is also part of the six-country project.Previously, however, their strength in doing so relied on the talent pool of their members, as musicians, artists and camera operators were needed to create content. With the advent of generative AI, this is no longer the case.“Now there’s technology that we can use to generate an image or video in an instant or music within just a couple of minutes,” said Jasser. “So the playbook is old, but the speed is much faster.”The economics of social media have also transformed the process, leading to questions regarding who is creating far-right content and their motivations.“It could be posted by a bot. It could be anyone and anything wanting to generate income from producing as many AI videos and images as possible,” said Jasser.“Which then interestingly calls into question how ideologically driven many of these accounts are, or if it’s a way to generate revenue.”As the research continues, Kondor and her team have been weighing how best to educate the public about their findings, mulling strategies such as online content or tools that could help people better recognise the far right and the myriad of cultural elements they’re producing.“I think it’s often shocking to people,” said Kondor. “Right now it’s dangerous because we’re seeing a steady rise of the far right in every aspect of society. It’s more important than ever to figure out how to mitigate this.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Maps of the pistes were left stacked beside a stapler; the staff rota pinned to the wall.Six years on, a yellowing newspaper dated 8 March 2018 sits folded on its side, as if someone has just flicked through it during a quiet spell. A half-drunk bottle of water remains on the table.View image in fullscreenThe Céüze 2000 resort when snow was plentiful.The Céüze resort in the southern French Alps had been open for 85 years and was one of the oldest in the country. Today, it is one of scores of ski resorts abandoned across France – part of a new landscape of “ghost stations”.More than 186have been permanentlyclosed already, raising questions about how we leave mountains – among the last wild spaces in Europe–once the lifts stop running.It was costing more to keep it open than closed … We looked into using artificial snow but realised that would delay the inevitableMichel Ricou-CharlesAs global heating pushes the snow line higher across the Alps, thousands of structures are being left to rot – some of them breaking down and contaminating the surrounding earth, driving debate about what should happen to the remnants of old ways of life – and whether to let nature reclaim the mountains.Snowfall at Céüze started becoming unreliable in the 1990s. To be financially viable, the resort needed to be open for at least three months. In that last winter, it only managed a month and a half. For the two years before that it had not been able to operate at all.Opening the resort each season cost the local authority as much as €450,000 (£390,000). As the season got shorter, the numbers no longer added up. To avoid a spiral of debt, the decision was made to close.View image in fullscreenThe resort closed permanently during the 2020 winter due to a lack of snow.Photograph: Thomas Valentin/The Guardian“It was costing us more to keep it open than to keep it closed for the season,” says Michel Ricou-Charles, president of the local Buëch‑Dévoluy community council, which oversees the site. Even under the most optimistic projections, the future looked bleak. “We looked into using artificial snow, but realised that would delay the inevitable,” he says.It was seven years before the trucks and helicopters came in to begin removing the pylons. Still, the local community grieved for the small, family-oriented resort, which was host to generations of memories. As demolitions began, they came to take nuts, bolts and washers as mementoes of what they had lost.Degrading wild terrainIn France, there are today113 ski lifts totalling nearly 40 miles (63km) in lengththat have been abandoned, nearly three-quarters of them in protected areas. It is not just ski infrastructure. The Mountain Wilderness association estimates that there are more than 3,000 abandoned structures dotted around French mountains, slowly degrading Europe’s richest wild terrain. This includes military, industrial and forestry waste, such as old cables, bits of barbed wire, fencing and old machinery.View image in fullscreenThere are 113 abandoned ski lifts in France, nearly three-quarters of which are in protected areas.Photograph: Thomas Valentin/The GuardianCéüze ski resort is fast becoming one of these pollutants. The little wooden cabin at the bottom of the first button lift is shedding insulation. Ropes once used to mark out the piste hang in tatters and bits of plastic are falling off a pylon. The old sheds at each end of the ski lifts often still contain transformers, asbestos, motor oils and greases. Over time, these substances seep into the soil and water.Corrosion and rust from metal structures left over from the second world war, such as anti-tank rails and metal spikes, have led to changes in plant species in the surrounding area, potentially offering a vision of what could happen if pylons are left to rust over the coming decades.Don’t think that you are making eternal things; they will end up becoming obsolete … ask yourself: what will remain?Nicolas Masson, Mountain Wilderness“In Latin, we saymemento mori– remember that you are mortal. Don’t think that you are making eternal things; they will end up becoming obsolete,” says Nicolas Masson, from Mountain Wilderness, which is campaigning for old ski infrastructure to be dismantled to make space for nature. “When you make them, ask yourself the question: what will remain?”Some believe the resorts should remain memorialised landscapes, honouring generations of people who lived and skied here; others believe they should be returned to wild landscapes with their disintegrating machinery removed.View image in fullscreenEcologist Nicolas Masson is part of a campaign to dismantle old ski infrastructure.Photograph: Thomas Valentin/The GuardianNature’s recoveryCéüze’s deconstruction started on 4 November 2025, a month before the ski season would once have kicked off. The resort’s ski lifts were airlifted out using a helicopter to minimise environmental disturbance and compression of the earth.French law requires ski lifts to be removed and dismantled if they are no longer in use. The lawonly applies to ski lifts built after 2017, however. Most last for 30 years, so no lifts would be considered obsolete until at least 2047. The process is also expensive: dismantling Céüze will cost €123,000. This means most abandoned ski infrastructure is left to disintegrate in situ. What is happening in Céüze is rare.With pylons cleared and the resort already closed for seven years, early signs of ecological recovery are already visible. A red haze floats over the white snow: winter berries of the dog rose are sprouting where the piste is no longer mown.View image in fullscreenBerries can be see on dog rose shrubs which are starting to flourish now the piste is no longer cleared for skiers.Photograph: Thomas Valentin/The GuardianThe berries are important winter food for birds such as the rare red-billed chough, and their thorny stems are used for nest-building come spring. In the summer, orchids and yellow gentians bloom over these hillsides. The hills surrounding the site are classed asNatura 2000, meaning they are home to Europe’s rarest and most protected wildlife.The trees are coming back too. “I don’t know if it would take 10, 20 or 50 years, but this is becoming a forest,” says Masson.A fraction of a degree changes everything in the mountain environment. It’s the difference between snow and no snowNicolas MassonWild boar and roe deer living in these forests will benefit from quieter winters. Birds such as grouse shelter from severe cold in winter by digging into the snow, and prefer deep powdery snow – just like skiers. The species is endangered in all the mountain ranges ofFrance.The dismantling of Céüze comes at a time when many spaces for nature are shrinking. Pierre-Alexandre Métral, a geographer at the University of Grenoble Alpes, who studies abandoned ski resorts, says: “There is a lot of debate about the nature of this dismantling – is it just removing mechanical stuff, or are we attempting to put mountains back into a kind of original state?”Ecological recovery can be filled with surprises, he says, noting that the maintenance of pistes can be beneficial to some alpine flowers. “If we let nature come back spontaneously – in a wild, uncontrolled way – there are also risks that some invasive species that tend to be stronger could colonise faster,” says Métral.View image in fullscreenThe hills around the former resort are home to some of Europe’s rarest and most protected wildlife.Photograph: Thomas Valentin/The GuardianThere is scant research in this area, but studies from theValcotos ski resort closurein Madrid’s Sierra de Guadarrama in 1999 show it led to significant recovery of native vegetation and cleaner waterways, while reducing soil erosion.“These are laboratories of what the mountain could be like in the future with new closures,” says Métral.On the brinkThe question of what to do with these places will play out across Europe’s mountains, and around the world. Skiing isdisappearing frommany alpine landscapes. “Many lower ones are already closed,” says Masson. “A fraction of a degree changes everything in the mountain environment. It’s the difference between having snow and no snow.”View image in fullscreenRichard Klein believes the resort should have been saved.Photograph: Thomas Valentin/The GuardianResearch suggeststhat with 2C (3.6F) of global heating, more than half of existing resorts risk having too little snow. Higher altitude resorts are vulnerable to theloss of permafrost, threatening pylons that have been drilled into it. Some resorts, such as St-Honoré 1500, wereabandoned before construction was even completed. Even bigger resorts, which typically have funds to invest in new pistes and artificial snow,are struggling to survive.For some, the loss of Céüze feels premature. Richard Klein,who lives in Roche des Arnauds, near Céüze, feels the ski resort could – and should – have been saved. “It’s a wonderful place to learn to ski – it’s the best. I think it’s really stupid they closed it,” he says. “There were always loads of people.” Klein believes the local authority should have begun using artificial snow, adding: “Now it’s too late.”Yet life has not disappeared from Céüze. In October 2025, the resort’s Hotel Galliard is being sold to a developer looking to open it for events, according to Ricou-Charles. A property developer has bought the children’s holiday residence, and a carpenter has moved into the building where the old ticket office was. The rooms used as a holiday camp for children have cracks appearing down the side, but might open again in the future.“Céüze will continue to live, despite the loss of the resort,” says Ricou-Charles. “We are not mourning Céüze because it is not dead.”On winter weekends dozens of cars still gather in the car park, with people enjoying quieter activities on the hillside, such as walking, snow-shoeing, cross-country skiing and sledging.View image in fullscreenA poster from the resort’s 80th anniversary celebrations.Photograph: Thomas Valentin/The GuardianMasson does not like the term “ghost resort” because it suggests total abandonment when what is happening in his area is more complicated. “People continue to come,” he says. “We don’t need large machines to make mountains attractive.”What happens at Céüze is a glimpse into a future that faces dozens of other small resorts, and mountain landscapes, acrossEurope. “What is our heritage that we will want to keep,” asks Masson. “And what is just a ruin we want to dismantle? That is a question we have to ask every time, and it requires some reflection.”Explore more on these topicsSki resortsThe aftermathFranceSkiingClimate crisisConservationEuropeWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now this culture must be future-proofed from the forces of globalisationRachel AroestiSat 27 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 27 Dec 2025 15.19 ESTShareOn the face of it, British culture looks doomed. Our music industry is now borderline untenable, with grassroots venues shuttering at speed (125 in 2023 alone) and artists unable to afford to play the few that are left; touring has become a loss leader that even established acts must subsidise with other work. Meanwhile, streaming has gutted the value of recorded music, leading to industry contraction at the highest level: earlier this year the UK divisions of Warners and Atlantic – two of our biggest record labels – were effectively subsumed into the US business.In comedy, the Edinburgh fringe – the crucible of modern British standup, sketch and sitcom – is in existential crisis thanks to a dearth of sponsorship and prohibitively high costs for performers. Our film industry is at this point almost totally reliant on (dwindling) US funds; while Britain remains a popular filming destination due to tax breaks and appealing locations, the vast majority of the productions made here ultimately generate American profits.As the BBC, bedrock of our cultural life, lurches from crisis to crisis, the TV industry at large has been ruinously compromised by broadcasters’ inability to pay for programming due to advertising cuts and ballooning costs. Like film, it has become dependent on international investment – to the extent that many are concerned that we’ve lost the ability to make programmes exclusively for British audiences. Shows that cannot attract foreign money rely on goodwill, with directors, writers and stars of flagship dramas taking significant pay cuts just to get them made (see: the second instalment of the double-Bafta-winning Wolf Hall). Unlike US-based streamers, we are incapable of converting viewership into profit: ripped-from-the-headlines drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office attracted an audience of more than 13 million and still lost around £1m, something ITV boss Kevin Lygo attributed to its lack of sales in other territories.View image in fullscreenCool Britannia … Mr Bates vs the Post Office.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockHow on earth do we sustain an uncompromising, idiosyncratic arts sector in these circumstances? One result of the globalisation of entertainment is that success is now judged by the number of nationally indistinct eyeballs or eardrums culture can attract. As a small island, we are surely destined to matter less and less.Except something strange has happened. Amid this catastrophe, British culture is booming. Not only are we dominating the global zeitgeist, but we’re doing so with art that reckons with our heritage and sensibility in unprecedentedly thrilling and nuanced ways. Look at it all – from the viral trends that capture the British psyche like never before to the music, TV and films that grapple with the complex, often contradictory British identity – and tell me we haven’t found ourselves in a golden age.I Used to Live in England is a very British love letter to Britain. By an American. “I used to shop at Tesco’s and buy meal deals,” drawls musician Frankie Beanie, who released the track in June under his Supermodel moniker. “I used to say ‘Go Tesco’s’ instead of ‘Go to Tesco’s’,” he brags before referencing Wetherspoons, his familiarity with UK garage (“So now I can be the guy in LA that saysgarage instead of garage”) and £65 national rail journeys.Beanie isn’t the only yank bypassing the tired tropes – afternoon tea, bad teeth, the word “guv’nor” – to celebrate the real hallmarks of British life. Following 2024’s Britishcore trend, in which TikTok users from around the world embraced our quintessential texts (Trainspotting), institutions (Greggs) and figures (Gemma Collins), this year has seen a boom in all-round Anglophilia from across the pond: root causes include a romanticised perception of the UK as a sanctuary from Trump’s America and an unprecedented exposure to the nuances of the British sensibility via social media. “I love England so much,” declared Olivia Rodrigo during her Glastonbury headline set, citing Colin the Caterpillar, having a judgment-free pint at noon and English men, a reference to her current squeeze, the actor Louis Partridge. The pair’s transatlantic coupledom forms a key part of the “British boyfriend” trend, fuelled by the surfeit of young British actors dominating Hollywood, that has made UK men an aspirational accessory.View image in fullscreenViral hit … 28 Years Later.Photograph: Miya MizunoElsewhere, there’s been a global boom in popularity for the British content creators whose clownish provocation “feels equal parts Benny Hill, You’ve Been Framed, and Nil By Mouth”, as per Clive Martin, author of an article published by Vice in August titled How The World Fell in Love With a Summer of British Chaos. It seems like genuine familiarity with the UK has become a weird form of cultural capital: when New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani was asked about his listening habits, he waxed lyrical about the Arseblog Arsecast podcast and an extended version of One Pound Fish, a viral 2012 song by an east London market trader who ended up on The X Factor.Clearly there’s a novelty factor to this internet craze iteration of Cool Britainnia 2.0. Yet there’s substance, too: our wry fetishisation of mundanity and slightly crap small pleasures is finally being understood on a global scale. Meanwhile, in the more conventional artistic sphere, a far more profound reflection of Britishness is all the rage.Take pop music. In the 2010s, the British artists that enjoyed enormous global success: Adele, Ed Sheeran and Coldplay pedalled fairly beige fare that had little to say about this country. Fast-forward to now: for two summers on the trot we’ve been responsible for the transatlantic musical zeitgeist: this year, the Oasis reunion; last year, Charli xcx’s Brat. (The latter’s influence continued well into 2025, partly thanks to a belated and horribly misguideddiss track by Taylor Swift.) Both are quintessentially British in myriad ways. Oasis have, of course, been national mascots for more than 30 years: their combination of lairy terrace banter, mordant Mancunian wit, knowingly ludicrous braggadocio and Beatles nostalgia was a shortcut to the hearts of a population encouraged to romanticise the everyday, the past and the concept of having a laugh.View image in fullscreenClose encounter of the furred kind … Jade Thirwall performing at Glastonbury 2025.Photograph: Harry Durrant/Getty ImagesBrat, meanwhile, connected thanks to more up-to-date British references: happy hardcore, UK garage, dubstep. Yet at its root is an ironic, ideas-y British art school sensibility, whose current figurehead happens to be Charli’s close collaborator AG Cook, a Goldsmiths graduate who helped birthed hyperpop – the only genuinely new musical subgenre in recent memory – via his irreverent satire of artifice, consumerism, tech and good taste.Also like Oasis, Brat channelled a fuck-it candour and sardonic megalomania, this time in the guise of a privately educated party girl.In fact, that chaotic, gobby yet meticulously droll side of our national character was all over pop: from Lily Allen’s evisceratingly honest yet acerbically funny West End Girl to Lola Young’s expletive-laden Messy (which topped the charts in January) to ex-Little Mixer Jade’s debut album That’s Showbiz Baby! (sample lyric: “I am the it girl / I am the shit girl”). They share a vibe with Amelia Dimoldenberg, whose YouTube series Chicken Shop Date fuses social awkwardness, sandpaper-dry wit and the less salubrious end of the UK high street into a vision of peak Britishness that’s been lapped up in the US; she is currently the Oscars red carpet correspondent.If Charli’s RP-accented electropop was very us, then Kent-raised PinkPantheress’s melancholic version might be even more so. Since debuting on TikTok in 2020, the 24-year-old’s rise has been brisk (the social media platform’s tendency to serve niche UK content to global audiences results in chicken-and-egg-style popularity, see also: #Britishcore): this year she was nominated for the Mercury prize and two Grammys. She, too, leans on an overtly British nostalgia, overlaying drum’n’bass, jungle and big beat samples with evocatively desolate vocals that telegraph rain-lashed woe. PinkPantheress’ USP in the US may be mining this underheard musical history in an appealing accent, but she’s also digging deep into the feeling of Britishness. On the moodboard, she once told Rolling Stone, is “hope and lost hope”, the colour grey, Skins, “having a dirty kind of feeling” and the Streets, particularly Mike Skinner’s ability to evoke the sense that “life is so shit”. It was a take delivered, according to the interviewer, in that “distinctly British way we have of delighting in our own misery”.View image in fullscreenOrange theory … Devonté Hynes.Photograph: Alessandro Bosio/AlamyThis was also the year distinctively British rap properly crossed the pond thanks to Central Cee, whose debut Can’t Rush Greatness became the first ever UK rap album to enter the Billboard top 10, and did so with a grounding in UK drill and shout-outs for Sports Direct, the Uxbridge Road and the Vauxhall Astra. Having previously aligned himself closely with US R&B, in August Blood Orange’s Devonté Hynes released Essex Honey, an album suffused in pained nostalgia for his Ilford childhood whose “primary mood is a very British kind of late summer-into-autumn melancholy”, wrote the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis.In cinema, Tim Key and Tom Basden’s exquisitely sad The Ballad of Wallis Island – one of the greatest films this country has ever produced, according to Richard Curtis – proved an unlikely international hit while remaining, in Basden’s view “very British”: set amid blustery Welsh coastline, its emotional palette was dominated by repressed grief sublimated into awkward banter and a yearning for the past; references included Monster Munch, Gideon Coe and Harold Shipman. Faced with acclaim on the US festival circuit, Key did his national self-deprecation duty and wrested the prospect of failure from success by wondering if he’d accidentally made a film that only worked in America.Another ridiculously British film, Danny Boyle’s 28 Years Later, took in more than $150m worldwide. Boyle’s film was a kitchen sink drama – fry-ups and familial dysfunction in a two-up-two-down – in the guise of a zombie film that opened with an old VHS of the Teletubbies and crescendoed with the appearance of a Clockwork Orange-style gang paying sartorial tribute to Jimmy Savile. It was also an allegory for post-Brexit Britain: the community at its core are isolationists who channel nostalgic comfort via a vision of England that takes in Arthurian romance, the postwar village hall and pint-based ribaldry.View image in fullscreenFunny business … Such Brave Girls.Photograph: BBC/Various Artists Limited/James StackIf 28 Years Later was a sour, surreal yet beautiful paean to this country’s past,Adolescence– the second-most popular programme in Netflix history – was its nightmarishly future-facing counterpart. Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham’s six-time Emmy-winning tale of a 13-year-old accused of murder was the kind of provocative social-issues television that used to be our stock-in-trade – only none of them could boast 142million views. Painstakingly realistic – the police station scenes were eerily reminiscent of Channel 4’s obs-doc 24 Hours in Police Custody (Graham has admitted to being “obsessed” with the series) – it eventually descended into a chillingly ordinary domestic drama that recalled Mike Leigh at his most devastating.Elsewhere, Apple TV’s runaway hit Slow Horses – built on a bedrock of failure and flatulence and set in a recognisably depressing recreation of the capital – returned for a fifth series. Also returning, for a second outing, was Such Brave Girls, whose combination of stifling suburbia and extreme gallows humour is deeply entrenched in a dark British comic sensibility (the New York Times drew parallels with Peep Show, Pulling and Fleabag), despite being backed by influential US production powerhouse A24. All capture the spirit of UK life infinitely more accurately than The Crown or The Great British Bake Off or Ted Lasso – but not every depiction of Britain on screen has been so bleak. Industry, a HBO-BBC co-production most popular in the US, is possibly the most cool and sophisticated drama ever made about Britain: segueing from trading floor to dodgy boozer to gentlemen’s club to country cottage, creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay have managed to infuse their study of the black box power structures at the heart of UK society with gobsmacking drama and biting satire.Perhaps the panic about British culture dying out is premature. Or perhaps the disastrous effects are still to come. Either way, the most startling thing about this new age in which we are obligated to perform Britishness to the rest of the world is how creatively and authentically it is being done – and how well it is going down. So why can’t we use this present high to help lift our creative industries out of dire straits? In January, David Lammy announced a “soft power” taskforce, designed to turn our cultural achievements into benefits for the country, noting that despite our successes “we have not taken a sufficiently strategic approach to these huge assets”. There has never been a better time to monetise the global appetite for British culture, but 12 months later we’re still waiting for a plan of action.View image in fullscreenPlaying chicken … Amelia Dimoldenberg at the Oscars.Photograph: Sarah Meyssonnier/ReutersSome people do have actual ideas: Wolf Alice guitarist Joff Oddie has been among those petitioning for the introduction of a £1 ticket levy on arena gigs, with proceeds going to smaller venues (the policy was adopted earlier this year, albeit only on a voluntary basis). Even if we have shortsightedly allowed US tech companies to annex our TV industry, it’s not too late to claw back some cash: director Peter Kosminsky (Wolf Hall, The Undeclared War) is advocating for a 5% levy on UK subscription streaming revenues, with the money raised going towards a British cultural fund.In September, prolific screenwriter Steven Knight (Peaky Blinders, A Thousand Blows, the first film in the newly Amazon-owned James Bond franchise) told the Times that the answer to our current woes might be “creative nationalism”. The phrase may make you flinch – especially after a summer in which the St George’s Cross, long weaponised by the far-right, was displayed around the country as part of a nebulous patriotic campaign. Yet some strain of nationalism – in the autonomy and independence sense – may be necessary if we don’t want our popular culture to be permanently dependent on the whims of foreign conglomerates. (Disney’s decision to discard its underperforming Doctor Who reboot like an old snot rag should serve as a warning.) Either way, Knight’s outlook didn’t seem particularly exclusionary or tub-thumping: his version of Britishness – “a cross between Dad’s Army and SAS Rogue Heroes” – was based around rain, cold and our awareness “of our own absurdities”.The problem with creative nationalism might just be that: we are so in love with our failures and flaws that capitalising on success just isn’t a very British thing to do. If our cultural sensibility is anti-boosterish – rooted in self-deprecation, repression, chaos, irreverence and disappointment – perhaps we operate best on the back foot. The future is uncertain, but one thing isn’t: as 2025 comes to a close, British culture finds itself in a very British place.Explore more on these topicsCultureCharli xcxTelevision industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the piss. Duckett’s on the piss.Don’t take me home, please don’t take me home. And while we’re here, stand up, stand up, please do stand up if you love a two-day Test on a pitch as green and ridged as an under-ripe roasting potato. For an hour in mid-afternoon on day two at the MCG England’s top order finally did the thing. The clocks stopped. Dogs miaowed. Birds flew backwards across the sky. And Test cricket turned into darts.This was probably always coming in some form. The universe tends toward entropy. In England all things are, in the end, shirtless men singing Sweet Caroline. As England’s openers set off in pursuit of 175 to win this fourth Test at the midway point of a strange, restless day of fast-forward cricket, junk cricket, cricket off its meds, there was a sense of barriers dissolving, of a top order intent not just on playing the old favourites, but playing them all at the same time.England survive MCG mayhem to break Ashes drought in Australia with fourth Test victoryRead moreBen Duckett kicked things off with three fresh-air swipes in his first five balls. He crunched Mitchell Starc off his pads. He whirled his bat like a club. He was almost bowled, almost caught and almost caught-and-bowled.Absurd walking ramps were essayed. A forward defensive drew vast pantomime roars from the banks of English fans. Zak Crawley stood still and hit Michael Neser’s seventh ball high over long-off for six, a beautifully crisp moment of clarity in the middle of all that heat and noise.The opening partnership reached fifty off 6.5 overs. Duckett walked off shortly after with 34 off 26, yorked playing a kind of cave-ball defensive bunt, but having also produced surely one of the strangest active top-order Test innings in the history of this ground.And there was more too, as Brydon Carse walked out at No 3 with more than a hundred runs still required for victory. Ideally Carse at this point would have raised his left elbow to the skies and ground his way to 27 off 117 balls, thereby genuinely sticking it to the man, freaking out the squares and subverting the dominant paradigm. He didn’t do this. Instead he played every conceivable cricket shot, pure movement, unchoreographed shapes, free-flowing physical ballet, en route to a horrible six.View image in fullscreenEngland batter Ben Duckett plays a ramp shot as Australia’s Alex Carey looks on.Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty ImagesThere was a vague sense of desecration about all this. Australia venerates Test cricket. This matters here. It speaks to the land, the culture, the triumphant separation from the colonial past. In Adelaide they agonise about letting you in through the media entrance without a collar. In Melbourne the G at Christmas is a secular cathedral, a temple of chino and blue twill shirt, a fixed cultural point.Except, now Duckett is out there playing meth-ball. Carse has gone out to bat in chaps. Brendon McCullum is lounging back so far in his chair, feet up, he’s in danger of disappearing into a ball of pure human insolence.Boxing Day Test serves up too much of a good thing even in the season of excess | Geoff LemonRead moreAnd as England walked off at tea, 77 for two and going along at six and a half an over, the ghost of something long since pronounced dead on the table, the Bazball that dare not speak its name, had never felt so horribly alive. Albeit, only alive in in a desiccated way, leathery and Botoxed, pumped full of meds, telling everyone it’s never felt so young.This was not a vindication of anything. But it was a note of grace, a tick in the box for all that. England’s approach to batting made perfect sense here. A successful chase and a four-wicket win was a reminder of the basic logic of playing this way on a pitch that just kept on seaming.And right now there are two things worth saying about it. First, any England team winning a Test in Australia is a real thing.On day two here, England bowled Australia out for 132 a bowler down, then smashed an excellent attack around the park on a tough pitch. In doing so they completed a first Test win since Sydney in 2011. This has been a place of annihilation, collapse, trauma, careers in turnaround. Whatever the state of the series, this is a genuine achievement, and a tick for the regime.A talented, biddable, slightly raw group of players has been betrayed at times, by short cuts and poor planningBut let us be clear also: it is by no means a vindication of another losing tour, or of a failing executive tier. In fact, this is the opposite. What winning in Melbourne says is: here is what you could have had. Here is evidence that Australia were vulnerable, and for good reason too. They came into this game with three all-time bowlers missing. Mitch Starc has had to play every Test. The batting isn’t really there. This team was vulnerable.Yet England just weren’t ready to press their fingers into those tender points. They kicked off in Perth playing jet-lag cricket, eyes wide, still trying to work out what day it was. A properly prepped, balanced and weaponised team might be doing more than simply taking a dead rubber on a wonky pitch.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Barmy Army revel in a Test victory on day two in Melbourne.Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty ImagesInstead a talented, biddable, slightly raw group of players has been betrayed at times, by short cuts and poor planning. A backroom energy that was initially inspiring, and whose spirit flickered here again in that chase, hasn’t known how to transform an idea and a set of slogans into a winning machine. Or at least, not yet, anyway.Victory here will stand on its own. But it must also serve as a reprimand, a note of internal frustration about complacency, slackness and how easy it is to miss these opportunities.England will now have a fair chance of winning in Sydney too, and of chasing this series right to its hypothetical finish line. They turned cricket into darts here. They did the thing, finally, that they always promised to do. But who knows how the southern summer might look now if they’d started running a little earlier.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26England cricket teamAustralia cricket teamThe AshesAustralia sportCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

In January,Donald Trumptook the oath of office,declared himself“saved by God to make America great again” and issued a barrage of executive orders. In the ensuing months the US president and his allies moved at breakneck speed and seemed indomitable.But as 2025 draws to a close with Trumpstruggling to stay awakeat meetings, the prevailing image is of a driver asleep at the wheel. Opinion polls suggest that Americans are turning against him.Republicansare heading for the exit ahead of congressional contests next November that look bleak for the president’s party.“He came into office and, like a blitzkrieg, was violating laws and the constitution,” saidLarry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. “The American political process is slow-moving and so he was able to do things that were extraordinary.“But this is a guy whose legacy may well be the political collapse ofRepublicansin this era. Put another way, rather than asking who is going to be the inheritor of the Trump mantle and the so-called Maga movement, we may be talking in a year or so about which candidates can escape the odious distinction of having been connected with Trump.”Emboldened by his political comeback in the 2024 election, Trump hit the ground running. On his first day in office hepardoned nearly everyoneinvolved in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and launched a radical expansion of executive power, a systematic retribution campaign against perceived adversaries, and a sweeping overhaul of domestic and foreign policy.Cracks have emerged in the Maga coalition | Moira DoneganRead moreA government-wide restructuring under the “department of government efficiency” (Doge) was led by the billionaire Elon Musk and resulted in mass federal layoffs and the dismantling of agencies such as USAID. But Trump and Musk fell out and Doge burned itself out.The president’s domestic agenda included a hardline immigration crackdown featuring mass deportations and the deployment of the national guard and other federal forces to US cities, often against the wishes of local authorities.The 1798 Alien Enemies Actwas invoked to deport Venezuelans to a mega-jail in El Salvador.Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: “He promised to secure the border but the deportations have gone too far. City after city, community after community has expressed frustration and dismay at the tactics.”Trump had also promised to fix the economy but his signature legislation, the “one big, beautiful bill” – rebranded as theWorking Families Tax Cut Act– will, critics say, transfer wealth from the poor to the rich and strips healthcare from millions of people. Meanwhile the president’s disruptive policy centred on aggressive tariffs that caused market volatility and fuelled higher prices for consumers.Schiller added: “The greatest self-inflicted wound that the president has brought on himself and the Republicans are the tariffs. In the first administration, they were primarily directed at China and you can make an argument about that.“In this administration they are so much broader and more sweeping and it’s showing in supply chains, in consumer purchasing, in pricing, in every corner of people’s lives. Whether it’s a supermarket or it’s holiday gifting or whatever it is, they’re feeling it.”Trump’s appointment of Robert F Kennedy Jr helped fan anti-vaccine sentiment, leading to a resurgence of preventable diseases and a politicisation of theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. He withdrew the US from the Paris agreement and systematically dismantled climate science infrastructure.At his political zenith, Trump’s embrace of authoritarianism appeared unstoppable. He quickly fired 17 independent inspectors general in apparent violation of federal law. He ordered the justice department to investigate perceived enemies including James Comey, the former director of the FBI, and Letitia James, the New York attorney general.This administration has been governing in a way that is on a collision course with the constitutionSkye Perryman of Democracy ForwardThe administration targeted law firms that represented adversaries, stripping contracts and security clearances to extract multimillion-dollar settlements. Billions in federal fundingwere frozen for universitiesincluding Harvard and Columbia, leveraging antisemitism and DEI policies to force changes in curricula and leadership.Trump also pursued an aggressive campaign against mainstream media, suing news organisations such asCBS/Paramount, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, pushing the Federal Communications Commission to revoke broadcast licences and restricting access for some outlets while promoting “Maga media”.In 11 months he signed 225 executive orders, 56 memorandums and 114 proclamations. Many mirror proposals from the conservativeProject 2025policy document and have been met with significant legal challenges, with numerous actions deemed illegal and unconstitutional by federal judges.Skye Perryman, president and chief executive ofDemocracy Forward, a national-legal organisation that has filed numerous lawsuits against the administration, said:“This administration has been ruthlessly breaking the law, disregarding the protections that are provided through American law for people and communities. It has been governing in a way that is on a collision course with the constitution.”She gave examples including infringement of free speech, disregard for due process, an effort to replace civil servants with political loyalists, and a federal funding freeze that threatened food and nutritional assistance for 42 million Americans. But Perryman also finds hope in the way that people have responded.“The American people have been pushing back. There have been nearly 500 lawsuits filed in federal court over the course of these first 11 months of the administration. The administration is losing in court before judges that were appointed by Republicans,Democratsand President Trump himself.”View image in fullscreenThe No Kings protest in Manhattan on 18 October 2025.Photograph: Urman Lionel/Abaca/ShutterstockOne of the most unexpected developments of Trump’s second term is how much political time and capital he has invested in foreign policy. His relationships in the Middle East and cryptocurrency ventures prompted ethical concerns. His intention toaccept a $400m luxury jet from Qatarfor use as Air Force One drew rare bipartisan criticism as a “bribe”.Trump brokered a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas but gave the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,an Oval Office shakedownwhile rolling out a red carpet for Russia’s Vladimir Putin in Alaska. He ordered military strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean, leading to allegations of potential war crimes.Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: “The focus on foreign affairs has surprised me. It’s not just the ongoing question of Ukraine. This has been a first year that has been much more defined by what he’s doing overseas than what he’s doing at home and I did not expect that.“I also expected more of what we saw during the campaign, which was a Trump that didn’t use social media in an explosive way on a regular basis, and instead we’ve returned significantly to the first term, where the language and the surprising use of social media is a defining feature of his presidency. People didn’t like it in term one and then they seem not to like it in term two.”For months Trump appeared unassailable as the opposition Democratic party struggled to find its feet and protests appeared muted compared with his first term.But a demonstration known asNo Kingsstaged in June to coincide with Trump’s 79th birthday and a rare military parade in Washington attracted 5 million people. This was followed by another No Kings protest in October, where the turnout of 7 million was said to be the biggest civic action in the US for more than half a century.Democrats also appeared to regain their mojo. Against the backdrop of the longest government shutdown in history, the party stormed to victory after victory in elections for governor of New Jersey andVirginia, mayor of New York, and other offices. The central theme of their campaign was affordability as millions of Americans struggle to make ends meet.Like Joe Biden before them, Republicans’ insistence that the economy is strong does not tally with many people’s daily experience at the supermarket. The president’s efforts to dismiss affordability as a “con job”, “hoax” and “scam” by the Democrats have rung hollow as he plans a $400m ballroom at the White House.With the Jeffrey Epstein files also casting a long shadow, Trump appears increasingly out of touch. For years he travelled the country drawing big crowds to rollicking campaign rallies where he would meet local officials. This year he has held only seven rallies, focusing his travel instead on overseas trips and his own luxury golf courses. The Atlantic magazine described him as “the bubble-wrapped president”.I would place the odds at 70% that Democrats are going to recapture the House in a massive tsunamiPatrick Gaspard of the Center for American ProgressLast montha poll by Gallupshowed Trump’s job approval rating down to 36%, the lowest of his second term, while disapproval had risen to 60% (his all-time low was34% in 2021, at the end of his first term after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol). Notably his approval rating was underwater on crime (43%), foreign affairs (41%), foreign trade (39%) and immigration (37%).The polls suggest that groups who moved towards Trump in 2024 – including young voters and Latino voters – are now deserting him and returning to the Democratic fold, animated by jobs, inflation and healthcare.Schiller of Brown University said: “This is getting into territory that is Biden numbers and the question is why. The president and his team have taken the signals from the voters on particular issues – for example, immigration and bringing manufacturing home where voters said, yes, we want a change in our policies – but they took it to the extreme. They overreached.“America, at the end of the day, is not an extremist country. If you go too far left, voters are unhappy; if you go too far right, voters are unhappy. This has been true for quite some time so what we’re seeing is voters expressing a sense of frustration, trying to send a signal, at least to the Republican party if not to the president: we’re not happy with the direction you’re taking us.”The omens for November 2026 are grim. History shows the party that holds the White House always tends to suffer losses in midterm elections. Democrats appear galvanised and determined to curb Trump’s power. Some Republicans are already deserting what they may fear is a sinking ship.Several Republican senators have announced they will not run for re-election next year: Mitch McConnell of Kentucky,Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. Meanwhile, more than two dozen Republicans in the House of Representatives have announced they will not try to retain their seat.Patrick Gaspard, a former assistant to Barack Obama and director of the White House office of political affairs, said: “Trump has run out of runway on Joe Biden. For the first few months of the presidency, he was given this allowance to blame everything that people are experiencing on Joe Biden.“But now, by a margin of two to one, voters hold Trump rather than Biden responsible for the outcomes in the economy and that’s got to be pretty scary for [House speaker] Mike Johnson and company.”Gaspard, now a distinguished senior fellow at the Center for American Progress thinktank in Washington, added: “I would place the odds at 70% that Democrats are going to recapture the House in a massive tsunami. Republicans are losing every moment they’re talking about something other than the economy andDonald Trumpforces them to talk about anything but the economy.”The midterms typically fire the starting gun for the next presidential election, consigning the incumbent to lame duck status. It is not a position that Trump – who continues to drop dark hints about running for an unconstitutional third term – is likely to relish.Charlie Sykes, a conservative author and broadcaster, said: “With Donald Trump, ‘lame duck’ may just be another word for nothing left to lose. He will still have vast, unchecked powers, which he’s already made clear that he will exercise in the rawest, most reckless way possible.“He’s figured out what he can do with the power of pardoning – for my friends everything, for my enemies the law. He’s pardoning major drug kingpins and corrupt politicians right and left before he’s officially a lame duck. How does Donald Trump behave when he has nothing politically left to lose? That’s a question I’m not sure that we’ve gotten our heads around.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

One-third of the 500 videos were “brainrot”, a category that includes AI slop and other low-quality content made to monetise attention.The findings are a snapshot of a rapidly expanding industry that is saturating big social media platforms – from X to Meta to YouTube – and defining a new era of content: decontextualised, addictive and international.A Guardian analysisthis year found that nearly 10% of YouTube’s fastest-growing channels were AI slop, racking up millions of viewsdespite the platform’s effortsto curb “inauthentic content”.The channels found by Kapwing are globally distributed and globally watched. They have millions of subscribers: in Spain, 20 million people, or nearly half the country’s population, follow the trending AI channels. AI channels have 18 million followers in Egypt, 14.5 million in the US, and 13.5 million in Brazil.Bandar Apna Dost, the most-viewed channel in the study, is based in India and now has 2.4bn views. It features the adventures of an anthropomorphic rhesus monkey and a muscular character modelled off the Incredible Hulk whofights demonsandtravels on a helicopter made of tomatoes. Kapwing estimated that the channel could make as much as $4.25m. Its owner did not respond to a query from the Guardian.Rohini Lakshané, a researcher on technology and digital rights, said Bandar Apna Dost’s popularity most likely stems from its absurdity, its hyper-masculine tropes and the fact that it lacks a plot, which makes it accessible to new viewers.Pouty Frenchie, based in Singapore, has 2bn views and appears to target children. It chronicles the adventures of a French bulldog – driving to a candy forest, eating crystal sushi – many of them set to a soundtrack of children’s laughter. Kapwing estimates it makes nearly $4m a year.Cuentos Facinantes, based in the US, also appears to target children with cartoon storylines, and has 6.65 million subscribers – making it the most-subscribed channel in the study.Meanwhile,The AI World, based in Pakistan, contains AI-generated shorts of catastrophic flooding in Pakistan, with titles like Poor People, Poor Family, and Flood Kitchen. Many of these videos are set to a soundtrack called Relaxing Rain, Thunder & Lightning Ambience for Sleep. The channel itself has 1.3bn views.It’s hard to say exactly how significant these channels are compared with the vast sea of content already on YouTube. The platform does not release information on how many views it has yearly, or how many of these are from AI content.But behind these uncanny scenes of candy forests and disasters is a semi-structured, growing industry of people trying to find new ways to monetise the world’s most powerful platforms using AI tools.“There are these big swathes of people on Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord and message boards exchanging tips and ideas [and] selling courses about how to sort of make slop that will be engaging enough to earn money,” saidMax Read, a journalist who has written extensively on AI slop.“They have what they call niches. One that I noticed recently is AI videos of people’s pressure cookers exploding on the stove.”While creators of AI slop are everywhere, Read said that many come from English-speaking countries with relatively strong internet connectivity, where the median wage is less than the amount they can make on YouTube.“It’s mostly sort of middle-income countries like Ukraine, lots and lots of people in India, Kenya, Nigeria, a fair number in Brazil. You see Vietnam, too. Places with relative freedom online to access social media sites,” he said.It’s not always easy to be an AI slop creator. For one thing, creator programmes on YouTube and Meta aren’t always transparent about who they pay for content, and how much, said Read. For another, the AI slop ecosystem is full of scammers: people selling tips and courses on how to make viral content – who often make more money than the AI slop producers themselves.But, at least for some, it’s a living. And while new, attention-grabbing ideas – such as exploding pressure cookers – constantly emerge, when it comes to AI slop, human creativity matters far less than the algorithms that distribute the content on Meta and YouTube.“These websites are huge A/B testing machines just by their nature,” said Read. “Almost anything that you can think of, you could already find on Facebook. So the question is, how do you find the things that are kind of doing well, and then how do you scale that? How do you make 10 of them?”A YouTube spokesperson said: “Generative AI is a tool, and like any tool it can be used to make both high- and low-quality content. We remain focused on connecting our users with high-quality content, regardless of how it was made. All content uploaded to YouTube must comply with our community guidelines, and if we find that content violates a policy, we remove it.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

They came asthe Ukrainian leader headed to Floridafor a face-to-face meeting on Sunday with Donald Trump, who has proposed a plan to end nearly four years of fighting that has killed tens of thousands.Zelenskyy stopped in Canada, where he met the country’s prime minister, Mark Carney, who announced an additional $2.5bn (£1.85bn) of economic aid forUkraine.Carney condemned the “barbaric” overnight attack on Kyiv. He said: “We have the conditions, the possibility, for the just and lasting peace,” adding this requires a “willing Russia”.View image in fullscreenUkrainian firefighters work to extinguish a fire in Kyiv.Photograph: Ukrainian emergency service/AFP/Getty ImagesZelenskyy spoke by video call with European allies.Macron highlighted what he called the “contrast” between “the willingness of Ukraine to build a lasting peace and Russia’s determination to prolong the war that it started”, Elysee officials said.The EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa said the European Union’s support for Ukraine would not falter.“In 2026, the EU Commission will continue to keep up the pressure on the Kremlin, sustain our support to Ukraine, and work intensely to accompany Ukraine on its path toward EU membership,” von der Leyen said on Saturday.Zelenskyy said he would hold talks with European leaders again after meeting Trump on Sunday.Zelenskyy said the overnight bombings showed international pressure on Russia was insufficient. “If Russia turns even the Christmas and New Year period into a time of destroyed homes and burnt apartments, of ruined power plants, then this sick activity can only be responded to with truly strong steps,” he said. “The United States has this capability. Europe has this capability. Many of our partners have this capability. The key is to use it.”View image in fullscreenA Ukrainian firefighter extinguishes a fire in a residential building damaged by a Russian drone and missile attack in Kyiv.Photograph: Ukrainian emergency service/AFP/Getty ImagesRussia’s defence ministry said it had downed 111 Ukrainian drones, in what appeared to be a retaliatory attack.Russia claimed on Saturday to have captured two more towns in eastern Ukraine, Myrnograd and Guliaipole.Zelenskyy has said the meeting with Trump in Florida is “specifically intended to refine things as much as we possibly can”. Speaking on Friday, he added that a proposed 20-point peace plan was “90% ready”. “Our goal is to bring everything to 100%,” Zelenskyy said. “As of today, our teams – the Ukrainian and American negotiating teams – have made significant progress.”Ukraine war briefing: Kim Jong-un celebrates sharing ‘blood, life and death’ with RussiaRead moreZelenskyy has reportedly said he would need to seek the approval of the Ukrainian public if he failed to secure a “strong” position on territory.After the strikes on Saturday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia’s “only response to peace efforts” was “brutal attacks using hundreds of drones and missiles against Kyiv and other cities and regions”. The minister said that a third of the capital was without heating. The temperature in Kyiv was about 0C (32F).The Russian strikes forced Polish fighter jets to scramble, and two airports in south-eastern Poland – Rzeszów and Lublin – were temporarily closed.The latest peace effortsfollow a burst of diplomatic activitylast weekend in Miami, where Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff, as well as Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, separately met Russian and Ukrainian representatives.View image in fullscreenUkrainian rescuers look through rubble inside a damaged residential building in Kyiv.Photograph: Serhii Okunev/AFP/Getty ImagesThe plan is considered an updated version of an earlier 28-point document agreed several weeks ago between the US envoys and Russian officials, a proposal widely viewed as skewed towards the Kremlin’s demands.Ukraine has pushed for security guarantees modelled on Nato’s article 5 mutual defence pledge under any proposed peace deal with Russia, though it remains unclear whether Moscow would accept such terms.In aninterview with Politicoon Friday, Trump said he anticipated a “good” meeting with the Ukrainian leader, though he offered no endorsement of Zelenskyy’s plan. “He doesn’t have anything until I approve it,” Trump told the news website. “So we’ll see what he’s got.”The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, used a Russian television appearance on Friday to criticise Zelenskyy and European allies on their work on the peace plan. “Our ability to make the final push and reach an agreement will depend on our own work and the political will of the other party,” Ryabkov said.He said the proposal drawn up with Zelenskyy’s input “differs radically” from points initially drawn up by US and Russian officials in contacts this month. “Without an adequate resolution of the problems at the origin of this crisis, it will be quite simply impossible to reach a definitive accord,” Ryabkov added.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Their passing was lethargic, they had no width, they were 1-0 down to a dominant Chelsea and it seemed the story was going to centre on Emery’s decision not to start Ollie Watkins up front.Yet few managers are as effective as Emery when it comes to altering the flow with a few smart tweaks. The Spaniard never stops plotting, never stops hunting for weaknesses in his opponents, and perhaps it was not a surprise when Villa’s tactical mastermind found a way to ensure that the travelling fans were belting out songs about winning the league at full time.Aston Villa lodge complaint after bottle thrown at their bench at end of Chelsea winRead moreKey to it all was Emery having the clarity of mind to change Villa’s shape and alter the flow with a triple substitution early in the second half. Do not mistake it for luck. Villa retrieving 18 points from losing positions this season is no fluke. They have a group full of leaders, as Emery was quick to point out after an 11th consecutive win in all competitions, and it helps that they have players who are ready to make an impact when thrown on from the bench.The feel was different once Villa had Amadou Onana’s muscle in midfield and Jadon Sancho looking to prove a point against the team who decided against signing the winger in the summer.Chelsea, on the other hand, failed to react. Their lead was cancelled out by Watkins equalising five minutes after coming on and their problems increased when the striker lifted Villa three points below Arsenal at the top of the league after rising to head in the winner in the 84th minute.Where does this end? Emery continues to play down talk of a title challenge but Villa, who visit Arsenal on Tuesday, are building serious momentum. Crucially, they do not know when they are beaten. They have fallen behind in each of their past six away games but have recovered to win five of them.Quick GuideKey factsShow• Aston Villa have won eight consecutive top-flight matches for the first time since a run of nine wins between October and December 1910. In all competitions, their 11-game winning run equals a club record, set in September 1897 and March 1914 previously.• Chelsea have dropped 11 points from winning positions in home Premier League matches this season – four more than any other side. Enzo Maresca has lost four home Premier League games when going 1-0 up, with only Glenn Hoddle (five) losing more as Blues manager• Aston Villa are responsible for 45% of the away wins by teams when conceding first in the Premier League this season (five of 11) – in Premier League history, only Manchester United in 2020-21 (nine) have won more away games when going 1-0 down in a season than Villa’s five in 2025-26.OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.What Chelsea, who have slipped to fifth place after one win in six league games, would give for some of that knowhow. Unfortunately for Enzo Maresca, though, his young side’s habit of playing in fits and starts is why they are still not realistic challengers. “We need to manage the game better,” Chelsea’s head coach said. “We were completely in control – and this has happened before.”Indeed, Chelsea’s collapse after Villa’s alterations was no one-off. They have dropped 11 points from winning positions at home this season and it was a worry for Maresca – who was forced to watch from the back of the press box after being hit with a touchline ban – that none of his substitutes were able to make an impact.The lack of leadership was stark. Chelsea lost their shape after Villa equalised, while another headache for Maresca was Cole Palmer not hiding his displeasure at being substituted in the 72nd minute. Palmer, who is still feeling his way back from a groin injury, flung his arms in the air when his number went up and briefly disappeared down the tunnel after making way for Estêvão Willian.View image in fullscreenOllie Watkins scores Aston Villa’s equaliser after his initial shot was blocked by the floored Robert Sánchez.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersIn truth, though, Chelsea’s No 10 did not have one of his better games. Palmer was lively early on, whistling a volley wide, but he was outshone by Morgan Rogers in the second half. Villa’s star man made Watkins’s first goal and there were times when Chelsea could not get close to the England international.It was some turnaround. Chelsea were excellent during the first half. They neutralised Villa as an attacking force, were full of aggression and went ahead when João Pedro turned a Reece James corner past Emi Martínez in the 37th minute.Yet Chelsea could not push on. They faded after being denied a penalty when Ian Maatsen handled a cross from Alejandro Garnacho. Emery, who could have made his changes during the interval, came to the fore. Villa were far more menacing with Watkins leading the line. He almost made a goal for Boubacar Kamara, who was thwarted by Robert Sánchez, and he equalised when Onana pounced on a stray pass from Benoît Badiashile.Onana was alert, shovelling the ball to Rogers, who sent Watkins through to bundle an effort past Sánchez in the 63rd minute after the striker’s first shot was saved by the goalkeeper. Now Villa believed. Watkins and Maatsen forced saves from Sánchez, who was relieved when a Rogers free-kick flew inches over.Chelsea offered little at 1-1. Villa looked the likelier winners. They kept pushing and their moment arrived when an error from Malo Gusto, who had come on at left-back for the hamstrung Marc Cucurella, led to Watkins sparking dreams of glory by rising highest to head in a Youri Tielemans corner.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Thousands more claims are expected next year.Last week, GMB and Unison claimed a “historic” victory for thousands of employees of Birmingham city council and Birmingham Children’s Trust after a four-year campaign led to a settlement agreement worth about £250m.This has been among the most high-profile equal pay cases, as it was used by the council to justify declaring effective bankruptcy in 2023, although back then the potential liability was estimated to be much higher – at about £750m.However, the decision to issue a section 114 notice recently came under question afteran analysis by accounting academicssuggested the council’s financial position was better than senior officers made out.GMB said some employees in the Birmingham city council case ended up receiving sums up to £55,000.Under the Equality Act 2010, women and men must receive the same pay and contractual terms, including when doing roles that are different but hold “equal value”.Equal pay claims typically argue that roles more commonly held by women, such as carers, administrators and teaching assistants, come with worse pay grades and conditions than male-dominated jobs like waste collection.The largest sum secured so far from a single council is Glasgow, after a deal was struck in 2022 for a total £770m. However, workers are still waiting for the council’s promised redesign of its pay and grading structure to fix equal pay issues.The other successful cases brought by GMB have been at Sheffield (£60m), Leeds (£10m), Blaenau Gwent (£3m) and Falkirk (£3m).The union said that a further 40,000 claims were still outstanding across 26 local authorities, including the six where deals have already been done, which will probably run into hundreds of millions of pounds.The other local councils with pending claims were Dundee, Fife, Renfrewshire, West Dunbartonshire, Argyll & Bute, Brighton, Southampton, Bristol, Swansea, Cardiff, Sunderland, Coventry, Cumberland, and Westmorland.Councils across the country have been struggling financially, and a record high number of local authorities are expected to ask the government for exceptional financial support in 2026-27 – despite government reforms that willboost funding for councils in deprived areas.GMB also said that next year it expects to launch another 10,000 claims across five more local councils. The union has warned local authorities including Coventry and Bradford urging council bosses to come to the negotiating table or risk “eye-watering settlement figures”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In November, the book won the prestigious Boardman Tasker award for mountain literature.“In effect, for 50-odd years I was suffering from PTSD,” he said. “Climbing on the one hand, it can be a very dangerous activity. And in my case, I pushed the envelope of survival in climbing to its limits in many ways. In my younger days I was doing loads of crazy stuff.View image in fullscreenIain Peters: ‘In some ways, climbing, it saved my life. It saved my sanity.’Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“It was almost in response to what had happened to me in terms of abuse and all these other things. In some ways, climbing, it saved my life. It saved my sanity.”Peters said his favourite outdoor pursuit, introduced to him at the age of three by his grandfather, has taken him all over the world, from the Alps to the Cordillera Darwin on Tierra del Fuego on the border of Chile and Argentina.“It has enabled me to reach the grand old age that I’ve reached – living the life that I do, and I’m still a climber, even in my late 70s,” he said. “From a therapeutic point of view, it’s helped. It’s helped me considerably, in terms of both of living with abuse, living with the aftermath of abuse … It became my survival technique.”Peters said he believed climbing allowed him to “disassociate”.“When you’re concentrating on staying alive halfway up a vertical rock face you can’t then think ‘Oh God, poor me, I was assaulted when I was nine years old,’” he said.The father and grandfather said the trauma still had a great impact on his life choices, including on relationships as well as his career. He turned down a scholarship at Cambridge and at one stage found himself working in a strip club for the notorious Kray twins.“The problem with sexual abuse is it’s all about power and the power of the rapist is huge psychologically and physically,” he said. “I was always frightened. I can see this now but I always rejected success because success led to power, and power led to being like a rapist.”Eventually, he did marry with his first marriage lasting 28 years before he lost his wife to cancer. Six years ago, he married again to Ellen.He had never shared his experience with anyone before he reported it in 2015 by handing “a grubby piece of paper” recounting his abuse over the counter at a police station in Exeter.He had previously denied anything had happened to him when reports of abuse at the school – Upcott House preparatory school – emerged in the media.Asked what he thought would have happened to him without climbing in his life, he shared the experience of his best friend, who was also abused by Earle, often in front of each other.“He never recovered,” he said. “He didn’t have climbing. He didn’t climb. He lost his mind. He tried to kill me at one stage. He tried to stab me. I said ‘Why?’ He said ‘Because you survived.’”View image in fullscreen‘When you’re concentrating on staying alive halfway up a vertical rock face you can’t then think ‘Oh God, poor me, I was assaulted when I was nine years old.’Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“I have had things like climbing, I have had, eventually the ability to have children, to have a successful relationship, all these things have come. And now finally, you know, I’m an award-winning writer, yes, and so many victims don’t have that opportunity.”Looking ahead, Peters hopes he and his book can be a beacon for survivors of sexual abuse to know they can come forward with confidence.“We have to create a social culture that will make people feel that they shouldn’t have shame, they shouldn’t have guilt, that they can go for help and more people, particularly young people, should have that opportunity.”Explore more on these topicsMountaineeringChildrenDevonnewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, the staff involved have been suspended.Dr Scott Davidson, medical director at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, offered “sincere apologies” to both families.“We have very rigorous processes for the identification and labelling of bodies from arrival in our mortuaries until their release into the care of an undertaker,” he said.“It is of deep regret that these processes have not been adhered to on this occasion, and that as a result two families have been caused significant additional distress at an already very difficult time.“We launched an immediate investigation into this incident and will ensure that learning is applied.”Queen Elizabeth university hospital is subject to a public inquiry after a series of infection outbreaks and concerns about water and ventilation systems emerged just three years after it was built in 2015.In September, Jane Grant, who led the board between 2017 and 2025, faced questions about the hospital’s communication with families and patients.Explore more on these topicsGlasgowNHSDeath and dyingScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The 47-year-old father has since become a “community champion”, encouraging his neighbours to enrol.“It got to the point where even my little boy was coming home and saying, ‘my friend’s mam and dad are looking for work’,” he grins. “They [the project] have a lot of contacts, they can open doors into places.”Stokell has had health problems, and was struggling to find a suitable role before his caseworker, Khialah Wilson, helped him with his CV and job applications.This is one of 10 JobsPlus schemes. It covers the adjoining Primrose Hill and Newtown estates in Stockton, on Teesside, an area with a proud railway history but bearing the scars of deindustrialisation.The pilots – running against thebackdrop of UK unemployment at a four-year high– are in areas of predominantly social housing across England, from Penge in south London to Wirral in Merseyside, with backing from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).View image in fullscreenBryan Stokell got a full-time job as a security guard with help from JobsPlus.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianThey are modelled on a US scheme, which was first tried in 1998 and initially ran for five years.Long-term analysis showedit was possible to trace a positive impact on the earnings and employment of residents across generations. The research suggested children living in three JobsPlus areas, in Dayton, Ohio; Los Angeles, California; and St Paul, Minnesota, where the scheme was fully implemented went on to earn $2,706 more than their counterparts in similar areas.Key aspects of the “hyperlocal” approach include saturating a small geographical area with employment support, providing direct financial assistance and incentives, and involving the local community. With social tenants more than three times as likely to be lone parents and twice as likely to be disabled as the wider population, help is provided as close to home as possible.In Stockton, this means sessions being held in the Newtown community resource centre: a former school, busy with other local facilities, including a nursery and a youth group. The community champions gather weekly at Nancy’s diner here to chat through ideas over dinner.Wilson stresses that caseworkers stay in touch with their clients, providing moral support even after they find a job. “A lot of my work support customers still come in to see me face to face, even though they’ve signed off on the programme … I’m like, ‘I’ll put the kettle on’.”The community-based nature of the scheme reflectsresearch showing that boosting the “social capital”in an area – the trusted local connections – is good for economic growth.Pat McFadden, who has taken over from Liz Kendall as work and pensions secretary since JobsPlus was launched, has signalled a particular focus on youth unemployment and inactivity, includinglaunching a reviewchaired by the Blair-era minister Alan Milburn.View image in fullscreenYaw Botwe says JobsPlus helped him get the first job he has ever liked doing.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianJobsPlus takes a place-based approach, rather than being tailored to a specific age range; but with unemployment rising across the UK, hitting a four-year high of 5.1% according to the latest data, its proponents argue it is one tool that could help.For 63-year-old Yaw Botwe, who was spending £15 a day on Ubers to get himself to work, the JobsPlus approach meant connecting him to an employer closer to home – Morrisons – and buying him a bike to get there. “It’s cleaning: it’s a nice job, we clean the floor, we pick the cardboard, the plastic. We are inside. This is the first time in my life I’ve got a job that my heart liked,” he says.Megan Steel, 19, who had studied childcare at college but did not want to pursue it as a career and was struggling to find employment, got intensive help with her CV and applications.“She’d come in twice a week, and we’d sit there for a full hour at least, sometimes a lot longer, and first we worked on your confidence, didn’t we? We built you up a bit,” her caseworker, Jade Green, tells Steel.When an invitation for an interview at the local casino came in late one recent Friday, Green stepped in. “I met her outside Tesco and I gave a voucher and said, ‘get yourself kitted out’ because I want her to feel confident,” she says. Steel got the job. “It’s helped me a lot,” she says.Young parents Leia Cuskern, 21, and Thomas Courtney, 18 – a care leaver – have also signed up. Cuskern has been signposted to the jobcentre, with her caseworker, Lyndsey Henry, scheduling an hour-long appointment for support with finding childcare for their 13-month-old daughter, Lily-Rose.Part of the JobsPlus recipe is to bring together resources that are already available but may be hard to access – whether training, benefits advice or connections to local employers. “Everything is done within the community, so that they don’t have to venture out as much – sometimes it’s about building their confidence,” says Henry.View image in fullscreenLeia Cuskern and Thomas Courtney with their daughter at Newtown Resource Centre.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianCourtney, the young dad, who lives with his partner on the estate, is keen to pursue a career in market management after completing a work placement with the local council under a separate employability scheme.With the help of the JobsPlus caseworkers, he plans to study for a diploma with the National Association of British Market Authorities. “I’ll go through a lot of processes, a lot of tests, and then after I go through that I get a diploma in market management, and then hopefully after that I can get a market manager job,” he says.“It’s running the whole markets,” he enthuses. “Taking rents, looking after the markets, making sure everyone feels OK while they’re on the market.”Another happy customer, Jacquie Brown Fowler, describes herself as “the crazy lady who had eight children” – now aged from eight to 28.Hitting a low patch after losing a previous job, she found regular phone calls with her caseworker helpful: she now has a job as a cleaner and lunchtime supervisor at her younger children’s school, and has completed a qualification in food hygiene. “I met lovely Khialah, who lit a lightbulb moment in my head,” she said.One of the unusual aspects of the scheme is that after eight weeks’ paid employment participants receive a £400 bonus. Botwe says he will use it to buy presents for his grownup daughters.As well as encouraging people to sign up, Suzanne Halliwell, the head of care and support at Thirteen Group, the housing association leading the pilot here in Stockton as well as being the landlord for many properties on the two estates, says the payment can help tide clients over the difficult transition between benefits and paid work. “Because of the way universal credit works, you’ve quite often got a period where it’s a bit of a hit and miss situation.”The Learning and Work Institute (LWI) is overseeing the implementation of the 10 pilots and conducting a full evaluation. The latest data shows that since the launch in summer 2024 more than 1,000 people have signed up with one of the JobsPlus teams, with more than 270 finding work.An interim assessment in September found that three-fifths of those who had found jobs through the scheme had hit the eight-week milestone, triggering the £400 bonus.Alongside £2m of support from the DWP the pilots are being part-funded by a charity, the Youth Futures Foundation. But as it stands government funding will run out next March.“This model is showing real promise to transform neighbourhoods and we look forward to watching it progress,” said Stephen Evans, the LWI’s chief executive.For the moment, though, the caseworkers in Stockton and the nine other projects are awaiting news about whether they can continue the project beyond March. Wilson, whose infectious enthusiasm keeps her crew of community champions coming back, says: “Fingers crossed, because I absolutely love it.”Explore more on these topicsUnemploymentEconomic policyEconomicsNorth of EnglandWork & careersPovertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Murder! Horny Republicans! This starry bonkbuster is about as good as nonsense television getsLucy ManganSat 27 Dec 2025 17.35 ESTShareThis is it. This is your reward. For getting through Christmas, for getting through the crisis-laden sorrowfest that was 2025, the gods of television have vouchsafed us all The Hunting Wives, eight episodes of the most perfect trash to fill our screens since – well, I don’t even know when.Since Rivals?Maybe, but like the book it was based on by thelate, great Jilly Cooper, that show was too good to qualify for this coveted title. The Hunting Wives is not. The Hunting Wives is perfect trash. The most perfect trash possibly ever – how’s that?I’m not sure I can explain quite how much fun it is with only the paltry resource of the written word at my disposal but let me limn first its hysterical outlines and we’ll see how we get on.So: former Democratic campaign manager Sophie O’Neil (Brittany Snow, last seen in The Beast in Me) and her Harvard graduate, architect-berk husband Graham (Evan Jonigkeit) move with their Tesla and young son Jack from their elitist ivory tower in Cambridge, Massachusetts to the small town of Maple Brook, Texas, just south of Basket of Deplorablesville and slightly to the right of Trump, where Graham is starting a new architect-berk job. Everyone is drunk, armed and on heat. Let’s go!Sophie is rapidly taken up by Margo (Malin Åkerman), the hot second (at least – I’ve lost track) wife of Graham’s hot new boss, Jed Banks (Dermot Mulroney), who – together and separately – have an array of sexual proclivities that may make headlines if and when Jed announces his planned run for governor. Margo is the centre of the coolest lady-clique in town and Sophie is soon rediscovering her long-buried wild side as she starts to enjoy running with this perma-soused Republican pack.These Mean-Girls-with-cocktails comprise: the sheriff’s wife, Callie (Jaime Ray Newman), who is having an affair with Margo (which is probably OK with the sheriff, as it looks as if he is having it away with one of the young cops in his department); devout Christian Jill (Katie Lowes), wife of the town’s secretly-abusive pastor and mother to late-teenage and permanently priapic Brad (George Ferrier); and two peripheral socialites, Monae (Joyce Glenn) and Taylor (Alexandria DeBerry), who are largely there to make up cocktail numbers.Brad is going out with Abby (Madison Wolfe), the daughter of an overweight single mother who therefore won’t do at all, much as Brad likes to do her. You’ll never guess who else he likes to do. Oh, you have? Well done! You have the measure of the show already. Isn’t it great?Every two to three minutes there is a new secret revealed, a bombshell dropped or some sex being had, very rarely in heterosexual pairings, age-appropriate pairings or even pairings at all. I see now why southern hospitality is so legendary. I don’t know where they find the time to get all their target practice, blackmailing, paying off black sheep siblings and framing people for murder in, but Stetsons off to everyone in Maple Wood. They somehow make it work.If you pay very close attention – but why would you? – you might occasionally spot trace amounts of satire, I presume left over from a very early draft indeed before the writer got a clip round the ear and an admonishment to leave that sort of thing well out of it. The Hunting Wives is adapted from the 2021 book of the same name by May Cobb, which I am minutes away from starting, and thus don’t know what the original intentions of either the author nor the series showrunner, Rebecca Perry Cutter, were. I only know that I couldn’t be happier with the fast, furious, full-blooded results, which exploit the chemistry of all its leads to the full and has enough wit and intelligence to keep it from descending into total melodrama while never shortchanging us on the glorious wildness. I revere Cobb and Cutter jointly and severally, along with whoever has already commissioned a second series and given me a reason to look forward to 2026.The Hunting Wives is on ITVX.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

Britain has the second highest total number of users – more than 1.5 million in 2024, an 88% increase from 2023. Every month, there has been a 30% increase in new users of the app, whose sound identification function was launched in 2021.Merlin has been trained to identify the songs of more than 1,300 species around the world, with more birds added twice a year. Different songs make distinct patterns on spectrograms and Merlin is trained to recognise these different shapes and attribute them to a species.For latecomers to birding, or those lacking a knowledgeable friend, the app has become their teacher. “My fear at first was I wouldn’t actually learn because I’m outsourcing my understanding of birds to this app,” says Walter. “But that hasn’t come to pass. It’s helped me continue my journey of learning.” Nowadays, she guesses, and uses Merlin to confirm her hunches. “It’s wonderful if you’re coming to bird-watching late and don’t really have a mentor,” she says.Angela Townsend from Bedfordshire began using Merlin after going on a nightingale walk one spring and being overwhelmed by the range of bird-voices in the evening chorus. She has found it has steadily built up her bird knowledge. “Warblers were just little brown jobbies but I can now recognise Cetti’s warblers and willow warblers when I’m out without having to put the app on,” she says.Mary Novakovich, author of My Family and Other Enemies, is another recent adopter. She has found it particularly useful when travelling across Croatia, where her parents are from. “I love putting a name to a face and a name to the sound,” she says. “It really brings you closer to the natural world, rather than it being disconnected from your life. It’s part of what makes life a joy.”Bird and birdsong encounters improve mental health, study findsRead moreMerlin is not flawless, however. The first time Kasper Wall, 12, tried it in his Norfolk garden, it detected a northern cardinal and a brown-headed cowbird – North American species not found in Britain.“I think it was figuring out where we live,” says Wall, who enjoys using it even though he is now an extremely knowledgeable birder. “A couple of weeks ago we were looking at a large group of goldcrest and it came up with a firecrest. I thought, ‘Oh, there must be a firecrest in here too’ and 30 seconds later we saw one, which was the first I’d ever seen. I like it and it’s very good but I wouldn’t say that it’s better than the best people at identifying bird-calls like [the naturalist] Nick Acheson. It can definitely be fooled.”Wall enjoys fooling Merlin with his uncanny impressions of a curlew, barn owl and greenshank.Acheson doesn’t use Merlin. He welcomes it, but points out it can replace learning. “Anything that gets people out, thinking about and reacting to nature is a great thing,” he says. “But there’s certainly a risk that people don’t learn and just abdicate responsibility for learning to Merlin.”He has noticed a glitch where Merlin interprets a certain type of chaffinch call as a redstart, leading to people being absolutely adamant that there is a rare bird in their garden. “There’s no substitute for a real person explaining to you how a birdsong feels and encouraging someone to engage with it emotionally,” he says.John Williamson, who works as a guide forNorfolk Wildlife Trust, has found Merlin repeatedly identifying high-pitched calls as a spotted flycatcher, a bird that is very unlikely to be found in the middle ofHickling Broad nature reserve’slarge reedbeds. “Merlin can’t do habitat,” he says.Merlin has also excited visitors by identifying a golden oriole, a very occasional rare migrant, in Hickling woods, but no one has actually seen the species. Williamson is convinced it is misinterpreting a fairly unusual “catcall” of a female jay, a common woodland bird.That said, Williamson finds it a “good tool” and welcomes how it is encouraging new people to enjoy birdsong, and particularly its mental health benefits. He knows one person who suffers from acute anxiety but Merlin has got him out into the world again and into nature, providing a focus for calming trips outdoors. “I find it impressive that an app can empower people to go out into nature,” he says.Research has found that birdsong is particularly beneficial to mental health, and has a lasting positive impact on wellbeing. For millions around the globe, that’s exactly what Merlin is doing.“It reminds you that there are birds knitted into your daily life,” says Walter. “It’s not about, ‘now I’m going to do a bit of birdwatching’, you may simply be walking through the park and you hear something and it gives you a sense that these birds are singing away all the time, even in London.”Explore more on these topicsBirdsArtificial intelligence (AI)AnimalsComputingWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now I’m a Guardian consumer champion. Reinvention is always bracing. My old life was spent wrestling airlines, insurance firms and energy providers intent on plundering readers’ piggy banks. My new life? Wrestling airlines, insurance firms and energy providers intent on plundering readers’ piggy banks.It is a comfort in this era of seismic shifts to know some things remain constant. You can bank on energy firms tochill your marrowwith billing psychodramas and phantom accounts. Meanwhile, certainty is still the business model of insurers: many would say you can be certain that if you damage your car, or yourself, your provider will look for a reason to stall over your claim.It is an age-old tradition for airlines and accommodation providers to take your cash for a booking, but actual flights and actual beds sometimes appear to be considered an optional extra.This year, I have discovered where you can buya takeaway coffee for £100; the mysterious reasons why guests at Travelodge can beshunted by night to motorway service stations; and what“for ever” meansin the banking sector (about two decades in Santander’s lexicon, apparently).I have investigatedhow long HM Revenue and Customs reckons it needs to make an agreed bank transfer– 33 weeks – and why some retired teachershave to prove each year they are not dead.View image in fullscreenAn elderly couple was at least expecting a refund after finding evidence that strangers had sex in their Premier Inn room while they were out.Photograph: Javier Zayas Photography/Getty ImagesAt this time of year I like to acknowledge those organisations that have worked so hard to keep their customers at arm’s length, and to keep me in a job.Applause, please, for the winners of Anna’s dishonours awards 2025.SensitivityambassadorDead customers are so much easier to deal with than live ones. Perhaps that is why Three (slogan: “Live your best phone life”) suggested CF “kill off” her sick fatherwhen she wanted to change the ownership of her mobile phone contract. CF’s account had been set up with him as the principal account holder because she was then a teenager at the time. Three’s customer service team does not have a process for this, but its bereavement service does. Helpfully, it suggested it mark her father down as deceased so it could oblige her request to make her the primary account holder for her own mobile phone. That could, Three warned, affect his credit rating, but it promised to tell credit agencies that he was still alive after the deed was done. Three later said it would review its processes and made a goodwill payment.GoodhygieneSex has bedevilled Guardian-reading holidaymakers. An elderly couple discovered thatstrangers had been at itin their hotel room while they were at a Christmas gathering. The evidence? Condoms, knickers and a paper party hat in the bedroom. Premier Inn (slogan: “Force for Good”) apologised for “any inconvenience” and declared the case closed, before delicate questioning from the Guardian prompted a refund. Then there is Vrbo (“Where families travel better together”), which told a young family whofound their holiday rental was a bloodstained sex denthat their complaint was “minor” and refused compensation until the Guardian stepped in.View image in fullscreenThe housing association L&Q left residents, without warning, with no running water for 12 days at it belatedly fixed a leak.Photograph: RichardBaker/AlamyGood SamaritanEveryone knows Ryanair has a heart of … solid granite. FB, a doctor, reached her departure gate late because she hadstopped to help an injured passenger. Ryanair (“Great Care”) refused to let her board the waiting plane and charged her a £100 admin fee to rebook. Could it not waive the fee as a goodwill gesture, given the circumstances? No it could not, it insisted, since it is its passengers’ responsibility to be punctual (even if it means not helping bleeding pensioners, it seems).Nurture prizeA close race, this one. London’s Wandsworth council (“We serve”) deserves a shoutout forleaving a 91-year-old cancer patientwith damp, mould and insects for a year while it pondered how to address a leak elsewhere in the block. But the housing association L&Q (“Our vision is that everyone deserves a quality home that gives them the chance to live a better life”) went one step further when, with no warning, itleft residents without running waterfor 12 days while it belatedly fixed a leak.View image in fullscreenAirbnb eventually paid a full refund and a £500 voucher to customers after Guardian Money intervened.Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersPhilosopher’sprizeAirbnb (“Belong Anywhere”) must share this with one of its hosts. When a 100-year-old oak tree fellon to a French gite, narrowly missing the occupants (who’d been having breakfast on the terrace minutes earlier), damaging the property’s roof and smashing their hire car windscreen, the host refused to refund their aborted stay. “You have chosen to remember the worry and trauma instead of celebrating a unique memory,” she told them. Airbnb was similarly sanguine. “We understand this may have caused some inconvenience to you,” it said, then closed their complaint – minus refund – and told them: “Keep safe. Stay healthy.” (It eventually issued a full refund along with a £500 voucher after our intervention).SocialjusticewarriorWhere do you potentially face a court forconfusing an “O” with a zero? The London borough of Ealing, which shields its residents from harmful forces without fear or favour. When a visiting driver confused an O on his car number plate with a zero and entered the wrong digit into a parking app, the council gave him the option of an £80 fine or legal action. Os and 0s are identical on car number plates and the driver had paid for his parking. That did not wash with Ealing, nor did government guidance on parking penalty enforcement, which requires councils to exercise discretion “sensibly and reasonably”. It insisted he cough up out of “fair consideration … to motorists who comply with all the parking regulations”.View image in fullscreenApplause, perhaps for the AA, over its treatment of one member’s car?Photograph: Caiaimage/Martin Barraud/Getty Images/iStockphotoCorporatecontritionNo one feels your pain like big business. In fact, it has adopted a platitude to encapsulate its empathy when it realises it has let you down. “We’re sorry for any inconvenience” can be rolled out when the civil service pension scheme managed by the outsourcing company Capita demands a retiree refund£25,000 worth of overpayments it had accidentally madeover 11 years, or Virgin Atlanticfails to refund the cost of a honeymoonit cancelled. It meets the need when TSBconfuses a victim of ID fraud with the fraudster, applies fraud markers to his name and causes the closure of his bank accounts. Inconvenient it is indeed when Airbnbbans youbecause it has seemingly decided you are associated with the criminal underworld; or when Skyfails to cancel the packageof a family whose house was wrecked by a gas explosion next door.AAintrepidtravelThis award is for the AA itself. “Join us on our journey” it invites. But one woman’s carmade the journey without her for six monthsafter the AA towed it to an approved garage for repair. It was returned – only after she reported it as stolen – with a coating of bird dirt, a £70 penalty charge notice for a parking breach, and 15,000 extra miles on the clock. Reassuringly for other AA members, the association told me its relationship with the garage in question was now “under review”.Bereavement supportInsurers have collectively earned this prize. Their response, when informed of a policyholder’s death, can be tohit the bereaved partner with a huge hike in premiumsfor home and car cover. Why? One provider was disarmingly frank with a new widow: now she lives alone, it explained, her home is more at risk of break-ins.This article was amended on 28 December 2025.

But, no sooner had Maxim De Cuyper received the ball on the counterattack, the Belgian was flattened by a crunching Declan Rice tackle that killed any threat. De Cuyper slumped; Rice, towering over him, roared – arguably this season’s standoutPremier Leaguemidfielder making light of playing right-back for the first time in his Arsenal career.Arsenal 2-1 Brighton, Liverpool 2-1 Wolves, Senegal 1-1 DR Congo, and more – football liveRead moreIf Arsenal are to win the Premier League this season, a ceaseless succession of injuries would render it a feat of staggering proportions. Rice the right-back; Mikel Merino the striker; Christian Nørgaard the centre-back – all have been seen at points this season. Even Saturday’s teamsheet had to be altered when the left-back Riccardo Calafiori dropped out after feeling a niggle in the warmup. There were an abundance of available excuses if a Brighton comeback had come to pass.That it did not owed much to a resilience required numerous times this season: almost half of Arsenal’s matches in all competitions have been drawn or decided by a single goal.The hosts’ failure to kill off the game after Martin Ødegaard’s opener and a Georginio Rutter own goal could have cost them. Diego Gómez unexpectedly pulled a goal back amid a period of Brighton threat in which David Raya also pulled off a wonder save to deny Yankuba Minteh. Asked whether it was sustainable for Arsenal to keep coming so close to capitulating at the back end of home games, Mikel Arteta answered simply: “Yes.”Supporters would rather not have to endure such frequently raised pulses, but the wins keep coming and, for successive weekends, Arsenal followed an earlier Manchester City victory by climbing back to the top of the table.“Very happy with the performance,” Arteta said. “Individually and collectively, so dominant. We were a big threat, so very pleased with that, but the margin should have been much bigger. It should never be 2-1, but that’s the Premier League.“We should have scored the third one and then it would have been different. We haven’t, so we have to suffer a little bit more.”View image in fullscreenDavid Raya spectacularly tips Yankuba Minteh’s shot over the bar to preserve Arsenal’s lead.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersThe Arsenal manager suggested the frequency of injuries was serving as a unifying force and insisted his side can continue to weather them: “At the moment we survived six months, so let’s see – hopefully things will get better.”Notwithstanding a 20-minute anxiety-inducing period of Brighton threat in the second half, it was a triumph of some ease. With Ødegaard pulling the strings, and Leandro Trossard and Bukayo Saka terrorising their hapless Brighton handlers, the winning margin should have been considerably greater. By half-time Arsenal had registered 15 shots to Brighton’s zero.Only one of those was converted after the hosts seized on a botched Brighton short goal-kick and capitalised with calm assurance. Saka fed Ødegaard, whose drilled finish into the bottom corner was his first goal of an injury-troubled campaign.The lead was doubled via a familiar route soon after half-time. A customary whipped Rice corner caused Rutter to flick the ball into his own net for Arsenal to benefit from a fourth own goal in their past three home games.By that stage things might have been worse for Brighton, who were perhaps fortunate not to have Bart Verbruggen sent off for flattening Viktor Gyökeres after charging out of his box. The proximity of the touchline meant it was not deemed a goalscoring opportunity, with the goalkeeper instead shown a yellow card.Having offered no attacking threat, the visitors unexpectedly pulled a goal back out of nothing just after the hour when Yasin Ayari’s low drive hit the post and Gómez hammered in the rebound. An uncomfortable tension rose around the Emirates Stadium, but Brighton could not find an equaliser.“In the first half we didn’t play a good game,” said Fabian Hürzeler, whose Brighton side have not won any of their past 11 games in the month of December. “The second half completely the opposite; a lot of courage. In the end it’s a disappointing result.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Or at least that was how it seemed in October. Already, though, the picture has begun to change. This was the year of the backlash, and then a bit of a backlash to the backlash.For almost two decades football had accepted theguardiolistaconsensus. Football was about possession, about the press, but most of all about position, about the careful manipulation of space. Much-improved pitches meant first touches could be taken for granted: players receiving the ball didn’t have to focus on getting it under control but could instead be parsing their options. The game had become chess with a ball, a matter of strategy more than physicality.Into which environment enter Nicolas Jover, Austin MacPhee, Bernardo Cueva and the fleet of set-piece coaches who have transformed the Premier League this season: 21.8% of goals have come from corners or throw-ins, up from 13.9% last season.View image in fullscreenNicolas Jover and the fleet of set-piece coaches have transformed the Premier League.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesTo an extent that is a result of referees being far more prepared to permit challenges on goalkeepers. The era when any contact was considered a foul is, thankfully, over but the degree of licence has perhaps gone too far when players can grab an opponent’s arm – as, say, David Brooks did to Gianluigi Donnarumma in the buildupto Bournemouth’s goal at Manchester Citythis season – and not be penalised on the grounds that he released his grip before the ball arrived in the penalty area.But it’s also about a more general trend of tactical history, which is the reinvention of old methods in new circumstances. This does not mean, as is often claimed, that tactics are cyclical. That would imply they followed a set pattern – winter, spring, summer, autumn – when it’s more that changing priorities can lead to vulnerabilities emerging that, once recognised, can be exploited.‘We’ve fallen behind’: why Germany’s biggest teams have split from DFBRead moreAs the game became increasingly about possession, the focus for defenders, at least at elite clubs, became less about their heading, marking and tackling, the old-fashioned defensive virtues, than their ability on the ball. Which, it turns out, offered an opportunity if you could put them under aerial pressure.That led to a minor moral panic. How could football survive if it just became a series of set pieces, the fluidity that can make football so compelling swept aside by a generation of gurus with iPads and playbooks? The International Football Association Board, which sets the laws of the game, murmured about forcing teams to take set plays within 30 seconds of them being awarded.This is a telling reveal: officials awarding a set play can often take several minutes using VAR to make a decision, while those taking them are to be chivvied and harassed? Which is only right: why would anybody want to see the person best equipped to take a set play, who may have to jog 50 yards to take it, set themselves and take it to the best of their ability? Far more important to get the ball back in play as quickly as possible so we can get to the real business of another penalty appeal or hair’s-breadth offside call.View image in fullscreenRobert Sánchez was able to claim throws with comfort against Tottenham with the box less crowded.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersOver the years, though, football has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to stabilise, to maintain the balance between attack and defence, between technique and physique, without the need to tweak the laws in the way other sports have felt the need for adjustment.Defenders started remembering how to head. Against Tottenham, Enzo Maresca’s Chelsea left three players upfield. Spurs, wary of being caught on the break, left men back to cover. With the box less crowded, the goalkeeper Robert Sánchez was able to come and claim throws with a degree of comfort. It’s not that throws or set plays are no longer a weapon, merely that already they don’t seem quite as devastating or impossible to combat as they did even a couple of months ago. The proportion of goals from throw-ins and corners has fallen 5.2% from the end of October.It seems not unreasonable to assume this is the way football will be for a time. The sport is 160 years old, it is mature. If there are revolutions to come, they will be rare and almost certainly predicated on a technological advance akin to the change in pitch technology that underlayguardolismo; it’s possible to imagine the data revolution and AI having a similarly profound impact. WhatPep Guardioladid, re-invoking the principles of Total Football for a world of flat pitches, creating a worldwide revolution, is exceptionally unusual.View image in fullscreenDominic Calvert-Lewin is in the best scoring form of his career.Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty ImagesEven Guardiola has stepped back from the radicalism of his Barcelona days. In part that may be because once a strand of thought has been pushed so far, the only way to go is backwards, just as many artists, having pursued abstraction to an extreme, end up returning to something more representational, although filtered through the lessons of that process of radicalism. Revolutions once experienced are never forgotten.But it’s also, as Guardiola explicitly said towards the end of last season, about the crowded nature of the calendar. Hewould prefer a small squadhe can indoctrinate in his theories, a philosophy to underlay the specific plans he comes up with for each game. The hectic schedule, though, means there is no longer time for such bespoke preparation, while the physical demands on players mandate a larger squad.That encourages an approach of tweaking and adaptation, aided by the data revolution, perhaps raiding the past for approaches modern sides have forgotten how to deal with. Leeds’s upturn since Daniel Farke switched to a front two at half-timein the defeat by Manchester Cityis a case in point. Centre-backs pairings used to having one to mark and one to cover have had to adapt to both marking and the result has been Dominic Calvert-Lewinhitting the best goalscoring runof his career.This is a fascinating period for tactics. The monolithic belief ofguardiolismohas fractured and nobody is entirely sure what is to follow. It’s a little like English football after the defeat by Hungary in 1953. The old ways are over and in their place has come an age of small-scale experimentation and counter-experimentation from which, eventually, the new era will be synthesised.Explore more on these topicsFootball tacticsInside footballPep GuardiolacommentShareReuse this content"

The lasting impression, however, was Liverpool’s relief at holding off a team that has endured more defeats in the first half of a season than any other inPremier Leaguehistory.“I’ve just said to the lads that I’m getting fed up with this,” said Rob Edwards, the Wolves manager. Edwardshas been in chargefor seven games, but deflation was understandable.Wolves, two down at half-time, finished the contest on top and performed with more endeavour and adventure than many visitors to Anfield. But they left with only unwanted records.Slot applauds Liverpool and Wolves fans for ‘special’ Anfield tribute to Diogo JotaRead moreAn 18th game without a win from the start of a season means Wolves eclipse Sheffield United’s 17-match winless streak in 2020-21. They are also the first top-flight team since Bolton in 1902-03 not to win any of their first 18 league games. Victory never appeared likely here, certainly not after Ryan Gravenberch and Wirtz struck in quick succession in the first half, but a second-half transformation warranted greater reward.Liverpoolhad to fight to get over the line at on an increasingly tense afternoon.“The last 10 minutes were much better than last week [at Tottenham] but that wasn’t too difficult,” said Arne Slot.Jota’s two sons, Dinis and Duarte, and other young family members were mascots for the first meeting between the late striker’s two English clubssince his deathin July. It was a lovely touch by Liverpool to involve the family so closely in proceedings though heartbreaking to see the children walk out alongside Virgil van Dijk with their mum, Jota’s widow, Rute Cardoso, watching on from the sidelines and their dad’s retired number 20 on their backs.The Liverpool captain looked after the youngsters brilliantly throughout the warm-up. Wolves supporters sang their Jota song in the 18th minute and Liverpool fans followed suit with their customary tribute in the 20th.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s Virgil van Dijk with Diogo Jota’s sons and other relatives before kick-off at Anfield.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersWolves acquitted themselves well with the 18-year-old forward Mateus Mané hugely impressive on his first start. Edwards pushed him to take a well-deserved bow in front of the away fans after the final whistle.Wirtz was the most creative talent on display and crafted the first opening with a delightful ball through to Hugo Ekitiké. Wolves’ defenders closed down the in-form striker but he managed to clip a shot against the far post.For 41 minutes José Sá was relatively untroubled in the Wolves goal. He did make a superb stop to turn an Alexis Mac Allister half volley against a post but Federico Chiesa, deputising for the suspended Dominik Szoboszlai, was offside in front of him. Anfield was getting restless, Wolves seemingly comfortable, when Liverpool carved open their opponents twice in two minutes.Jeremie Frimpong made the breakthrough when collecting Chiesa’s layoff and accelerating away from João Gomes and Hugo Bueno into the area. From the byline he pulled back a perfect assist for Gravenberch to stroke a measured finish inside Sá’s bottom left-hand corner.View image in fullscreenRyan Gravenberch fires home Liverpool’s opener four minutes before half-time.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesLiverpool doubled their advantage while Wolves were clearing their heads. Milos Kerkez regained possession and Ekitiké, having spun away from his marker, released Wirtz through a gaping hole in Wolves’ central defence. The Germany international beat the advancing Sá to the ball and poked home his first Liverpool goal in his 23rd appearance for the club. Every outfield Liverpool player made a point of swamping Wirtz as he celebrated finally breaking his duck.That should have been the cue for Liverpool to coast to victory but Wolves never resigned themselves to a 16th league defeat of a desperate campaign. Santiago Bueno reduced the deficit after Tolu Arokodare met André’s corner with a towering header and Alisson blocked on his goalline. The Wolves defender made no mistake with the rebound from close range. Another set-piece malfunction from Liverpool.The home side were vulnerable against Wolves’ positive, purposeful passing game too. One flowing move resulted in a free header for Arokodare but the unmarked forward steered his attempt over Alisson’s crossbar. Liverpool were also grateful to substitute Conor Bradley for a vital challenge on Jhon Arias when the Wolves sub looked to convert Jørgen Strand Larsen’s cross in the final moments.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The air was warm and smelled faintly of spilled pints. The chants of “One Stephen Bunting” had long since died away, and all that was left was one Stephen Bunting: three darts in his hand and no more tricks up his sleeve. No place left to run.And so as James Hurrell pinned tops to win 4-3 and claim the biggest victory of his life, there was just the merest whiff of anticlimax to it all: a seismic shock that also somehow felt like the most natural thing in the world. The crowds dispersed with barely a murmur. Hurrell packed up his darts and left the stage: not overawed or overcome, but bearing the immense calmness of a man who had seen this all coming in advance.Perhaps he was the only one who had. Certainly nothing the 41-year-old from the Cotswolds has achieved in his two years on tour suggested he was capable of this performance, on this stage, in this tournament. There was a promising run to the last 16 of the Players Championship finals last month. Some promising runs on the floor. An assured disposal of Dirk van Duijvenbode in the second round here. But he was the world No 63 for a reason.View image in fullscreenA dejected Stephen Bunting leaves the stage after his defeat by James Hurrell.Photograph: James Fearn/Getty ImagesAnd yet time and again, as Bunting pulled outstanding finishes out of thin air, as the Bullet tried to surf the familiar wave of emotion and noise that has turned far more accomplished opponents to rubble, he found Hurrell’s stout frame blocking his path, relentlessly outscoring him on the inner ring, utterly unflustered by the size of his task. In truth Hurrell destroyed the world No 4 here, outscoring him by 98 to 91 on the averages, winning 18 legs to 12, ultimately a little irritated that such a dominant performance had still required a deciding set.“Should have won four-nil,” he said afterwards, and it didn’t sound like boasting or bragging, just a statement of fact. He plays Martin Schindler or Ryan Searle for a place in the quarter-finals, but on this form he would give anyone in the world a game. “I’ve got a different mindset these days,” he said. “Not feeling no nerves or anything. I’m so confident in my game. I’m not going anywhere.”But for a while it was hard to see exactly where Hurrell was going. Eight years ago he woke in the night feeling ill and vomited blood into the sink, a symptom of the twisted bowel that would ultimately require an emergency life-saving operation and put him out of the sport for more than two years. The man who emerged on the other side of surgery was a more driven and focused player, determined to make up for lost time.Dartsis full of players like Hurrell: richly talented, quietly plugging away, biding their time, waiting for the rich vein of form that will catapult them to greatness.For Bunting, an ignominious end to a frustrating year. Brand Bunting is as strong as ever: the social media profile, the electrifying walk-on, the fans and the fame. It may yet be enough to keep his spot in next year’s Premier League. But in recent months there has also been a real fragility to him, most evident when he broke down after his second-round win over Nitin Kumar, evidence of a game and a mindset that for whatever reason were not quite right.This was a meek and fully deserved exit: still littered with micro-moments of brilliance but lacking in both consistency and conviction. He averaged just 84 in losing the first set, saved the second with a miraculous 161 finish, won the third with a 121 finish and the sixth with a 100 checkout. But eventually his well of miracles ran dry. The songs went quiet. The belief drained from the crowd, and eventually it drained from him too.View image in fullscreenLuke Littler barely gave Mensur Suljovic a look-in during a 4-0 demolition.Photograph: James Fearn/Getty ImagesBeyond Hurrell, Bunting’s exit has two main beneficiaries in the top half of the draw:Luke Littlerand Jonny Clayton. Not that the world No 1 looked in any need of help during his 4-0 demolition of Mensur Suljovic in the night’s final game. Clayton, meanwhile, is now the only remaining top-10 player in his section after coming through a nervy deciding set against the much-improved Niels Zonneveld of the Netherlands.Next Clayton will play the debutant Andreas Harrysson of Sweden, who looked extremely impressive in beating Ricardo Pietreczko of Germany 4-2. With his straggly grey beard and showman’s flourish, Harrysson is one of those cult heroes who seems to come alive on the Alexandra Palace stage. By day the 50-year-old from Målilla works in a factory making window frames. By night he toils in the dream factory, and if he beats Clayton he will automatically claim a 2026 tour card and fulfil his lifelong ambition of playing full-time professional darts.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipDartsLuke LittlernewsShareReuse this content"

A display of equal parts grit and skill byNewcastlethreatened a huge festive upset in the freezing-cold south-west, but two tries by the elusive Louis Rees-Zammit and some classically fluent attacking by Pat Lam’s buoyant team eventually enabled them to overpower their spirited visitors.After the Bears ruined Harlequins’ Christmas at Twickenham last Saturday,sticking 40 pointson the London club in Big Game 17, they were widely expected to ease to victory against the Prem’s bottom side, who were yet to muster a bonus point after seven matches. The question seemed to be not if Bristol would win, rather by how many.Jacques Vermeulen on song as Sale batter Harlequins in second halfRead moreBut the work Newcastle are doing under the head coach, Alan Dickens, now assisted by the former Wales international Stephen Jones, is beginning to bear fruit. They are on the board with an attacking bonus point for scoring four well-worked tries, including a double for the dangerous Oli Spencer.Bristoleventually scored six in response but were made to work much harder than last week at Twickenham.Newcastle were impressive in every facet of the game, particularly in the first half, with Murray McCallum crashing over to open the scoring on seven minutes. Spencer’s sensational diving score in the corner, evading the attention of Kalaveti Ravouvou, made it 10-0 and an industrious start by Dickens’ side dampened the home fans’ festive spirits.Quick GuideGloucester 21-30 Saracens: Williams shines in defeatShowMark McCall hailed Tomos Williams as a “great, great player” after the Wales international  underlined the quality that Saracens can expect by shining for Gloucester in a 30-21 Prem defeat against McCall’s team at Kingsholm. The 30-year-old British & Irish Lion created two of Gloucester’s three tries and was a constant threat in a first appearance since Saracens announced their high-profile signing on Christmas Day.“He is a great, great player,” the Saracens rugby director said of Williams (pictured laying the ball off for Arthur Clark's try). “He didn’t really have the best platform today, but everyone can see his quality every time he attacks.”Saracens ended a run of three-successive league defeats by seeing off Gloucester in bonus-point fashion. The flanker Theo McFarland inspired a first Prem win since mid-October by scoring two of his team’s four tries, while the hooker Theo Dan and the scrum-half Ivan van Zyl also crossed, with the fly-half Owen Farrell kicking two penalties and two conversions.McCall said: “Overall, it was one of our better 80-minute performances. Today was good, but we have had inconsistent days. We could have beaten Bath and we could have beaten Exeter and been in a slightly different position to where we are. Today was important because have lost a few in a row and it was important to come down here and get a result.”Gloucester had their moments – notably through first-half touchdowns for the locks Freddie Thomas and Clark, plus a late Will Knight try – with Ross Byrne converting all three scores, but they ultimately slipped to a seventh loss from eight Prem games this season. To compound Gloucester’s frustration, they lost wing Ben Loader – a pre-season signing from the South African side the Stormers – after 15 minutes of his comeback game following injury.Gloucester's rugby director, George Skivington, said: “We are creating some pressure and some good line-breaks and then just not finishing them off. That is a sign of not quite connecting – we have not quite got the experience at the moment to get across the line.“On the flipside, the boys stayed in the fight the whole game. They were desperate to try and get a losing bonus point at the end and never threw the towel in.\"PA MediaPhotograph: Dan Istitene/Getty Images EuropeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.After talk about excessive kicking it was pleasing to see Rees-Zammit, the Bears full-back, frequently sprinting from deep with ball in hand like a seasoned NFL running back. “I think full-back is his best position,” Lam said of Rees-Zammit. “You’ve got to be a great communicator, good under the high ball, you need pace – it suits our style completely for him to be at full-back. After his time in the NFL, he’s more powerful and I believe he has the ability to be a world-class full-back.”Bristol – suddenly but briefly – began to hit the right notes in attack. Rees-Zammit ran through a yawning gap in Newcastle’s defence after 20 minutes, scoring Bristol’s first try, and then fed Matías Moroni, who arrowed over the line, before Tom Jordan’s conversion took Lam’s side into the lead.No one had expected the Red Bulls to lead at half-time but Ollie Leatherbarrow’s muscular score after a fine strike move involving Elliott Obatoyinbo got them over the gain-line in the opposition 22, and it turned out to be a five-point lead at the break.View image in fullscreenElliott Obatoyinbo (right) is challenged by Bristol’s Harry Randall.Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty ImagesBrett Connon added a penalty for Newcastle soon after half-time, stretching the lead to eight, but Bristol soon tore down the right wing, offloading as they went, and Noah Heward finished off a slick score to reduce the deficit to three.Newcastle had faded badly in the round-seven defeat by Bath but if Bristol hoped the same would happen here they were disappointed. Sammy Arnold burst through the defensive line with a driving midfield run in midfield and they had the numbers on the left for Spencer to score his second try.Quick GuideBristol 36-27 Newcastle teams and scorersShowBristolRees-Zammit; Heward (Ivanishvili 74), Moroni (Lane 63), Williams, Ravouvou; Jordan (Worsley 78), Randall (Wolstenholme 57); Lahiff (Genge 44), Thacker (Oghre 44), Chawatama (Halliwell 14 (28), 58), Taylor (Rubiolo 44), Batley, Owen, Harding (capt), Mata.Yellow cardRavouvou 77.Red cardBatley 66.TriesRees-Zammit 2, Moroni, Heward, Ravouvou, Oghre.ConsJordan 2, Williams.NewcastleGrayson; Spencer, Hearle, Arnold (Hutchison 67), Obatoyinbo; Connon (Chamberlain 67), Benítez Cruz (Elliott 67); Brocklebank (Hancock 58), McGuigan (capt.)

The conversion was missed but it barely mattered: Rees-Zammit cut inside after a fizzing pass by Moroni, leaving Newcastle defenders for dead, and when Gabriel Oghre was shoved over and James Williams converted, it was a nine-point lead for Bristol.The Bears’ lock Joe Batley was sent off with 14 minutes left for a brutal ruck clear-out and Ravouvou was sent to the sin-bin inside the final five minutes for a deliberate knock-on. Newcastle made it a nervous finish. A knock-on by Cameron Hutchison ended up costing them a fifth try and a losing bonus point – and even a late crack at victory. Two points would have been nice but even five would have been deserved.“If that try had stood, we wanted to go for the win,” Dickens said. “It’s a place we like to come. The way Bristol play opens it all up, and I thought there were a lot of positives from our team today.”“To win five in a row is pleasing,” said Lam. “But I’m so pleased my old club Newcastle has got great financial input with Red Bull. The place is just going to get better and better … you can see everyone there is fighting for contracts and fighting to be involved.”Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbyBristolNewcastleRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Well, not quite the team.Northamptonrung the changes for this match, but the understudies proved the stars of the show to terrorise their hosts. Six tries, a hat-trick for Tommy Freeman and the lead, no less, of the Prem for good measure.The bookies gave Northampton a 20-point head start for this one. In the end it wasBathwho needed it. Bath were at full strength, the Saints some way short of it, but this will surely prove one of the performances of the season.Bristol survive scare but Newcastle off the mark in Prem as Spencer seals bonusRead more“I’m lost for words,” Freeman said. “There’s been a lot of rotation and a lot of people wrote us off, but we just wanted to leave nothing out there and take every opportunity.”If only they had been allowed to. Northampton were unlucky not to have won by more, after three tries were ruled out, a couple of them very harshly.Both sides had changed 10 players from their comfortable wins last weekend, but Bath had strengthened their side, while Northampton left a host of first-teamers at home. The Saints are the sort of club whose backup players thrive in this environment. Hard, flexible and above all smart, they seemed to relish their underdog status.The scores were level at the break, but that was something of a travesty, what with those disallowed tries. Freeman, making his first Prem start since October, was selected at outside centre and scored the first try in only the third minute, picking a superb line off an attacking lineout to stroll over in style. Which was when the officials turned nasty.View image in fullscreenTommy Freeman goes on the attack against Bath.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesFrom the restart, Joe Cokanasiga seemed to tap the ball back. Rory Hutchinson – the epitome of hard, flexible and smart – controlled it expertly to send Edoardo Todaro away. But during the Italy wing’s run-in the touch judge told the referee, Craig Maxwell-Keys, that Cokanasiga’s tap-back was actually a Northampton knock-on. Maxwell-Keys blew his whistle before the try was scored. A shame they did not wait and then check, because replays suggested the touch judge’s call was wrong.Bath set up a sustained attack from the resultant scrum, and Thomas du Toit was cleverly worked over from a tapped penalty a few minutes later. A 14-0 lead to the visitors thus became 7-7. And then 14-7, when Tom Dunn went over from a second lineout to the corner, in the 15th minute.Quick GuideGloucester 21-30 Saracens: Williams shines in defeatShowMark McCall hailed Tomos Williams as a “great, great player” after the Wales international  underlined the quality that Saracens can expect by shining for Gloucester in a 30-21 Prem defeat against McCall’s team at Kingsholm.

Early in the second quarter, Northampton, down to 14 after a yellow card for Ed Prowse from a head collision, struck again. Archie McParland found a gap round the fringes and ran to the posts. The excellent Anthony Belleau, in for Fin Smith, landed the conversion to equalise.Northampton thought they had scored again before the break. Belleau turned the ball inside to George Hendy to launch Freeman at the posts. Callum Chick touched down in the follow-up, but the TMO drew attention to a marginal call at the previous ruck. Whether Beno Obano was impeded in defence of the ruck is a moot point. He did not seem to be aware of it himself.The pattern continued into the second half. Bath scored a third try – Du Toit again, from a tapped penalty again – and Northampton had a third disallowed. Hutchinson’s try was awarded initially. This time the TMO rightly drew attention to the fact Hutchinson was inches short.Quick GuideBath 21-41 Northampton teams and scorersShowBathDe Glanville (Carreras 57); Cokanasiga, Lawrence, Ojomoh (Harris 31), Arundell; Russell, Spencer (capt; Carr-Smith 72); Obano (Van Wyk 57), Dunn (Frost 65), Du Toit (Griffin 65), Roux (Hill 57), Molony, Bayliss (Pepper 57), Underhill, Reid.Yellow cardFrost 66.TriesDu Toit 2, Dunn.ConsRussell 3.NorthamptonHendy; Todaro, Freeman, Hutchinson (Lumley 77), Ramm (Sleightholme 74); Belleau, McParland (James 77); Iyogun, Smith (Walker 67), Davison (Millar Mills 62), Prowse, Munga, Chick (capt), Graham, Pollock.Yellow cardProwse 13.TriesFreeman 3, McParland, Pollock 2.ConsBelleau 4.PenBelleau.RefereeCraig Maxwell-KeysWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Thereafter, the Saints were anything but short. They were imperious. Bath twisted and turned in the storm of running rugby unleashed about them for the final half an hour. Freeman had his second after more sumptuous approach play, before Henry Pollock scored the bonus-point try in spectacular style. Henry Arundell was somehow forced to spill the ball on the attack by Chick, the Saints’ understated captain, and Hendy was away on the counter, finding their less understated back-row forward in support.Bath fell away. Pollock was over again, from an attacking lineout with 15 minutes to play, before Freeman’s coup de grace. At the end of more free-flowing rugby, Freeman almost taunted Cokanasiga, standing up the former England wing and restating his own credentials as the current one.Imperious is the word.

In 2025, she has reached three of the four grand slam finals, winning her fourth major titleat the US Openand further positioning herself as a generational great. From her humble origins as a volatile, one-note ball-basher, the 27-year-old has admirably evolved into an increasingly complete player. Sabalenka is the best player in the world for a second year in succession.The fleeting tennis off-season is usually an opportunity for players and spectators alike to reflect on such great feats before the new season is upon them. This year, however, the December discourse has been derailed by the fast-approaching train wreck Sabalenka stands at the heart of.BBC showing tennis’s new Battle of the Sexes will just offer up opportunity to belittle women’s sport | Barney RonayRead moreOn Sunday, Sabalenka, the world No 1 in women’s tennis, will play againstNick Kyrgiosin an exhibition match in Dubai that has been billed as the Battle of the Sexes. At the end of many weeks of promotion from both players, it remains on track to being one of the most inane tennis events ever conceived.It is not difficult to see why this match would be appealing to Kyrgios, who over the past three years has had an unending string of injuries, playing just six official matches during this period. At 30 years old, it is unclear whether he will be able to return to the tour in any consistent or competitive manner. He is evidently here to earn as much money as he can, while he still can.Sabalenka’s participation in this event is far more noteworthy and disappointing. Since the announcement of the exhibition Sabalenka, Kyrgios and their camp have countered the subsequent criticism by asserting that this should be viewed solely as lighthearted entertainment that will be greatly beneficial for the sport, driving greater interest in tennis and reaching audiences that may not be interested in its regular competitive formats.At the same time, however, it has been marketed by cynically using the challenges faced by women’s sports as engagement bait. Sabalenka has claimed that the contest will “bring women’s tennis to a higher level” and she has also referenced Billie Jean King’s 1973 win over the former player Bobby Riggs to immense fanfare in one of the original Battle of the Sexes bouts, a seminal moment for women’s sports that played an instrumental role in changing attitudes to female athletes.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka reached three grand slam finals in 2025 and triumphed at the US Open.Photograph: Yuki Iwamura/APRegardless of the result, this event is an own goal for Sabalenka and women’s tennis. There is nothing at all to learn from it. A top female player cannot be competitive with a top male player and the audience will not believe any scenario where they are. However, women’s tennis is still already a tremendous sport responsible for some of the greatest athletes ever seen. The sport does need more attention and eyes, but that should be on its countless great competitive performances and unforgettable personalities.The last thing women’s tennis needs is more tired discussions questioning equal prize money, which will never change, and women playing best-of-five-sets matches – topics this event is sure to invite. The position of No 1 in the WTA, the leader of the biggest women’s sport in the world, has always been of great symbolism and importance. Sabalenka has used the position she has earned to open up the floor for people to trash her sport.The buildup of this event has been even more grim than anticipated. In early December, Sabalenka and Kyrgios were interviewed by Piers Morgan and the discussion soon turned to thesubject of trans women in professional tennis, with Sabalenka rebuking the presence of trans women in the sport. Her comments made global headlines.View image in fullscreenNick Kyrgios has played a handful of matches in recent years and it is unclear if he will return to the tour in any consistent or competitive manner.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAThere are zero trans women on the WTA Tour. A far more relevant and pressing issue is the misogyny that female players continue to face on a daily basis from figures both outside and within the sport. Sabalenka chose to make statements claiming to protect women’s sport ahead of an exhibition that she insists will help it while sitting shoulder to shoulder with Kyrgios, a man who pleaded guilty to assaulting his ex-girlfriend, had to distance himself from Andrew Tate after reposting the proud misogynist on social media and who has faced accusations of sexist remarks involving female players, such as Anna Kalinskaya and Donna Vekic.There is no denying the attention this has generated. The event has been picked up by the BBC and Sabalenka was ushered on to the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, a stage usually only accessible to tennis players immediately after a US Open triumph. It would not be a surprise to see the Dubai Coca-Cola Arena’s 17,000 seats mostly filled.However, attention isn’t always positive. This exhibition is nothing more than a cynical attempt to fabricate controversy to benefit the bank accounts of both the players and all other entities involved. It is an event truly of its era, a time when influencers generate more money for their celebrity boxing bouts than many of the best fighters in the world. No serious figure really believes that Jake Paul leveraging his celebrity to earn untold millionsby fighting Anthony Joshuaora 58-year-old Mike Tysonis actually good for boxing, just as no serious figure should believe that this event has any sort of noble cause. Sabalenka and Kyrgios are both represented by the same agency, Evolve, and they all stand to gain handsomely.2025 was one of the best women’s tennis seasons in recent memory, driven by performances from Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek but with a supreme supporting cast including Coco Gauff, Amanda Anisimova, Elena Rybakina and Madison Keys, players who have made life incredibly difficult for the top two and provoked numerous spectacular matches. As always, the best way to understand the greatness of women’s tennis is to watch women’s tennis.Explore more on these topicsTennisAryna SabalenkaNick KyrgioscommentShareReuse this content"

His mount was a little free behind the pace on the first circuit, and despite his big weight and the distance still left to travel, Bowen did not hesitate to allow him to stride on into the lead.Haiti Couleurs did not see another rival from there, and there were definite echoes of Native River’s front-running performance under a similar burden in this race in 2016, 15 months before his Gold Cup victory, as the eight-year-old powered clear with O’Connell turning for home and then held him at bay with an unflinching gallop from two out.This was the second “National” win of Haiti Couleurs’ career after his success in the Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse in April, and the initial reaction from bookmakers was to cut his price to complete a Grand National treble at Aintree in the spring.Paddy Power make him a 14-1 chance (from 20-1) for the world’s most famous steeplechase, but he also has a Cheltenham festival win on his record in the National Hunt Challenge Cup last season – a race in which Native River finished second in his novice season – and the 33-1 about Curtis’s gelding for the Gold Cup might not last long if it is confirmed as a target.View image in fullscreenSean Bowen steers Haiti Couleurs to victory in the Welsh Grand National at Chepstow.Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty ImagesFrom Curtis’s point of view, though, talk of Cheltenham and Aintree can wait. Like Bowen, she was winning her “home” National for the first time, and it was an impressive training performance to get Haiti Couleurs back to his relentless best after a disappointing run in the Betfair Chase last time out.“I’m absolutely delighted to get him back, I was upset about Haydock and I knew he was still a very good horse,” Curtis said. “He’s done that so well and aggressively today, he outclassed them and was back to his very best. Sean said he had to go to the front as he couldn’t hold him, and when he’s like that, you know he’s back to his best.“I’m Welsh, Sean’s Welsh and most of my staff are and it’s a really prestigious race we have wanted to win for many years.”Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday tipsShowLeicester12.05 Roi Du Risk 12.37 Kapamazov 1.12 Casa Loupi 1.47 Two To Tango 2.22 Jhentong Enki 2.57 Heeztheboy (nap) 3.32 Gentleman TobootCatterick Bridge12.18 Bravethewaves 12.53 Ballyeaston 1.28 Classical Sting 2.03 Ninna Collina 2.38 Redbridge Rambler 3.13 CamarrateSouthwell1.00 Cerelia 1.35 Ziggy’s Angel 2.10 Raging Raj 2.45 Bowfell 3.20 Hunky Dory 3.50 Sax Appeal 4.20 Toolatetonegotiate (nb) 4.50 Mr NuggetWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Bowen was touched off aboard Banbridge in the thrilling finish to Friday’s King George at Kempton, but a first victory in Saturday’s race was decent compensation for the runaway leader in the National Hunt riders’ title race.“It means so much,” Bowen said. “These are the races you want to win and to do it on a Welsh-trained horse for a Welsh trainer is special.“Becky actually used to babysit me a bit as a kid, so to do it for Becky is a bit like doing it for family, so that was amazing.

And when people talk past one another there are real-world consequencesSat 27 Dec 2025 14.00 ESTShareThe14 December Bondi Beach attacktargeting Jews at a Hanukah celebration has brought the issue of antisemitism into sharp national focus. In response, the New South Wales government announced measures to further curb hate speech and symbols, and, more controversially, new protest powers. This event and the government’s response have once again raised questions about the relationship between Jews, Israel, Zionism and anti-Zionism.Zionism is a Jewish national movement that sought to create a Jewish state, then to secure and sustain it. But “Zionism” is also a contested label: for many Jews it signifies safety, continuity and belonging; for Palestinians – and for many others – it denotes dispossession and ongoing domination. It’s clear that for different people, the word Zionism means very different things, which leads to people talking past one another – with real-world consequences.Originating in the late 19th century as a movement for Jewish national self-determination, Zionism was founded in response to the increase of a modern form of Jew-hatred grounded in pseudo-science and conspiracy theories, and the rise of European national movements seeking their independence. Early Zionists argued that the only solution for the precarious status of Jews as a perennially persecuted minority in Europe was through the establishment of a Jewish state.From the beginning of mass Jewish migration from Europe to Ottoman and MandatePalestine, the Zionist project collided with the fact of a majority Palestinian Arab population, engaged in building its own national movement. Zionism comprised a spectrum of political positions, including socialist, liberal, religious and militaristic and revisionist strands. Within these movements, there were internal arguments about the nature of the future state and the place of Arabs and Palestinians within it.In the nearly 130 years since the founding of the Zionist movement, the meaning of the term has continually evolved. The Holocaust, the 1948 war that accompanied Israel’s establishment, and the mass displacement of Palestinians (known by Palestinians as the Nakba, or the Catastrophe) reshaped what “Zionism” meant in practice. Since 1967 Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and its control over Gaza, alongside ongoing settlement expansion in the Palestinian territories, have made the term even more contested.Today many Jews see Zionism as a modern continuation of the centuries-old yearning for connection with the land of Israel, which is deeply rooted in Jewish history and liturgy. A commonly held view is that the state of Israel is necessary to protect Jews around the world from the possibility of ongoing persecution. This connection to Israel and support for Jewish self-determination are central to Zionist Jews’ sense of what it means to be Jewish.There is no consensus though on what that self-determination ought to look like, and Zionism has always encompassed a spectrum of meanings. Many Zionists advocate for a democratic Jewish state to sit alongside a democratic Palestinian state. Many are deeply critical of, even hostile to, the current Israeli government. At the extreme end of the spectrum are ultranationalists – including members of the Israeli cabinet – who reject Palestinian statehood and who advocate for annexation of the Palestinian territories and to entrench permanent unequal rights between Jews and Palestinians.For Palestinians and critics of Zionism the term signals displacement, inequality and the ongoing suffering of Palestinians since the establishment of the Israeli state. To them, the cost of Jewish statehood has been too great and the impact on Palestinians too devastating. Many describe it as settler colonialism; many as a system of oppression and unequal rights.For Jews who oppose Zionism, the role of statehood runs counter to their self-understanding of what it means to be Jewish.Many people arrive at their views from sincere commitments, whether to Jewish safety and continuity or to Palestinian freedom and equality. That does not mean all political programs are equally defensible, especially those that deny other peoples their basic rights. But it does highlight the problem with language that treats “Zionists” as collectively violent or subhuman, whether through labelling all Zionists as terrorists and genocidal maniacs, or claims that Australian Jews are legitimate targets because of their attachment to Israel. Similarly, we ought not dismiss all pro-Palestinian protesters as antisemites or Jew-haters.Findings from the Gen17 Australian Jewish community survey – conducted in 2017 to be replicated in 2026 as the Gen26 survey – found that 69% of Australian Jews identified as Zionist, 22% did not and about 10% didn’t know or declined to answer. Among those who do not identify as Zionist, there are a growing number of Jewish bodies opposing Zionism and who are in tension with the more established Jewish community bodies.Because Zionism carries multiple and often conflicting interpretations, recognising this diversity is essential to fostering informed dialogue, empathy and intellectual honesty. Understanding Jewish intergenerational trauma and the trauma Palestinians carry from decades of occupation would make the conversation harder to weaponise and easier to humanise. And recognising the historical, religious and cultural significance of the land to both Jews and Palestinians will help us to have a more robust public conversation.Recognising this diversity of thought and the humanity of those who hold those beliefs, we ought to draw a clear distinction between debating the merits of Zionism as an idea and harassing, doxxing or physically attacking those who identify as Zionist. In Australian public debate, “Zionist” is often used as a political descriptor. But it is also sometimes used as a stand‑in for “Jew”, which is where political argument turns into antisemitic targeting.It is possible for critics of Israel to argue that Jewish statehood has caused profound harm to Palestinians, while still recognising that targeting people because they are Jewish, or because of their political or cultural attachments, crosses a line from legitimate political disagreement into bigotry. The reverse is also true: defending the right of Jews to hold Zionist beliefs does not require endorsing every action or government of the Israeli state.David Slucki is the director of the Australian Centre for Jewish Civilisation at Monash University, where he leads the Monash Initiative for Rapid Research intoAntisemitism.

The event will be staged as part of National Poverty in America Awareness Month, the time every year when charities document the number of US residents surviving on low incomes.Of course, the president will do no such thing, preferring to summon the press to watch him rub shoulders with the billionaire class as he did at last month’s black tiedinner for the Saudi rulerand his entourage.Trump can be expected to ignore calls for policies to reduce poverty and to dismiss the annual awareness campaign, leaving him unencumbered by any guilt that past presidents might have felt looking in the mirror and seeing Louis XIV starring back at them.US poverty levels matter in the UK and across continental Europe because the rising level of poverty in the States –a trend that dates back to the turn of the century– is the direct result of a particular form of capitalism that increasingly popular rightwing parties say should be adopted.Nigel Farage’s Reform UK and Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives laud the US, but seem to care little about how it promotes a style of capitalism that leaves millions of people on the side of the road, injured in one way or another, allowing the rest to work, spend and save without a thought for the less fortunate.You couldn’t have an opioid crisis in Europe in the way that hashappened in the US. You couldn’t have thescale of mental health crisis, or high levels of obesity or poverty. Even after years of austerity across Europe, the level of government intervention in the US remains so much lower.And more cinematically, the US also exports its financial crashes around the world, knowing that the cost to itself is a fraction of the repair job faced by countries that care about their people.If you feel any responsibility to the environment or to those who have fallen by the wayside, there is an easy path to lower taxes and low levels of regulation.It’s worth remembering this when you next read about how Europe’s economy only inches ahead each year, with the UK not far in front.A kinder nation, one that takes ordinary people’s views into account, is going to grow at a more measured pace, by definition. Regulation that prevents financial crashes might slow the adoption of whizzy new financial products, but pays dividends should the worst be prevented or the effect minimised. Again, it should be remembered that since 1929, it is reckless US governments that have exported financial chaos, not the more careful custodians of UK or European financial centres.For those who think there must still be a way to grow at a faster pace, there are countless reports about how UK and European governments could do a better job.Mario Draghi, the former Italian prime minister and ex-head of the European Central Bank, provided acomprehensive critiqueof Europe’s lack of growth and provided remedies, most of them involving further integration.Draghi is no socialist, but his effort was socialistic. Taken in the round, his reforms were designed to pay for a large and munificent state.Farage and Badenoch are unsurprisingly resistant to the ideas that underpin Draghi’s report and the lesson from the US is that European markets are not integrated enough.They prefer to take other lessons from the US. That financial markets should be set free, that monopolies are fine if it drives investment. And the poor and unhealthy should understand that it is most likely to be their own fault and for that reason can only expect the most rudimentary support from the state.It seems from studies of the modern electorate that older people are the most susceptible to the Farage/Badenoch argument. The only aspect of the state that is sacred is the health service – for obvious reasons.Everything else can be sacrificed to prevent the state from demanding more in tax from its citizens. The AfD in Germany, the National Rally in France and Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party all subscribe to the same philosophy.In the UK, there is a clear correlation between those over 60 and those voting with frustration and anger to destroy the society created by older voters.Without acknowledging the link to far-right parties on the continent and Trump’s White House, it is baby boomers who are coming out in favour of low regulation, a finance industry free to do its worst and leaving charity to look after the least well-off.Those with more progressive views are in a minority in this age group.The government should make the case for gradualism and how it protects most people. It guards against disaster and, when disaster strikes, has the capacity to offer support where it is needed. It builds resilience.The US casts its least fortunate aside in the most callous way. It’s true that it always has. But these days, its colossal wealth and income make that unnecessary.Explore more on these topicsBusinessViewpoint columnDonald TrumpUS economyEuropeEconomicsPovertycommentShareReuse this content"

In January, recording his podcast in a studio in Austin, Texas, the host, Joe Rogan, and the actor Mel Gibsonmerrily dissed climate science. At the same time, about 1,200 miles away in California, Gibson’s $14mhome was being incineratedin the Palisades wildfire. In this and other respects, their discussion could be seen as prefiguring the entire 12 months.The loss of his house hadn’t been confirmed at the time of the interview, but Gibson said his son had just sent him “a video of my neighbourhood, and it’s in flames. It looks like an inferno.” According to World Weather Attribution, January’s fires in California were madesignificantly more likelyby climate breakdown. Factors such as the extreme lack of rainfall and stronger winds made such fires both more likely to happen and more intense than they would have been without human-caused global heating.View image in fullscreenMel Gibson.Photograph: Albert L Ortega/REX/ShutterstockThere’s a widespread belief that people will wake up to climate breakdown when disasters affect them. It’s equivalent to the claim that “there were no atheists in the trenches” of the first world war (if you believe this, you haven’t read Siegfried Sassoon’s Memoirs of a Fox-hunting Man:“Standing in that dismal ditch, I could find no consolation in the thought that Christ was risen”). For some people, disaster seems to provoke adoubling down. If your entire worldview is challenged by events, it’s tempting to conclude the events are at fault.Halfway through the interminable interview, Gibson, while disputing evolution, launched a typically detailed attack on the scientific method. “Yeah, well, there’s a lot of money in, you know, claims, and I don’t know.” Anyway, he mused: “What difference is it going to make to me?” Then he suddenly swerved to climate science, and started reciting one of the oldest denialist tropes.“Ever have a glass full of ice and watch it melt? Did you ever see the glass flow over?” “No.” “Takes up less room, you know.” In reality, sea levels are rising not because sea ice is melting, but through thethermal expansion of seawater, and meltwater flowing off the land. But Rogan happily took up the theme. “Well, there’s a lot of horseshit that’s involved in climate change for sure … a narrative gets established and then there’s a profit attached to the solution.” He referred toa studyhe has sincecited repeatedly, claiming it shows “the temperature on Earth is plummeting”. As the authors keep pointing out,it shows the opposite. But that seems to make no difference.View image in fullscreenThe ruins of Mel Gibson’s home, destroyed in wildfires in Los Angeles, January 2025.Photograph: MEGA/GC ImagesSo what did they blame for the fires? Mostly Gavin Newsom, governor of California. Rogan remarked: “How crazy it is that they spent $24bn last year on the homeless, and what do they spend on preventing these wildfires?” “Zero.” “Zip.” “He didn’t do anything.” Needless to say, this is completely untrue: Californiatripled its wildfire resiliencespending between 2016 and 2024. The true figure it spent on homelessness in 2024-25 was$2.5bn. But who gives a damn? Here we see another of the grand themes of 2025: everything is now a partisan issue, and no fact can stand in the way of polarisation.This became even starker when they turned to one of Rogan’s favourite themes, the former US chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci, who has beenwidely and unjustly blamedby the radical right for a remarkable range of ills, fromAids deathsto the Covid pandemic. Rogan suggested Fauci’s actions were “evil”. In response, Gibson said something to the tens of millions of listeners that, in Fauci’s position, I would find highly threatening: “Well, I don’t know why Fauci’s still walking around.” “How is that guy still walking around?” Rogan echoed.This theme led to another of the year’s motifs: the whining self-pity of powerful men. Talking of Robert F Kennedy Jr’swildly inaccuratebook The Real Anthony Fauci, Rogan remarked: “They kept that book off bestseller lists … they hid it. That’s when you find out that bestseller lists are actually curated.” “Yeah,” Gibson replied, “it’s censored. It’s all censored. Everything’s censored.” In truth, depressingly enough, Kennedy’s rubbish book spent 20 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list.Alongside their dismissal of science-based medicine was the usual catalogue of quack cures. Gibson claimed that he had “holes” in his head, which he appeared to suggest were caused by PTSD. But he was given “a very miraculous and great remedy for it which was to eat a bunch of fish oil, vitamin B complex and get into a hyperbaric chamber for 40 sessions”. Rogan asserted that hyperbaric chambers are “phenomenal for … everything”, and can “decrease your biological age”. He gave no warning ofthe dangers, which can be very great. The two men promotedivermectin,fenbendazole, “hydrochloride something or other” andmethylene blueas cancer cures:prematureand irresponsible claims that could causegreat harm. But all very Maha.Early in the interview, Rogan asked Gibson what he would do if his house had indeed burnt down. “Oh, I don’t know,” Gibson replied. “I got a place in Costa Rica. I love it there … it’s in a real nice spot.” For the very rich, it sometimes seems, even the consequences have no consequences.It now appears that Gibson has decided torebuild his house. While I feel bad for the loss of his belongings, his ability to start again contrasts with the position of many poorer California residentsdisplaced by fire, some of whom might have swelled the ranks of thehomeless. Gibson appeared to agree with Rogan that the state should not be spending so much on them.For now, the very rich have options. They can rebuild or move somewhere they haven’t yet wrecked, while others languish in places that might come to look like the set of Mad Max, with which, of course, Gibson is not unfamiliar. Those who rack up vast impacts then walk away, and those who spread misinformation freeload on the rest of us. They are always leaving other people to live with the consequences.There was, however, one thing Gibson said that hit home. It was while he was dismissing evolution, and claiming that everything was “ordered” by God: “I think anything left to itself without some kind of intelligence behind it will devolve into chaos.” It could be seen as a warning for our times.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsClimate science scepticism and denialOpinionClimate scienceMel GibsonJoe RoganClimate crisisInequalityHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a typical self-empowerment manual in which the pair expound on the secrets of entrepreneurial success while drawing on their personal experiences. At one point,they write: “Building a brand may be more important than building a business.”That was certainly Trump’s approach to business: he was theNew Yorkreal estate tycoon who turned his fame into a brand that symbolized luxury and savvy strategy – even if his companies filed forbankruptcy six times. Trump spent decades trying to use his name to turn a profit: he owned an airline and a university, and slapped his moniker on vodka, steaks, neckties, board games and even bottled water. Leveraging the fame he gained from the Apprentice TV show, he expanded to licensing Trump-branded global real estate projects built by other developers. In many of these ventures, Trump collected licensing fees, rather than investing his own money, ensuring that he profited even if thebusinesses collapsed.Today, Trump is using the US presidency as the ultimate branding opportunity. In his second term, he’s slapping his name on as many buildings, monuments and government projects as he can. Last week, Trump’sname was addedto the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which has served as a “living memorial” to the assassinated president since it opened in 1971. The institution was renamed by its board of trustees, a majority of whom were installed by Trump early this year after he appointed himselfas the center’s chairand purged its board.The year in patriarchy: Taylor Swift, Trump 2.0 and the Epstein files | Arwa MahdawiRead moreBut the Kennedy Center was named after JFK by anact of Congressin 1964, a year after his assassination, and Democrats argue that the center’s board does not have the power to rename it the Trump Kennedy Center. Still, the center’s trustees ploughed ahead and dispatched workers to installnew signagelast Friday, adding Trump’s name (in large capital letters) to the building’s exterior.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, tried to spin the rebranding as a boon for both Kennedy and Trump’s legacies, writingin a post on X: “This will be a truly great team long into the future! The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur.” But by grafting his name on to the center – and stacking it above Kennedy’s, no less – Trump is not honoring JFK’s legacy; he is colonizing the assassinated president’s memory.Before setting his sights on the Kennedy Center, Trump had already gone on a rebranding spree in Washington DC and across government programs. The state departmentadded his nameto the US Institute of Peace near the National Mall, while the Trump administration unveiled a new government website,TrumpRx.gov, where Americans can shop for lower-priced medications, and announced that new savings accounts for millions of children will be called “Trump accounts”.In October, the US treasurer, Brandon Beach, confirmed that his agencyhad drafteddesigns for $1 coins featuring images of Trump to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the US’s independence next year. And earlier this month, the National Park Serviceadded Trump’s birthdayon 14 June, which coincides with Flag Day, to its list of free-admission days for US residents at national parks. (The park service also eliminated its policy of not charging admission on Martin Luther King Jr Day and the emancipation celebration of Juneteenth, which are both federal holidays, unlike the president’s birthday.)For Trump, a building (or a warship) without his name on it is a missed chance to expand his brandTrump continued his self-aggrandizement binge this week: on Monday, he announced a plan for the US navy tobuild a new generationof massive vessels that will be called “Trump class” warships. Flanked by military officials at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, the president showed offthree posterswith the potential design of a new Trump-class battleship called the USS Defiant. Trump and Pentagon officials said they expected two battleships, which could costup to $15bn each, to be constructed over the next few years. And they said the US would eventually build up to 20 vessels as part of a “golden fleet” that will carry hypersonic weapons, high-powered lasers and nuclear-armed cruise missiles – all technologies that are still under development by the navy.At Monday’s announcement, John Phelan, the navy secretary, used plenty of superlatives to please Trump while describing the warship that will bear his name,sayingit “will be the largest, deadliest, most versatile and best-looking warship anywhere on the world’s oceans”.He added: “Our adversaries will know, when the Trump-class USS Defiant appears on the horizon, American victory at sea is inevitable.”But does the US navy need such massive and expensive ships, especially to confront adversaries like China, which relies on alarge fleetof smaller and cost-effective vessels? Some experts doubt the US warships will be effective, even if they can overcome seriousdesign flawsthat could prevent them from being built at all. By reviving an obsolete class of warship, Trump wants the US military to builda weapon with little strategic purpose other than to carry his name across the oceans.The president’s sycophants will find new ways to justify his narcissistic and authoritarian actions, even as Trump continues to expand his power and dismantle many of the safeguards put in place after the Watergate scandal that forced Richard Nixon toresign the presidencyin 1974. For a sitting president to order the construction of a fleet named after himself is unprecedented in US history. It aligns Trump less with George Washington and more with Kaiser Wilhelm II, the last German emperor who obsessed over building a powerful navy that would reflect his personal grandeur and abdicated his throne after Germany’s defeat in the first world war.But Trump is not swayed by history, or the actions of past presidents who refrained from slapping their names on everything within reach, especially while in office. In 2018, when Trump visited Mount Vernon during his first term, he seemed unable to grasp why Washington, the first US president, did not name his estate in Virginia after himself. “If he was smart, he would’ve put his name on it,” Trump said of Washington, according to areport in Politico. “You’ve got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you.”For Trump, a building (or a warship) without his name on it is a missed chance to expand his brand or, worse, the mark of a loser who doesn’t know how to take full advantage of his leverage. Nearly a year into his second term, Trump is busy establishing monuments to himself – and daring anyone to stop him from exploiting his presidential branding opportunity.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionRepublicansUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But that is where I would like our relationship to endSat 27 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 27 Dec 2025 12.34 ESTShareWhen I buy something online, I don’t want to receive more than two emails: one to confirm my order has been received, and another to tell me when it will be delivered. The numerous notifications we receive while browsing, buying and then waiting for delivery are presumably meant to be reassuring. But since when is harassment reassuring?Imagine a world in which the second you walk into a shop, someone taps you on the shoulder and asks: “Can I help you today?” Then someone asks for your email address in exchange for a 5% discount. When you find what you are looking for and place it in your basket, this instigates more nuisance. “Hurry! Twenty-one other people have this in their basket too!” Of course 21 other people have this in their basket, it’s shower gel and a significant number of people shower. This doesn’t make you rush. It makes you thrilled that the consensus remains in favour of personal hygiene. You wander around the shop a bit more. Someone grabs your arm. “There is still an item in your basket. Don’t forget to check out!”At the till, there are more questions. “Do you want to give us your information, or check out as a guest?” You check out as a guest. People are meant to be kind to guests. But, after paying, someone screams into your face. “Sign up to this third-party website that has nothing to do with the store and get £15 CASHBACK!!!!!” It couldn’t sound more nefarious. You race out of the shop, pursued by a final assailant. “How did we do? Please rate our service from one to 5!”The bus ride home is no quieter. The driver remarkably announces: “Your item has been dispatched.” An old man next to you nudges your ribs and sagely whispers into your ear: “Your item is on its way.”When you make it home you are greeted by someone who has broken into your house to tell you: “Your item has arrived!” They then run off. They have stolen nothing but your time.At least it is all over. Your transaction is complete. You get into the shower and the cascading water brings you peace at last. Until you read the request that has been etched into the steam on the bathroom mirror. “Please review your purchase!”You do not. Because it is a toiletry item. It was made by a multinational conglomerate, not Andrew Lloyd Webber. And you are tired.Please. If you are a retailer, and you are reading this – leave me alone.Athena Kugblenu is a comedian and writerExplore more on these topicsShops and shoppingThe hill I will die onRetail industryInternetcommentShareReuse this content"

Instead, we had to make do withKaty Perryspending 11 minutes on the edge of space as part of Blue Origin’s all-female crewed mission. Perrypromisedus all that, in service of women’s empowerment, the crew would “put the ‘ass’ in astronaut” and “make space and science glam”. Truly, one giant leap for womankind!Space may have got glam, but it was another glum year for many on Earth. The war in Ukraine continued, with increasing numbers of womenvolunteering to fight. The civil war in Sudan raged on, with the UN urging the worldnot to ignoreharrowing details of targeted sexual violence, torture, and abductions from the region. The slaughter in Sudan is so extreme that the blood can even be seen fromspace. Although I’m not sure the billionaires and celebs doing celestial joyrides in their expensive rockets are particularly bothered by that view.Meanwhile, a ceasefire was supposedly brokered in Gaza in October. But, as the past few months have made clear, it is effectively a ceasefire in name only: thegenocide, mediablackoutand aid blockade continue.Malnutritionremains rampant, particularly among children and pregnant and breastfeeding women. Babies who aren’t starving arefreezingto death.Over in the US, a year of Trump 2.0 has had a devastating impact on human rights protections at home and around the world. One of Donald Trump’sfirst actsas president was to reinstate the Global Gag Rule, which restricts aid from going to any groups that provide abortion services or advocate for abortion rights. The year also saw sustained attacks on access tobirth controlandabortion pillsin the US. Even a woman’s right to vote is now beingquestionedby some prominent Maga members.In fluffier news, Taylor Swift gotengagedto football star Travis Kelce, a man who once joked he needed to find “abreeder”. Kim Kardashian released apubic hair thongand failed the bar exam. (Or rather, the Washington Post opined, the bar examfailed her.) Sydney Sweeney got everyone talking about her “great genes” – but failed to get fans to show up for hermediocreChristy Martin biopic. Sabrina Carpenter sparked adebateon sex-positive feminism. And an awful lot of Maga women have apodcastnow, as well as exactly the sameMar-a-Lago face.And that’s just a snippet of a very exhausting 2025. To wrap things up, here aresix-sevenmemorable moments from the year in patriarchy. And six-seven is my brainrot, slightlyrage baitway of saying 12.1. A brain-dead woman in Georgia was used as a human incubatorAdriana Smith was almostnine weekspregnant when she fell ill and was declared medically brain dead. Under Georgia’s strict laws, abortion is banned after about six weeks of pregnancy and Smith waskept aliveto carry on the pregnancy, without any regard for what her family wanted and despite doctors noting the chances of her delivering a healthy newborn were very small. The newborn, called Chance, was delivered prematurely in June. As of early December, Chance wasstill in a hospital Nicu, unable to breathe on his own.2. The Trump administration let tens of millions worth of contraceptives go to wasteAfter the Trump administration brought in new laws that prohibit sending US aid to organizations associated with abortion services, the state department decided to let contraceptives valued atbetween $10m and $40mexpire rather than send them abroad to women in need. The Center for Reproductive Rights has said the loss of these contraceptives “could result in more than a million unintended pregnancies and thousands of maternal deaths”.3. Italy recognized the crime of femicideIn November, Italy’s parliament approved a law, backed by the conservative government of Giorgia Meloni, thatmade femicide a crime. It is one of veryfewcountries in the world to specifically classify every murder of a woman that is motivated by her gender as femicide.4. French parliament voted to add consent to rape lawThis historic move waspromptedby outrage over the mass rape ofGisèle Pelicot.5.Sanae Takaichibecame Japan’s first female prime ministerNot exactly progress considering the ultra-conservative politician, whocites Margaret Thatcheras an influence, then appointedjust two womento her 19-member cabinet.6. Thailand andLiechtenstein recognized same-sex marriageAfter a very long struggle by activists, Thailand became thefirst countryin south-east Asia to recognize equal marriage. In Europe, Liechtenstein’s marriage equality bill (passed in 2024) took effect.7. The REDACTED REDACTED Epsteinfiles got releasedWhile running for president in 2024, Trumppromisedto declassify the Epstein files. Funnily enough, he didn’t quite make good on that. For most of the year, the president tried, unsuccessfully, to get people to stop talking about what he termed a “Democratic hoax”. Finally, in December, a bipartisan push forced him to release a tranche of documents. The only problem was the “most transparent” administration in history redacted most of it. While we have learned afew new thingsabout how Jeffrey Epstein operated and who he associated with, justice still has not been even remotely served. Trumpmassively over-promisingand under-delivering? Who would have guessed it!8. The Andrew formerly known as Prince had a very bad yearIn November, after a lot of Epstein-related embarrassment, King Charles finallytook awaythe former Duke of York’s royal titles. He is now just Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor – and the butt of alot of jokes.9. Sean‘Diddy’ Combs was sentenced to more than four years in prisonOver the summer, the disgraced music mogul wasacquittedof the most serious charges against him, but found guilty of two counts of transportation to engage inprostitution. His team have asked Trump for apardon, but it hasn’t been forthcoming so far.10.

Dark humour feels vital to make light of everything that’s going wrong, but I’ve also been trying to draw cartoons that highlight reasons for hope, such as thefragile ceasefire in GazaorZohran Mamdani’s winin New York.View image in fullscreenVirginia Giuffre (3 November 2025).Illustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianMartin Rowson2025 has been remarkable not for what I’ve drawn but for what I haven’t. In 40 years of cartooning I’ve never known such an anonymous government, where nobody recognises 95% of the cabinet (apart from Wes “face like a full Brazilian” Streeting). Whether this is down to Morgan McSweeney’s shenanigans or them keeping their heads down until the day the nightmare ends doesn’t matter: it’s a tragedy.

They are not people I want to spend my time thinking about, or looking at – however nobody is beyond satire and they are both sufficiently unpleasant to make a good caricature. I loathe them, but I approach drawing them with curiosity and the eye of analysis. A caricature is as much about the person’s expressions as it is about their features, and while Trump’s face is very active, Putin’s is still: only his mouth seems to move, so I go for his glare.View image in fullscreenWhat’s on the table for Trump and Putin (17 February 2025).Illustration: Nicola Jennings/The GuardianMy aim is to ridicule, to decipher the grins and glares, in order to expose the motivation of those in positions of power.

Even so, I am sure it is damaging for the soul to draw Trump so many times – and I am planning tosue for $10bn.Ben JenningsThe year has felt a bit like watching repeats of old news broadcasts while being strapped to a dentist’s chair having all of one’s teeth removed.

But, he said, unions should feel able to call out a Labour government.“There’s always going to be points of tension and we can’t agree on everything,” he said.“I think people got frustrated that sometimes it looked like the hard choices were falling on those who could least afford them. This year they just have to be clear … show how you are making a difference to people’s standard of living.”He said he was pleased to see Labour U-turn before the budget on plans for an income tax rise. “It’s not justthe sharp end of the labour market who are feeling the pinch, it’s right across those low- and middle-income earners.”‘If it walks like a racist and quacks like a racist, it probably is racist’Nowak said he was unsurprised that there was speculation about Starmer’s leadership. One of his likely challengers would be Angela Rayner, who has close union ties, especially with Unison, and who steered the employment rights bill before she was forced to resign earlier this year.“When the prime minister personally is doing badly in polls, you’re never going to be able to avoid that [leadership speculation],” Nowak said.“I just don’t think it’s useful for me to do fantasy politics. We’re dealing with the realities of what we’ve got right now.”He said Starmer had an opportunity this year to deliver tangible differences to how people felt about the cost of living, saying if he did so it would “look fundamentally different in the polls”.But he warned leadership hopefuls not to get distracted by politics. “Frankly, the public will not thank you for parliamentary manoeuvrings and political shenanigans when the big job at hand isn’t being delivered.”Nowak said that he remained extremely concerned about the rise of Reform UK – despite acknowledging many trade union members were likely to be supporters of Nigel Farage’s party. But he said the normalisation of racist language was having a devastating impact on some minorities.“I was in County Durham a couple of months ago, and met a black woman social worker who’d been in the country for 20 years. She talked about her experience of being afraid to walk out on the streets because she is being racially abused,” he said.“What we’ve done is legitimise language that frankly five, 10 years ago we would think was unacceptable. If it walks like a racist and quacks like a racist, it probably is racist.”Nowak said he acknowledged there was widespread concern about high levels of immigration – and said unions would be prepared to back fair-minded reforms. But he cautioned they would have a major effect on public services – and that he was deeply concerned about the proposed change to make people wait 10 years for indefinite leave to remain.“It has real-world consequences for people working in care homes, on our railways and on our buses and in our prisons, that you’re going to end up losing people that we desperately need,” he said.“Both my grandfathers came to this country during the second world war and the idea that if you come to the UK, then within two and a half years someone could assess that you need to go back? It’s really difficult … we’ve made this point to the government.”The TUC and most trade unions are ending the year in a celebratory mood, with the passing of the Employment Rights Act after months of delay in the Lords. But Nowak said there were significant steps still to be taken to enact the whole of Labour’s Make Work Pay package promised in the manifesto.He said it was crucial that the end to zero-hours contracts was implemented “with real bite” so the onus was on employers to offer fixed hours. And he said the government should press ahead with its consultation on defining a single status of worker to end bogus self-employment.“Bad employers can be incredibly innovative when it comes to insecure forms of employment,” he said.But Nowak said he was most heartened by the passing of the new measures that made it easier for unions to organise in workplaces. “It’s the first time in my 35 years of being a trade union activist and official that any government’s ever repealed anti-union legislation,” he said.For the first time, he expected union membership to rise over the coming years. “I think what this does is move us away from being a minority sport to the mainstream of British workplaces,” he said.Nowak said he also wanted to see the government shout louder about its leftwing credentials, from the employment rights bill, to nationalisation, to the end of the two-child benefit gaps.But he also said progressives who were disillusioned with Labour should engage more, showing what pressure could achieve. “I think we’ve got to make this the best possible Labour government that we can,” he said.“I don’t think, in my job, or anybody who’s really interested in progressive politics, you can treat politics as a spectator sport. It’s not our job to carp from the sidelines, it’s to try to engage the government and lobby them.”Explore more on these topicsTUCTrade unionsDonald TrumpKeir StarmerImmigration and asylumTrade policynewsShareReuse this content"

It would not involve deployment to active operations, and there would be no obligation to stay in the military after completing the scheme, as it aims to teach transferable skills that can be used in other industries.John Healey, the defence secretary, told the i paper that the scheme would “give Britain’s young people a taste of the incredible skills and training on offer across the army, Royal Navy and RAF”.He added: “As families come together at this time of year, and young people think about their futures, I want the outstanding opportunities on offer in our armed forces to be part of that conversation in homes across the UK.”Under the current plans, the army scheme involves 13 weeks of basic training as part of a two-year placement, while the navy scheme would last one year and provide “profession agnostic” training for sailors, according to reports. The RAF’s scheme is less developed, although options are reportedly being explored.It comes after the chief of the defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Rich Knighton, said Britain’s “sons and daughters” should be “ready to fight” and called for a “whole of society” effort to defend the country in the face of Russian aggression.The British army already runs an internship scheme, formerly known as gap year commissions, but it had a low uptake in 2024/25 , with only 10 people enrolling. These are one-year placements for young people before, during or immediately after university.Australia already offers a gap year scheme for its military for those aged between 17 and 24. In 2023, 664 people enlisted in the Australian scheme, with a little more than half going on to a permanent role in the country’s defence force.In June, the British government said that the UK should take inspiration from the Australianmodel, arguing that a shorter-term option could make engagement with the military more appealing to women and people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds.Explore more on these topicsMinistry of DefenceYoung peopleMilitaryJohn HealeynewsShareReuse this content"

The steel cars, wrapped in black-and-white vinyl, come decked out with warning lights and flashing sirens on the roof. They seem to be heftier, more angular versions of a traditional police car. Las Vegas is the first city in the US to grant its officers access to a battalion of the futuristic trucks, which have become synonymous with the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, the richest person in the world.“They represent something far bigger than just a police car,” Sheriff Kevin McMahill said at a recentpress conferenceshowcasing the vehicles. “They represent innovation.”News of the 10 electric Cybertrucks first rippled across Las Vegas in February when McMahillposted renderingsof the cars on X, saying “These are badass” and announcing his force would soon be driving them. Another police departmentposton Instagram said the fleet “was entirely donated by an anonymous supporter”.Rumors swirled about who the donor could be. It came at a time when Tesla’s sales had tanked and Musk was laying waste to the federal government’s payroll as the head of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge). According to police department emails acquired by the Guardian through a public records request, the donation had been in the works since the month after Donald Trump’s election win.“As we’ve discussed, the use of these vehicles would represent a groundbreaking approach to modern policing,” Mike Gennaro, the chief of staff for the Las Vegas metropolitan police department, wrote in an email to the donor on 1 December 2024.The mysterious donor turned out to be Ben Horowitz, co-founder of the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and his wife Felicia Horowitz. They came forward just days after McMahill posted the renderings on social media. Horowitz’s firm, one of the best-known in Silicon Valley, invests in a variety of tech companies and spent $400m to help Musk take over Twitter in 2022.In reaction to the news, Musk replied to a post about it on X with an emoji wearing sunglasses.White nationalist talking points and racial pseudoscience: welcome to Elon Musk’s GrokipediaRead moreAthar Haseebullah, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, said that police use of these Cybertrucks seemed like an endorsement of Musk.View image in fullscreenA member of the Las Vegas police department inspects a Tesla Cybertruck, part of the department’s fleet of vehicles, in Las Vegas on 28 October 2025.Photograph: Ty ONeil/AP“I recognize that LVMPD sees value in having cool-looking vehicles around, and it projects an air of modernity and sophistication. But the reality is that for communities, that’s not what they’re asking for,” Haseebullah said. “They’re asking to feel safer. I don’t know that a Tesla Cybertruck makes anybody feel any safer.”Other cities around the US have also faced blowback at the prospect of adding Teslas to government-owned fleets. Baltimore had pledged to spend $5m on Tesla sedans for municipal employees in June 2024, but by March hadbacked off those plans. In King county, Washington, officials facedbacklash from residentsfor buying 120 Tesla vehicles for its municipal carpooling program. And in a handful of small towns in California, where officers have been testing Tesla sedans for law enforcement work, department chiefs say the vehiclesaren’t fit for modern policing.The Las Vegas police department, however, is optimistic. McMahill said zero taxpayer dollars were spent on the Cybertrucks because they were a donation.The mysterious donorsThe Horowitzes live in Las Vegas and have been longtime supporters of the city’s police department. According to the emails acquired by the Guardian, their Cybertruck donation included 10 vehicles for patrolling and one “sting protector” for special weapons and tactics (Swat). The donation, which isestimated at about $2.7mand was finalized in late January 2025, was funnelled through a law enforcement charity called Behind the Blue.“The morale of the cops will be through the roof when these show up at their substations,” Gennaro wrote to Horowitz, as they hammered out the donation logistics. “And we will use them as a tool to keep morale high and cops productive.”The police department waited for the Cybertrucks for about 10 months as they underwent upgrades by a company called UpFit, based in Hawthorne, California, which specializes in retrofitting Teslas for police work. The patrol vehicles come with barrier shields, ladders, radios and other tactical gear, according to the police department. The upgrade specifics and pricing were redacted in public records.According to internal emails, the Swat vehicle will be used in situations that include “barricaded suspects and hostage incidents”.Las Vegas police asked UpFit to remove Tesla’s “beast” mode on all 11 vehicles. Beast mode is a setting that Tesla says makes a Cybertruck accelerate from zero to 60mph in 2.6 seconds and can reach a top speed of 130mph.Horowitz has made several tech-centric donations to the Las Vegas police department over the past couple of years, totalling roughly $8m. Those include license plate readers from the company Flock, drones from Skydio and an artificial intelligence tool that helps with 911 calls from the company Prepared911. These three products were created by businesses within Andreessen Horowitz’s investment portfolio,according to a report by TechCrunch. The firm is not an investor in Tesla.In response to TechCrunch’s reporting, Horowitz wrote ablogpostemphasizing the need for public safety and quoted the rapper Nas, saying: “You can hate me now, but I won’t stop now.”Horowitz and Tesla did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment.The Cybertruck’s woesMusk has touted the Cybertruck’s stainless steel body as being “apocalypse-proof” with the ability towithstand bulletsandarrows. During his unveiling of the vehicle in 2019, he had one of his staffers throw a metal ball at the car’s window to show off what he said was “a truck that’s really tough, not fake tough”.The window shattered.Cybertrucks have been on public roads for two years now. They have dedicated fans, but have seen dwindling sales and are banned from the European market over pedestrian safety issues. In the third quarter of this year, Tesla sold just 5,385 Cybertrucks – down 63% from the same time last year. For comparison, the Ford F-150, a similar oversized electric truck, saw sales rise by nearly 40% in the third quarter.Some of the lackluster sales come from opposition to Musk during his time at Doge. “Tesla Takedown” protests last winter were aimed at getting people to sell their cars and afair amount of vitriol and violence was directed specifically toward Cybertrucks. Vandals around the country spray-painted swastikas on the pickup trucks, and, in Seattle, someone set four of the vehicles on fire, engulfing them in flames.View image in fullscreenTesla Cybertrucks owned by the Las Vegas metro police department on display in Las Vegas on 28 October 2025.Photograph: Ty ONeil/APCybertrucks have also had a staggering number of recalls over the last two years. Among the 10 recalls, issues included side panelling that’s prone to flying off while driving, too bright front lights and a gas pedal that accelerates uncontrollably. The most recent recall, issued on 30 October, was due to the truck’s light bar being susceptible to falling off and causing a road hazard to other vehicles.“Why didn’t they pick any other type of vehicle?” Haseebullah from the ACLU of Nevada asked. “Why would a Tesla be more efficient for police to utilize than a Ford?”The Las Vegas police department said it dealt with those recalls before deploying its Cybertrucks on patrol last month. For Sheriff McMahill, using these trucks is about having “the most technologically advanced police department on the planet”.“These trucks are high performance and they’re built tough,” McMahill said, echoing Ford’s “Built tough” tagline. “Cops are going to look kinda cool in them too.”Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskLas VegasUS policingnewsShareReuse this content"

It delivers better tools for today’sFBIworkforce at a fraction of the cost.”In November, leaders in Maryland sued the Trump administration after itscrapped plans to move the bureau’s headquarters to the state. The lawsuit pointed out that Congress had already appropriated funds for the relocation.The brutalist J Edgar Hoover building wasdesignedin the 1960s, when it was also conceived and constructed. It was often criticized for breaking with the style of other federal buildings. Former FBI head Hoover himself once called it “the greatest monstrosity ever constructed in the history of Washington”.Explore more on these topicsFBIWashington DCTrump administrationArchitecturenewsShareReuse this content"

In an email Wednesday to the Associated Press, Redd said he pulled out of the concert in the wake of the renaming.“When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,” Redd said. He added on Wednesday that the event has been a “very popular holiday tradition” and that he often featured at least one student musician.“One of the many reasons that it was very sad to have had to cancel,” he told the AP.The year after John F Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Congress passed a law naming the center as a living memorial to him.Grenell is a Trump ally whom the president chose to head the Kennedy Center after he forced out the previous leadership. According to the White House, Trump’s handpicked board approved the renaming, which scholars have said violates the law. JFK niece Kerry Kennedy has vowed to remove Trump’s name from the building once he leaves office, and former House historian Ray Smock is among those who say any changes would have to be approved by Congress.The law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees from making the center into a memorial to anyone else, and from putting another person’s name on the building’s exterior.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJazzWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

The human costs, in lives, displacement and lost livelihoods, are uncounted.Devastating events such as these are often grouped together as “natural disasters”, as if they were simply the consequences of normal weather variation. But this is a misperception, according to the report’s authors.Joanna Haigh, emeritus professor of atmospheric physics at Imperial College London, said damaging events were increasing in frequency and intensity owing to the human-made climate crisis. “The world is paying an ever-higher price for a crisis we already know how to solve. These disasters are not ‘natural’ – they are the inevitable result of continued fossil fuel expansion and political delay,” she said.While the economic cost of disasters is often accounted as greater in developed countries, where people and businesses can afford insurance, the true toll in developing countries can be much higher. Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: “While wealthy nations count the financial cost of disasters, millions of people across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean are counting lost lives, homes and futures. In 2026, governments must stop burying their heads in the sand and start responding with real support for people on the frontlines.”The top 10 list is far from the whole of the damage to the planet: a further 10 major extreme weather events that each came in at less than $1bn in damage were also examined in the report, and many less costly examples did not make either list.The reportalso highlighted theseries of typhoons in the Philippines, where more than 1.4 million people were displaced, and $5bn incurred in damages.All regions of the world were hit, as disasters piled up through the year.Drought in Iranthreatens the 10 million inhabitants of Tehran with evacuation. Floods hit Democratic Republic of the Congo in April, then Nigeria followed in May, with 700 deaths. Floods in India and Pakistan killed more than 1,860 people, cost about $6bn, and affected more than 7 million people in Pakistan alone.In the developed world,record-breaking fires raged across the Iberian peninsula, droughts hit Canada, and there were record heatwaves in Scotland.At this year’sUN climate summit, Cop30 in Belém in November, rich countries agreed to triple the amount of finance available to help poor countries adapt to the impacts of extreme weather. But the tripling, expected to reach $120bn by 2035, will still be nowhere near enough to fund all the protection needed in developing countries.The bill for extreme weather damages will continue to rise until the world slashes greenhouse gas emissions and phases out fossil fuels, added Christian Aid’s chief executive, Patrick Watt.“These climate disasters are a warning of what lies ahead if we do not accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels,” he said. “They also underline the urgent need for adaptation, particularly in the global south, where resources are stretched and people are especially vulnerable to climate shocks.”At Cop30, an attempt to start work onroadmaps for countries to phase out fossil fuelswas relegated to the status of a voluntary initiative, rather than a compulsory task for all countries. However, work will begin on it this year, led by Cop30 host Brazil, and at a special conference on fossil fuels to be held by Colombia in April, expected to be attended by the more than 80 countries supporting the roadmap effort.Explore more on these topicsExtreme weatherClimate crisisFloodingWildfiresShareReuse this content"

Right outside, the River Wandle is awake and bursting with life. The grey heron swoops down and swiftly lands with a big splash, then stands up, still as a statue. Once I spotted an electric-blue kingfisher zapping along so quickly that I could barely see it.Sadly, in February at half-term, there was a diesel leak into the river. A putrid stench came out of the water and the shock of the smell was overwhelming. The shimmering rainbow swirl of oil seemed to kill any fish that were in its path. My family and I were so worried, especially about the birds. The community worked together to clear the spill and monitor the river, and someone came todo a clean-up.View image in fullscreen‘The grey heron swoops down and swiftly lands with a big splash.’Photograph: Family handoutFast forward to now, and the river is bursting with life again. I see the cormorant diving into the river for food, sleek as a submarine. I think it can hold its breath for longer than I can! The piercing sound of the Egyptian geese rings in my ears. They might be some of the loudest animals I’ve ever heard. The little egret stands elegantly in the water, its bright-white feathers like a light illuminating the dark mornings.

The San Bernardino county fire departmenton Thursday night statedthat one person was injured in the slide, but that weather conditions were expected to improve and there was no ongoing safety threat.The town remained under an evacuation warning on Friday morning with some surrounding roads closed, according to the county’s emergency service system.There was still a risk of more flash flooding and mudslides on Friday around Los Angeles, the National Weather Service warned, even as the rain began to ease up.“Still not quite out of the woods, but for the most part, the worst is over,” said Mike Wofford, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Los Angeles.Firefighters rescued more than 100 people Thursday in Los Angeles county, with one helicopter pulling 21 people from stranded cars, officials said. LA police also responded to more than 350 traffic collisions, the mayor’s office said.The storms, a result of atmospheric rivers carrying plumes of moisture from the tropics, hit during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. The immense rainfall was also a stark shift from last winter, whenan exceedingly dry yearcreated conditions for the rapid spread of devastating wildfires across the region.The system brought the wettest Christmas season to downtown Los Angeles in 54 years, the National Weather Service said.At least three peoplehave been killedsince the storms began earlier this week. A motorist was killed in the northern California city of Reddingafter becoming trapped in their vehicleduring a flood. Farther south, a Sacramento sheriff’s deputydiedin what appeared to be a weather-related crash.

Lopiccolo got a new snowboard and an e-bike.“We just played card games all night with candles and flashlights,” he said.One dead in California floods as state braces for brutal week of Christmas stormsRead moreDavey Schneider hiked a mile and a half (2.4km) through rain and flood water up to his shins from his Wrightwood residence on Wednesday to rescue cats from his grandfather’s house.“I wanted to help them out because I wasn’t confident that they were going to live,” Schneider said on Thursday. “Fortunately, they all lived. They’re all OK – just a little bit scared.”Arlene Corte said roads in town turned into rivers, but her house was not damaged.“It could be a whole lot worse,” she said. “We’re here talking.”With more rain on the way, more than 150 firefighters were stationed in the area, said Shawn Millerick, San Bernardino county fire department spokesperson.“We’re ready,” he said. “It’s all hands on deck at this point.”View image in fullscreenA car drives through a flooded road on La Cienega Boulevard on Wednesday in Los Angeles, California.Photograph: Apu Gomes/AFP/Getty ImagesAreas along the coast, including Malibu, were under a flood watch until Friday afternoon, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento valley and the San Francisco Bay Area.Southern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3-2.5cm) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see 4-8in, with even more in the mountains, National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Wofford said.More wind and heavy snow was expected in the Sierra Nevada, where gusts created “near white-out conditions” and made mountain pass travel treacherous.Elsewhere across the US, millions of additional residents were bracing for extreme weather. Forecasters said that a weekend storm could bring New York City’s biggest snowfall in three years. Freezing rain was falling Friday in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and in New York, an emergency was declared for much of the state before widespread snowfall expected on Friday night into Saturday morning.In Connecticut, people were encouraged to avoid travel as a winter storm approached the north-east on Friday.This article was amended on 26 December 2025.

It would curve from Minehead to Watchet and use 125 underwater turbines to harness the power of the second-highest tidal range in the world.The proposal comes amid growing concern that rapidly rising use of AI in Britain will drive up carbon emissions unless more renewable energy sources are found. The AI boom is expected to add to sharp increases in demand for electricity across the UK, which the governmentestimatedthis month could more than double by 2050.“If the decision is to go ahead with adopting more and more AI – which I am surprised is not being questioned more at a time of climate emergency – then it is going to be better with a renewable energy source,” said Barfield. “Datacentres could double energy demand and this is a predictable and reliable source.”The barrage would not cross the full breadth of the channel but would instead curve to and from the Somerset coast with a 2.5GW maximum output – not far short of the peak energy that will be created by the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station just 12 miles east. It would be enough to power 2m homes.View image in fullscreenA visualisation of the full arc of the proposed lagoon.Illustration: Marks Barfield ArchitectsThe vision includes a path along the top of the semi-circular barrage for walkers and cyclists willing to brave the south-westerlies, a water-sports marina, a lido and an observation tower. Local MP Rachel Gilmour, who is backing the plan, said the pathway “will become absolutely iconic”.The designers have tentatively suggested it also might be possible to install datacentres within the structure, allowing them to benefit from cheap seawater cooling. There are hopes for oyster and mussel beds, arrays of floating solar panels and a coastal amphitheatre to boost the economy of Minehead, once a popular holiday resort and nowone of the 20% most deprived areas in Britain.The latest UK energy policy states that tidal and wave energy could play a role “if their costs can be reduced”.“We have got people who want to fund it but they will only do so if the government is supportive,” said Aidan Clegg, chief executive of the consortium. “They need to take this seriously. This is not hypothetical – we have a strong plan in place.”View image in fullscreenA visualisation of the cycle track over the tidal power station.Illustration: Marks Barfield ArchitectsA spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “We are open to considering well-developed proposals for harnessing the tidal range energy in the bays and estuaries around our coastlines, which demonstrate strong value for money. TheAI energy councilis bringing together the likes ofNeso[the National Energy System Operator], EDF, Microsoft and Google in solving the energy demands of AI, exploring opportunities to attract investment and support the development of low carbon power for datacentres.”Tidal power is more predictable than wind and solar, even though there are several hours when tides turn each day with little or no power. The backers of theWest Somerset Lagoonproject believe it would last 120 years and would therefore produce power more cheaply than nuclear power.It was first conceived several years ago with the aim of reducing the UK’s carbon footprint. Since then, the AI revolution began and is now on course to dramatically increase energy demand. Britain’s national energy system operator, Neso, haspredictedelectricity demand for datacentres will treble by 2035. The vast racks of microprocessors needed to train and run AI models and store the ever-increasing mountains of data on which the tech-enabled 21st-century economy relies will account for the largest part of the overall increase in electricity demand in the commercial sector.The West Somerset Lagoon is the latest in a line of proposals to harness the tidal power of the Severn estuary. In the 1980s, other lagoons were proposed in the narrower part of the estuary, closer to Bristol, whilea full barrage from near Cardiff to near Weston-super-Marewas suggested more recently, raising concerns about large-scale and irreversible change to the estuary system. The latest sponsors of the idea say the lagoon will not interrupt navigation channels to the ports of Bristol and Cardiff, and is outside protected areas such as local nature reserves and special areas of conservation.“Minehead and that whole area of West Somerset is an area of deprivation and this project will drive positive transformation,” Barfield said. “It will create skilled full-time jobs, an area for water-sports, a lido, a visitors’ centre, an observation tower and cultural facilities. It could also become a hub for marine farming mussels, seaweed and oysters. These are the types of businesses that local young people could develop because the tidal range would be more controlled.”Explore more on these topicsHydropowerSomersetRenewable energyArtificial intelligence (AI)Energy (Technology)Energy (Environment)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

The paper suggested that Charles’s visit to the US was likely to take place in April.William is expected to make a separate visit to the US later in the year during the World Cup, which will be hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico from 11 June to 19 July.The visit would be the first by a reigning British monarch since Queen Elizabeth II accepted an invitation from George W Bush in 2007.Earlier this month, theUS paused its promised multibillion-pound investmentinto British tech over trade disagreements.As part of the £31bndeal, hailed by Keir Starmer as “a generational step-change in our relationship with the US” when it was announced during Trump’s state visit, US tech companies pledged to spend billions in the UK, including a £22bn investment from Microsoft and £5bn from Google.But Washington paused the implementation of the agreement, citing a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas.The decision to put it on hold was a blow to the UK government, which touted the agreement as a prize of its intensive year-long engagement with the US to avoid punitive tariffs on British exports. As part of his diplomatic charm offensive, Starmer had hosted Trump for a second state visit at Windsor Castle in September, an unprecedented honour for a US president.Earlier in December, Downing Street said the government was still in “active conversations” with the US on the tech deal. But the prime minister’s spokesperson acknowledged that “negotiations of this kind are never straightforward”.Reports suggested US negotiators had become frustrated by slow progress in agreeing a wider trade deal announced in May 2025, when Britain escaped the 20% tariffs that the US president imposed on much of the rest of the world.Britain’s digital services tax, opposed by Trump’s big tech backers, and the sensitive issue of greater access to British markets for US farmers, are thought to be sticking points.It is possible that the visit will be timed to ensure that the prince is in the US for Independence Day, the Times reported.The prime minister is not expected to accompany the king on the visit. Instead, the foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, is likely to attend to represent the government, according to reports.William is expected to visit the US during the World Cup in his capacity as the president of the Football Association. England’s third group match is being played on 27 June in New Jersey, a week before the 250th anniversary of the US Declaration of Independence celebrations on 4 July.For the bicentennial celebrations of independence in 1976, the queen and Prince Philip visited Philadelphia, Washington DC and New York over six days. The queen was hosted by President Gerald Ford at a White House state dinner.She spoke of her visit during her Christmas broadcast the same year, and said: “This year we went to America to join in their bicentennial celebrations. Who would have thought 200 years ago that a descendant of King George III could have taken part in these celebrations? Yet that same king was among the first to recognise that old scores must be settled and differences reconciled.”She added: “The United States was born in bitter conflict with Britain but we didn’t remain enemies for long.”Buckingham Palace declined to comment, stating it did not comment on upcoming royal engagements.Explore more on these topicsKing Charles IIIPrince WilliamDonald TrumpMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

He had been an ectopic pregnancy – when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the uterus – and was hidden behind a large ovarian cyst.Doctors at Ceder-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles called the dangerous pregnancy extremely rare – occurring in just one in 30,000 pregnancies – and have plans to document the case in medical journals.Dr John Ozimek, who oversees the hospital’s labor and delivery ward, remarked that pregnancies outside the uterus that reach full term “are essentially unheard of – far, far less than one in a million”, hesaidto the Associated Press. “I mean, this is really insane,” he added.Lopez found out that she was pregnant only days before giving birth. Since her 20s, she had been dealing with ovarian cysts. She previously had her right ovary removed along with another cyst.View image in fullscreenSuze Lopez and her son, Ryu, in California in October 2025.Photograph: Associated PressFor months, doctors had been monitoring a 22lb cyst on Lopez’s abdomen. After dealing with increasing abdominal pain and pressure, Lopez visited doctors to see about having it removed. But during her appointment, after taking a routine pregnancy test, Lopez discovered that she was pregnant.Despite the positive test, Lopez hadn’t noted any pregnancy symptoms. “Because of the large ovarian cyst that had been growing for years, it could have been a false positive, even ovarian cancer,” said Lopez in aCedars-Sinai press release. “And I was used to very irregular periods and some abdominal discomfort. I could not believe that after 17 years of praying, and trying, for a second child, that I was actually pregnant.”But days later, Lopez returned to the hospital with abdominal pain and dangerously high blood pressure. Doctors discovered that, while Lopez’s uterus was empty, a fetus was concealed in her abdomen.Baby Ryu was delivered on 18 August, with the team of 30 doctors also removing Lopez’s cyst during the same procedure. Lopez reportedly lost a lot of blood during the surgery and Ryu spent two weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit, SFGatereported. Both mother and baby made a full recovery.A spokesperson at Cedars-Sinai confirmed that Lopez and baby Ryu are in good health: “The family is doing great. Mom and baby [are] all thriving.”The Guardian could not reach Lopez for comment, but the mother of two shared a holiday updateon Facebook, writing: “Praise the Lord. Our family has a very special and surprising Christmas gift this year.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaPregnancyWest CoastChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Lawmakers broke the record forlongest floor speechandlongest vote, and presided overthe lengthiest government shutdown.They also spent plenty of time seeking to reprimand each other by passing censures, as the House’s formal mechanism for discipline is known. A search on Congress.gov reveals at least 17 attempts since the start of the year to condemn another lawmaker, in the form of a censure or a less formal disapproval resolution.If a censure resolution is approved by a majority of the chamber, the targeted lawmaker must stand before the House dais as the speaker informs them that they have been punished for their bad behavior. That’s as far as the consequences go – they keep their seat and their right to vote, but perhaps not their reputation.Though almost none of these passed, the flurry grew so intense that by the end of the year, a bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed changing the rules to make it more difficult for censures to succeed. “How about we stop the circular firing squad in the House?” asked Republican Don Bacon, one of the bill’s sponsors.Here’s a look back at the alleged misdeeds at the center of the censure spree:Calling Musk a ‘dick’Republican congresswoman Nancy Mace introduced the first censure attempt of the year in February against Democrat Robert Garcia. Mace’s measure accuses Garcia of “inciting violence against a special government employee” – meaning Elon Musk, who was then in Trump’s best graces as the leader of the “department of government efficiency”. The measure cites an instance in which Garcia – ina rather roundabout fashion– called Musk a “dick” at a committee hearing, and a comment he made to CNN about how his fellow Democrats should “bring actual weapons to this bar fight” against Musk. The House did not end up voting on it.Yelling at the presidentThe newly re-elected Donald Trump appeared to be at the height of his powers when headdresseda joint session of Congress in early March. But Democrat Al Green was not having it. Pumping a walking cane in the air, Greeninterrupted Trump, shouting “he has no mandate”. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, had Green forcibly removed, and three Republicans introduced censure resolutions targeting him. Two days after the speech, the House passed Washington congressman Dan Newhouse’s measure, with 10 Democratsvoting in favor, along with all Republicans. Democratic lawmakers surrounded Green and sang We Shall Overcome as Johnson read the censure.(In response to that scene, Republican congressman Eli Crane proposed, unsuccessfully, another resolution that would have thrown Green off the financial services committee). Newhouse’s resolution remains the only censure to actually win approval in 2025, but the wave of acrimony was far from finished.Wallowing in racial stereotypesFour days after Green was censured, Democratic congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan proposed censuring Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert, who said the following about Green in an interview with a rightwing broadcaster: “For him to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump was absolutely abhorrent.” The resolution accused Boebert of using language that is “disparaging, derogatory, and racist toward another colleague”, but was not considered on the House floor.Making light of the Texas governor’s wheelchairIn March, Republican congressman Randy Weber of Texas proposed censuring Democratic fellow Texan Jasmine Crockett for calling Greg Abbott – the state’s Republican governor who has used a wheelchair for decades after being paralyzed by a falling tree – “Governor Hot Wheels” and “a hot ass mess”. This also did not come up for a vote.Confronting ICERepublicans filed two censure resolutions against New Jersey Democrat LaMonica McIver after she wasarrested and chargedwith felonies following an altercation outside an ICE detention facility in Newark. The resolution introduced by Republican Clay Higgins was brought up in the House, only for Democrats and a handful of Republicans to collaborate in killing it. This would be the first of several instances this year in which small groups of lawmakers crossed party lines to put down a censure attempt.More racismTennessee Republican Andy Ogles was the target of two censure resolutions over the summer, for discriminatory comments made about the incoming New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani and other Democrats of color. Democrat Shri Thanedar proposed Ogles’s censure in June for social media posts in which he dubbed Mamdani “little muhammad” and called for him to be deported. The following month, Democrat Ritchie Torres introduced a censure resolution after Ogles called Hakeem Jeffries, the African American House minority leader, “Discount Dollar Store Obama”. Neither resolution was put up for a vote.Questioning the deeds of Charlie KirkOne of only two Muslim women in Congress and the only Somali American, Democrat Ilhan Omar isa perpetual targetof Trump and his Republican allies. In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s murder, Mace proposed censuring Omar and booting her off two committees for comments in which she “disparaged” his character as well as those who mourned the conservative activist’s death, according to her resolution. Democrats succeeded in killing it thanks to help from, again, a small group of Republicans. Jeff Hurd, one of four GOP lawmakers to vote the motion down, called Omar’s comments “ghoulish and evil” butsaid: “The right response to reprehensible speech like this isn’t silencing: it’s more speech. That’s what Charlie Kirk believed and practiced, and I agree.”‘Undermining the process of a free and fair election’The censure wave peaked in November, when, in the midst ofa pivotal voteto end the government shutdown, Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez went to the House floor and alleged that fellow Democrat Chuy Garcia orchestrated his retirement in such a way to guarantee that his chief of staff would be elected to replace him. The resolution “disapproves of [his] behavior” for “undermining the process of a free and fair election”, but was not technically a censure. It sparked outrage from some in Perez’s party but ended up passing, with most Republicans and 23 Democrats voting in support.Texting Jeffrey EpsteinAs the bill to compel the release of government-held files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was nearing passage,the Washington Post reportedthat Democrat Stacey Plaskett, the non-voting delegate from the US Virgin Islands, had texted with Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing. The GOP saw a moment to make Democrats – who had for months pressed for release of the Epstein files – practice what they preached, and Congressman Ralph Norman proposedcensuring Plaskett. His resolution failed thanks to united Democratic opposition and the votes of three Republicans.A wide range of alleged misdeedsFlorida Republican Cory Mills was the target of three separate censure resolutions this year that wound up sparking allegations of party leaders scheming to kill competing censure attempts. In response to the attempt to censure McIver, Democrat Yvette Clarke introduced the first resolution in September, which said that Mills had on “several occasions conducted himself in a manner that reflects discredit” on the House, citing reports the congressman abused romantic partners, committed financial misconduct and misrepresented his military service. The congressman denied wrongdoing, and Clarke’s resolution wound up being withdrawn at the same time that a few Republicans joined with Democrats to block the censure of Omar.Clarke filed a substantially similar measure on the same day as the Epstein files vote in November, and the following day, Mace introduced her own censure resolution against Mills. The Florida congressman made a motion to refer Mace’s proposal to the ethics committee rather than bring it up for a vote, which succeeded with the support of many Democrats. That prompted some Republican women to allege that House leaders brokered a deal to protect Mills in exchange for voting down the censure of Plaskett.“This backroom deal shit is swampy, wrong and always deserves to be called out,” Florida Republican Kat Cammack later said.Explore more on these topicsUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesUS politicsDemocratsRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

We did the dishes and laid the table but my mother did the cooking. I didn’t really know how to cook. I wasn’t a good eater as a child but I loved mashed potatoes with a bit of oil poured over them.”She is also a champion of local produce such as the Penedès cockerel that she and her husband farmed until a few years ago. She says the Penedès variety has more flavour and a better texture than supermarket chicken because it’s reared for twice as long and is fed on grape seeds from local vineyards.View image in fullscreenMaria Antònia Udina is one of women who contributed videos on traditional Catalan cooking.Photograph: Pablo García/The GuardianView image in fullscreen‘Catalonia is small but we have mountains and sea and we like mixing the two,’ Udina says.Photograph: Pablo García/The GuardianShe lists what in her view are Catalan cuisine’s three essential characteristics: the sofregit made with olive oil, onions, tomatoes and sometimes peppers or carrots, which is the ground zero of dozens of dishes; the use of herbs such as rosemary, bay and thyme, and finally the picada, a paste made from olive oil, ground almonds or hazelnuts, garlic, parsley and fried bread, served as an accompaniment to many dishes and a key ingredient in suquet de peix, the Catalan version of bouillabaisse.Although Udina has a reputation as an excellent cook, she has never worked as a professional chef. However, she has dined in some of the region’s most famous restaurants, among them Can Fabes, the first in Catalonia to be awarded three Michelin stars, and El Celler de Can Roca, twice voted the best restaurant in the world.She admires these avant garde chefs and accepts that their cuisine is rooted in tradition. However, she is sceptical about the claim that it’s simply a homage to their mother’s and grandmother’s tables.For example, Udina says, wild mushrooms are a staple of Catalan cooking but at Can Fabes, “we had six or seven dishes that were all made with wild mushrooms, including an ice-cream”.“That’s nothing like what their mothers would have cooked,” she says, adding that she believes there’s a move back towards simpler, less innovative cuisine and hopes that Gastrosàvies will encourage “our children and grandchildren to cook traditional food instead of pizza, hamburgers and Pot Noodles”.Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropeFoodCataloniaChefsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Gigantic website also listed the same fee for the recently built Co-op Live arena in Manchester.Restoration fees and levies have become a familiar feature on venue and ticketing websites in recent years – but the reader asked how they could be applied to these two almost brand-new venues, which opened in 2019 and 2024, respectively.When we contacted Gigantic, the company said we needed to speak to the promoter, and it changed its website to explain that this fee was to support grassroots venues.View image in fullscreenTottenham Hotspur Stadium opened in 2019 and cost £850m.Photograph: View Pictures/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesCloser inspection of the other fees that had been charged revealed that while the website listed a 10% booking fee, the reader had been charged 13% – with the 3% adding on almost £3 extra for each ticket purchased.A spokesperson from Kilimanjaro Live, the promoter of the Gorillaz tour, confirmed that the ticketing website had made an error and that all affected buyers would be given a refund of the difference.The story highlights how the plethora of fees being added to tickets mean that fans can quickly lose track of how much they should pay.Last year, research by the consumer body Which? found that extra charges including delivery and transaction fees, booking fees, service fees and order processing fees, canadd up to 25% to the costof concert and festival tickets.However, the 2025 Music Fans’ Voice surveyfound that only 35% of respondents were aware of all charges before reaching the checkout stage, while only 34% of respondents said they were aware of what each charge was for.Lack of transparencyAlice Andrews recently bought tickets to see the pop-rapper Pitbull at London’s BST Hyde Park in July 2026. The price of the three tickets without fees was £329.85. There was an added £3 transaction fee, a £3 sustainability levy, and a £37.50 service fee – making a total of £373.35.Like many music fans, she says she wants greater transparency over how much tickets will cost in total, and where this extra money goes.“I would like to know what my money is going to be used for if I’m going to pay a fee,” she says. “It has put me off big gigs before.”Andrew Simpson, a regular gig-goer, says that when looking at tickets for Haim at Manchester’s Co-op Live, on top of the £51.75 face value for a general admission ticket to stand, there was an £8 service fee, £2.35 handling fee, and £2.95 facility fee – bringing the total up to £65.05.View image in fullscreenThe Clapham Grand, an independent venue in London, now tells customers what additional fees will be used for.Photograph: Tim P Whitby/Getty ImagesWhen he looked for a breakdown of what the fees covered, the website said the facility fee “keeps the venue running, helping us to improve our services and experiences for all fans …”“This is just a meaningless sentence and tells me nothing,” Simpson says.Some independent venues, such as the Clapham Grand in London and Saint Luke’s in Glasgow, have listened to feedback from ticket buyers and now include a breakdown of expenses online that show what additional fees, such as a restoration levy, are for. Some specify what an added charge is for at the time of purchase – for example, it may be used to finance a new floor.When the Guardian approached Gigantic, it said the restoration fee was in fact a £1 Live Trust donation, where the money is given to smaller, independent venues via a scheme by the Music Venue Trust, a charity which acts to “protect, secure and improve UK grassroots music venues for the benefit of venues, communities and upcoming artists”.The reader who got in touch has received their overpayment back from Gigantic.Total costMark Davyd, the chief executive officer of the Music Venue Trust, says the reason there are so many fees is because of the number of players that are involved in selling tickets. Often fees are set by different parties involved in the process, all of whom argue that they need the money in order to deliver the service or product.He says transparency is actually “irrelevant” to fans, and that they actually just want the total cost to be what is displayed to them on the landing page.“That’s what fans want,” he says. “Delivering that requires government and trading standards bodies to recognise that, and a total rewiring of the terms of the contract.”Last month,the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched what it described as a “major consumer protection drive” focused on online pricing practices across a range of sectors including entertainment. These practices include“drip pricing”, which is where online shoppers are shown an initial price for an item or service, but then more fees are revealed (or “dripped”) as people progress through the buying process.View image in fullscreenA fan said a ticket to see Haim at Co-op Live had £13 of additional fees on top of the face-value ticket cost.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAThe CMA citeda 2023 government reportthat found that drip pricing was particularly common when it came to event tickets (it indicated they were present at 93% of the businesses looked at).The competition watchdog said it had begun investigations into eight companies about their pricing practices, two of which were sellers of event tickets: StubHub and Viagogo. It said these two companies were under review over the mandatory additional charges applied when consumers buy tickets, and whether or not these fees were included upfront. However, it said that at this stage it had reached no conclusions about whether the law had been broken in any of these investigations.Explore more on these topicsTicket pricesConsumer affairsShareReuse this content"

This is ahead of industrial properties, at 9.1% and offices at 3.2%.Shopping centres and food stores are the joint top performers this year, each delivering 10.2% growth in returns.View image in fullscreenShopping centres such as Bluewater in Kent are seeking to attract people with ‘experiences’ and activities including zip wiring.Photograph: suppliedShopping centres are now seeking to attract visitors with “experiences” andactivities such as zipwires and darts, to complement shops. While large centres tend to do well, smaller, older malls are suffering because retail chains’ preference for fewer larger stores, Knight Frank said.Next year, retail property is forecast to deliver investment returns of 9.5%.Will Lund, the head of retail capital markets at Knight Frank, said: “With online penetration flatlining and retailers reinvesting in physical space, the narrative around retail has fundamentally changed. We have great confidence that this demand is going to drive a return to decade-high investment volumes in 2026 and we are expecting a busy year.”In November, the chief executive of the commercial property development and investment company Landsec, Mark Allan, saidit was prioritising buying more retail assetsover the next 12 to 18 months, in asector that had long been considered “unloved”.Landsec, which owns and manages large shopping centres such as Bluewater in Kent and Trinity Leeds, has sold £295m of offices as it shifts towards retail and residential. The company is in talks to buy the Silverburn shopping centre near Glasgow for £250m early next year.British Land, another big developer, focuses mainly on London office campuses and retail parks.“Office attendance is accelerating, retailers are expanding out of town, and supply remains very constrained across both markets,” its chief executive, Simon Carter, has said.View image in fullscreenLandsec is in talks to buy the Silverburn shopping centre near Glasgow for £250m early next year.Photograph: Jeff Holmes JSHPIX/REX/ShutterstockA number of shopping centres have changed hands this year and supermarkets and other food stores have increasedsale-and-leasebacktransactions.Knight Frank is managing the sale of Merry Hill near Dudley and expects to sell the West Midlands shopping complex for £300m, with 10 investors bidding.Last month, Frasers Group, the owner of Sports Direct, bought the Braehead shopping centre near Glasgow, one of Scotland’s busiest, from SGS UK Retail in a deal reportedly worth £220m.Knight Frank estimated that £5.8bn was invested in retail assets in 2025, down 17% from the previous year because of a shortage of properties. Transaction levels rose in the second half if the year, and with pricing strengthening, that momentum is expected to carry into 2026.Charlie Barke, the head of capital markets at Knight Frank, said: “We’ve got fewer willing sellers because people are expecting these assets to start to perform well again. So stock supply to the market is limited for the first time in quite a long time, and now demand for investments exceeds supply in the retail sector.”Across the country, 13.5% of shops stand empty, the lowest vacancy rate since 2020, with a further drop expected next year.On the high street, £420m of shops were traded in the second half of 2025, up 150% on the first half. Prime centres and regional cities are expected to deliver rental growth of 6.9% this year.Sam Waterworth, a partner at Knight Frank, said: “Retail has decisively turned a corner with 2025 marking the high street’s rebound.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryCommercial propertyReal estatenewsShareReuse this content"

Once the dust has settled on the festive celebrations, a third (34%) of those surveyed admitted to getting rid of the unwanted present rather than returning or exchanging it.Among popular options for passing on an unsuitable item were giving it to a friend or family member, which 12% of respondents did, while 10% said they had given it to a charity shop and 8% had sold it on an online marketplace.My weirdest Christmas: the oven was broken, the turkey was raw and all the crisps had been eaten …Read moreOnly 2% of those surveyed said they had thrown away an unwanted present, with just 1% admitting to giving it back to the person who bought it for them.“Our research shows that a fifth of us have been left wondering what to do with an unwanted gift,” said Lisa Webb, a consumer law expert at Which?. “It’s always worth getting a gift receipt so your loved one has the option to return their gift if needed.”Thankfully, many retailers extend their returns policy over the festive period, allowing many people who received a disappointing gift to get a refund or exchange it for another item or a voucher.“Sometimes, for online orders, only the buyer can request a refund or exchange,” Webb added. “But if the item was marked as a gift when ordered, the retailer’s returns policy may enable a recipient to return or exchange it.”Which? advises consumers they will usually need to provide proof of purchase in order to return an unwanted item. Some retailers do not allow refunds to credit or debit cards unless the original card holder is present. Depending on the returns policy, they may, however, offer a gift card, voucher or credit note.Explore more on these topicsUK newsChristmasConsumer affairsRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The podcast finds Marler, former rugby player and breakout star of TheCelebrity Traitors, impersonating a psychotherapist and subjecting guests to “totally unregulated psychological testing”. The mock-therapy conceit is hardly a new one, but on paper it still has the makings of a successful pod.Celebrity hostfresh from ratings-busting TV triumph? Check. Fancy studio setup for the viewing crowd? Check. Weird visual stunts that will leave audio listeners baffled? Er … check?The big news inpodcastingfrom the last 18 months has been the medium’s swift and unstoppable pivot to video. Where a podcast was previously defined as an audio recording available to stream online, it has since expanded to become an umbrella term taking in visual and audio content. The idea, at least in theory, is that audiences get to choose whether they watch or listen. But there are creeping signs that video is taking precedence, with audio considered to be secondary.Which brings us to Marler’s pod, the opening episode of which has its host in conversation with his fellow Celebrity Traitors contestantNick Mohammed. Before becoming an actor, Mohammed worked as a magician, which is presumably why Marler gets him to perform a card trick. It’s not exactly riveting visual entertainment, but if you are listening, it’s impossible to know what’s going on. While Mohammed does attempt to explain the mechanics of the trick, there is no tension and no sense, for the listener, of the sleight of hand at the heart of it.Sillier still is a so-called trust exercise where Marler blindfolds Mohammed and pretends to shoot a paper cup off the top of his head using a crossbow (in fact he uses a child’s gun – which is something you just cannot tell from listening alone). Again, it’s not good in either medium, but listening to it is like eavesdropping on a stranger telling a funny story but missing the vital plot points.This is not an isolated case of a visualised podcast seemingly forgetting about its listeners. A recent episode of the all-conquering Diary of a CEO WithSteven Bartlett, featuring insomnia expert Matthew Walker, saw Bartlett hand his interviewee a jar of gold coins to explain the concept of banking sleep before periods of stress. At no point was this visual aid described for the show’s listeners; instead, they just heard long pauses and incomprehensible shuffling sounds.View image in fullscreen‘Long pauses and incomprehensible shuffling sounds’ … Steven Bartlett recently baffled listeners to Diary of a CEO.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianSometimes the problem isn’t visual explainers or gags but simply crappy sound quality. Early episodes of The Rest Is Football podcast, in which hosts Gary Lineker, Micah Richards and Alan Shearer sat around a coffee table wearing tiny clip-on mics, sounded as if they were broadcasting from deep inside a cave. The problem was subsequently fixed, but the fact that the series is set to broadcast daily on Netflix for next year’s World Cup says a lot about where its values lie.For podcast host and audio critic Miranda Sawyer, the problem is clear. “A podcast made by people who come from a telly, YouTube or Insta background prioritises video rather than audio, and the result can be painful to hear. I’ve heard shows where one or all of the participants are on Zoom and one cuts out, and there’s no editing to make it better to listen to.” Asked if she believes the focus on video content is coming at the expense of audio quality, she says: “I think it comes at the expense of both. A podcast that is made by people who prefer audio means you get a desultory effort when it comes to visuals: presenters sitting in front of a studio bookcase, on a sofa that makes them slump, with mics in an awkward position.”Much of the drive behind video content comes from its potential as a marketing tool for the show. Footage can easily be clipped up and shared on social media to help drive audience engagement and, where possible, generate news lines. Eleanor McDowall, audio documentary-maker and director of Falling Tree, the production company behind series including Half Life and Short Cuts, notes that “in the hyper-visual landscape of social media, it’s always been a struggle to share audio eye-catchingly”. She adds that she can understand the draw for networks in having celebrities talking in digestible clips, though, she says, “I do get depressed thinking that the funder is more concerned with the ease of advertising something as opposed to the value of the thing itself.”None of this is to say that beautifully produced audio podcasts are a thing of the past. This October saw the launch of Adrift, an Apple Original podcast telling the true story of the Robertson family, who were shipwrecked in the Pacific in the early 1970s. It’s an audio-only series that goes to great lengths to place the listener in the dinghy with the Robertsons using multilayered sound design. Audible’s all-star remake of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone also comes with a rich and detailed sound palette, replicating echoing footsteps on Hogwarts corridors and the whoosh of an owl coming in to land.View image in fullscreen‘Sounded as if they were broadcasting from deep inside a cave’ … Micah Richards, Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer on The Rest is Football podcast.Photograph: Goalhanger PodcastsThere is, however, a certain type of podcast that is enamoured of studio furnishings, mood lighting and the celebrity in its midst, and which cares a lot less about the listener tuning in on headphones. Can McDowall see a time when audio and video split off again and become distinct mediums? “I hope so,” she replies. “The absence of images from radio and podcasting isn’t some failure of technology. These audio mediums have grown from a deep love of sound and its imaginative possibilities. When I hear people say the future of audio is essentially television, it makes me feel they never knew what was exciting about sound in the first place.”Judging from the speed at which visualised podcasts have taken hold, it’s clear that they are here to stay. Even so, the focus of major networks on eyeballs over ears overlooks not only the capacity of audio to spark the imagination but also its intrinsic convenience. One of the reasons I love audio pods is that they allow me to do other things while listening, such as walking the dog or cooking. For dedicated audiophiles, poor sound quality or content aimed primarily at viewers is unlikely to drive them to sit down and watch the visual version instead. They will simply switch off altogether.Explore more on these topicsPodcastsPodcastingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a well-trodden theme, though usually sung by classic dude troubadours such as Townes Van Zandt or Merle Haggard: no matter where she runs, she’s herself, and it’s a problem. But the song’s crescendo is one of the prettiest, and lasting, that I have heard in a while. After losing love (or maybe it was just some guy), the singer resolves to replace all of her glass with paper plates – “things I cannot break”.Alaina DemopoulosLisa Knapp and Gerry Diver – Long LankinThe 10 best folk albums of 2025Read moreThe most transfixing song too few people heard in 2025 has actually been around for nearly 300 years. Long Lankin, an insanely violent traditional folk murder ballad, has been performed by musical ghouls since at least the 1750s. Far more recently, its dark soul has been conjured by trad stars as esteemed asMartin Carthy,Shirley Collinsand Steeleye Span. Never, however, have I heard a version as bone-chilling as the one by the Englishfolk starLisa Knapp. (It appears onHinterland, her first album co-credited to her longtime partner in music, life and, for all I know, crime, Gerry Diver). Knapp’s quavering soprano manages to sound, at once, pristine and menacing, a silky ghost of a thing equally skilled at seduction and threat. The clarity of her tone has a Sandy Denny purity, but her vibrato portends imminent danger, underscored by Diver’s creepy-crawly glockenspiel and Pete Flood’s spooky drums, which have the jazzy surprise of Terry Cox’s work with Pentangle. While the musicians orchestrate the shifting perspectives of the lyric, Knapp delivers a vocal so arresting, you won’t know whether to shudder or swoon.Jim FarberMidnightRoba– Axis (featSaul Williams)Roba El-Essawy AKA MidnightRoba was the soulful voice of 90s British trip-hop band Attica Blues and has more recently been releasing music solo, including 2025’s self-released second album, Raise A Symphony – a call for “peace, love, justice, solidarity, righteousness, compassion, empathy and care”. Lead track Axis, produced by El-Essawy, is a maelstrom of splintered, IDM-style electronica, hypnotic interlocking loops, skittering, restless rushes of tabla and operatic vocals in tribute to the children who’ve been killed in Gaza and those grieving them. It features the guest incantations of poet, actor and activist Saul Williams, who has been nominated alongside New Age maestroCarlos Niñoat the upcoming Grammys and with whom El-Essawy recently performed at the Pitchfork London festival. An anthem for screaming into the void when it feels like no one is listening. As Williams says on the track: “It’s beyond exhausting.”Kate HutchinsonCleyra– There’s Nothing Happening Between UsThere is a tiny handful of blurred or obscured pics of Cleyra out in the world and even less biographical info, beyond the fact they’re a producer from Bristol in the UK. Perhaps that’s all to the good, allowing for greater mystery and deeper immersion into their mist-wreathed music, which seems to drift through the walls of a multi-room nightclub like an ex-raver in purgatory. Their album-length EP remember this body? features five universally strong tracks, from the reggaeton-adjacent Conundrum to the post-R&B soundscape Just Can’t Live Without Ya and three flavours of techno in between, including the 17-minute There’s Nothing Happening Between Us. That long runtime allows for a proper trip, as 4/4 drums chart a course through a murky sea with explosions emanating from the deep, before surfacing into cleaner drum programming and alarm sounds, as if returning to consciousness in an unfamiliar ambulance. Then ambient techno carries you back into a stupor. Few other dance producers attempted anything quite so ambitious in a single track this year.Ben Beaumont-ThomasDom Innarella – Call MeNew York’s humble neighbor to the east in the form of New Jersey has produced plenty of Italian American singing talent. (Looking at you, Sinatra). Now, 14 year-old Dom Innarella prepares to take the stage. His smooth falsetto originally launched him into TikTok-viral fame with listeners comparing him to a young Justin Bieber. Now, his own version ofBieber fevermay not be far behind. (Innarella-mania?) His past year was a big one, with the singer signing with Republic Records and releasing a series of throwback pop and R&B singles that harken back to Bieber’s early days. Aside from his breakout Bout Me and a recent cover of It’s Beginning To Look a Lot Like Christmas, Inarella’s acoustic and drum machine-driven Call Me reminds one of Usher’s glory days. No wonder why he’searned kudosfrom the man himself, along with J Balvin and Teddy Swims. With a debut album on the horizon, the future could belong to another voice from the Garden state.Rob LeDonneJammy – Right TimeJammy is an artist I first encountered back in 2017 withMargarita, a sad, post-summer ode to dreaming of a love that fades when the sun stops shining. It remains under-heard (a music video with fewer than 30,000 views, the Google search “jammy margarita” leading to recipes for a margarita with jam) but it’s a monster hit compared with his EP this year. The best track,Right Time, hasn’t even hit 60 views on YouTube (!) with a Spotify count not even notable enough to register (the artist himself only reaches under 3,000 listeners a month). It is therefore something of a public service for me to bring it to light, another mellow and lightly melancholic winner about a lost love, this time one who’s now in a new thankless relationship and maybe needs the help to get out? Or maybe he’s just fooling himself, a sense of delusion running through his back-and-forth, gently switching between cocksure and vulnerable. It’s too good to be kept a secret.Benjamin LeeAnika – Walk Away“The truth is I don’t really like myself / And the truth is I don’t really like anyone else” is an opening gambit so direct it almost dares you to flinch. But Walk Away never sinks into a confessional wallow; it keeps strutting forward as if refusing to grant despair the dignity of stillness. Annika Henderson’s voice arrives coolly detached, half-spoken, half-sung, floating above bright, jangling guitars whose breeziness feels deliberately mismatched to the venom in her words. That tension is the point. The Berlin-based hybrid artist – and former journalist – has always understood the power of saying things plainly, and Walk Away reads like column inches finally allowed to shout. It’s a four-and-a-half-minute anthem of irritation and self-loathing that somehow lands as liberating rather than bleak, its grunge-inflected pulse recalling the reckless candor of 90s alt-rock without leaning into nostalgia. The chorus doesn’t explode so much as sharpen, circling the same unsparing truths until they start to feel oddly cathartic. In an era of hyper-managed vulnerability, Walk Away is refreshingly unfiltered: a song that refuses both likability and apology, sounding all the better for it.Bryan Armen GrahamExplore more on these topicsMusic2025 in culturePop and rockIndieDance musicFolk musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But after his early music career faltered, he began to write about his troubled childhood – and hit a nerveSat 27 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTShareFromNewham, LondonRecommended if you likeDave, Bashy, NemzzzUp nextDebut mixtape planned for springIt’s a measure of how quickly Keaton Edmund, AKA Kidwild, has speed-run his way through a performing arts career that the rapper describes himself as being in the “comeback part of my life” at age 20.As a child he was acting opposite Beverley Knight in The Bodyguard in the West End and toured the production around China. He had a main role in four seasons of CBBC football drama Jamie Johnson and appeared on Casualty. You can see him dancing in the video to Stormzy’s 2017 single Vossi Bop, a baby-faced scamp swinging a baseball bat into the camera lens. It all made him grow up fast. “I was spending bare time alone, bare time with older people. So I just started seeing life for what it is. You get time to sit with your thoughts.”Bored during Covid,he ordered a microphone and began crafting rap songs of his own. Half a decade on, he now has millions of listeners drawn to his candid storytelling about his life’s struggles. But not until after a false start.By 17,he had signed to major label Atlantic Records – so young that his mum had to chaperone him to the signing. But after Edmund had released two tracks, the person who signed him left, and he was left in limbo. “For everything to just go cold, you start second-guessing yourself,” he says, speaking with expansive, gentle gestures on a Guardian office sofa, his features still almost as boyish as in that Stormzy video. “It’s kind of degrading, because you’re meant to be the next star, as they said, and then you just exist.” After a third track “didn’t live up to their expectation – I don’t know what their expectation was”, he was dropped.But that newfound freedom left him feeling “like I came out of jail”. He felt charged up at the prospect of making a career on his own. When his self-released track Indecisive started gaining traction in October 2024 – it’s since been streamed 29m times on Spotify – he was visiting family in St Lucia. “Everything I ever wanted was happening, and I’m just sitting at my grandma’s house in the village.” He flew home, then a day later he went to the studio and “in a flow state” wrote the hook to Redemption – one of the biggest British rap tracks of 2025. “How can I stop when I come this far? / I smile outside, deep down I’m scarred”, he rapped. Later in the year, on superb JBee collaboration If I Lose, he tells a lover: “I just want you to hold me.”Vulnerability has soared in rap over the last decade, but Kidwild is particularly soul-baring over his atmospheric, drill-adjacent beats. Is it taboo for men to be so open with their emotions? “It’s true – you see it in the suicide rates in men compared to women,” he says. “A lot of men don’t open up. With songs where I’m quite vulnerable, people message me and say: I relate to this so much. If they are one of them people who don’t like to speak on their emotions, at least they have Kidwild to relate to.”The most potent of these tracks is his recent single Forgive Me, about his relationship with his father who was imprisoned for a number of years. “I was calling your phone, never got no reception / The only pic I got of us is me in Reception,” Kidwild raps, crestfallen. “I remember the first time I got a call from jail,” he says. “I didn’t want to speak. I said hi, and that was it, just gave my mum back the phone.” On the track he spits out: “Is it a crime if I say I’m glad he got sentenced?” But after five years of no contact, they are beginning to reconcile. “When we speak about it now, I laugh because it’s like, now that I’m older, I understand life more. I see why I was angry.”A forthcoming mixtape is “a chance to talk my truth” and chart his difficult youth. “A lot of music now, there’s not much topic, it’s just like …” Vibes? “Vibes, yeah – which is good! I like vibes music. But I wanted to add something different, get in depth.”Explore more on these topicsCultureNew music for 2026RapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Known for his surreally bittersweet short stories, George Saunders has written only one novel so far – but that one won the Booker prize. The follow-up to 2017’s Lincoln in the Bardo,Vigil(Bloomsbury) focuses on an unquiet spirit called Jill who helps others pass over from life to whatever comes next. She is called to the deathbed of an oil tycoon who is rapidly running out of time to face up to his ecological crimes, in a rallying cry for human connection and environmental action. Ali Smith’sGlyph(Hamish Hamilton) is a companion to 2024’s Gliff, and promises to tell a story initially hidden in that previous novel. Expect fables, siblings, phantoms and horses in a typically playful shout of resistance against war, genocide and the increasingly hostile social discourse. And inDeparture(s)(Jonathan Cape), Julian Barnes announces his own – this blend of memoir and fiction, exploring memory, illness, mortality and love across the decades, will be his last book. “Your presence has delighted me,” he assures the reader. “Indeed, I would be nothing without you.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bloomsbury/PAThe Hamnet adaptation hits UK cinemas in January, but Maggie O’Farrell’s next novel isn’t out until June.Land(Tinder), a multigenerational saga which opens in 19th-century Ireland in the wake of the famine, is inspired by her own family history and centres on a man tasked with mapping the country for the Ordnance Survey. There’ll be much anticipation, too, forThe Things We Never Sayfrom Elizabeth Strout (Viking, May). The ultra-prolific Strout is adored for her interconnected novels, but this story of a man with a secret is a standalone, introducing characters we’ve never met before. InJohn of John(Picador, May) Douglas Stuart, author of much-loved Booker winner Shuggie Bain, portrays a young gay man returning home from art school to the lonely croft on the Hebridean island where he grew up. And September sees a new novel from Irish writer Sebastian Barry:The Newer World(Faber) follows Costa winner Days Without End and A Thousand Moons in transporting the reader to late 19th-century America in the aftermath of the Civil War.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jonathan Cape/PAApart from his pulpy collaboration with Keanu Reeves on The Book of Elsewhere, fantasy legend China Miéville hasn’t published a novel for adults since 2011’s Embassytown.The Rouse(Picador, September) has been 20 years in the writing and promises dark conspiracies and uncanny forces in a continent-spanning epic. Other returns to look out for include John Lanchester with a black comedy of entitlement and generational resentment set amid the metropolitan elite,Look WhatYou Made Me Do(Faber, March), and Life of Pi author Yann Martel’s ambitiousSon of Nobody(Canongate, April), in which a classical scholar uncovers a lost account of the Trojan war. The translated poem unfolds at the top of the page, with heartfelt footnotes addressed to his young daughter below, in a meditation on mythmaking, homemaking and storytelling. Gwendoline Riley has built a reputation as a deadpan genius of dysfunctional relationships; she follows 2021’s My Phantoms withThe Palm House(Picador, April), a sly dark comedy about a long friendship between two prickly people enduring in the face of the world’s disappointments.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Fourth Estate/PAAsako Yuzuki’s Butter, featuring a gourmet cook turned serial killer, has become a slow-burn sensation (“There are two things that I can simply not tolerate: feminists and margarine”). Author and translator Polly Barton are reunited inHooked(4th Estate, March), another exploration of food, friendship and female experience in contemporary Japan.Three award winners return. Tayari Jones took the Women’s prize for American Marriage in 2019;Kin(Oneworld, March) focuses on two motherless daughters in the segregated American south. Geetanjali Shree follows up her 2022 International Booker winner Tomb of Sand withThe Roof Beneath Their Feet(translated by Rahul Soni, And Other Stories, February), charting women’s lives in India. And inThe End of Everything(Serpent’s Tail, June), M John Harrison, whose previous novel The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again won the Goldsmiths prize in 2020, continues his unsettling destabilisation of our contemporary moment.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Oneworld PublicationsSecond novels to get excited about include Louise Kennedy’s follow-up to the award-winning and recently seen-on-TV Trespasses;Stations(Bloomsbury, September) traces the relationship of two Irish teenagers from the early 80s onwards. In Jacqueline Crooks’sSky City(Cape, August), the Fire Rush author focuses on a woman in 90s London trying to escape her past. Gabriel Tallent’s 2017 debut My Absolute Darling divided readers with its intense tale of an abusive father and his rebellious daughter; the follow-upCrux(Fig Tree, February) is a portrait of friendship and thrill-seeking between two young climbers in an impoverished California community . Megha Majumdar won high praise with her 2020 debut A Burning.A Guardian and a Thief(Scribner, January) is another depiction of Indian inequality, set in a near-future Kolkata ravaged by climate change; while inThe Last of Earth(Oneworld, February) Deepa Anappara follows her acclaimed 2020 adventure about children under threat in an Indian shantytown, Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line, with a historical novel featuring outsiders venturing into the Forbidden Kingdom of Tibet.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pan MacmillanShort stories from Colm Tóibín delve into the inner lives of people living far from home inThe News from Dublin(Picador, March), which ranges from Ireland to Argentina to the Spanish civil war, while American author Sigrid Nunez publishes her first story collection, the career-spanningIt Will Come Back to You(Virago, August).Finally, a treat for the autumn as Louisa Young embarks on a continuation of her aunt Elizabeth Jane Howard’s ultimate comfort read The Cazalet Chronicles, the sprawling saga of an upper-middle-class English family set around the second world war that has enthralled readers since the first volume was published in 1990.The Golden Hours(Mantle, September) opens at Christmas 1962, in a country on the brink of change. It will explore the final years of the old guard and the changing fortunes of the family, as well as new characters and new stories.To browse and preorder the titles in the 2026 lookahead, visitguardianbookshop.com.

Enjoy the rest of the holidays and we’ll see you this time next week for the first Guide of 2026!TV“Get Millie Black(Channel 4), in which Tamara Lawrance gives a powerhouse performance as a loose-cannon detective investigating a case in Jamaica. The settings are a tonic in these dreary months, and the theme song (Ring the Alarm by Shanique Marie) is a belter. But be warned: the content of the final, London-set episode goes to some dark places.” –Richard Hamilton“How good wasDying For Sex! This drama about a terminally ill woman embarking on an erotic odyssey was so funny and sad and true and daring. There has never been anything like it on TV. And I haven’t seen a better double act than Michelle Williams and Jenny Slate in years. I’m gutted it can’t come back but hopefully they find some other way to continue their partnership.” –J Roberts“I don’t know if this year saw the best series ofSlow Horses, but it was surely the season that featured the best scene: when Jackson Lamb told a shocking story about Soviet torture methods in the cold war that doubled up as a personal history. I see that the next series is already on the way – can’t wait!” –Toby“The Studio– fantastically laugh-out-loud humour, suitably flawed characters and stunning LA backdrops made this a really fun watch.” –Andrew GartsideMusic“Radiohead’s appearance in November was an unexpected treat and a lovely way to round off my 50th year. Having spent my life following music and going to gigs, it was a joy to be part of such an event – one of the best concerts I’ve been to. Even ending up with tickets in the first place was a great surprise. A generous, diverse set list with the band on fine form, an interesting stage setup and enthusiastic crowd – couldn’t have asked for more.” –Calum Byron“The Cords’ debut album. From the blistering opening burst of Fabulist to the blissful When You Said Goodbye, these 13 tunes in 31 minutes will put a huge smile on your face. It’s the Shop Assistants meets the Housemartins. And it’s fucking brilliant.” –Geoff Dixon“Virgin was a great return to electro-dance-pop for New Zealand’s finest export,Lorde,after the minor disappointment of 2021’s Solar Power album (actually great to put on for chilled summer vibes but so much to live up to, with Melodrama being the best album of the 2010s and Pure Heroine the second best). Always herself, no matter how odd, she writes the most incisive lyrics. It’ll take a few listens then you’ll realise: bloody hell this is a very raw description of her eating disorder. Or sleeping with too many blokes. Or a complicated relationship with her mother. All with a killer chorus. Her honesty has sometimes taken my breath away, but when it’s matched with insane charisma (live it’s quite astounding) and her “this is me, take-it-or-leave-it” attitude, I fall even deeper in love.” –Suzanne StocktonFilm“Corey FeldmanvsThe World, a documentary about the former child star’s failed attempt at a tour with his rock band. It initially plays on the perceived naivety of Feldman and his cringe-inducing lack of awareness, but when the fun stops and the paranoia starts, it reveals his true character. Quite the ride.”– David Gander“The most underrated film of the year is definitelySeptember 5, the heart-stopping drama about how the ABC Sports team covered the massacre at the 1972 Munich Olympics. I haven’t seen another film that wrestles so well with the ethics around getting a scoop, and the performances are fantastic, especially Peter Sarsgaard as the unflappable station chief. The period detail is great too, with all the wide-collared shirts and chunky TV equipment. Definitely check it out.”– Jess, nr Lichfield“It’s so hard to look pastSinnersas the film of 2025, given that it got everyone returning to the cinema – at least for a week. A creepy, gory vampire film that was about something and had so much style. Also, what a soundtrack! I also lovedBring Her BackandWeapons, two more horror films that made you feel something – and think!”– Amy HamiltonIf you want to read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive The Guide in your inbox every FridayExplore more on these topicsCultureThe Guide newsletterSinnersLordenewslettersShareReuse this content"

First, he had visited Agra, to capture the Taj Mahal. The next morning, he awoke before dawn to visit the Yamuna River. Despite being one of the most polluted bodies of water in the world, locals can be seen fishing while visitors take boat rides from the ghat, the name for the flight of stairs that leads to the water.“In this image, the people on the boats are feeding the birds,” Ghai adds. “They call out ‘Aww, aww’ and the birds glide towards that spot, as if they instantly recognise the familiar call of kindness.”While Ghai toyed with the option of converting the image to black and white, he eventually chose to retain the colour. “This version felt more real – the gleaming hues of sunrise blending with the mist, the birds moving across the pale sky,” he adds. “It held the soul of the morning.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographySmart shotArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In May of this year, I went for an upright MRI for a minor injury on my arm, and the scan happened to catch the mass in my neck. By the following month, I had a diagnosis. People kept telling me it was “the good cancer”, the kind that can be taken out neatly and has a high survival rate. But I’m 54, and my dad died of cancer in his 50s, so that shadow came down on me hard.My eldest son was doing A-levels at the time, so we didn’t tell him at first. I felt as if I’d stepped across some irreversible Rubicon that you hear about happening to other people, but never imagine will actually come for you.After my diagnosis, I retreated. I barely left the house. My neck was bruised and swollen, as if I’d attempted some sort of gruesome Halloween makeup. I felt peeled-open and humiliated, as though strangers could look straight through my skin. Friends and family stepped up: my brother, who lives hours away, and I had this incredible chat for hours on a park bench in the sunshine. Still, I curled inward.It wasn’t until later that summer that my mum managed to coax me out for lunch and a trip to the Whitworth Art Gallery, in Manchester near where I live. There was aJMW Turnerexhibition on. I knew his name and his work in the way most people do: big ships, sweeping seascapes of blues and golds. The grand stuff of someone else’s life. I didn’t want culture or fresh air or anything that required being seen, but I agreed to go to please her.The exhibition rooms were dark and quiet, lined with sepia prints. My mum moved from caption to caption, reading each one carefully. I drifted behind her, barely looking. When you’re waiting for more test results, for the next consultant meeting, for someone to tell you whether cancer has threaded itself further into your body, nothing penetrates.I was about to sneak off to the cafe  when one painting stopped me in my tracks. The print was Mount St Gothard, from 1808. In it, a pack horse stands on a mountain path, exhausted and pausing to catch its breath, with its head hanging low to the ground. The cargo on its back looks impossible. It was like looking in a mirror.It felt absurd, recognising myself in a horse on a Swiss mountain painted more than 200 years ago. But there I was. The horse was me. The overburdened body. The sense of not knowing how much more of the journey there was to go. For the first time in weeks, something cut through the fog. My feelings – the ones I’d been hiding, managing, downplaying so I didn’t worry everyone else – had shape.It was a moment of recognition. I had been managing everyone’s expectations around my illness, and seeing the horse gave me permission to let some support in. Yes, being able to sit in misery, darkness and fear was a necessary part of the process for me, but it couldn’t be done for ever.There’s now a 10-mile tunnel through the mountain in the painting: it takes 14 minutes by car. The horse must have taken hours.Months later, with two surgeries to fully remove my thyroid completed, and radioactive iodine treatment ahead of me marking my final medical hurdle, I’m finally starting to feel more like myself. I’m back at work, and I’m even ready to pick up the creative bits of life I’d dropped: the DIY; the craft-making; the messier, more joyful things that make me feel alive.It wasn’t the diagnosis, or the operations, or even the relief of curability of my cancer that marked a turning point. It was Turner’s horse. He made it to the top of the mountain carrying all that baggage, and was going to go back down the other side and have that pack taken off.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The foundation of my culinary education was unconventional, to say the least. In the 90s, I was taught by my best friend, Ben Hodges, formerly of theRiver Café, and brother to Jake Hodges, who co-foundedMoroin London. We’d cater for hundreds at weddings, and thousands at festivals from Glastonbury to Green Man, cooking Spanish- and Italian-influenced food. When we weren’t getting stuck in ditches in muddy fields, we’d be driving to the south of Spain in search of olive oil and life.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That education led to a lifelong passion for Spanish and Italian cuisine, and I’m still enamoured of their effortless simplicity, technique and flavour. The bedrock of Mediterranean cuisine is founded on heritage products created for preservation: prosciutto, coppa and bresaola (cured beef) from Italy, and jamón serrano, lomo and chorizo from Spain, to name just a few.With a bounty of regional food products to feast on, most festive meals begin with antipasti, tapas or pintxos: small snacks of charcuterie, preserved vegetables and more elaborate small plates, crostini, flavoursome ferments and preserves, cheese and crunchy snacks, such as dried fava beans or corn. My favourite meals often begin with these treats.Supermarkets sell assorted antipasti and tapas charcuterie platters, and today I’ve tested 10 selection packs. The quality was generally high, with wafer-thin slices of well-cured charcuterie, though animal welfare credentials were notably lacking and nitrate- and nitrite-free products hard to find. That said, most prosciutto is cured simply with salt, so that’s a great choice if you want to avoid those compounds.The best supermarket antipasti cured meatsBest overall:Waitrose No 1 antipasto mistoView image in fullscreen£4.80 for 120g at Waitrose (£4/100g)★★★★☆Three cured meats: PDO prosciutto di Parma and salame brianza, and coppa. Quintessentially Italian with delicate, wafer-thin slices, all made from Italian pork. Waitrose has committed to sourcing continental meat to specific standards and to improving traceability. High quality and great value.Best bargain:Brindisa Iglesias Spanish charcuterie selectionView image in fullscreen£8.50 for 200g at Ocado (£4.25/100g)★★★☆☆Exquisite, deeply cured serrano ham, chorizo, salchichón and lomo, all helpfully individually packed, so you can enjoy them across several days. Tender, thin slices that melt in the mouth. Produced by Cárnicas Iglesias, a heritage Salamanca brand since 1928, using Spanish pork. Very good quality for the price.And the rest …Duchy Organic antipasto mistoView image in fullscreen£5 for 90g at Waitrose (£5.56/100g)★★★★☆A trio from Lombardy: Milano salami, spianata Romana salami and lonza (cured loin).

Six outdoor-bred pork snack salamis (three plain and three fennel and chilli), award-winning air-dried ham and beef bresaola, all with outstanding depth of flavour. Eye-wateringly expensive, yes, but great for a special occasion.M&S Italian antipasto selectionView image in fullscreen£5.50 for 110g at Ocado (£5/100g)★★★☆☆A trio of prosciutto di Parma, salami Milano and bresaola (cured beef). The bresaola adds an element of variety, while the classic salami and ham are well-flavoured, if slightly salty. The 24-month-cured ham is almost too thin to lift out of the tray, though. Made in Italy with Italian pork and British beef. Classic M&S quality and great value.Tesco Finest Italian antipasto platterView image in fullscreen£6.95 for 188g at Tesco (£3.70/100g)★★★☆☆A generous party pack featuring four styles of meat: dry-cured ham, coppa, garlic salami and spicy salami. The coppa, with its thick marbling and aromatic notes of nutmeg and coriander, stands out, while the spicy salami has a nice kick. Good value and great taste.Morrisons the Best Italian antipasto selectionView image in fullscreen£3.50 for 100g at Morrisons (£3.50/100g)★★☆☆☆A traditional selection featuring sweet, extra-thin prosciutto with fine marbling and garlicky, peppery, medium-thin salami. A straightforward and tasty antipasto made with Italian pork.Sainsbury’s Italian antipasto selectionView image in fullscreen£3 for 120g at Sainsbury’s (£2.50/100g)★★☆☆☆A trio of classic meats: prosciutto crudo and Napoli and Milano salami. Sweet, well-cured ham, and there are fragrant whole peppercorns in the salami. Clean, well-kept slices with a good overall texture. Packed in Italy using a mix of Italian and Dutch pork.Co-op Italian-style antipastoView image in fullscreen£4 for 120g (£3.33/100g)★★☆☆☆A classic selection of salami, air-dried ham andventricina. The latter is the standout, with a piquant, aromatic and complex flavour. Wafer-thin slices that really do melt in the mouth. A good low-cost option offering good flavour for the price.Asda Exceptional Italian gran antipastoView image in fullscreen£3.97 for 120g at Asda (£3.31/100g)★★☆☆☆A selection of prosciutto, coppa and Milano salami. The coppa is the star, with a deep red colour, marbled fat and a medium-thin cut that helps it retain some bite, though it is a touch salty. Sweet-tasting ham complements the selection.

Ditchling – the start and end point of the walk – has two pubs, the White Horse and the Bull, alongside 36 buildings dating from the 1500s to 1800s. Most notable isWings Place, gifted to Anne of Cleves in her divorce settlement from Henry VIII in 1540.Within a couple of minutes’ walk from the heart of the village, you’re in open fields. Head right out of the car park and look for a right turn, signposted “to the Downs”. With the church spire behind you, the path leads diagonally into leafy woodland, before heading south towards Underhill Lane, and the steep climb up to Ditchling Beacon.Order a glass of Plumpton Estate wine and check out the pub’s famous painting of dozens of its regulars, including Raymond BriggsThe Beacon is a pull (248 metres), but the view is spectacular: south to Brighton and the silvery wastes of the English Channel, north across the Sussex Weald to Ashdown Forest and the Surrey Hills. Walk east along the South Downs Way, before an unmade road takes you downhill, directly into the welcoming arms of theHalf Moonat Plumpton.Of all the pubs in the area, the Half Moon is my favourite: independent, ungentrified and supportive of local producers. Order a glass of Plumpton Estate wine and check out the pub’s famous painting of dozens of its regulars, including Raymond Briggs and Jimmy Page, done over a nine-month period in 1979. Sunday lunches are hearty roasts, with good vegan options (two/three courses, £24.95/£29.95), alongside a local catch of the day and homemade pies.The good news is that the second half of the walk is flat. Well-signed paths skirt the grounds of Plumpton College, before heading back across fields and pastMy Little Farm, a new community smallholding. Once at the bridleway, turn back to see a forested “V” of beech, fir and lime trees on the side of the hill, planted in 1887 to mark Queen Victoria’s golden jubilee. I always sneak a peak through the gates at Streat Place, an elegant Elizabethan manor house, before the final, straight-line stretch across open fields to Ditchling – where a choice of pubs awaits.Annabelle ThorpeHighgate to Little Venice, LondonView image in fullscreenNarrowboats moored on the canal at Little Venice.Photograph: Barry Teutenberg/AlamyDistance: 8 milesDuration: 3½ hoursStartHighgate tube stationFinishThe Prince Alfred, Maida ValeStarting at Highgate tube station, follow Southwood Lane into Highgate village, noting the former home ofMary Kingsley, a Victorian explorer who had the chutzpah to chat up cannibals in the Amazon. At Pond Square, admire the array of London plane trees (planted in bulk across the city because they could handle the pollution), before proceeding south down Swain’s Lane toHighgate Cemetery(adults £10) to pay your respects to Bob Hoskins (made films), George Michael (made music) and Karl Marx (made a terrible fuss about the exploitation of workers).You’re in Hampstead village now, which is either good or bad depending on your dispositionCut through Oakeshott Avenue – a distinctive street of mock-Tudor mansions – to Hampstead Heath, where you should resist the temptation to have a dip in the men’s pond (Mum, I’m talking to you), and instead continue west until you hit upon East Heath Road. From here, wiggle north-west to Well Walk, where you’ll find the erstwhile abodes of JB Priestley and John Constable, as well asthe Wells Tavern, a good spot to get some liquid on board. Follow Well Walk west until it splits, at which point err right on to Flask Walk, which you should follow to its terminus.You’re in Hampstead village now, which is either good or bad depending on your disposition. Meander south-east to Belsize village, where it’s possible to rest your legs or get a bagel fromRoni’s. Continue south on Belsize Park Gardens (the composer Frederick Delius lived at No 44) before doing a quick left-right on to Primrose Gardens, about as attractive an oval of terraced housing as you’re liable to find.In Primrose Hill village itself, you’ll find the former homes of Sylvia Plath (opposite Chalcot Square) and Friedrich Engels (opposite Le Tea Cosy). Climb to the summit of the village’s eponymous mound, exit the park on its west side then proceed along St Edmund’s Terrace to St John’s Wood High Street, where even the charity shops are flogging designer gear for serious dough.You’re now a stone’s throw from the zebra crossing on Abbey Road made famous by the Beatles, upon which you should absolutely take your time posing, because the motorists love it. Follow Hall Road to Hamilton Terrace, at the southern end of which you’ll find the former gaff of Joseph Bazalgette, who scored brownie points with Londoners by designing the city’s sewer system. Cross Maida Vale and enter Little Venice, a concentration of canals that probably doesn’t warrant its moniker. Follow the aromas of ale and roast beef tothe Prince Alfred, where dinner awaits. The pub is an absolute beauty, worth a visit for its vintage interior alone. Bottoms up! (Or down, rather …)Ben AitkenBath, SomersetView image in fullscreenBath is an ‘an urban blip in a hug of hills’ … the Royal Crescent.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/AlamyDistance10 milesDuration5 hoursStart/finishBath AbbeyBath is a city lost in the countryside, an urban blip in a hug of hills. Even standing in the heart of its Georgian gorgeousness, those green billows beckon you out. So I turn my back on the Abbey, step on the Cotswold Way marker stone by its hefty doors, and walk away.This National Trail starts (or ends) in Bath, and provides the finest route out of town. It’s tricky, picking out the waymarks amid theChristmasmarket crowds, but eventually I duck down Quiet Street and then pass the city’s greatest hits: Queen Square, The Circus, the sweeping Royal Crescent, resplendent in low winter light.As the trail winds westward and up – and there’s a lot of up to come – the tourists thin. I skirt Royal Victoria Park, nod to the golfers on High Common and drop into Weston village. Here, the Cotswolds proper start to rise.I’ve walked and run this route a hundred times, but still … how is this sylvan promenade so close to a city? I feel my lungs expand; I want to sing to the sheep, to the rolling slopes, to the hump of Kelston Roundhill, with its wig of winter-naked trees. Best is Prospect Stile, from where you can see Bath, the Mendips, even Wales. And it’s never better than now: blush pink on a crisp winter afternoon, as if embarrassed by its own good looks.The Cotswold Way heads left here. Instead, I veer right across the racecourse and around the cirque beneath Beckford’s Tower – a gilt-topped monument to Georgian eccentricity, open most winter weekends. Nearby, a footpath leads left to Lansdown Road, and to the hillsideHare & Hounds.This 17th-century inn is a great summer pub: it has Bath’s best beer garden, looking across the winsome Charlcombe valley. With a thick coat, you could still nurse a pint of Proper Job outside. Fortunately, it also has a full wall of mullioned windows. I opt to enjoy the view from inside, where a real fire crackles and good roasts are served.I’ve walked seven miles now, and could bus back to town. But instead I backtrack to the trail below Beckford’s, continuing to walk. The views remain superb. And this way I can wind through salubrious backstreets that deliver peak Bath-ness minus the crowds – not least Lansdown Crescent, a rival to the Royal. Eventually, I make it back to the abbey, this time walking towards its exquisite west front, but still with an eye to the hills beyond.Sarah BaxterBroadway Tower, the CotswoldsView image in fullscreenBroadway Tower in the Cotswolds.Photograph: James Osmond/Getty ImagesDistance4 milesDuration2½ hoursStart/finishWar memorial, Broadway High StreetThe dog’s tail is wagging hard. We’ve brought her to Broadway on a chilly Saturday afternoon – a time she usually saves for snoring belly up – and there are canines at every turn. Pugs leaving coffee shops, beagles eyeing up knitwear boutiques, terriers cooing over the 16th-century limestone architecture. The dog owners of south-east Worcestershire are out in force, although as visitors our goal lies elsewhere. We’re heading for the hills.Broadway is well named. Some Cotswolds honeypots feel hemmed in, but the wide, handsome high street has a calming sense of space, especially in lesser-visited winter. A rich history too: the Beaker people, the Romans, medieval wool traders, TikTok influencers – all have passed through Broadway, pulled in different ways by the rolling countryside.It’s what’s drawn us, too. We’re walking anofficial National Trails circular route, meaning decent signage, loads of puddly kissing gates and big, billowing views. We exit the high street on to a footpath. The escarpment to the south is topped by the turreted silhouette of Broadway Tower, our end goal. Green landscapes swell around us.A patchwork of towns and farmland spills out below us; Birmingham is a speck on the blustery horizonThe first section is an easy ramble across grassy meadows, and ridge and furrow undulations, before the path leads upwards along a thigh-sapping avenue of sycamores. Higher now, we cross more tussocky fields as the panoramas open up. Visible far to the west is the spine of the Malvern Hills. The sky is blue. The wind is cold and mud scented. The dog is in heaven.The complex around the tower arrives suddenly, complete with a cafe and playground. The tower itself – a hexagonal structure built as a folly in the 1790s – is the second highest point in the Cotswolds. Designer William Morris came here regularly to draw inspiration. A patchwork of towns and farmland spills out below us; Birmingham is a speck on the blustery horizon.The Cotswold Way descends steeply back into Broadway and we make for the 17th-centuryCrown & Trumpet. A 35-year mainstay in the Good Beer Guide, it’s a short wander off the main drag and something of a rarity in these parts: in place of chichi decor it has an open fire, framed beer mats and a well-trodden carpet. Pints of Shagweaver and bowls of cheesy chips hit the spot. And the dog? Ready for that snooze.Ben LerwillBurnley to Worston viaPendle Hill, LancashireView image in fullscreenPendle Hill.Photograph: Alex West/Getty ImagesDistance11½ milesDuration6 hoursStartBurnleyFinishCalf’s Head, WorstonIn this corner of east Lancashire, Pendle Hill – an outlier of the Pennine spine – separates industrial and agricultural, built-up and empty, the urban working-class from the rural upper-middles. Burnley, the start point, is known for coal as well as cotton, football and cricket, not to mention gay rights and Benedictine liqueur.Take theBurnley Wayto the banks of the Calder, the river that powered and watered the early mills. From here, follow thePendle Wayto Higham, which gets you on to the southern slopes of Pendle Hill. Sheep, dry-stone walls and steep climbs take over. A zigzagging route takes you up to Newchurch in Pendle, a tiny hamlet perched on a tight bend in the road. St Mary’s church has an “eye of god” on its tower to deter evil spirits, and a tomb by the rear wall bears the name of one Ellin Nutter. The 1651 date could make her a relative of Alice Nutter, who was hanged after theLancaster witch trials.This area is marked as the Forest of Pendle on maps. A former royal chase, it was later used for vaccaries (pastures for cows). Note the recurrence of “booth” in local placenames, alluding to the huts used by herdsmen. Look south for views over the chain of towns that grew up around yarn and cloth. From left (east) to right (west), there’s Barrowford, Colne, Nelson, Brierfield, Burnley, Accrington, Oswaldtwistle and Blackburn – to name only the larger places. For residents of all, Pendle Hill and the nearby West Pennine Moors are the main recreational spaces, airy heights that in the smoky old days provided respite for lungs and legs.The 557-metre climb to the trig point at the top of Pendle Hill goes via Fell Wood, between the two Ogden reservoirs and along Boar Clough – clough is another local word, used for a steep-sided ravine. Barley Moor opens out here, hopefully with a few peewits or even a hawk battling the westerlies. From the trig, it’s a breezy saunter across the mesa-like top of the hill, now with views north to the Yorkshire Three Peaks and Bowland Fells, to drop down to Worston from the Pile of Stones on Pendle Moor.You’ve passed pub options already – at Higham and Barley – but theCalf’s Headis a well-liked, well-run village pub all on its own in Worston. There’s a single small snug with three tables and an open fire, and more tables – for food or drink – in the pub lounge and in an annexe. If the weather’s fine, the beer garden is a real beauty. Timothy Taylor’s and local Moorhouse’s ales are generally available. The menu is massive; I rate the seafood sharing board, hot pot and plate pie.From Worston, it’s a short walk to Clitheroe for onward trains and buses. Take care crossing the A59. If you want a longer walk, you can avoid the busy carriageway altogether by taking a loop along West Lane and through the villages of Downham and Chatburn, which have three more pubs between them.Chris MossSt Mawganand Mawgan Porth, CornwallView image in fullscreenSea stacks at Bedruthan Steps.Photograph: Helen Hotson/AlamyDistance5.4 milesDuration2 hoursStart/finishThe Falcon Inn, St MawganI’m climbing up the coast path away from Mawgan Porth beach on the north Cornwall coast, the golden sands and swirling seas way below. Gulls wheel overhead and the wind whips my face, but I’m glad for the breeze after the exertion of the hill. Ahead, I make out the rocky outcrop of Griffin’s Point, an iron age cliff fort with views south to Watergate Bay and Newquay beyond. This is where I turn inland, leaving behind the dramatic sea stacks of Bedruthan Steps and heading east to return to the village of St Mawgan.It’s around the halfway point of one of my favourite circular walks in Cornwall, a 5.4-mile loop that takes in a wide variety of terrain, from coastal sections and sheep-speckled fields to woodlands scattered with streams, pines and badger setts.You could start and end at Mawgan Porth, but I like to begin in St Mawgan, parking on the road outside The Falcon Inn. From here, I follow the river north-west then cross a bridge, passing the acers and azaleas of the Japanese Garden (closed in winter) and a row of cottages with quaint names such as the Mouse House.The Falcon is a warm, welcome respite after miles walking through the Cornish winter elementsForking left, I’m on to the public footpath signposted towards Mawgan Porth. After Windsor Mill, a settlement dating back to the middle ages, I cross a stile and follow the path through the trees, the River Menalhyl trickling to my left. The track quickly turns rugged underfoot, with exposed tree roots and leaves that make a satisfying crunch with each step.Beneath the trees, some with orange lichen on their trunks, others with stubborn hawthorn berries still clinging to branches, there’s shelter from the elements; a blissful contrast to the bracing sea breeze I’m about to experience on that coast path.After around half an hour on the coast, I turn inland for a final stretch through fields and across streams. I return to the Falcon via the St Mawgan churchyard, pausing at the memorial to 10 men who died from hypothermia on a boat that drifted ashore near Watergate Bay in December 1846.I wonder if any of those men frequented this 16th-century inn, which is under new ownership this winter but has kept a traditional feel, with its original fireplace, exposed beams and dark wooden bar. I join the locals enjoying pints of ale from the pub’s own microbrewery in Penryn. It’s a warm, welcome respite after miles walking through the Cornish winter elements.Ellie RossBakewell to Little Longstone, Peak DistrictView image in fullscreen‘Kids, dogs and muddy boots, welcome’ … the Packhorse Inn.Distance3 milesDuration1½ hoursStartBath Gardens, Bakewell SquareFinishThe Packhorse Inn, Little Longstone“Walk and pub?” Growing up in the Peak District, these two things were never mutually exclusive. You can keep your Gore-Tex-clad scrambles, your emergency crampons, your Wainwright “bagging” and Three Peaks conquering. I’m worn out just thinking about all that. Give me a route I can do in an hour and a half, that’s manageable with a hangover or an unruly toddler or, God forbid, both. Give me a route where the scenery is quietly breathtaking and ever-changing but I can do it in a pair of beaten-up trainers.Give me a route that ends in a fantastic pub, where I can fill my belly with lovingly cooked local produce and slake my thirst on local ale. Earwig on a mix of day-trippers and local “characters” rubbing along just fine in front of one of three roaring fires. Give me the walk from Bakewell tothe Packhorse in Little Longstone.I’ve done this walk so many times I can practically hear the footsteps from different phases of my life ringing out from the pavement as we set off from Bath Gardens and leave theRutland Arms Hotel(the “birthplace” of the original Bakewellpudding– thetartfollowed later, just so you know and don’t mortally embarrass yourself when you visit) and the bustling market town behind. Tracing the A6 road out past the Lambton Larder cafe and pretty Georgian houses, we cross the River Wye at the stone bridge on the right, just past the fire station. We head straight on past Lumford House, with its blue plaque for Richard Arkwright Jr, whose inventor and industrialist old man was kind of abig deal in these parts.Following the public footpath over a stone stile to the left brings us out into an almost laughably bucolic field of beech and sycamoreA brief incline brings us out above the town and the show-off panoramic views to the imposing woods above Chatsworth and the fields down towards Hassop and Ashford-in-the-Water, beautifully pockmarked with wild pink heather. A few years ago, I proposed in the field of canary yellow rapeseed blazing in the far distance. Today, my bovine-phobic wife pushes me forward as a human shield as we take the left fork of the footpath into a field of cows that stare at us like the locals fromthe pub scene in An American Werewolf in London.We cross a stile into a wooded stretch and emerge at a field full of sheep (less foreboding, apparently) and the road heading into Great Longstone. Following the public footpath over a stone stile to the left brings us out into an almost laughably bucolic field of beech and sycamore trees. We skirt around the village of Great Longstone and into Little Longstone, with its red phone box and Bertie Bassett-inspiredwell dressing. The Packhorse Inn sits on the right, complete with a sign that says “Kids, dogs and muddy boots, welcome”. We don’t have any of those things today but we do, crucially, have a thirst on.“Walk and pub?” An unbeatable combination.James WallaceNewport to Fishguard,PembrokeshireView image in fullscreenFishguard Harbour.Photograph: ShutterstockDistance11.3 milesDuration6 hoursStartNewportFinishThe Ship Inn, FishguardThe A487 is not one of Britain’s most celebrated highways. In one stretch, it’s reduced to a single-track squeeze that requires drivers to sneak around a blind corner and pray no one is coming the other way. And what is the source of this nasty constriction that cannot be removed? A wonderful little pub calledthe Ship Inn. Hemmed in by a wooded hill behind, the fishing boat-speckled sea in front and that crow-black trunk road, it is no wonder that the front door is of the sliding variety. If it opened outwards, the tailback would block Pembrokeshire.Serving good beer surrounded by nautical memorabilia, polished wood and black-and-white photographs of drinkers down the ages, the Ship in Lower Town, Fishguard, has hosted some famous drinkers in its time. One face stands out from the fading photos: Richard Burton, at the peak of his thespian career, barrelling down that single-track snicket, his eye on the front door of the pub, no doubt thirsting for a pint of Double Dragon. Burton was in town for the 1971 filming of Dylan Thomas’s Under Milk Wood.Our walk to reach this watering hole starts up the coast at the pretty village of Newport (the pub is cash-only so use the ATM here), then follows the Wales Coast Path. Almost immediately, the flavour of the route is apparent: a big, banging seascape filled with jagged rocks, epic cliffs and roaring seas. Even the signs seem to have an extra robustness about them: “Keep to the Path. Cliffs Kill” screams one and, more mysteriously, “Caution. Deep Animal Holes Ahead” reads another.Almost immediately, the flavour of the route is apparent: a big, banging seascape filled with jagged rocks, epic cliffs and roaring seasThe route rolls along, passing several fine coves before tackling Dinas Mawr, a formidable headland. In 1954, this dramatic coastal feature was used in the filming of Moby Dick, starring Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab. Three-masted ships like Ahab’s Pequod were once a common sight along here, until the great storm of 1859 wrecked many of them. At the sea’s edge in Cwm-yr-Eglwys, I search the ruined churchyard of St Brynach’s and find tombstones for the mariner John Harries and Thomas Laugharne, master of the schooner Eliza. That may have been the Eliza that got smashed up on the Llŷn peninsula. One other casualty of the 1859 storm was the church itself, of which only one wall survives.It was to New Quay, on this stretch of coast, that Dylan Thomas moved in 1944, finding inspiration for unforgettable characters such as the lascivious fisher Nogood Boyo and Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard, so house-proud that the sun must wipe its shoes before sneaking through her chintz curtains. Burton was a slam dunk to narrate both the 1954 BBC radio play and the 1971 film.I pass the ruined Fishguard Fort and its cannon, last fired during the abortive French invasion of 1797, then reach the pub as it opens (4pm on Saturday and Sunday, 5pm Wednesday to Friday). There are only snacks, but the beer is good and the decor satisfyingly unchanged since Burton sat in here boozing with Peter O’Toole, their Daimlers parked down by the quayside. Elizabeth Taylor did not show her face, although local legend has Burton on the payphone, ordering Hollywood’s finest to “get her fat arse down to Pembrokeshire”. They were divorced three years later, remarried, then divorced again after two more.Kevin RushbyEdinburgh to Leith viatheWater of LeithView image in fullscreenSnow covering Circus Lane, a narrow side street in Stockbridge, Edinburgh.Photograph: George Clerk/Getty ImagesDistance4.7 milesDuration2 hours (with option to extend)StartNational Galleries of Scotland, EdinburghFinishLeithTheWater of Leith Walkwayfollows its namesake river from Balerno, near the Pentland Hills, through the heart of Edinburgh to Leith, the city’s historic port district, where it meets the sea. This walk follows the final stretch.In the grounds of Modern One on Belford Road – one of Scotland’snational art galleries– visit the crescent lakes of Charles Jencks’sLandform,then head to the left corner of the car park, passing a Henry Moore sculpture. Double iron gates lead to steps descending to the Water of Leith. Cross the footbridge and turn left, look for a figure of a man in the river, the first of four of Antony Gormley’s 6 Times figures that are visible on this walk. The path is marked throughout by small brown signs. Some sections offer step-free alternatives: for the most interesting landscape, stick to the riverbanks.The path winds through Dean Village, once an industrial slum, now one of Edinburgh’s most incongruous and enchanting neighbourhoods. The half-timbered cottages look more Bavarian than Scottish. Look out forWell Court, an imposing red-brick building, a rare example of Arts and Crafts style in Edinburgh, commissioned by the owner of the Scotsman newspaper in the 1880s to house local workers. Walk under the high arches of Thomas Telford’s 1832 Dean Bridge towards St Bernard’s Well, a pretty Roman-style folly with a statue of Hygeia, the ancient Greek goddess of health.Arriving in Stockbridge, perhaps pause in one of its excellent cafes, before crossing Deanhaugh Road to steep steps where the route continues. This section curves around some of Edinburgh’s distinctive “colony houses”, built for artisans and skilled workers between 1850 and 1910. Ahead you’ll see the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh – add a loop if you have time (free entry, donations welcome).Otherwise, the path forks right to follow the river. At a junction signed for Rocheid Path, keep right to steep steps to Brandon Terrace. Cross to Warriston Road, a high walkway built as part of flood defences. From here, the route skirts the wooded edges of St Mark’s Park to the wildlife-rich Coalie Park – keep an eye out for more Gormleys and, if you’re lucky, kingfishers.Our walk ends in Leith, where the river widens and is dotted with restaurants, bars and delis. For a cosy pub lunch head to theRoseleaf, a welcoming family-run pub, with excellent home-cooked food. The cullen skink is legendary and the all-day big breakfast, served in a sizzling skillet, is hard to beat.Ailsa SheldonWhitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, toSeaton Sluice, NorthumberlandView image in fullscreenThe causeway at St Mary’s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay.Photograph: Roger Coulam/AlamyDistance3 milesDuration2 hoursStartLido di Meo’s beach shackFinishThe Delaval ArmsTwo Octobers ago, a stormturned Whitley Bay seafront into a hazardous foam party, then dragged about a metre of sand out to sea. Whenever I return home, once or twice a year, I still do a double-take every time I see the sunken beach and marvel at the newly exposed sandstone, ripe sea glass and pebbles of coal. I’m always on the hunt for a few standout pieces to add to my shelf of beach finds back in my landlocked Madrid apartment.On a still, sunny morning at low tide, the shoreline glitters with wildness. I spot a crab strutting along the water’s edge, then burying itself alongside looping sandworms. Crows survey the scene just as closely, before zigzagging between the rocks in search of their salty prey. I look out to sea and see a creche of gull chicks bobbing up and down on the gentle waves, flying off in fright when a seal pops up for air. I look inland and tune into an orchestra of speckled starlings chirrupping around theLido di Meo beach shackand begin my walk north up the sand, the mild sun warming my back.Climb up to the clifftops and catch your breath while enjoying a panoramic view of the lighthouse belowAt low tide, a good stretch of this route can be done on the beach. When the sand runs out, simply head up to the promenade and let the footpath guide you onward to St Mary’s Lighthouse, on its own tiny island and accessible only at low tide. I’ve always wished there was a pub on this poetic rocky outcrop, but that would have brought this pub-bound winter story to an abrupt end, missing arguably the best bit.Leave the island, climb up to the clifftops and catch your breath while enjoying a panoramic view of the lighthouse below, interrupted only by fluffy coastal grasses bowing in the North Sea gusts.Check the tide timesand, if you get it right, you can watch the water engulf the path to St Mary’s Island, rendering it an offshore Northumbrian outpost until low tide returns.From here, almost every northbound footpath leads you tothe Delaval Arms, a Grade II-listed building dating back to 1748 and the first pub you’ll encounter as you cross into Northumberland. Over the years, the pub’s interior has been modernised yet has never lost its cosy charm. The brass‑railed bar, log fire and dark wood‑panelled walls and ceilings still anchor the snug rooms, while colourful soft furnishings and a lively menu have brought it gracefully up to date.The old sandstone building sits a coal pebble’s throw from the border with North Tyneside, so I settle in beside the log fire, wine in hand, and reflect on how my ancestors once fought over the very land where I now sit in complete comfort.Leah PattemLlanthony Priory, Bannau BrycheiniogView image in fullscreenLlanthony Priory.Photograph: Ed Moskalenko/Getty ImagesDistance6 milesDuration3 hoursStart/finishLlanthony PrioryLlanthony Priory, nestled in the Vale of Ewyas, makes for an enticing base to explore the Black Mountains, here in the easternmost part of Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons).The priory was foundedin the early years of the 12th century by William de Lacy, a Norman knight who was said to have been so taken with this remote location that he immediately renounced the way of the sword for the life of a hermit. Some stories suggest he was inspired by Dewi Sant (Saint David), who sought tranquillity in this same place in the sixth century.Today, the priory is just a ruined shell, but the allure of Llanthony, flanked by steep glacial ridges, endures. Particularly energetic walkers like to embrace the 16-mile loop out along Offa’s Dyke Path to Hay Bluff and Lord Hereford’s Knob, before tracking back along the Cambrian Way trail. I, however, have a more modest tramp in mind –a 6-mile circular walkthat will get me back to the priory’s Cellar Bar just in time for lunch (served from 12.30pm to 2pm on weekends during the winter months). With its whitewashed vaulted stone ceilings and wooden benches, this snug will provide a cosy reward for whatever the Welsh weather may have in mind.The views from the top of the ridgeway are a more than sufficient reward for the climbMy route embraces the tough stuff first – a short but sharp ascent following the Beacons Way walking trail up Cwm Bwchel to Bâl Bach (a lower section of the 607-metre Bâl Mawr). Viewing the route from Llanthony, you may be tempted to head straight to the pub. Don’t be put off, though, because the views from the top of the ridgeway are a more than sufficient reward for the climb you’ve undertaken. It’s a clear day and the nearby peaks of Sugar Loaf and Skirrid Fawr stand out against the blue-and-white clouded sky. Above Llanthony Priory, on the other side of the valley, a long treeless ridgeway connects Hatterrall Hill with Hay Bluff. Further up the Vale of Ewyas lies Capel-y-Ffin, once the summer grange for the canons of the priory. It was here that beatnik poet Allen Ginsberg wrote his acid-enabledWales Visitation– his neo-romantic riff on Wordsworth’s Tintern Abbey.From Bâl Bach, I follow the Cambrian Way south until I reach a sharp left fork into Coed Tŷ Canol. Down in the western valley liesSaint Issui in Patricio, a medieval church named after another hermit holy man and renowned for its 10th-century font and intricately carved 15th-century wooden screen. A detour to Saint Issui is tempting, but will have to wait for another walk. This morning, it’s time to descend off the ridgeway following forestry tracks and woodland paths back to Llanthony. A little over three hours after I began, I emerge from Llanthony Wood into open fields and the stone facade of the priory comes into view. A pint of Felinfoel Double Dragon beckons. Surely Ginsberg, and maybe even William de Lacy, would approve.Matthew YeomansExplore more on these topicsWinter walksDay tripsWalking holidaysWalkingChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This started life as a Lyonnaise dish that I sawAnthony Bourdainenjoy on his TV seriesParts Unknownat Daniel Boulud’s parents’ farmhouse. My adapted version could be a centrepiece of your New Year’s Eve party, where the molten cheese mixture can be spread on bruschetta and topped with pickles. Equally, however, it could be a main meal shared with friends alongside a salad, pickles and bread. Either way, it’s built for comfort and for joy. Happy New Year to you.Pumpkin fondueI used a 3kg kabocha squash, but if you can’t find one that big, get two medium-sized pumpkins instead.Prep15 minCook2 hr 15 minServes6-8 for dinner, or 20 as canapes3kg pumpkin(1 big or 2 smaller ones) – crown prince, delica or kobocha; it’s not about the overall weight, but the size of the pumpkin and the cavity7 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilFine sea salt1 tsp mixed spice1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced80g cooked chestnuts, chopped12 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked to get 1 tbsp500g mushrooms– the most exotic you can find – shredded or chopped smallBlack pepper50g unsalted butter50g plain white flour500ml whole milk100g gruyere(make sure it’s a vegetarian one), roughly chopped75g emmental(a vegetarian one), grated50g stilton(a vegetarian one), or other vegetarian blue cheese, roughly choppedTo serveToasted baguetteBaby cornichonsSalad leavesHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Using a small, serrated knife, cut a roughly 15cm-wide lid off the top of the pumpkin, then scoop out the seeds. Cut out (and reserve) a little extra flesh from the cavity to open up the hole a bit, then rub in a tablespoon of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a half-teaspoon of mixed spice.Heat three tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan, then add the chopped onion and the reserved pumpkin flesh left over from making the lid. Cook for six or seven minutes, until soft, then add the garlic, chestnuts, thyme and remaining half-teaspoon of mixed spice, and cook for two minutes. Scrape into a large bowl.Heat three more tablespoons of oil in the same pan, then add the mushrooms, half a teaspoon of salt and six grinds of pepper. Turn up the heat, cook for 15 minutes, until there is no liquid left in the bottom of the pan, then transfer the mushrooms to the onion bowl.In a medium saucepan, melt the butter on a medium heat and, when it’s frothy, add the flour and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and whisk for a couple of minutes, until smooth. Slowly whisk in the milk, beating constantly, until the sauce thickens, then take off the heat.Fold all the cheese bar 25g grated emmental into the mushroom bowl. Spoon the mix into the cavity of the pumpkin until it’s nearly full, then slowly pour in as much of the bechamel as you can. Pop the lid back on the top of the pumpkin, wrap the whole thing in foil and bake for an hour to an hour and 15 minutes, until a sharp knife passes easily through the pumpkin skin. Unwrap the foil just at the top, lift off and discard the lid and scatter the reserved 25g grated emmental on top of the filling inside. Bake for another 10 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and bronzed.Take the pumpkin out of the oven, carefully peel off the foil and serve from the tin or transfer to a platter. To eat as a canape, spread some bechamel on a slice of baguette and top with a cornichon (save the leftover pumpkin flesh for another use); for a main meal, scoop the flesh and bechamel on to plates and serve with bread, cornichons and salad leaves.Explore more on these topicsWinter food and drinkMeera Sodha recipesVegetablesFoodCheeseMain coursePumpkinrecipesShareReuse this content"

This year, TV was where the best fashion was at. Here, nine Guardian writers pick their favourite looks from the shows that had us hooked over the past 12 months.‘Her vanity is a plot point’View image in fullscreenMorgan, in one of her tamer outfits, in Nobody Wants This.Photograph: Erin Simkin/NetflixSeason one of Nobody Wants This was about the Hot Rabbi, but season two is all about the Hot Little Sister. Morgan, played by Succession’s Justine Lupe, steals every scene she’s in. She is a brilliant physical comic, and her outfits are key. In the first episode, big sis Joanne (Kristen Bell) is adulting hard at her first couple’s dinner party, but a pivotal moment comes when Morgan makes her entrance in a fluffy shearling jacket and hot pants. She is a preening, maddening, gorgeous cat-among-the-pigeons, and you just know from the moment she walks on screen that the night is not going to go to plan.What makes Morgan so compelling is that her vanity is a plot point. There is something so recognisable and heartbreaking about this smart woman who leads with her looks. The hair-flicking tic, the inappropriate stiletto boots for daywear, the Cher in Clueless mix of being charmingly off-the-wall yet infuriatingly self-obsessed. Joanne has a cute overthinky Diane Keaton thing going on with that little frown and her pleat trousers and rollnecks, but it is fashion girl Morgan – in her Wales Bonner track pants and argyle knits, rugby shirts and oversized leather bombers, western-buckle belts and Cali denim – who has my heart.Jess Cartner-Morley‘Dark,privileged and toxic queen bees and wannabes’View image in fullscreenIntentionally dated outfits … Wild Cherry.Photograph: Natalie Seery/BBC/Firebird Pictures/No expense was spared in the costume department for Wild Cherry, the glamorous thriller about two spoiled teenage girls and their mothers whose lives are upended by scandal. It’s Gossip Girl meets Desperate Housewives, but in the age of social media influencing. One particular look caught my attention in the first episode: the pinstriped, pink wrap-front top and brown monogrammed Fendi miniskirt worn by one of the teens, Allegra (Amelia Gray), during a choir performance at the school. My knowledge of the fashion of 15-year-old girls is limited, but the outfit seems intentionally dated – it immediately reminded me of 2004’s Mean Girls and you could imagine Allegra slotting in with the Plastics in the canteen every Wednesday. It seemed to communicate that the show was happy to wear its references on its sleeve and honour its cultural lineage of dark, privileged and toxic queen bees and queen-bee wannabes. Pink has always been the colour of that uniform.Jason Okundaye‘A world away from the gilet-wearing tech bros that control cinema in 2025’View image in fullscreenWide lapels of power … Seth Rogen in The Studio.Photograph: AppleMatt Remick, Seth Rogen’s perpetually harried head of the fictional Continental Studios, in Apple’s terrific film-industry satire The Studio, is a man who never seems to be lacking a fine glazing of sweat. Somehow though, as Remick lurches from indignity to catastrophe to however you’d classify accidentally getting the CEO of your parent company face-meltingly high before a crucial upfronts presentation, his attire stays unruffled.Inspired by Rogen’s own wardrobe, Remick’s dynamite collection of wide-lapel Italian suits, often in warm ochres, turmerics and mahoganys, hints at the golden age-era Hollywood he desperately wants his flatlining studio to evoke; a world away from the gilet-wearing tech bros that control cinema in 2025. However stressful and cringe-inducing events might become in The Studio, there’s always a dash of old-mogul glamour to make things go down easy.Gwilym Mumford‘A disgustinglyenviable,zero-fucks-given attitude’View image in fullscreenA shabbier Columbo … Gary Oldman in Slow Horses.Photograph: Jack English/APSome might think of Slow Horses’ Jackson Lamb (played by Gary Oldman) and recall farts and liberal swearing. But it’s the mac for me. A clever update on the one that Peter Falk wore as Columbo, it gives the same maverick genius vibe. The rest of the outfit only adds to the mood – loosened tie, slight paunch, seedy 70s glasses and hair in need of a seriously good wash. Partially embodying the outcast energy of Slough House, a grimy, damp office building in east London, but also with a disgustingly (enviable?) zero-fucks-given attitude. Here is a hero for our times. Let’s hope season six doesn’t mess with the outfit – but does give the formula a bit of a glow-up.Lauren Cochrane‘Shirts that are even dodgier than his behaviour’View image in fullscreenNaff … Walton Goggins in The White Lotus.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/APNever mind the giant Gucci sunhat worn by Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan), or the coordinated swimwear of Kate (Leslie Bibb), for me it was Rick’s collection of naff holiday-ready shirts that won the third season ofThe White Lotus.When we first meet Rick (played by Walton Goggins), he’s wearing an apparently “Mexico”-themed shirt covered with bullfighting and folk-dancing motifs. It’s unbuttoned to the navel and teamed with khaki cargo trousers, black leather toe-wrap sandals, Wayfarer sunglasses and a gold chain with a tiger’s eye pendant. Should I be disgusted by this look? Absolutely. He’s basically a walking red flag who glares at his much younger girlfriend, Chelsea, played by Aimee Lou Wood, as she bangs on about how they are soulmates. But for some reason that I’m sure a therapist would have a hoot unpacking, I unashamedly fancy Rick.These shirts are even dodgier than his behaviour – remember when he casually mentioned he wasn’t allowed to enter Australia? They are decorated with cranes and spiky greenery, Hawaiian-esque palm prints, orange swirls and elephants. The saccharine patterns and motifs jar with his moody, mean and hot-headed persona but somehow it all just makes him even more alluring. Would I advise a man to buy a similar shirt for their next holiday? Please god no. They work on Rick, and Rick alone. Thankfully, the internet has reassured me that I am not alone in thinking the greasy-haired grump and his crass collection is hot. What can I say guys, fashion is fickle.Chloe Mac Donnell‘It perfectly captures Amanda’s desperation to curate herself at all times’View image in fullscreenImpractical chic … Amanda commits to an all-cream palette.Photograph: Natalie Seery/BBC/MermanTuning into Amandaland earlier this year, I found myself watching the eponymous lead as much for her outfits as for her narcissistic unravelling. Her style is prim, polished and deeply impractical – which seems entirely the point. This is a woman who wears an all-cream outfit with high-heeled boots to her son’s football match on a muddy field, topping it off with the team scarf as a gesture of maternal solidarity.One of the funniest moments comes when Amanda is forced to flyer for a kitchen and bathroom showroom company in a burgundy branded T-shirt. “My colour palette is very much spring-summer and this is autumn-winter,” she protests, horrified. When she spots her daughter walking down the street, she quickly swaps the tee for a white vest trimmed with black lace, all dignity restored. It’s a small gag, but it perfectly captures Amanda’s desperation to curate herself at all times.Her clean style is a fragile shield that slips whenever real life intrudes. And that’s what makes it work.Sundus Abdi‘A woman so consumed by grief that she can barely dress herself’View image in fullscreen‘A woman in retreat from her life’ … Aggie in The Beast in Me.Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix/APIf you’ve seen the journalistic killer thriller The Beast in Me, you’ve probably noticed its broad-stroke approach to character names (Aggie Wiggs just trips off the tongue), the absurdly big houses (never has an upstate broken-pipe-dream of a mansion felt so dingy), and Nile Jarvis’s over-dyed hair. But the standout “set piece” is Aggie’s wardrobe.In almost every episode Aggie (Claire Danes) wears a button-down shirt, carrot pants and an ill-fitting man’s jacket, so tightly buttoned she can barely put her hands into the pockets – yet is compelled to stuff them in because, if you hadn’t guessed, Aggie is a woman in retreat from her own life. This is the sort of costume design I appreciate. All that Pulitzer money, all those Long Island boutiques, all those trips into Manhattan – and yet she can’t buy a jacket that fits! No matter that it’s damp all the time, a pair of clogs for her morning shuffle will do! In one early episode, she doesn’t even change out of her pyjamas for the whole day.The show is absurd. The plot is maddening. But in our Emily in Paris world, with its box-fresh costume changes, it’s heartening to see a woman so consumed by grief that she can barely dress herself.Morwenna Ferrier‘Morphs from public authority figure to understated power dresser’View image in fullscreenBlonde-bobbed crusader … Grace in Blue Lights.Photograph: Steffan Hill/BBC/Gallagher Films/Two Cities TelevisionGrace’s customary look when on the beat in BBC’s Belfast police drama Blue Lights? Akepicap and furrowed brow. But outside the bottle-green of her PSNI uniform, our blonde-bobbed moral crusader morphs from public authority figure to understated power dresser. She wears lots of shirts. At home she wears a silkutility blousewith the sleeves rolled up – structured, but a dusty pink with a scalloped collar for a soft, feminine twist. In another scene she gives younger colleague Annie advice in a blue-and-white-striped button-down.Grace (Siân Brooke) usually teams her shirts with high-waisted, wide-legged trousers. Hands in pockets, she’s giving Katharine Hepburn energy. And, as a millennial in her 30s, you’d have to prise that French tuck from Grace’s cold, dead waist (v relatable).Other times, she’s rocking knits. A homely, ribbed cardigan when in pastoral care mode; wrapped up against the sea breeze in a grey chunky fisherman’s sweater underneath a navy wool peacoat. Practical but stylish, sensible but sophisticated. But Grace is not afraid of colour or embellishment; she finally snogged Stevie while wearing a burnt orange double-breasted bouclé car coat. A bold look for a bold moment.Did she wear a Canadian tuxedo to a party in Belfast? Sure. But I will always stick up for double denim, and it’s not an arrestable offence. Grace may only be a rookiepeeler, but she’s holding her own next to Hercule Poirot and Jane Tennison in the style stakes.Hannah Jane Parkinson‘This is 2025-era Boom Boom informed by the Silicon Valley AI dollar’View image in fullscreenAn embarrassment of luxury labels … Molly in Loot.Photograph: Colleen E Hayes/Apple TVIt’s a depressing time to be watching a show about the operatically extravagant lives of the 0.000001%, but Loot – at least for its first two seasons – is an absolute joy. Succession this is not.The fun being had with billionaire-mocking in this Apple TV+ show is exemplified in Molly’s wardrobe. The cuckquean, “nouveau riche”,gurning, insensitive, ridiculous character is played with glee and comedic prowess by Maya Rudolph. Her dogs are called Mary-Kate and Ashley, and her clothes have the confidence of someone who was recently awarded $87bn in a divorce settlement. They are full of wild joy, vivid colour and fabrics – silks, satins, feathers and ostrich – fit only for a life with easy access to a fleet of rainbow-coloured sports cars.Molly turns up to her first day of work at the philanthropic foundation she didn’t know she owned wearing the same style of pink satin Peter Pilotto suit that Beyoncé wore in herApeshit video. She wears a Vampire’s Wife dress the costume designer described as “the colour of money”, enough matching La DoubleJ to fill all the Ferraris of Milan and an embarrassment of luxury labels: Gucci, Lanvin, Taller Marmo, The Row. Patterns blare, feathers hoot and ruffles honk; this is 2025-era Boom Boom, not informed by the Wall Street extravagance of the 1980s but by the Silicon Valley AI dollar. It’s an orchestrated, brash and excessive look that feels quite panto, in a Bel-Air kind of way.It is, categorically, not the sort of thing I would ever wear. But in this context, where fictional billionaires leverage fictional sway with fictional money, it makes utter sense, and I salute it.Ellie Violet BramleyTo read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletterSlow HorsesGary OldmanThe White LotusnewslettersShareReuse this content"

We subsist on a steady diet of lies, distortion and AI slop. Everything is getting stupider, including me.That’s why, when it comes to examining the year, I choose to reckon with nothing but cold, hard numbers. Here, then, is how things stand for me, statistically, at the close of 2025.66.6%Adult sons currently living under my roof. This is up sharply from 0% this time last year, and represents an abrupt reversal of a long-term trend: the outward migration of offspring.27Books I’ve read this year. I didn’t start keeping a list on my phone to impress people. I did it because in September I suddenly realisedI couldn’t remember anything about any of the books I’d read recently, including the titles and authors’ names. When I wrote a column about this, someone suggested keeping a tally might help. The list itself proved to be a major investigative undertaking, which involved combing through online order histories, reviewing my book club’s WhatsApp and trying to judge from its position on the bookshelf whether I finished Moby Dick in early 2025, late 2024 or never.It doesn’t happen often, but recently a couple expressed delight at being mentioned in this columnThe total is provisional: I am reading a book I may well finish before midnight on New Year’s Eve. Don’t ask me what it’s called.14Times I’ve told the single joke I wrote in 2025, to the total bewilderment of listeners. The only reason I didn’t tell it more often was because it requires the participation of a willing comic foil, and most people I know want no part of it.If you haven’t heard it, it goes like this:Me: “You know, they said I’d really like that spreadable Calabrian sausage that’s so trendy right now.”Comic foil: “Nduja?”Me: “I can take it or leave it.”I have now reluctantly retired the joke, because it seems there just aren’t enough people who both know of the spreadable Calabrian sausage callednduja, and also know that it’s pronounced in a way that could conceivably be mistaken for someone saying “and do ya?”There are, however, dozens of people who claim the J inndujais actually pronounced with a soft “zh” sound in Calabria itself, thus rendering my joke null and void. I know this because they all emailed me.3.5Hours, of the 8,760 available in 2025, that I spent watching the YouTube channel of a man who calls himselfSteve Roofer. Steve specialises in showing you the many ways a flat roof can go wrong, and his channel was recommended to me by my own roofer, Mike, who thought it would help me understand some of the waysmy flat roof had gone wrong: shoddy installation, insufficient insulation, improper ventilation, all leading to a buildup of condensation. I guess he thought I would find it comforting, and to be honest, I did.2People who have expressed delight at being mentioned in this column in 2025. This doesn’t happen very often, but I recently received a thank you card from a couple, saying they were thrilled to be mentioned, even though they didn’t actually appear as speaking characters – they were only unnamed lunch guests who didn’t turn up because it turned outwe had actually invited them to dinner. If they’re happy, I’m happy, even if I had to cook twice.1People who have expressed fury at not being mentioned in this column in 2025. On this occasion, it was my fault. When my wife started plotting toeject me from our book clubin November, I mentioned every single member except one. I mentioned my wife, because her invidious scheming was central to the story. I mentioned Sasha, because she made a disparaging reference to me in the WhatsApp group; I mentioned Emma, because she said something in my defence; I mentioned Suzy, because book club was at her house that week; I even mentioned Fran for some reason, even though she didn’t come to book club.But I forgot to mention Nicola, and as a result she’s livid. If I had to make a prediction for 2026, it’s that I will be looking for a new book club.Happy new year.Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Most people go to the woods in search of flowers, birds, insects or fungi, but I was looking for moss. Why moss? What is so special about this irksome plant you find hidden in plain sight?The Forest of Dean could be synonymous with moss. When I went, I was immediately struck by the amount there was. It was covering rocks, trees, the ground – everything! Everywhere was camouflaged by this blanket of green. It was like looking through emerald glasses. I ran my hand over a patch of moss; it was soft and velvety like a puppy’s fur.View image in fullscreen‘There are so many amazing things about moss … [It] has been around for 450m years.’Photograph: Family handoutThere are between 15,000 and 25,000 species ofbryophytes(which includes mosses, liverworts and hornworts), making it one of the most diverse plant groups in the world. There are so many amazing things about moss, like how it can survive in extreme conditions – dormant moss has been known to survive temperatures from -272C to 100C, and the spores can be in space for months without dying. Moss has been around for 450m years, enduring drastic climate changes. Mosses also hold moisture, help the soil to prevent erosion, and absorb pollution from the air.It makes me wonder why we neglect and ignore these magnificent plants, especially when we find it in our own garden patios.Arjun, 12Read today’s other YCD, by Theo, nine: ‘Our local river is clean again – and the birds are back too’The Young Country Diarysubmission formis now closed, but keep hold of the link, it will reopen for winter articles on Friday 3 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsPlantsYoung country diaryRural affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His actions triggered widespread protests and criticism from opposition groups and civil society, most of whom doubted his vow not to personally run for office.On Sunday, 6.7 million eligible voters in Guinea will head to the ballot box for the first presidential election since the2021 coup. Among the nine candidates are the former minister Abdoulaye Yéro Baldé of the Democratic Front of Guinea and the former junta supporter turned critic Faya Millimono of the Liberal Bloc party.But thanks to a controversial referendum in September that led to the adoption of a new constitution allowing him to run and extending presidential terms from five to seven years, the clear frontrunner is Doumbouya.‘Each of us is afraid’: Guinea’s junta leader tightens grip as opposition lies lowRead moreThe opposition coalition Forces vives de Guinée has called his candidacy a betrayal. “The man who presented himself as the restorer of democracy chose to become its gravedigger,” it said ina statement last monthafter Doumbouya officially deposited his intent to run with the supreme court.Political upheavals have been a recurring feature in west Africa, a region that has earned the moniker of “coup belt” after seven successful coups and several unsuccessful attempts since 2020. WhileGuineahas remained under the Ecowas umbrella, fellow juntas in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, angered by its post-coup sanctions, have split from the regional bloc to form the pro-Russian Alliance of Sahel States (AES). If it holds, the Guinean election will be the first in any of the junta-run states since 2020.View image in fullscreenA campaign billboard in Conakry of the Guinean presidential candidate Abdoulaye Yéro Baldé of the Democratic Front of Guinea.Photograph: Souleymane Camara/ReutersWithin Guinea, many believe the general’s victory is a foregone conclusion, given his consolidation of power since ascending to the presidency and promoting himself to a general. Even now, the presidential race is notable not for those who are on the ballot, but for those who are not.The biggest opposition parties remain suspended, and their most prominent leaders have been detained, barred from running or – like the former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea, are in exile. Many say aclimate of fearpervades the country due to the junta’s crackdown against its critics, with several dissidents in jail.Conversely, Doumbouya pardoned the former dictator Moussa Dadis Camara who was given a 20-year sentence for his role in one of Guinea’s most serious human rights atrocities: the 2009massacre and mass rapeof protesters at a stadium in Conakry. The pardon, granted before the final hearing, promptedseveral human rights groups to write a joint open letterto the junta leader alongside families of victims, urging him to reconsider. That process is now in limbo.Ahead of the vote, Doumbouya has been accumulating goodwill.This month, the shiny new Simandou mine, which has the world’s largest untapped reserve of iron ore, was launched after nearly three decades of delays caused by political instability and corruption. Doumbouya’s government is touting the project as a bridge to prosperity for Guinea and a sign of incoming development, despitemass job lossesandenvironmental complaints.The election stakes are high: in the coming years, the multi-layered Simandou mine project – which also includes the construction of ports and a railway – is expected to transform the economy of Guinea, where half of the population lives on below $2 a day. Given existential concerns around transparency, many are waiting to see what the winning government does after the election.“Our salvation lies in a return to the [proper] constitutional order,” said Abdoulaye Koroma, a presidential candidate for the Rally for Renaissance and Development party.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Somaliland controls the north-west tip of Somalia, where it operates a de facto state, and is bordered by Djibouti to the north-west and Ethiopia to the west and south.Exclusive: Somaliland president says recognition of state ‘on the horizon’ following Trump talksRead moreThe Israeli prime minister’s office said the declaration was “in the spirit” of the Abraham accords, a series of normalisation agreements between Israel and mostly Arab states signed in 2020.It posted a video of Benjamin Netanyahu speaking via video call with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, in which he invited him to visit Israel and described the friendship between the two countries as “historic”. Abdullahi said he would be “glad to be in Jerusalem as soon as possible”.Donald Trump said he opposed US recognition of Somaliland in an interview with the New York Post published on Friday, adding: “Does anyone know what Somaliland is, really?”The US administration is reportedly split over the recognition of Somaliland, with some fearing such a move could endanger military cooperation with Somalia. The US has troops deployed there, where it supports Somali forces in their fight against the Islamist movement al-Shabaab.Somalia’s foreign ministry said in statement the decision was a “deliberate attack” on its sovereignty that would undermine peace in the region, a sentiment echoed by the African Union (AU).The AU said it “firmly rejects” Israel’s move, warning: “Any attempt to undermine the unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Somalia ... risks setting a dangerous precedent with far-reaching implications for peace and stability across the continent.”The pan-African body’s head, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf, said Somaliland “remains an integral part of the Federal Republic of Somalia”, which is a member of the AU.Israel’s move was also condemned by Egypt and Turkey, which said in a statement: “This initiative by Israel, which aligns with its expansionist policy and its efforts to do everything to prevent the recognition of a Palestinian state, constitutes overt interference in Somalia’s domestic affairs.”Sa’ar said the recognition came after a year of talks between the two countries and that he had instructed Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs to immediately “institutionalise ties between the two countries”.Israeli analysts have said recognition of the breakaway state could be in Israel’s strategic interest, given Somaliland’s proximity to Yemen, where Israel has conducted extensive airstrikes against the Houthi rebels over the past two years.Areportin November by the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli thinktank, said: “Somaliland’s territory could serve as a forward base for multiple missions: intelligence monitoring of the Houthis and their armament efforts; logistical support for Yemen’s legitimate government in its war against them; and a platform for direct operations against the Houthis.”The Somaliland authorities already host a military base operated by the United Arab Emirates in Berbera, which has a military port and an airstrip for fighter jets and transport aircraft. Analysts have suggested that the base is a key part of the UAE’s anti-Houthi campaign in Yemen.Somaliland’s presidentrevealedin May that US military officials, including the most senior officer in the Horn of Africa, had visited Somaliland and that another US delegation was expected to visit soon. “It’s a matter of time. Not if, but when and who will lead the recognition of Somaliland,” Abdullahi told the Guardian.Project 2025, which was published in 2023 and is alleged to have guided much of the doctrine of Donald Trump’s second administration, called for the recognition of Somaliland as a “hedge against the US’s deteriorating position in Djibouti”, where Chinese influence is growing.This August, the Texas Republican senator Ted Cruz wrote to Trump asking him to recognise Somaliland. Cruz said Somaliland was an ally of Israel and that it had expressed support for the Abraham accords.Somaliland has a population of a little more than 6.2 million. The breakaway state has a democratic system that has had peaceful transfers of power, though the Washington-based non-profit organisation Freedom House noted an “erosion of political rights and civic space” in recent years, with journalists and opposition figures facing repression from authorities.Explore more on these topicsSomalilandIsraelSomaliaAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They came asthe Ukrainian leader headed to Floridafor a face-to-face meeting on Sunday with Donald Trump, who has proposed a plan to end nearly four years of fighting that has killed tens of thousands.Zelenskyy stopped in Canada, where he met the country’s prime minister, Mark Carney, who announced an additional $2.5bn (£1.85bn) of economic aid forUkraine.Carney condemned the “barbaric” overnight attack on Kyiv. He said: “We have the conditions, the possibility, for the just and lasting peace,” adding this requires a “willing Russia”.View image in fullscreenUkrainian firefighters work to extinguish a fire in Kyiv.Photograph: Ukrainian emergency service/AFP/Getty ImagesZelenskyy spoke by video call with European allies.Macron highlighted what he called the “contrast” between “the willingness of Ukraine to build a lasting peace and Russia’s determination to prolong the war that it started”, Elysee officials said.The EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa said the European Union’s support for Ukraine would not falter.“In 2026, the EU Commission will continue to keep up the pressure on the Kremlin, sustain our support to Ukraine, and work intensely to accompany Ukraine on its path toward EU membership,” von der Leyen said on Saturday.Zelenskyy said he would hold talks with European leaders again after meeting Trump on Sunday.Zelenskyy said the overnight bombings showed international pressure on Russia was insufficient. “If Russia turns even the Christmas and New Year period into a time of destroyed homes and burnt apartments, of ruined power plants, then this sick activity can only be responded to with truly strong steps,” he said. “The United States has this capability. Europe has this capability. Many of our partners have this capability.

Speaking on Friday, he added that a proposed 20-point peace plan was “90% ready”. “Our goal is to bring everything to 100%,” Zelenskyy said. “As of today, our teams – the Ukrainian and American negotiating teams – have made significant progress.”Ukraine war briefing: Kim Jong-un celebrates sharing ‘blood, life and death’ with RussiaRead moreZelenskyy has reportedly said he would need to seek the approval of the Ukrainian public if he failed to secure a “strong” position on territory.After the strikes on Saturday, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia’s “only response to peace efforts” was “brutal attacks using hundreds of drones and missiles against Kyiv and other cities and regions”. The minister said that a third of the capital was without heating. The temperature in Kyiv was about 0C (32F).The Russian strikes forced Polish fighter jets to scramble, and two airports in south-eastern Poland – Rzeszów and Lublin – were temporarily closed.The latest peace effortsfollow a burst of diplomatic activitylast weekend in Miami, where Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff, as well as Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, separately met Russian and Ukrainian representatives.View image in fullscreenUkrainian rescuers look through rubble inside a damaged residential building in Kyiv.Photograph: Serhii Okunev/AFP/Getty ImagesThe plan is considered an updated version of an earlier 28-point document agreed several weeks ago between the US envoys and Russian officials, a proposal widely viewed as skewed towards the Kremlin’s demands.Ukraine has pushed for security guarantees modelled on Nato’s article 5 mutual defence pledge under any proposed peace deal with Russia, though it remains unclear whether Moscow would accept such terms.In aninterview with Politicoon Friday, Trump said he anticipated a “good” meeting with the Ukrainian leader, though he offered no endorsement of Zelenskyy’s plan. “He doesn’t have anything until I approve it,” Trump told the news website. “So we’ll see what he’s got.”The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, used a Russian television appearance on Friday to criticise Zelenskyy and European allies on their work on the peace plan. “Our ability to make the final push and reach an agreement will depend on our own work and the political will of the other party,” Ryabkov said.He said the proposal drawn up with Zelenskyy’s input “differs radically” from points initially drawn up by US and Russian officials in contacts this month. “Without an adequate resolution of the problems at the origin of this crisis, it will be quite simply impossible to reach a definitive accord,” Ryabkov added.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

And the full system will take 24 months to complete,” the deputy defence minister, Cezary Tomczyk, told the Guardian in an interview in Warsaw.‘I’d defend our nation’: Poles prepare for growing threat of warRead moreTomczyk said the new air defence systems would be integrated into an older line of protection constructed a decade ago. He said it would involve different layers of defence, including machine guns, cannon, missiles and drone-jamming systems.“Some of this is for use only in extreme or war conditions. For example, these multi-barrel machine guns are difficult to use in peacetime, because everything that goes up must go down,” he said.More than a dozen suspected Russian drones entered Polish airspace in September, in an incident that led to airport closures, fighter jets being scrambled, and damage to buildings on the ground as drones were shot down. The foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski,told the Guardian at the timethat the attacks, which involved drones not carrying any ammunition, were an attempt by Russia “to test us without starting a war”.View image in fullscreenThe Polish border with Belarus in the Podlasie region, where fortifications will be aimed at preventing any future Russian invasion.Photograph: Jędrzej Nowicki/The GuardianSince then, Poland has updated plans already in the works to reinforce its eastern borders. While no anti-drone system can be fully effective against the kind of systematic and massive targeting thatUkrainehas been subjected to, European nations along the eastern flank are scrambling to upgrade their systems to match the new threat. Tomczyk said the project would cost more than €2bn (£1.75bn), and would be mostly financed with European funds under the SAFE (Security Action for Europe) defence loan programme, as well as some contributions for the state budget.During almost four years of full-scale war in Ukraine, Poland has increasinglyput itself on a war footing, as cases of sabotage and arson which Polish services link to Russian intelligence agencies are on the rise. The country has plans to train hundreds of thousands of citizens in survival skills while others are taking voluntary military training.In addition to the anti-drone wall, Poland is also conducting fortifications along its land borders with Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, known as the Eastern Shield and aimed at preventing a future Russian invasion. Tomczyk said special logistics hubs would be built in every border municipality, where equipment to help block the border would be stored, ready to be deployed in a matter of hours.View image in fullscreenBorder fence in the Podlasie region; Poland’s eastern border municipalities are to receive logistics hubs.Photograph: Jędrzej Nowicki/The Guardian“The truth is that as long as Ukraine is defending itself and fighting Russia,Europeis not at risk of war in the conventional, strict sense of the word. What we will face instead are provocations and acts of sabotage,” said Tomczyk. But, he said, if the west allowed Russia to win in Ukraine, it could be not long before the Kremlin set its sights on Europe.Poland has boosted its defence spending to 4.7% of GDP, one of the highest rates in theEuropean Union, amid continuing fears over Russian hybrid operations and potential military threats to the country.“Today, Ukraine is spending around 40% of its GDP on the war, and anyone wondering what percentage we should devote to the military ought to ask themselves whether it’s better to raise spending from, say, 2% to 3 or 3.5%, or to let it rise from 2% all the way to 40% later,” Tomczyk said.View image in fullscreenA Polish military helicopter patrols the border with Belarus in the Podlasie region.Photograph: Jędrzej Nowicki/The GuardianQuestioned over whether Russia really had military designs onPolandin the same way it did on Ukraine, which the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has long said was central to Russian identity, Tomczyk pointed to the long history of Russian aggression and expansionism in eastern Europe. He said that “like in Orwell’s 1984”, messaging about the enemy of the day could quickly be changed.“These conquests function mainly as a political tool for maintaining power: a recurring motif in Russian history. The government needs to show that it is strong, that it commands a powerful army, that no one should dare to challenge it. In that sense, an external war becomes a domestic instrument in Russia,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPolandRussiaEuropeEuropean UnionUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

We have agreed on a meeting at the highest level – with President Trump in the near future,” Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X on Friday, adding that “a lot can be decided before the New Year”.Early on Saturday, several powerful explosions rocked Kyiv as authorities warned that the Ukrainian capital was under threat of missile attack and that air defences were in operation.Ukraine’s air force also announced a countrywide air alert, saying on social media that drones and missiles were moving over several Ukrainian regions, including the capital.Zelenskyy told journalists the high-stakes meeting with Trump would focus on some of the most sensitive parts of the peace talks, includingUkrainian security guaranteesand reconstruction, plus territorial discussions regarding the Donbas region and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.“This meeting is specifically intended to refine things as much as we possibly can,” Zelenskyy said.He added that the proposed 20-point peace plan was “90% ready”.“Our goal is to bring everything to 100%,” Zelenskyy said. He later added: “As of today, our teams – the Ukrainian and American negotiating teams – have made significant progress.”The plan is considered an updated version of an earlier 28-point document agreed several weeks ago between the US envoys and Russian officials, a proposal widely viewed as skewed towards the Kremlin’s demands. Ukraine has pushed for security guarantees modelled on Nato’s Article 5 mutual defence pledge under any proposed peace deal with Russia, though it remains unclear whether Moscow would accept such terms.“Russia constantly looks for reasons not to agree” to the peace proposals, Zelenskyy told reporters.In aninterview with Politicoon Friday, Trump said he anticipated a “good” meeting with the Ukrainian leader, though he offered no endorsement of Zelenskyy’s plan.“He doesn’t have anything until I approve it,” Trump told the news website. “So we’ll see what he’s got.”The announcementfollows a burst of diplomatic activitylast weekend in Miami, where Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff met separately with Russian and Ukrainian representatives, as well as Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.US officials described the discussions as “constructive”, though Moscow has played down expectations of progress and there are few signs that Vladimir Putin is prepared to soften his maximalist demands to end the full-scale invasion. Trump in the interview with Politico said he expected to speak with Putin “soon, as much as I want”.Ukraine war briefing: Kyiv hits Russian oil refinery with British Storm Shadow missilesRead moreAt a closed-door meeting with Russia’s business elite on Wednesday evening, the Russian president reportedly reiterated his demand that Ukraine hand over the entire eastern Donbas region as part of any peace deal.According to Kommersant, one of Russia’s best-connected newspapers, Putin also indicated openness to a limited territorial exchange with Ukraine, with Moscow potentially exchanging small areas of land Russian forces occupy in Ukraine’s northern Kharkiv and southern Zaporizhzhia regions.Zelenskyy has previously said Ukraine would be open to withdrawing “heavy forces” from parts of Donbas it still controls, but only if Russia mirrored the move as part of a US-backed initiative to create a “free economic zone” in the region.It remains highly uncertain that Moscow would accept either a suggested demilitarised buffer zone or a withdrawal of its forces, even as other sticking points remain, including control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant that Kyiv says should be jointly managed by the US and Ukraine.On Friday, the Kremlin said Putin’s top foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, had held a call with the US administration after Moscow received an updated US proposal on a potential peace deal, although there were no signs that a breakthrough had been reached.The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, used a Russian television appearance on Friday to criticise Zelenskyy and European allies. “Our ability to make the final push and reach an agreement will depend on our own work and the political will of the other party,” Ryabkov said. “Especially in a context where Kyiv and its sponsors – notably within the European Union, who are not in favour of an agreement – have stepped up efforts to torpedo it.”He said the proposal drawn up with Zelenskyy’s input “differs radically” from points initially drawn up by US and Russian officials in contacts this month. “Without an adequate resolution of the problems at the origin of this crisis, it will be quite simply impossible to reach a definitive accord,” Ryabkov added.Russia has repeatedly said it was prepared to continue fighting in Ukraine if no peace deal were reached, saying it was confident it could achieve its war aims through military means.Yet while Moscow has made slow, grindingprogresson the battlefield, Ukrainian forces have in recent days pushed Russian troops out of thecity of Kupianskin the Kharkiv region.It marked a rare successful Ukrainian counteroffensive, prompting frustration among pro-war Russian bloggers over what many described as overly upbeat and unrealistic battlefield briefings.“On the Kupyansk front, large-scale territorial losses have come to light, caused by the systematic submission of false reports that exaggerated the Russian armed forces’ successes in the battle for Kupyansk and surrounding settlements,” the popular Telegram channel Rybar, which has close links to the defence ministry, wrote.In late November, senior Russian generals briefed Putin that Russian troops had “completed the liberation of Kupyansk”, prompting Zelenskyy to travel to the city’s outskirts to “show the world that Putin is lying”.Lauren Gambinocontributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUkraineDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeRussiaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Thousands more claims are expected next year.Last week, GMB and Unison claimed a “historic” victory for thousands of employees of Birmingham city council and Birmingham Children’s Trust after a four-year campaign led to a settlement agreement worth about £250m.This has been among the most high-profile equal pay cases, as it was used by the council to justify declaring effective bankruptcy in 2023, although back then the potential liability was estimated to be much higher – at about £750m.However, the decision to issue a section 114 notice recently came under question afteran analysis by accounting academicssuggested the council’s financial position was better than senior officers made out.GMB said some employees in the Birmingham city council case ended up receiving sums up to £55,000.Under the Equality Act 2010, women and men must receive the same pay and contractual terms, including when doing roles that are different but hold “equal value”.Equal pay claims typically argue that roles more commonly held by women, such as carers, administrators and teaching assistants, come with worse pay grades and conditions than male-dominated jobs like waste collection.The largest sum secured so far from a single council is Glasgow, after a deal was struck in 2022 for a total £770m. However, workers are still waiting for the council’s promised redesign of its pay and grading structure to fix equal pay issues.The other successful cases brought by GMB have been at Sheffield (£60m), Leeds (£10m), Blaenau Gwent (£3m) and Falkirk (£3m).The union said that a further 40,000 claims were still outstanding across 26 local authorities, including the six where deals have already been done, which will probably run into hundreds of millions of pounds.The other local councils with pending claims were Dundee, Fife, Renfrewshire, West Dunbartonshire, Argyll & Bute, Brighton, Southampton, Bristol, Swansea, Cardiff, Sunderland, Coventry, Cumberland, and Westmorland.Councils across the country have been struggling financially, and a record high number of local authorities are expected to ask the government for exceptional financial support in 2026-27 – despite government reforms that willboost funding for councils in deprived areas.GMB also said that next year it expects to launch another 10,000 claims across five more local councils. The union has warned local authorities including Coventry and Bradford urging council bosses to come to the negotiating table or risk “eye-watering settlement figures”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

In November, the book won the prestigious Boardman Tasker award for mountain literature.“In effect, for 50-odd years I was suffering from PTSD,” he said. “Climbing on the one hand, it can be a very dangerous activity. And in my case, I pushed the envelope of survival in climbing to its limits in many ways. In my younger days I was doing loads of crazy stuff.View image in fullscreenIain Peters: ‘In some ways, climbing, it saved my life. It saved my sanity.’Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“It was almost in response to what had happened to me in terms of abuse and all these other things. In some ways, climbing, it saved my life. It saved my sanity.”Peters said his favourite outdoor pursuit, introduced to him at the age of three by his grandfather, has taken him all over the world, from the Alps to the Cordillera Darwin on Tierra del Fuego on the border of Chile and Argentina.“It has enabled me to reach the grand old age that I’ve reached – living the life that I do, and I’m still a climber, even in my late 70s,” he said. “From a therapeutic point of view, it’s helped. It’s helped me considerably, in terms of both of living with abuse, living with the aftermath of abuse … It became my survival technique.”Peters said he believed climbing allowed him to “disassociate”.“When you’re concentrating on staying alive halfway up a vertical rock face you can’t then think ‘Oh God, poor me, I was assaulted when I was nine years old,’” he said.The father and grandfather said the trauma still had a great impact on his life choices, including on relationships as well as his career. He turned down a scholarship at Cambridge and at one stage found himself working in a strip club for the notorious Kray twins.“The problem with sexual abuse is it’s all about power and the power of the rapist is huge psychologically and physically,” he said. “I was always frightened. I can see this now but I always rejected success because success led to power, and power led to being like a rapist.”Eventually, he did marry with his first marriage lasting 28 years before he lost his wife to cancer. Six years ago, he married again to Ellen.He had never shared his experience with anyone before he reported it in 2015 by handing “a grubby piece of paper” recounting his abuse over the counter at a police station in Exeter.He had previously denied anything had happened to him when reports of abuse at the school – Upcott House preparatory school – emerged in the media.Asked what he thought would have happened to him without climbing in his life, he shared the experience of his best friend, who was also abused by Earle, often in front of each other.“He never recovered,” he said. “He didn’t have climbing. He didn’t climb. He lost his mind. He tried to kill me at one stage. He tried to stab me. I said ‘Why?’ He said ‘Because you survived.’”View image in fullscreen‘When you’re concentrating on staying alive halfway up a vertical rock face you can’t then think ‘Oh God, poor me, I was assaulted when I was nine years old.’Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“I have had things like climbing, I have had, eventually the ability to have children, to have a successful relationship, all these things have come. And now finally, you know, I’m an award-winning writer, yes, and so many victims don’t have that opportunity.”Looking ahead, Peters hopes he and his book can be a beacon for survivors of sexual abuse to know they can come forward with confidence.“We have to create a social culture that will make people feel that they shouldn’t have shame, they shouldn’t have guilt, that they can go for help and more people, particularly young people, should have that opportunity.”Explore more on these topicsMountaineeringChildrenDevonnewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, the staff involved have been suspended.Dr Scott Davidson, medical director at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, offered “sincere apologies” to both families.“We have very rigorous processes for the identification and labelling of bodies from arrival in our mortuaries until their release into the care of an undertaker,” he said.“It is of deep regret that these processes have not been adhered to on this occasion, and that as a result two families have been caused significant additional distress at an already very difficult time.“We launched an immediate investigation into this incident and will ensure that learning is applied.”Queen Elizabeth university hospital is subject to a public inquiry after a series of infection outbreaks and concerns about water and ventilation systems emerged just three years after it was built in 2015.In September, Jane Grant, who led the board between 2017 and 2025, faced questions about the hospital’s communication with families and patients.Explore more on these topicsGlasgowNHSDeath and dyingScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

It would curve from Minehead to Watchet and use 125 underwater turbines to harness the power of the second-highest tidal range in the world.The proposal comes amid growing concern that rapidly rising use of AI in Britain will drive up carbon emissions unless more renewable energy sources are found. The AI boom is expected to add to sharp increases in demand for electricity across the UK, which the governmentestimatedthis month could more than double by 2050.“If the decision is to go ahead with adopting more and more AI – which I am surprised is not being questioned more at a time of climate emergency – then it is going to be better with a renewable energy source,” said Barfield. “Datacentres could double energy demand and this is a predictable and reliable source.”The barrage would not cross the full breadth of the channel but would instead curve to and from the Somerset coast with a 2.5GW maximum output – not far short of the peak energy that will be created by the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station just 12 miles east. It would be enough to power 2m homes.View image in fullscreenA visualisation of the full arc of the proposed lagoon.Illustration: Marks Barfield ArchitectsThe vision includes a path along the top of the semi-circular barrage for walkers and cyclists willing to brave the south-westerlies, a water-sports marina, a lido and an observation tower. Local MP Rachel Gilmour, who is backing the plan, said the pathway “will become absolutely iconic”.The designers have tentatively suggested it also might be possible to install datacentres within the structure, allowing them to benefit from cheap seawater cooling. There are hopes for oyster and mussel beds, arrays of floating solar panels and a coastal amphitheatre to boost the economy of Minehead, once a popular holiday resort and nowone of the 20% most deprived areas in Britain.The latest UK energy policy states that tidal and wave energy could play a role “if their costs can be reduced”.“We have got people who want to fund it but they will only do so if the government is supportive,” said Aidan Clegg, chief executive of the consortium. “They need to take this seriously. This is not hypothetical – we have a strong plan in place.”View image in fullscreenA visualisation of the cycle track over the tidal power station.Illustration: Marks Barfield ArchitectsA spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “We are open to considering well-developed proposals for harnessing the tidal range energy in the bays and estuaries around our coastlines, which demonstrate strong value for money. TheAI energy councilis bringing together the likes ofNeso[the National Energy System Operator], EDF, Microsoft and Google in solving the energy demands of AI, exploring opportunities to attract investment and support the development of low carbon power for datacentres.”Tidal power is more predictable than wind and solar, even though there are several hours when tides turn each day with little or no power. The backers of theWest Somerset Lagoonproject believe it would last 120 years and would therefore produce power more cheaply than nuclear power.It was first conceived several years ago with the aim of reducing the UK’s carbon footprint. Since then, the AI revolution began and is now on course to dramatically increase energy demand. Britain’s national energy system operator, Neso, haspredictedelectricity demand for datacentres will treble by 2035. The vast racks of microprocessors needed to train and run AI models and store the ever-increasing mountains of data on which the tech-enabled 21st-century economy relies will account for the largest part of the overall increase in electricity demand in the commercial sector.The West Somerset Lagoon is the latest in a line of proposals to harness the tidal power of the Severn estuary. In the 1980s, other lagoons were proposed in the narrower part of the estuary, closer to Bristol, whilea full barrage from near Cardiff to near Weston-super-Marewas suggested more recently, raising concerns about large-scale and irreversible change to the estuary system. The latest sponsors of the idea say the lagoon will not interrupt navigation channels to the ports of Bristol and Cardiff, and is outside protected areas such as local nature reserves and special areas of conservation.“Minehead and that whole area of West Somerset is an area of deprivation and this project will drive positive transformation,” Barfield said. “It will create skilled full-time jobs, an area for water-sports, a lido, a visitors’ centre, an observation tower and cultural facilities. It could also become a hub for marine farming mussels, seaweed and oysters. These are the types of businesses that local young people could develop because the tidal range would be more controlled.”Explore more on these topicsHydropowerSomersetRenewable energyArtificial intelligence (AI)Energy (Technology)Energy (Environment)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

It would not involve deployment to active operations, and there would be no obligation to stay in the military after completing the scheme, as it aims to teach transferable skills that can be used in other industries.John Healey, the defence secretary, told the i paper that the scheme would “give Britain’s young people a taste of the incredible skills and training on offer across the army, Royal Navy and RAF”.He added: “As families come together at this time of year, and young people think about their futures, I want the outstanding opportunities on offer in our armed forces to be part of that conversation in homes across the UK.”Under the current plans, the army scheme involves 13 weeks of basic training as part of a two-year placement, while the navy scheme would last one year and provide “profession agnostic” training for sailors, according to reports. The RAF’s scheme is less developed, although options are reportedly being explored.It comes after the chief of the defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Rich Knighton, said Britain’s “sons and daughters” should be “ready to fight” and called for a “whole of society” effort to defend the country in the face of Russian aggression.The British army already runs an internship scheme, formerly known as gap year commissions, but it had a low uptake in 2024/25 , with only 10 people enrolling. These are one-year placements for young people before, during or immediately after university.Australia already offers a gap year scheme for its military for those aged between 17 and 24. In 2023, 664 people enlisted in the Australian scheme, with a little more than half going on to a permanent role in the country’s defence force.In June, the British government said that the UK should take inspiration from the Australianmodel, arguing that a shorter-term option could make engagement with the military more appealing to women and people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds.Explore more on these topicsMinistry of DefenceYoung peopleMilitaryJohn HealeynewsShareReuse this content"

It was classified as an EF-0 on the Enhanced Fujita scale. The destruction it caused included damage to the roof of a home, and breaking windows and tree branches, bending a utility pole and destroying commercial signage in a shopping plaza.“The safety of every Angeleno is my top priority,” said Los Angeles’s mayor, Karen Bass, who earlier declared a temporary state of emergency, in a statement pointing to the tornado and “consecutive days of wet weather”.Firefighters in Los Angeles county rescued more than 100 people just on Thursday, with one helicopter pulling 21 people from stranded cars. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, declared emergencies in Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Shasta counties.With the heaviest rains now past, there is still a risk of flash flooding and mudslides, the National Weather Service warned.“Still not quite out of the woods, but for the most part, the worst is over,” said Mike Wofford, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Los Angeles. Forecasters anticipated a dry weekend before more rain around New Year’s Eve.Sherry Toccodescribed to the Los Angeles Timeshow her mountain town of Wrightwood, 80 miles (130km) north-east of Los Angeles, was pummeled by rain that turned the roads into rivers and buried cars under rocks, debris and mud.The river, she said, was raging before “it just came through and destroyed, took everything with it”. Tocco said firefighters helped her evacuate and she had slept in her car.But what fell as rain in the lowlands fell as snow in higher elevations. As much as 2in of snowfall an hour fell in the Sierra Nevada.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaLos AngelesUS weatherExtreme weatherSan DiegoWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

He called on Republican lawmakers to eliminate it “without question”.What is the filibuster and why does Trump want to get rid of it?Read moreIf Congress were to get rid of the filibuster, Trump added, “you can do everything. You can do great health care if you get rid of the filibuster. We can do everything we want.”Scraping the arcane-sounding legislative device is sometimes favored by the party with a majority in the Senate, but opposed by the other because it allows them to use their minority status to block legislation from passing.Senators typically back off from proposals to end it, because they don’t want to get steamrolled by a simple majority when the balance of power shifts again. Centrists in both parties typically oppose ending the filibuster as a way to defend against partisan political excesses.For Trump, who has 10 months before the midterm elections to push the Republican agenda along, including requiring voters to present identification, raising the issue has a more immediate purpose: preventing another government shutdown.“If you get rid of the filibuster, you’re not going to have a shutdown,” he told the outlet.Republicans currently hold 53 seats in the Senate to Democrats’ 47, giving them little room to lose members and pass bills with bare majorities. Trumppreviously calledon his party in the Senate to end the filibuster in October so that Republicans could reopen the government without Democratic support.Republicans did not take up the challenge, leading to a long standoff with Democrats over healthcare costs and paralyzing the government with a 43-day shutdown. But mounting time pressures on the sitting president to push his legislative agenda along could change the calculations.Elsewhere in Trump’s remarks to Politico, he said he believes the midterm elections will center on “pricing”, an alternative to the Democrats’ term of “affordability”, which he has said he thinks is a “hoax”. Both terms mean the same thing.He said he was confident that Americans will be receptive to his message: that he is tidying up an economic mess he inherited from Joe Biden.“I think it’s going to be about the success of our country. It’ll be about pricing,” Trump told Politico. “Because, you know, they gave us high pricing, and we’re bringing it down.”The comments come after two positive economic reports showing that inflation is cooling and the economy is growing more quickly than economists expected. But polls also show that American consumers are feeling economically insecure and pessimistic.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsUS SenateUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

He had been an ectopic pregnancy – when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the uterus – and was hidden behind a large ovarian cyst.Doctors at Ceder-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles called the dangerous pregnancy extremely rare – occurring in just one in 30,000 pregnancies – and have plans to document the case in medical journals.Dr John Ozimek, who oversees the hospital’s labor and delivery ward, remarked that pregnancies outside the uterus that reach full term “are essentially unheard of – far, far less than one in a million”, hesaidto the Associated Press. “I mean, this is really insane,” he added.Lopez found out that she was pregnant only days before giving birth. Since her 20s, she had been dealing with ovarian cysts. She previously had her right ovary removed along with another cyst.View image in fullscreenSuze Lopez and her son, Ryu, in California in October 2025.Photograph: Associated PressFor months, doctors had been monitoring a 22lb cyst on Lopez’s abdomen. After dealing with increasing abdominal pain and pressure, Lopez visited doctors to see about having it removed. But during her appointment, after taking a routine pregnancy test, Lopez discovered that she was pregnant.Despite the positive test, Lopez hadn’t noted any pregnancy symptoms. “Because of the large ovarian cyst that had been growing for years, it could have been a false positive, even ovarian cancer,” said Lopez in aCedars-Sinai press release. “And I was used to very irregular periods and some abdominal discomfort. I could not believe that after 17 years of praying, and trying, for a second child, that I was actually pregnant.”But days later, Lopez returned to the hospital with abdominal pain and dangerously high blood pressure. Doctors discovered that, while Lopez’s uterus was empty, a fetus was concealed in her abdomen.Baby Ryu was delivered on 18 August, with the team of 30 doctors also removing Lopez’s cyst during the same procedure. Lopez reportedly lost a lot of blood during the surgery and Ryu spent two weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit, SFGatereported. Both mother and baby made a full recovery.A spokesperson at Cedars-Sinai confirmed that Lopez and baby Ryu are in good health: “The family is doing great. Mom and baby [are] all thriving.”The Guardian could not reach Lopez for comment, but the mother of two shared a holiday updateon Facebook, writing: “Praise the Lord. Our family has a very special and surprising Christmas gift this year.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaPregnancyWest CoastChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

Their passing was lethargic, they had no width, they were 1-0 down to a dominant Chelsea and it seemed the story was going to centre on Emery’s decision not to start Ollie Watkins up front.Yet few managers are as effective as Emery when it comes to altering the flow with a few smart tweaks. The Spaniard never stops plotting, never stops hunting for weaknesses in his opponents, and perhaps it was not a surprise when Villa’s tactical mastermind found a way to ensure that the travelling fans were belting out songs about winning the league at full time.Aston Villa lodge complaint after bottle thrown at their bench at end of Chelsea winRead moreKey to it all was Emery having the clarity of mind to change Villa’s shape and alter the flow with a triple substitution early in the second half. Do not mistake it for luck. Villa retrieving 18 points from losing positions this season is no fluke. They have a group full of leaders, as Emery was quick to point out after an 11th consecutive win in all competitions, and it helps that they have players who are ready to make an impact when thrown on from the bench.The feel was different once Villa had Amadou Onana’s muscle in midfield and Jadon Sancho looking to prove a point against the team who decided against signing the winger in the summer.Chelsea, on the other hand, failed to react. Their lead was cancelled out by Watkins equalising five minutes after coming on and their problems increased when the striker lifted Villa three points below Arsenal at the top of the league after rising to head in the winner in the 84th minute.Where does this end? Emery continues to play down talk of a title challenge but Villa, who visit Arsenal on Tuesday, are building serious momentum. Crucially, they do not know when they are beaten. They have fallen behind in each of their past six away games but have recovered to win five of them.Quick GuideKey factsShow• Aston Villa have won eight consecutive top-flight matches for the first time since a run of nine wins between October and December 1910. In all competitions, their 11-game winning run equals a club record, set in September 1897 and March 1914 previously.• Chelsea have dropped 11 points from winning positions in home Premier League matches this season – four more than any other side. Enzo Maresca has lost four home Premier League games when going 1-0 up, with only Glenn Hoddle (five) losing more as Blues manager• Aston Villa are responsible for 45% of the away wins by teams when conceding first in the Premier League this season (five of 11) – in Premier League history, only Manchester United in 2020-21 (nine) have won more away games when going 1-0 down in a season than Villa’s five in 2025-26.OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.What Chelsea, who have slipped to fifth place after one win in six league games, would give for some of that knowhow. Unfortunately for Enzo Maresca, though, his young side’s habit of playing in fits and starts is why they are still not realistic challengers. “We need to manage the game better,” Chelsea’s head coach said. “We were completely in control – and this has happened before.”Indeed, Chelsea’s collapse after Villa’s alterations was no one-off. They have dropped 11 points from winning positions at home this season and it was a worry for Maresca – who was forced to watch from the back of the press box after being hit with a touchline ban – that none of his substitutes were able to make an impact.The lack of leadership was stark. Chelsea lost their shape after Villa equalised, while another headache for Maresca was Cole Palmer not hiding his displeasure at being substituted in the 72nd minute. Palmer, who is still feeling his way back from a groin injury, flung his arms in the air when his number went up and briefly disappeared down the tunnel after making way for Estêvão Willian.View image in fullscreenOllie Watkins scores Aston Villa’s equaliser after his initial shot was blocked by the floored Robert Sánchez.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersIn truth, though, Chelsea’s No 10 did not have one of his better games. Palmer was lively early on, whistling a volley wide, but he was outshone by Morgan Rogers in the second half. Villa’s star man made Watkins’s first goal and there were times when Chelsea could not get close to the England international.It was some turnaround. Chelsea were excellent during the first half. They neutralised Villa as an attacking force, were full of aggression and went ahead when João Pedro turned a Reece James corner past Emi Martínez in the 37th minute.Yet Chelsea could not push on. They faded after being denied a penalty when Ian Maatsen handled a cross from Alejandro Garnacho. Emery, who could have made his changes during the interval, came to the fore. Villa were far more menacing with Watkins leading the line. He almost made a goal for Boubacar Kamara, who was thwarted by Robert Sánchez, and he equalised when Onana pounced on a stray pass from Benoît Badiashile.Onana was alert, shovelling the ball to Rogers, who sent Watkins through to bundle an effort past Sánchez in the 63rd minute after the striker’s first shot was saved by the goalkeeper. Now Villa believed. Watkins and Maatsen forced saves from Sánchez, who was relieved when a Rogers free-kick flew inches over.Chelsea offered little at 1-1. Villa looked the likelier winners. They kept pushing and their moment arrived when an error from Malo Gusto, who had come on at left-back for the hamstrung Marc Cucurella, led to Watkins sparking dreams of glory by rising highest to head in a Youri Tielemans corner.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaAston Villamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Put Stephon Castle in charge of toy assembly. Let De’Aaron Fox toss presents into chimneys, from whatever range he’d like. Devin Vassell can customize the Christmas cookies. Harrison Barnes has the army of elves covered. And, of course, Santa Claus’s sleigh must immediately be resized for a taller, thinner pilot so that the towering Victor Wembanyama can drive it comfortably. The sensational Spurs have felled the Oklahoma City Thunderthree times in two weeks, and in doing so revitalized this NBA season. I now have more faith in the Spurs’ ability to grant joy to the masses than any holiday legends of old.It looked dire for a while there. The Thunder might have won the Larry O’Brien trophy in June, but began this season in even more ominous form. They reeled off 24 wins in their first 25 games (the lone loss was a fluky 20-point comeback). In most of them, Jalen Williams, their second-best player, was on the sidelines recovering from wrist surgery.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, their best, seldom had to play in fourth quarters. The Thunder beat the Sacramento Kings by 31. The Los Angeles Lakers, who some expected to be a plausible rival, lost by 29; their basketball savant Luka Doncic looked like he was playing against ten men. The Phoenix Suns’ valiant first earned them a close loss, by just four points. When they met again 12 days later, the Thunder won by 49. This game knocked all the remaining leaves off the trees and started winter 10 days ahead of schedule. Oklahoma City looked capable of shredding anything in its path, even the 2016 Golden State Warriors’ legendary regular season record of 73-9.The Thunder do not play a particularly appealing style of basketball. They skillfully exploit the referees’ dilemma over which fouls to call (a consistent whistle interrupts the flow of the game, an absent one lets players get away with blatant violations), often resulting in Gilgeous-Alexandershooting free throwsafter whistles that would be better swallowed, while personified mosquito swarm Alex Caruso seems to have free rein to do whatever he likes on defense. Some profess to enjoy, or admire, Gilgeous-Alexander contorting his body to draw slight bumps from defenders; I can only assume those same people also like being kicked hard between the legs. That’s not to mention man-mountain Luguentz Dort flying off his feet and into opponents after plenty of suspiciously light touches. This chicanery enables haters to harbor the fantasy that in a world with ideal officiating, the Thunder would be a mediocre team. True basketball heads know it’s far more exasperating than integral to the Thunder’s success, but the general irritation is sufficient to nudge some fans who might otherwise be neutral into rooting for Oklahoma City’s downfall.Dominance can be coldly thrilling to watch, but a historically great performance tends to evoke less awe the more times it repeats. How many times does anybody really want to watch one team beat another by 35? Eventually you remember that the drama is the point. The Thunder were draining the season of suspense, running up leads on other teams in the table as well as on the floor.Through 21 minutes of the first Spurs-Thunder game this season, San Antonio trailed by 16 and looked likely to go the same way as every other team. Instead, they have wrought hell upon the Thunder ever since.View image in fullscreenVictor Wembanyama of the San Antonio Spurs have beaten the Oklahoma City Thunder three times in a two-week span.Photograph: William Purnell/Getty ImagesAgainst the Spurs, the Thunder look mortal. Each member of their core deserves immense credit for that, but this is Victor Wembanyama’s team, and the Thunder know it. “There’s this guy on their team that’s seven-foot-five and takes up a lot of space on the court,” Jalen Williamssaid, with some exasperation, when asked what made the Spurs such a tough out. The Thunder’s professional beanpole, 7ft 1in Chet Holmgren, is the tallest player on the floor in most games, free to grab rebounds and swat down opposing shots. Next to Wemby, he’s short, crude, and even timid. Wembanyama’s contempt for Holmgren is evident in how he celebrates each time Chet misses a free throw, as though he’s won the lottery; the way he fouls him with a bit of extra venom; the wayhe told reportershe doesn’t consider Holmgren a rival. (There is indeed no debate over which player is better.) At this rate Holmgren must expect Wemby to burst out of the cupboard, talking smack, when he reaches up for a snack.Wembanyama and the Spurs made their most definitive statement yet on Christmas, thumping the Thunder by 15 on their home floor. San Antonio took the inevitable early punch well yet again, recovering to pile 41 points on the league’s best defense in the first quarter. Fox effortlessly found the miniscule holes in that defense to the tune of 29 points. The Spurs even held Gilgeous-Alexander to a season-low 22. He tried to make up for it by zipping passes to open teammates behind the arc, but they let him down by bricking almost every single attempt.A Thunder optimist would say that enough of those threes will go in next time to produce a win or a tighter loss, but I found the misses symptomatic of a flaw. Off the strength of his silky-smooth stepback jumper, Gilgeous-Alexander is the steadiest scoring engine in the league. He is difficult to guard and impossible to stop. (LeBron James recently offeredsome adviceon how to slow him down: “you gotta keep him off the free throw line. Which is hard.”) But even he can’t carry an offense entirely on his own. The Spurs put Gilgeous-Alexander under enough pressure that he had to delegate more than usual, and his supporting parts broke down under the heavier burden. Caruso and Dort are good for the occasional three-pointer, butrelyingon them to hit the long shot is the last place the Thunder want to be.The Spurs’ surge couldn’t have come at a better time. Not only have they emphatically established themselves as title contenders – some say they’re too young, and inexperience has indeed undone plenty of fabulous teams in the playoffs, but the 23-7 Spurs aren’t contenders, hardly anyone is – but they’ve allowed fans to see the Thunder in higher definition other teams couldn’t come close to revealing. Oklahoma City, potentially the best team in history two weeks ago, is merely exceptional. If you takeGilgeous-Alexander’s word for it, the Spurs are better right now. 74-8 is off the table. With the Spurs just two and a half games behind, OKC has its hands full just holding onto its lead in the Western Conference. Even if only against one team, the Thunder have assumed the unfamiliar role of chaser, trying to solve a squad who torments them the way they torment so many others. In their newfound vulnerability, the Thunder are a little easier to enjoy and a little harder to hate. And any future wins against the Spurs will be a lot more meaningful.They’ll get a few, maybe (or probably, but it’s thanks to the Spurs that choosing a word is difficult) as soon as this season. The Thunder are too good to stay down for long. When they rise the Spurs will eventually have to make their own adjustments. How’s this for terrifying: Wemby’s probably still a few years out from his peak. Christmases andNBAseasons can blend together, with only the most meaningful sticking out in the memory years later. Whatever happens next, the Spurs have given me enough reason to look back on these ones and smile.Explore more on these topicsSan Antonio SpursOklahoma City ThunderNBABasketballUS sportsVictor WembanyamaShai Gilgeous-AlexanderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The judges scored the contest 120-108, 119-109 and 117-111 in favor of the 32-year-old champion.Jake Paul’s artless spectacle robbed boxing of its democratic dream | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreThe victory marked Inoue’s sixth successful defense of his undisputed crown at 122lb and improved his record to 32-0 with 27 knockouts. While the finish never came, the result was rarely in doubt, even as Picasso showed durability and defiance to hear the final bell.“This performance wasn’t good enough,” Inoue said afterward through a translator. “I could have done better. I’m glad I won, but I’m really tired. I’ll rest and be much better next time.”Despite conceding height and reach to Picasso, Inoue quickly asserted himself with sharp counterpunching and crisp combinations, particularly to the body. He wobbled the Mexican midway through the fight and repeatedly pierced his guard, forcing Picasso into a largely defensive shell as the rounds wore on. By the championship rounds, Inoue appeared to be boxing on instinct alone, managing the contest with his jab and well-timed bursts of power.Picasso, who fell to 32-1-1, landed sporadically but struggled to match Inoue’s timing and hand speed. His corner urged him to take risks late, yet the gulf in class proved too wide to bridge.The win set the stage for a potential blockbuster clash with Nakatani, who also emerged victorious on the same card, earning a unanimous decision over Sebastian Hernandez in his debut at super-bantamweight. Nakatani, 27, extended his unbeaten record to 32-0 with 24 knockouts and immediately voiced his interest in facing Inoue next.“I moved up to this division to win world titles,” Nakatani said. “If I get that chance, I want to take it.”Inoue echoed the sentiment while stopping short of a formal commitment. “Both of us had very good wins tonight,” he said. “For next year, we will decide what happens. But Japanese fans should expect something very good.”If finalized, an Inoue–Nakatani bout – widely rumored for 3 May at the Tokyo Dome – would pit two undefeated, multi-division champions in their primes against one another, a rarity in modern boxing and a fight many believe would rank as the most significant in Japan’s storied pugilistic history.Explore more on these topicsNaoya InoueBoxingJapanShareReuse this content"

In 2025, she has reached three of the four grand slam finals, winning her fourth major titleat the US Openand further positioning herself as a generational great. From her humble origins as a volatile, one-note ball-basher, the 27-year-old has admirably evolved into an increasingly complete player. Sabalenka is the best player in the world for a second year in succession.The fleeting tennis off-season is usually an opportunity for players and spectators alike to reflect on such great feats before the new season is upon them. This year, however, the December discourse has been derailed by the fast-approaching train wreck Sabalenka stands at the heart of.BBC showing tennis’s new Battle of the Sexes will just offer up opportunity to belittle women’s sport | Barney RonayRead moreOn Sunday, Sabalenka, the world No 1 in women’s tennis, will play againstNick Kyrgiosin an exhibition match in Dubai that has been billed as the Battle of the Sexes. At the end of many weeks of promotion from both players, it remains on track to being one of the most inane tennis events ever conceived.It is not difficult to see why this match would be appealing to Kyrgios, who over the past three years has had an unending string of injuries, playing just six official matches during this period. At 30 years old, it is unclear whether he will be able to return to the tour in any consistent or competitive manner. He is evidently here to earn as much money as he can, while he still can.Sabalenka’s participation in this event is far more noteworthy and disappointing. Since the announcement of the exhibition Sabalenka, Kyrgios and their camp have countered the subsequent criticism by asserting that this should be viewed solely as lighthearted entertainment that will be greatly beneficial for the sport, driving greater interest in tennis and reaching audiences that may not be interested in its regular competitive formats.At the same time, however, it has been marketed by cynically using the challenges faced by women’s sports as engagement bait. Sabalenka has claimed that the contest will “bring women’s tennis to a higher level” and she has also referenced Billie Jean King’s 1973 win over the former player Bobby Riggs to immense fanfare in one of the original Battle of the Sexes bouts, a seminal moment for women’s sports that played an instrumental role in changing attitudes to female athletes.View image in fullscreenAryna Sabalenka reached three grand slam finals in 2025 and triumphed at the US Open.Photograph: Yuki Iwamura/APRegardless of the result, this event is an own goal for Sabalenka and women’s tennis. There is nothing at all to learn from it. A top female player cannot be competitive with a top male player and the audience will not believe any scenario where they are. However, women’s tennis is still already a tremendous sport responsible for some of the greatest athletes ever seen. The sport does need more attention and eyes, but that should be on its countless great competitive performances and unforgettable personalities.The last thing women’s tennis needs is more tired discussions questioning equal prize money, which will never change, and women playing best-of-five-sets matches – topics this event is sure to invite. The position of No 1 in the WTA, the leader of the biggest women’s sport in the world, has always been of great symbolism and importance. Sabalenka has used the position she has earned to open up the floor for people to trash her sport.The buildup of this event has been even more grim than anticipated. In early December, Sabalenka and Kyrgios were interviewed by Piers Morgan and the discussion soon turned to thesubject of trans women in professional tennis, with Sabalenka rebuking the presence of trans women in the sport. Her comments made global headlines.View image in fullscreenNick Kyrgios has played a handful of matches in recent years and it is unclear if he will return to the tour in any consistent or competitive manner.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAThere are zero trans women on the WTA Tour. A far more relevant and pressing issue is the misogyny that female players continue to face on a daily basis from figures both outside and within the sport. Sabalenka chose to make statements claiming to protect women’s sport ahead of an exhibition that she insists will help it while sitting shoulder to shoulder with Kyrgios, a man who pleaded guilty to assaulting his ex-girlfriend, had to distance himself from Andrew Tate after reposting the proud misogynist on social media and who has faced accusations of sexist remarks involving female players, such as Anna Kalinskaya and Donna Vekic.There is no denying the attention this has generated. The event has been picked up by the BBC and Sabalenka was ushered on to the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, a stage usually only accessible to tennis players immediately after a US Open triumph. It would not be a surprise to see the Dubai Coca-Cola Arena’s 17,000 seats mostly filled.However, attention isn’t always positive. This exhibition is nothing more than a cynical attempt to fabricate controversy to benefit the bank accounts of both the players and all other entities involved. It is an event truly of its era, a time when influencers generate more money for their celebrity boxing bouts than many of the best fighters in the world. No serious figure really believes that Jake Paul leveraging his celebrity to earn untold millionsby fighting Anthony Joshuaora 58-year-old Mike Tysonis actually good for boxing, just as no serious figure should believe that this event has any sort of noble cause. Sabalenka and Kyrgios are both represented by the same agency, Evolve, and they all stand to gain handsomely.2025 was one of the best women’s tennis seasons in recent memory, driven by performances from Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek but with a supreme supporting cast including Coco Gauff, Amanda Anisimova, Elena Rybakina and Madison Keys, players who have made life incredibly difficult for the top two and provoked numerous spectacular matches. As always, the best way to understand the greatness of women’s tennis is to watch women’s tennis.Explore more on these topicsTennisAryna SabalenkaNick KyrgioscommentShareReuse this content"

But, no sooner had Maxim De Cuyper received the ball on the counterattack, the Belgian was flattened by a crunching Declan Rice tackle that killed any threat. De Cuyper slumped; Rice, towering over him, roared – arguably this season’s standoutPremier Leaguemidfielder making light of playing right-back for the first time in his Arsenal career.Arsenal 2-1 Brighton, Liverpool 2-1 Wolves, Senegal 1-1 DR Congo, and more – football liveRead moreIf Arsenal are to win the Premier League this season, a ceaseless succession of injuries would render it a feat of staggering proportions. Rice the right-back; Mikel Merino the striker; Christian Nørgaard the centre-back – all have been seen at points this season. Even Saturday’s teamsheet had to be altered when the left-back Riccardo Calafiori dropped out after feeling a niggle in the warmup. There were an abundance of available excuses if a Brighton comeback had come to pass.That it did not owed much to a resilience required numerous times this season: almost half of Arsenal’s matches in all competitions have been drawn or decided by a single goal.The hosts’ failure to kill off the game after Martin Ødegaard’s opener and a Georginio Rutter own goal could have cost them. Diego Gómez unexpectedly pulled a goal back amid a period of Brighton threat in which David Raya also pulled off a wonder save to deny Yankuba Minteh. Asked whether it was sustainable for Arsenal to keep coming so close to capitulating at the back end of home games, Mikel Arteta answered simply: “Yes.”Supporters would rather not have to endure such frequently raised pulses, but the wins keep coming and, for successive weekends, Arsenal followed an earlier Manchester City victory by climbing back to the top of the table.“Very happy with the performance,” Arteta said. “Individually and collectively, so dominant. We were a big threat, so very pleased with that, but the margin should have been much bigger. It should never be 2-1, but that’s the Premier League.“We should have scored the third one and then it would have been different. We haven’t, so we have to suffer a little bit more.”View image in fullscreenDavid Raya spectacularly tips Yankuba Minteh’s shot over the bar to preserve Arsenal’s lead.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersThe Arsenal manager suggested the frequency of injuries was serving as a unifying force and insisted his side can continue to weather them: “At the moment we survived six months, so let’s see – hopefully things will get better.”Notwithstanding a 20-minute anxiety-inducing period of Brighton threat in the second half, it was a triumph of some ease. With Ødegaard pulling the strings, and Leandro Trossard and Bukayo Saka terrorising their hapless Brighton handlers, the winning margin should have been considerably greater. By half-time Arsenal had registered 15 shots to Brighton’s zero.Only one of those was converted after the hosts seized on a botched Brighton short goal-kick and capitalised with calm assurance. Saka fed Ødegaard, whose drilled finish into the bottom corner was his first goal of an injury-troubled campaign.The lead was doubled via a familiar route soon after half-time. A customary whipped Rice corner caused Rutter to flick the ball into his own net for Arsenal to benefit from a fourth own goal in their past three home games.By that stage things might have been worse for Brighton, who were perhaps fortunate not to have Bart Verbruggen sent off for flattening Viktor Gyökeres after charging out of his box. The proximity of the touchline meant it was not deemed a goalscoring opportunity, with the goalkeeper instead shown a yellow card.Having offered no attacking threat, the visitors unexpectedly pulled a goal back out of nothing just after the hour when Yasin Ayari’s low drive hit the post and Gómez hammered in the rebound. An uncomfortable tension rose around the Emirates Stadium, but Brighton could not find an equaliser.“In the first half we didn’t play a good game,” said Fabian Hürzeler, whose Brighton side have not won any of their past 11 games in the month of December. “The second half completely the opposite; a lot of courage. In the end it’s a disappointing result.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Hosting the ongoing Afcon and the past two women’s Afcons – in 2022 and this year, with another Wafcon to be played there in March and April 2026 – and staging the 2030 men’s World Cup, primarily with Portugal and Spain, shows the north African country’s importancewithin world football.“Being in my 40s, I have been a witness to all the unsuccessful bids to host the World Cup,” says Amine El Amri, the head of sport at Le360 and one of Morocco’s most respected football journalists. “Hosting the World Cup is a project that engages every Moroccan in a common dream, knowing that a World Cup tournament comes at a cost but also with a huge boost to the infrastructure of a very young and very demanding society.”Omar Khyari, head of international relations at the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), says forging close cultural, economic and diplomatic ties with the rest of Africa after the 2015 incident was a 2017 policy decision of King Mohammed VI, the country’s absolute monarch.Abderrahim Bourkia, a sports sociology professor at Hassan I University, goes further. “From a socioeconomic perspective, these tournaments are instruments of symbolic capital in the Bourdieusian sense, converted into political and economic capital. Mega-events accelerate urban development, modernise transport and stadiums, stimulate tourism and create temporary and long-term employment. At the same time, they contribute to a collective national narrative, strengthening social cohesion, pride and international visibility.View image in fullscreenMorocco is hosting the ongoing Afcon and will also stage the 2030 men’s World Cup.Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty Images“These events would generate hope around employment, infrastructure and development. I don’t know if I should use ‘should’ instead of ‘would’, but these events raise some questions: How do we ensure the benefits are socially inclusive? How do we avoid event-based development that overlooks everyday inequalities? And how do we transform football enthusiasm into sustainable public policy? Hosting these tournaments signifies Morocco’s capacity for organisation, to be trusted, and to project power symbolically. But it also challenges the country to translate sporting prestige into lasting social gains. And I think we could, if we think about it.”El Amri believes encounters with international visitors to Morocco help redefine national identity. “Moroccans look at themselves through the gaze of the other,” he says. “This can strengthen pride in cultural heritage: our music, our food and crafts, and religious tolerance, while also encouraging selective modernisation and openness.“Football becomes a stage for symbolic recognition, where Morocco asserts its Africanness and its global belonging. The society is a melting pot consisting of an Amazigh, Saharan, Arabic and southern European mixture. Opening the country to others is key in a world where power is shifting on a regular basis. It is strategic to know where we are and whom we are supposed to interact with, in order to find our proper and fitting place.”Sunday Oliseh, who won Afcon with Nigeria in 1994 and is working as an analyst at the ongoing tournament, knows Morocco well. The former Super Eagles captain and head coach is married to a Belgian-Moroccan.“I first came to Morocco in 1997 … We visit Morocco a lot and were here in August, in Tangier. For me, it is the most developed nation that I have seen in Africa over the last 30 years … Let anyone show you pictures of how Morocco was 30 years ago and compare it to now. It should really motivate other countries in Africa, especially my own, Nigeria, to make real progress.”View image in fullscreenWinning Afcon is the holy grail for ordinary Moroccans.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAnti-government youth-leddemonstrations that swept across Moroccoin late September and early October included accusations that the Moroccan government was prioritising spending on World Cup stadiums over social services. The government, which denied that, has since said it iscommitted to social reformsand announcedincreased spending on healthcare and education. Human rights groups have alleged the demonstrations led to thearbitrary detention of hundreds and beatings.In a football context, winning Afcon is the holy grail for ordinary Moroccans, the country having last secured the title in 1976. Hosting the 1988 tournament and the past two Wafcons did not bring home success but El Amri says the country’s goals as hosts go far beyond titles.“It is an opportunity to showcase not only our capacity to welcome the world but also to emphasise a deeply rooted tradition of being a genuine, open, yet respectful country. Moroccans from all walks of life love football, and seeing superstar players in Morocco is gratifying. On the economic level, it’s a huge boost to a solid industry, even though it is still a developing tourism industry. The image of a welcoming, affordable and secure country goes beyond any PR campaign.”Walid Regragui, Morocco’s manager, is acutely aware, though, that only an Afcon title triumph on 18 January will ensure he leads the team to next year’s World Cup. He took the Atlas Lions to a historic semi-final place at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar but in the result-oriented business of sport only the present is valued.Explore more on these topicsMorocco football teamAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Africa Cup of NationsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The lasting impression, however, was Liverpool’s relief at holding off a team that has endured more defeats in the first half of a season than any other inPremier Leaguehistory.“I’ve just said to the lads that I’m getting fed up with this,” said Rob Edwards, the Wolves manager. Edwardshas been in chargefor seven games, but deflation was understandable.Wolves, two down at half-time, finished the contest on top and performed with more endeavour and adventure than many visitors to Anfield. But they left with only unwanted records.Slot applauds Liverpool and Wolves fans for ‘special’ Anfield tribute to Diogo JotaRead moreAn 18th game without a win from the start of a season means Wolves eclipse Sheffield United’s 17-match winless streak in 2020-21. They are also the first top-flight team since Bolton in 1902-03 not to win any of their first 18 league games. Victory never appeared likely here, certainly not after Ryan Gravenberch and Wirtz struck in quick succession in the first half, but a second-half transformation warranted greater reward.Liverpoolhad to fight to get over the line at on an increasingly tense afternoon.“The last 10 minutes were much better than last week [at Tottenham] but that wasn’t too difficult,” said Arne Slot.Jota’s two sons, Dinis and Duarte, and other young family members were mascots for the first meeting between the late striker’s two English clubssince his deathin July. It was a lovely touch by Liverpool to involve the family so closely in proceedings though heartbreaking to see the children walk out alongside Virgil van Dijk with their mum, Jota’s widow, Rute Cardoso, watching on from the sidelines and their dad’s retired number 20 on their backs.The Liverpool captain looked after the youngsters brilliantly throughout the warm-up. Wolves supporters sang their Jota song in the 18th minute and Liverpool fans followed suit with their customary tribute in the 20th.View image in fullscreenLiverpool’s Virgil van Dijk with Diogo Jota’s sons and other relatives before kick-off at Anfield.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersWolves acquitted themselves well with the 18-year-old forward Mateus Mané hugely impressive on his first start. Edwards pushed him to take a well-deserved bow in front of the away fans after the final whistle.Wirtz was the most creative talent on display and crafted the first opening with a delightful ball through to Hugo Ekitiké. Wolves’ defenders closed down the in-form striker but he managed to clip a shot against the far post.For 41 minutes José Sá was relatively untroubled in the Wolves goal. He did make a superb stop to turn an Alexis Mac Allister half volley against a post but Federico Chiesa, deputising for the suspended Dominik Szoboszlai, was offside in front of him. Anfield was getting restless, Wolves seemingly comfortable, when Liverpool carved open their opponents twice in two minutes.Jeremie Frimpong made the breakthrough when collecting Chiesa’s layoff and accelerating away from João Gomes and Hugo Bueno into the area. From the byline he pulled back a perfect assist for Gravenberch to stroke a measured finish inside Sá’s bottom left-hand corner.View image in fullscreenRyan Gravenberch fires home Liverpool’s opener four minutes before half-time.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesLiverpool doubled their advantage while Wolves were clearing their heads. Milos Kerkez regained possession and Ekitiké, having spun away from his marker, released Wirtz through a gaping hole in Wolves’ central defence. The Germany international beat the advancing Sá to the ball and poked home his first Liverpool goal in his 23rd appearance for the club. Every outfield Liverpool player made a point of swamping Wirtz as he celebrated finally breaking his duck.That should have been the cue for Liverpool to coast to victory but Wolves never resigned themselves to a 16th league defeat of a desperate campaign. Santiago Bueno reduced the deficit after Tolu Arokodare met André’s corner with a towering header and Alisson blocked on his goalline. The Wolves defender made no mistake with the rebound from close range. Another set-piece malfunction from Liverpool.The home side were vulnerable against Wolves’ positive, purposeful passing game too. One flowing move resulted in a free header for Arokodare but the unmarked forward steered his attempt over Alisson’s crossbar. Liverpool were also grateful to substitute Conor Bradley for a vital challenge on Jhon Arias when the Wolves sub looked to convert Jørgen Strand Larsen’s cross in the final moments.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Or at least that was how it seemed in October. Already, though, the picture has begun to change. This was the year of the backlash, and then a bit of a backlash to the backlash.For almost two decades football had accepted theguardiolistaconsensus. Football was about possession, about the press, but most of all about position, about the careful manipulation of space. Much-improved pitches meant first touches could be taken for granted: players receiving the ball didn’t have to focus on getting it under control but could instead be parsing their options. The game had become chess with a ball, a matter of strategy more than physicality.Into which environment enter Nicolas Jover, Austin MacPhee, Bernardo Cueva and the fleet of set-piece coaches who have transformed the Premier League this season: 21.8% of goals have come from corners or throw-ins, up from 13.9% last season.View image in fullscreenNicolas Jover and the fleet of set-piece coaches have transformed the Premier League.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesTo an extent that is a result of referees being far more prepared to permit challenges on goalkeepers. The era when any contact was considered a foul is, thankfully, over but the degree of licence has perhaps gone too far when players can grab an opponent’s arm – as, say, David Brooks did to Gianluigi Donnarumma in the buildupto Bournemouth’s goal at Manchester Citythis season – and not be penalised on the grounds that he released his grip before the ball arrived in the penalty area.But it’s also about a more general trend of tactical history, which is the reinvention of old methods in new circumstances. This does not mean, as is often claimed, that tactics are cyclical. That would imply they followed a set pattern – winter, spring, summer, autumn – when it’s more that changing priorities can lead to vulnerabilities emerging that, once recognised, can be exploited.‘We’ve fallen behind’: why Germany’s biggest teams have split from DFBRead moreAs the game became increasingly about possession, the focus for defenders, at least at elite clubs, became less about their heading, marking and tackling, the old-fashioned defensive virtues, than their ability on the ball. Which, it turns out, offered an opportunity if you could put them under aerial pressure.That led to a minor moral panic. How could football survive if it just became a series of set pieces, the fluidity that can make football so compelling swept aside by a generation of gurus with iPads and playbooks? The International Football Association Board, which sets the laws of the game, murmured about forcing teams to take set plays within 30 seconds of them being awarded.This is a telling reveal: officials awarding a set play can often take several minutes using VAR to make a decision, while those taking them are to be chivvied and harassed? Which is only right: why would anybody want to see the person best equipped to take a set play, who may have to jog 50 yards to take it, set themselves and take it to the best of their ability? Far more important to get the ball back in play as quickly as possible so we can get to the real business of another penalty appeal or hair’s-breadth offside call.View image in fullscreenRobert Sánchez was able to claim throws with comfort against Tottenham with the box less crowded.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersOver the years, though, football has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to stabilise, to maintain the balance between attack and defence, between technique and physique, without the need to tweak the laws in the way other sports have felt the need for adjustment.Defenders started remembering how to head. Against Tottenham, Enzo Maresca’s Chelsea left three players upfield. Spurs, wary of being caught on the break, left men back to cover. With the box less crowded, the goalkeeper Robert Sánchez was able to come and claim throws with a degree of comfort. It’s not that throws or set plays are no longer a weapon, merely that already they don’t seem quite as devastating or impossible to combat as they did even a couple of months ago. The proportion of goals from throw-ins and corners has fallen 5.2% from the end of October.It seems not unreasonable to assume this is the way football will be for a time. The sport is 160 years old, it is mature. If there are revolutions to come, they will be rare and almost certainly predicated on a technological advance akin to the change in pitch technology that underlayguardolismo; it’s possible to imagine the data revolution and AI having a similarly profound impact. WhatPep Guardioladid, re-invoking the principles of Total Football for a world of flat pitches, creating a worldwide revolution, is exceptionally unusual.View image in fullscreenDominic Calvert-Lewin is in the best scoring form of his career.Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty ImagesEven Guardiola has stepped back from the radicalism of his Barcelona days. In part that may be because once a strand of thought has been pushed so far, the only way to go is backwards, just as many artists, having pursued abstraction to an extreme, end up returning to something more representational, although filtered through the lessons of that process of radicalism. Revolutions once experienced are never forgotten.But it’s also, as Guardiola explicitly said towards the end of last season, about the crowded nature of the calendar. Hewould prefer a small squadhe can indoctrinate in his theories, a philosophy to underlay the specific plans he comes up with for each game. The hectic schedule, though, means there is no longer time for such bespoke preparation, while the physical demands on players mandate a larger squad.That encourages an approach of tweaking and adaptation, aided by the data revolution, perhaps raiding the past for approaches modern sides have forgotten how to deal with. Leeds’s upturn since Daniel Farke switched to a front two at half-timein the defeat by Manchester Cityis a case in point. Centre-backs pairings used to having one to mark and one to cover have had to adapt to both marking and the result has been Dominic Calvert-Lewinhitting the best goalscoring runof his career.This is a fascinating period for tactics. The monolithic belief ofguardiolismohas fractured and nobody is entirely sure what is to follow. It’s a little like English football after the defeat by Hungary in 1953. The old ways are over and in their place has come an age of small-scale experimentation and counter-experimentation from which, eventually, the new era will be synthesised.Explore more on these topicsFootball tacticsInside footballPep GuardiolacommentShareReuse this content"

Donnarumma hurtled 40 yards towards the away technical area where Pep Guardiola was mobbed by his coaching staff, including Pep Lijnders and the set-piece coach James French, the architect behind Phil Foden’s corner that led to the goal that extended their winning run to eight matches. Then for a moment of calm, Cherki mimicked Erling Haaland’s meditation pose on the City Ground turf.It is now six wins in a row in the Premier League, the kind of ominous run they had not stitched together since winning their final nine matches of 2023-24. Everyone knows how that finished,City pipping Arsenalto the title by two points. This was anything but a straightforward victory, the City centre-backs Rúben Dias and Josko Gvardiol unusually ruffled by the Forest striker Igor Jesus; Dias was fortunate to finish an entertaining match with only a caution and Gvardiol got off the hook altogether.Nottingham Forest 1-2 Manchester City: Premier League – liveRead moreSean Dyche, the Forest manager, was adamant Morgan Gibbs-White was impeded in the buildup to Cherki’s winner, a first-time strike that whistled through the legs of the Forest captain and low into the corner of past John Victor. Gibbs-White went to ground after colliding with Nico O’Reilly before an unmarked Gvardiol cushioned a header into the path of Cherki who, just inside Forest’s penalty area, struck to maintain his sparkling form. Dyche felt the officials should have intervened: “It was such an easy game to referee, in my opinion, such an easy decision for VAR.”Cherki earlier registered his seventh assist of the season after slipping Tijjani Reijnders in for City’s opener two and a half minutes into the second half, collecting Gvardiol’s pass on the half-turn and freeing Reijnders to do the rest. “Always when we sign a player we expect the best, it’s true, but in reality he made an incredible assist and the winning goal,” Guardiola said. “From day one with Rayan, there are moments I want to shout at him and moments I want to kiss him. I have that ambivalent feeling with him, but I have to allow him to express his incredible talent.”For Forest, emotions had been heightened following the news ofJohn Robertson’s passingat the age of 72. There were floral tributes on the gates of the City Ground, Forest players and staff wore black armbands and, pre-match, there was a minute’s applause and a moving montage on the big screens. “Robbo is bionic,” read a scarf held aloft by one home supporter. A banner in the Bridgford Stand, to be renamed in Robertson’s honour, carried that famous old line from Brian Clough. “Give him a yard of grass and he was an artist,” it read. “The Picasso of our game.”View image in fullscreenFans hold up banners in tribute to the former Nottingham Forest player John Robertson, who died on Christmas Day.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesQuickly an entertaining game centred on Igor Jesus’s tussle with the City centre-backs. From kick-off the Brazil striker charged into Dias, as if to advise of the kind of afternoon ahead. Gvardiol was eventually penalised by the referee, Robert Jones, for tugging at Igor Jesus’s shirt on halfway. Less than a minute into the second half Dias crossed paths with the striker again, but escaped further punishment. Up the other end Haaland was shackled, his greatest contribution dummying an overcooked Elliot Anderson pass. “Haaland, Haaland!” crooned the visiting supporters.Forest passed up the first big opening, Igor Jesus and Gibbs-White both trying and failing to convert a Callum Hudson-Odoi cross after galloping, almost in tandem, towards the City six-yard box. Forest were disciplined and afforded City little room to manoeuvre. Neither side mustered an effort on target in the first half. But then Cherki released Reijnders with a killer pass behind Nikola Milenkovic. Guardiola pointed at Lijnders, high-fiving and then hugging his assistant, and the relief at breaking Forest’s stubborn resistance was palpable. “We know a lot of clubs suffer here,” Reijnders said. “It’s a very important win and we are on the hunt.”Reijnders’s strike seemed to provide City the warmth of a Christmas blanket and, on the run, Cherki sent an effort at goal that Victor forced on to his left post and out for a corner. Then Forest found an equaliser, Omari Hutchinson, a £37.5m arrival from Ipswich in the summer, scoring his first goal for the club. Gibbs-White drifted into the left channel and picked out Igor Jesus, who wedged a superb cross towards the edge of the box, where Hutchinson applied the finish.City would not freewheel to another victory – they had scored at least three goals in each of their previous five league wins – but another magical moment courtesy of Cherki maintained their winning run.View image in fullscreenRayan Cherki’s shot finds the bottom right corner of the Forest net.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersThis time Guardiola gravitated towards French, who, like Lijnders, joined his staff last summer. “I know my memory is weak but when we won one of our six Premier Leagues, these types of games help a lot,” Guardiola said. “It is three points, but it is a massive three points.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNottingham ForestManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Andoni Iraola’s status as a hot property is cooling amid difficult winter months. Bournemouth are the latest team to struggle after selling players to offset harsh financial winds. Of the Premier League’s set of “well-run”, smaller clubs, perhaps Brentford, who climbed to eighth, are now the best example of how to flourish after losing key personnel.“Don’t be down on yourself” was Keith Andrews’ recipe for his team’s successes after last summer’s defection of the manager, Thomas Frank, the captain, Christian Nørgaard, and leading scorers Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa. “I think it’s easy in this industry to look at what you haven’t got. Look at what you didn’t get rather than focus on what you have got.”Florian Wirtz nets first Liverpool goal to edge out Wolves on emotional dayRead moreAndrews inherited real talent on succeeding Frank. Igor Thiago and hat-trick hero Kevin Schade, both electric, positively ravaged Bournemouth’s defenders, suggesting if the Semenyo money can be reinvested the place to spend it is at the back. Semenyo, said to be Manchester-bound, got on the scoresheet but by then his team were three down. There would be no comeback. “We arrived 45 minutes late for aPremier Leaguegame,” said Iraola. “If we lose like we did in the second half, no problem but it was too late.”A year that began with high promise ebbs into dust and a desperate recent run of form. Bournemouth’s last Premier League victory was on 26 October. Losing Dean Huijsen, Illia Zabarnyi and Milos Kerkez is taking a heavy toll; their replacements are struggling. Just as problematic is a lack of goals;Bournemouthkicked off seventh in the Premier League on chance creation but with a negative goal difference, and 15th in the real table.Brentford’spre-Christmas win at Wolveshad lifted them 10 points clear of the bottom three. That cushion clearly lent confidence. “We grow from game to game,” said Schade. Yehor Yarmolyuk had fired wide even before the German speedster was sent away by Thiago to score his first. Bafodé Diakité’s clumsiness made the task easy.View image in fullscreenKevin Schade tucks home the opening goal for Brentford.Photograph: Harry Murphy/Getty ImagesFrom the start, Semenyo found Michael Kayode’s physical prowess difficult to shake and was often asked to do more defending than attacking.Brentfordstaged the type of early blitz trademarked in the Frank era. Andrews has his own ideas on the game, including repurposing the excellent Keane Lewis-Potter to raid off the right, but his team retain the same qualities of being flinty, ornery opponents.Diakité’s partner at the back, Marcos Senesi, had his own struggles when chased down by Andrews’ pack of hunting dogs. Both were on the crime scene for Brentford’s second, high farce following Thiago springing the offside trap. The ball ended in the net via both hapless central defenders and a flap from Djordje Petrovic. “The first half, we were sensational,” said Andrews. “We were not ourselves,” said Iraola.View image in fullscreenKevin Schade carries the match ball after his hat-trick for Brentford.Photograph: Peter Tarry/PAHe made three changes at the break, including the removal of the unfortunate Diakité, with Lewis Cook repurposed at centre-back, in a desperate search for vital signs. On came David Brooks, Evanilson and Justin Kluivert but that did not close the aching midfield gaps Brentford continued to exploit. Schade’s second came via another breakneck counter. Thiago, who meted out the same treatment to Cook as he had Diakité, supplied Yarmolyuk’s cutback before Schade’s drilled finish.“If you give players opportunities in the right type of environment, if their attitude is right and they want to achieve things, then they can do that,” said Andrews, delighted by his team’s overall display, not just his goalscorers.Bournemouth at last rallied, Kluivert incredibly hitting the post from mere inches out. Semenyo did at least manage to score from the same distance with a neat back heel. A farewell goal, with reports that Manchester City want him on 1 January? “Obviously I don’t want to lose him,” said Iraola. “The more games he can play for us, the better for us.”A Bournemouth second might have come but Kayode twice thwarted Semenyo’s incursions. Instead, in microcosm of their year, falling short of objectives there for the taking, Bournemouth gassed out, their hopes extinguished by Schade joyously nodding in his third with virtually the last action of the game.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrentfordBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Although Spurs are set fair to qualify for the knockout rounds of the competition, it has been possible to view their involvement as a poisoned chalice.Is there sufficient quality in the squad or resolve when the going gets tough? Frank’s players were slated for their reaction to going behind at Nottingham Forest after their last European midweek game, whenthey subsided to a 3-0 loss.Frank is acutely aware of the size of the challenge and yet he is fortified when he remembers how he drove improvement at Brøndby, his first job as a club manager which he began in 2013, and Brentford where he took over in 2018.“At Brøndby, I didn’t win the first eight games and then we were unbeaten in nine,” he said. “At Brentford, we lost eight out of 10 games and then we were unbeaten in 10. So I am convinced we will see a similar pattern here. I’m not in doubt of that. Because I know how to make a competitive team. We will make a very competitive team here, as well.View image in fullscreenThomas Frank tries to lift his players after their dismal defeat at Nottingham Forest.Photograph: Visionhaus/Getty Images“What makes it even more complex here is the amount of games we are playing … with rotations, and physical load and mental load that just impact a team and especially if it’s not used to do that.”Frank, who has made it his mission to instil greater resilience, was asked whether losing can become a habit. “I definitely think there are habits that can go both ways,” he replied. “There are good habits and bad habits and, of course, winning is a good habit and losing is a bad habit.“But underneath that are the habits of every staff member, every player. How do you react when there are setbacks in games? That is something we are really working very, very hard on. There are bits that are going the right way [in this area] but we are not consistent enough to do that every third or fourth day.“It’s small bits and good habits for a player. You want a player to do recovery runs 10 out of 10 times and he does it five out of 10 times. He won’t do it like this [Frank clicks his fingers] and then he’s doing it 10 out of 10 times. It will maybe be five and a half, six, six and a half, seven. That’s how it works.”Frank has said he is working “24-7” in the hunt for solutions and never in his life has he thought more about the game. “The good thing is I’ve always been a good sleeper so that’s helpful,” he said. “But of course you can feel that the thoughts are just underneath you. We’ve all experienced that with work. Probably you guys in your job [in the media] … there are nights where underlying there are these thoughts going on.“They’ve been there a long time [for me] because there’s a lot of things to sort out. When you get small setbacks and don’t get the right response you try something new or you stick to it. So that’s the bit. It’s normal. It’s not the first time in my career I haven’t found the team instantly but it’s coming over time. I know it will come. Probably sooner rather than later.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FranknewsShareReuse this content"

The Sweden midfielder putCelticin front in the 31st minute and an Arne Engels penalty gave them some breathing space before the break.Bottom-placed Livingston, who have gone 17 matches without a win, continued to trouble Celtic’s back three but Wilfried Nancy’s team did enough to seal a second consecutive win. Montano’s first came inside three minutes after a mistake by Kieran Tierney, but Nygren levelled after a corner. Montano soon made it 2-1, lashing in Scott Pittman’s cross after letting it bounce, but Yang emerged with the ball from a goalmouth scramble and knocked it over the line.Just after the half-hour a long spell of possession ended with Nygren whipping a shot in off the far post after receiving Tierney’s pass just inside the box. Celtic were then handed a 39th-minute penalty when Matthew MacDermid was sent to the monitor by the video assistant referee and ruled that Engels’ corner had struck the arm of Daniel Finlayson as the defender tried to head clear.

However, when Ward could only parry Gassama’s curling shot from inside the Motherwell box, after he had fashioned a yard of space, Aasgaard was on hand to slide the ball in from a couple of yards for his second Rangers goal.Danny Röhl, the Rangers manager, said: “I’m not looking too much to the data, but if you have 28 shots, a lot of big opportunities, three against one, four against one situations, you have to close the game.”His counterpart, Jens Berthel Askou, was baffled by the lack of a penalty in the second half when Lukas Fadinger went to ground while going past Emmanuel Fernandez. Play went on and the referee, David Dickinson, was not asked to look at his pitchside monitor by the VAR.“There’s something I will take with me into my grave, not understanding how we don’t get a penalty at the end,” he said. “He clearly tripped Lukas going free on an open goal.”Dundeesecured a potentially precious 1-0 win overFalkirkat Dens Park thanks to a first-half penalty by Yan Dhanda.Falkirkenjoyed plenty of possession but could not capitalise even when the home substitute Simon Murray was sent off late on.

But Tunisia staged a late comeback with goals from the defenders Montassar Talbi and Ali Abdi that set up a frenetic finish.Afcon roundup: Mohamed Salah strikes again as 10-man Egypt hold off South AfricaRead moreIt was Nigeria’s second win in Group C and ensures they will top the standings, even with one first-round fixture still to play. Their six-point haul is three more than second-placed Tunisia, with Tanzania and Uganda on one point each.Osimhen had a series of narrow misses from as early as the eighth minute as Nigeria came out of the starting blocks swarming all over Tunisia. But it took until the 44th minute for the striker, wearing his customary mask to protect his cheekbone, to score as he rose at the back post to head home Lookman’s cross.Nigeria were 2-0 up five minutes into the second half when Ndidi soared high above the Tunisian defence to score from a corner. Osimhen turned provider for Nigeria’s third in the 67th minute, dragging the ball into the path of Lookman, who looked initially to have spurned a good opportunity but after hesitating was still able to get a shot away and the ball went in off the post.Tunisia pulled their first goal back in the 74th minute when Hannibal Mejbri’s free-kick was met by Talbi and the error-prone Nigeria goalkeeper Stanley Nwabali slipped in his efforts to stop it.Tunisia won a fortunate penalty with five minutes left as the ball hit Bright Osayi-Samuel’s hand as he was trying to head clear. The spot-kick was thrashed home by Abdi, setting up a late surge from Tunisia with Ferjani Sassi’s header deep in stoppage time inches away from a dramatic equaliser.Egypt became the first team into the last 16 on Friday when they beat South Africa 1-0 to make sure of top place in Group B.

It is a first point for both sides in their pool after they opened their 2025 campaign with defeats by Tunisia and Nigeria respectively.Tanzania took the lead in the 59th minute when Simon Msuva converted a penalty after a handball in the box, but they were to be denied a first-ever win at the continental finals at the 11th attempt. Ikpeazu’s diving header drew Uganda level, before they were awarded a penalty and the chance to win it late on, only for the talisman Okello to put his spot kick over the crossbar.There was a familiar feel to the contest between two longstanding regional rivals, though this was their first meeting at the Cup of Nations. Uganda came close to the opener when Rogers Mato’s header came back off the crossbar inside 15 minutes, but the game really came to life in the second half.Tanzania were awarded a penalty when Alphonce Msanga’s shot from outside the box struck the arm of the Uganda midfielder Baba Alhassan, which was deemed to be in an unnatural position. Msuva stepped up to take the spot-kick and fired it into the roof of the net.But Tanzania could not see the game out and were denied a maiden Cup of Nations finals win when Ikpeazu stooped to head in Denis Omedi’s cross from the right. The Moroccan referee, Jalal Jayed, then awarded Uganda a penalty after a tug on the shirt of James Bogere by Haji Mnoga. Okello is known as Star Boy in his homeland, such is his talent, but fluffed his lines on this occasion as he sent his spot-kick over the bar.View image in fullscreenSadio Mané was on target in Senegal’s draw against DR Congo.Photograph: Themba Hadebe/APSadio Mané scored forSenegalas they came from behind to draw 1-1 with theDemocratic Republic of the Congoon Saturday and keep top place in Group D.

They took the lead, however, with a sweeping move forward, with Théo Bongonda combining with Wan-Bissaka before firing a shot that Édouard Mendy could only parry into the path of Bakambu, who finished from close range.Senegal’s 17-year-old substitute Ibrahim Mbaye set up the equaliser for Mane with a mazy run, although he profited from the DRC defender Arthur Masuaku suddenly stopping with a suspected achilles tendon injury. Mbaye’s shot was stopped by the goalkeeper Lionel Mpasi but fell for Mané to sweep home.The two sides have four points from their opening two games and look set to progress into the last 16 with their final group games on Tuesday.

The air was warm and smelled faintly of spilled pints. The chants of “One Stephen Bunting” had long since died away, and all that was left was one Stephen Bunting: three darts in his hand and no more tricks up his sleeve. No place left to run.And so as James Hurrell pinned tops to win 4-3 and claim the biggest victory of his life, there was just the merest whiff of anticlimax to it all: a seismic shock that also somehow felt like the most natural thing in the world. The crowds dispersed with barely a murmur. Hurrell packed up his darts and left the stage: not overawed or overcome, but bearing the immense calmness of a man who had seen this all coming in advance.Perhaps he was the only one who had. Certainly nothing the 41-year-old from the Cotswolds has achieved in his two years on tour suggested he was capable of this performance, on this stage, in this tournament. There was a promising run to the last 16 of the Players Championship finals last month. Some promising runs on the floor. An assured disposal of Dirk van Duijvenbode in the second round here. But he was the world No 63 for a reason.View image in fullscreenA dejected Stephen Bunting leaves the stage after his defeat by James Hurrell.Photograph: James Fearn/Getty ImagesAnd yet time and again, as Bunting pulled outstanding finishes out of thin air, as the Bullet tried to surf the familiar wave of emotion and noise that has turned far more accomplished opponents to rubble, he found Hurrell’s stout frame blocking his path, relentlessly outscoring him on the inner ring, utterly unflustered by the size of his task. In truth Hurrell destroyed the world No 4 here, outscoring him by 98 to 91 on the averages, winning 18 legs to 12, ultimately a little irritated that such a dominant performance had still required a deciding set.“Should have won four-nil,” he said afterwards, and it didn’t sound like boasting or bragging, just a statement of fact. He plays Martin Schindler or Ryan Searle for a place in the quarter-finals, but on this form he would give anyone in the world a game. “I’ve got a different mindset these days,” he said. “Not feeling no nerves or anything. I’m so confident in my game. I’m not going anywhere.”But for a while it was hard to see exactly where Hurrell was going. Eight years ago he woke in the night feeling ill and vomited blood into the sink, a symptom of the twisted bowel that would ultimately require an emergency life-saving operation and put him out of the sport for more than two years. The man who emerged on the other side of surgery was a more driven and focused player, determined to make up for lost time.Dartsis full of players like Hurrell: richly talented, quietly plugging away, biding their time, waiting for the rich vein of form that will catapult them to greatness.For Bunting, an ignominious end to a frustrating year. Brand Bunting is as strong as ever: the social media profile, the electrifying walk-on, the fans and the fame. It may yet be enough to keep his spot in next year’s Premier League. But in recent months there has also been a real fragility to him, most evident when he broke down after his second-round win over Nitin Kumar, evidence of a game and a mindset that for whatever reason were not quite right.This was a meek and fully deserved exit: still littered with micro-moments of brilliance but lacking in both consistency and conviction. He averaged just 84 in losing the first set, saved the second with a miraculous 161 finish, won the third with a 121 finish and the sixth with a 100 checkout. But eventually his well of miracles ran dry. The songs went quiet. The belief drained from the crowd, and eventually it drained from him too.View image in fullscreenLuke Littler barely gave Mensur Suljovic a look-in during a 4-0 demolition.Photograph: James Fearn/Getty ImagesBeyond Hurrell, Bunting’s exit has two main beneficiaries in the top half of the draw:Luke Littlerand Jonny Clayton. Not that the world No 1 looked in any need of help during his 4-0 demolition of Mensur Suljovic in the night’s final game. Clayton, meanwhile, is now the only remaining top-10 player in his section after coming through a nervy deciding set against the much-improved Niels Zonneveld of the Netherlands.Next Clayton will play the debutant Andreas Harrysson of Sweden, who looked extremely impressive in beating Ricardo Pietreczko of Germany 4-2. With his straggly grey beard and showman’s flourish, Harrysson is one of those cult heroes who seems to come alive on the Alexandra Palace stage. By day the 50-year-old from Målilla works in a factory making window frames. By night he toils in the dream factory, and if he beats Clayton he will automatically claim a 2026 tour card and fulfil his lifelong ambition of playing full-time professional darts.Explore more on these topicsPDC World ChampionshipDartsLuke LittlernewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the longest upwind I’ve ever done. It was pretty unpleasant. I was pretty sick myself,” Beck said.The Tasmania-owned Kraken 42S retired on Saturday night and headed for the New South Wales coast after a crew member suffered suspected broken ribs and the yacht had electrical issues.Last year’s 31st yacht across the line, Ragtime, was among those forced to call it quits overnight after the boat’s life raft was lost overboard.Her retirement came after Moneypenny, a former third overall and division winner, also lost a lift raft overboard when it self inflated.“As safety is the first priority, we had to retire from the race as all safety equipment is required to remain onboard during the race,” the crew said on social media.“The very things that make ocean racing so exciting can also make it devastating.”URM Group, a contender for the handicap trophy, was out of the race on Saturday afternoon with hull damage, marking a second retirement in two years.Wild Thing 100, which finished third in line honours and in overall standings in 2024, has been another high-profile casualty.Skipper Grant Wharington said the seas had been “nasty” and he wasn’t confident makeshift repairs would hold up in tough upwind conditions.“When you’ve got $4 million of mast in the air and no insurance you analyse these things a bit more carefully than you might have otherwise done,” he said.Crews have battled 25 knot winds and four metre swells in the 80th edition of the race, with some earlier retirements citing crew sea sickness.A Sunday evening finish in Hobart is expected, which will be well short of the race record of one day, nine hours, 15 minutes and 24 seconds set in 2017.Explore more on these topicsSydney to Hobart yacht raceSailingSydneyHobartAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the celebrations also featured the away dugout being showered with water when the final whistle was blown. It was not clear if the bottle was thrown by someone from theChelseabench or whether it came from the crowd. Chelsea intend to cooperate with the investigation.Ollie Watkins’ second-half double earns Aston Villa comeback victory at ChelseaRead moreThe incident did nothing to dim Villa’s joy at an 11th consecutive win in all competitions. They were poor in the first half butUnai Emerychanged the game with a triple substitution just before the hour. Ollie Watkins, one of the players who came on, earned Villa an impressive win by scoring twice.However Emery, who was called a “tactical genius” by Watkins, refused to entertain talk of a title challenge before his side’s trip to Arsenal on Tuesday.“We are playing against Arsenal and our mentality is to compete strongly,” he said. “And we are not going to speak about our target in the league until we are in game 34 because there are teams contending with a huge power to get points like Liverpool, like Chelsea. Of course we are performing very well, we are winning matches, we are competing fantastic. There is still another 20 matches to play.”Villa’s record of earning 18 points from losing positions stands in stark contrast to Chelsea dropping 11 points from winning positions at home this season. Enzo Maresca, who watched from the stands while he served a touchline ban, admitted that Chelsea did not manage the game well enough.However, Maresca, whose side have slipped to fifth place, insisted that he had no issue with Cole Palmer’s angry reaction to being substituted in the 72nd minute.“He was working very good,” the Chelsea head coach said. “He was on the ball and off the ball, pressing, he was very good. We have another game in 48 hours, so he was good and we are happy that he’s back.” Maresca added that Marc Cucurella had to come off with a hamstring injury in the second half.Explore more on these topicsAston VillaChelseaUnai EmerynewsShareReuse this content"

Well, not quite the team.Northamptonrung the changes for this match, but the understudies proved the stars of the show to terrorise their hosts. Six tries, a hat-trick for Tommy Freeman and the lead, no less, of the Prem for good measure.The bookies gave Northampton a 20-point head start for this one. In the end it wasBathwho needed it. Bath were at full strength, the Saints some way short of it, but this will surely prove one of the performances of the season.Bristol survive scare but Newcastle off the mark in Prem as Spencer seals bonusRead more“I’m lost for words,” Freeman said. “There’s been a lot of rotation and a lot of people wrote us off, but we just wanted to leave nothing out there and take every opportunity.”If only they had been allowed to. Northampton were unlucky not to have won by more, after three tries were ruled out, a couple of them very harshly.Both sides had changed 10 players from their comfortable wins last weekend, but Bath had strengthened their side, while Northampton left a host of first-teamers at home. The Saints are the sort of club whose backup players thrive in this environment. Hard, flexible and above all smart, they seemed to relish their underdog status.The scores were level at the break, but that was something of a travesty, what with those disallowed tries. Freeman, making his first Prem start since October, was selected at outside centre and scored the first try in only the third minute, picking a superb line off an attacking lineout to stroll over in style. Which was when the officials turned nasty.View image in fullscreenTommy Freeman goes on the attack against Bath.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesFrom the restart, Joe Cokanasiga seemed to tap the ball back. Rory Hutchinson – the epitome of hard, flexible and smart – controlled it expertly to send Edoardo Todaro away. But during the Italy wing’s run-in the touch judge told the referee, Craig Maxwell-Keys, that Cokanasiga’s tap-back was actually a Northampton knock-on. Maxwell-Keys blew his whistle before the try was scored. A shame they did not wait and then check, because replays suggested the touch judge’s call was wrong.Bath set up a sustained attack from the resultant scrum, and Thomas du Toit was cleverly worked over from a tapped penalty a few minutes later. A 14-0 lead to the visitors thus became 7-7. And then 14-7, when Tom Dunn went over from a second lineout to the corner, in the 15th minute.Quick GuideGloucester 21-30 Saracens: Williams shines in defeatShowMark McCall hailed Tomos Williams as a “great, great player” after the Wales international  underlined the quality that Saracens can expect by shining for Gloucester in a 30-21 Prem defeat against McCall’s team at Kingsholm. The 30-year-old British & Irish Lion created two of Gloucester’s three tries and was a constant threat in a first appearance since Saracens announced their high-profile signing on Christmas Day.“He is a great, great player,” the Saracens rugby director said of Williams (pictured laying the ball off for Arthur Clark's try). “He didn’t really have the best platform today, but everyone can see his quality every time he attacks.”Saracens ended a run of three-successive league defeats by seeing off Gloucester in bonus-point fashion. The flanker Theo McFarland inspired a first Prem win since mid-October by scoring two of his team’s four tries, while the hooker Theo Dan and the scrum-half Ivan van Zyl also crossed, with the fly-half Owen Farrell kicking two penalties and two conversions.McCall said: “Overall, it was one of our better 80-minute performances. Today was good, but we have had inconsistent days. We could have beaten Bath and we could have beaten Exeter and been in a slightly different position to where we are. Today was important because have lost a few in a row and it was important to come down here and get a result.”Gloucester had their moments – notably through first-half touchdowns for the locks Freddie Thomas and Clark, plus a late Will Knight try – with Ross Byrne converting all three scores, but they ultimately slipped to a seventh loss from eight Prem games this season. To compound Gloucester’s frustration, they lost wing Ben Loader – a pre-season signing from the South African side the Stormers – after 15 minutes of his comeback game following injury.Gloucester's rugby director, George Skivington, said: “We are creating some pressure and some good line-breaks and then just not finishing them off. That is a sign of not quite connecting – we have not quite got the experience at the moment to get across the line.“On the flipside, the boys stayed in the fight the whole game. They were desperate to try and get a losing bonus point at the end and never threw the towel in.\"PA MediaPhotograph: Dan Istitene/Getty Images EuropeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Bath looked powerful at that point but not convincing. Early in the second quarter, Northampton, down to 14 after a yellow card for Ed Prowse from a head collision, struck again. Archie McParland found a gap round the fringes and ran to the posts. The excellent Anthony Belleau, in for Fin Smith, landed the conversion to equalise.Northampton thought they had scored again before the break. Belleau turned the ball inside to George Hendy to launch Freeman at the posts. Callum Chick touched down in the follow-up, but the TMO drew attention to a marginal call at the previous ruck. Whether Beno Obano was impeded in defence of the ruck is a moot point. He did not seem to be aware of it himself.The pattern continued into the second half. Bath scored a third try – Du Toit again, from a tapped penalty again – and Northampton had a third disallowed. Hutchinson’s try was awarded initially. This time the TMO rightly drew attention to the fact Hutchinson was inches short.Quick GuideBath 21-41 Northampton teams and scorersShowBathDe Glanville (Carreras 57); Cokanasiga, Lawrence, Ojomoh (Harris 31), Arundell; Russell, Spencer (capt; Carr-Smith 72); Obano (Van Wyk 57), Dunn (Frost 65), Du Toit (Griffin 65), Roux (Hill 57), Molony, Bayliss (Pepper 57), Underhill, Reid.Yellow cardFrost 66.TriesDu Toit 2, Dunn.ConsRussell 3.NorthamptonHendy; Todaro, Freeman, Hutchinson (Lumley 77), Ramm (Sleightholme 74); Belleau, McParland (James 77); Iyogun, Smith (Walker 67), Davison (Millar Mills 62), Prowse, Munga, Chick (capt), Graham, Pollock.Yellow cardProwse 13.TriesFreeman 3, McParland, Pollock 2.ConsBelleau 4.PenBelleau.RefereeCraig Maxwell-KeysWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Thereafter, the Saints were anything but short. They were imperious. Bath twisted and turned in the storm of running rugby unleashed about them for the final half an hour. Freeman had his second after more sumptuous approach play, before Henry Pollock scored the bonus-point try in spectacular style. Henry Arundell was somehow forced to spill the ball on the attack by Chick, the Saints’ understated captain, and Hendy was away on the counter, finding their less understated back-row forward in support.Bath fell away. Pollock was over again, from an attacking lineout with 15 minutes to play, before Freeman’s coup de grace. At the end of more free-flowing rugby, Freeman almost taunted Cokanasiga, standing up the former England wing and restating his own credentials as the current one.Imperious is the word.

Liverpool supporters applauded when Wolves’ fans sang their song for Jota in the 18th minute and vice versa when Anfield acclaimed the late striker in the 20th minute, based on his squad numbers at the two clubs. The entire Wolves squad had visited the memorial to Jota outside Anfield to pay their respects the night beforeLiverpool’s 2-1 win.Florian Wirtz nets first Liverpool goal to edge out Wolves on emotional dayRead more“It was difficult but in a way also special and nice,” said Slot of the emotional atmosphere inside the stadium. “The football world again showed how to behave in moments like this. Our fans have been incredible since the tragedy happened. In every single moment they did what you hope they would do in memory of him.“Today the away fans showed it is not only about our fans. In the 18th minute the Wolves fans started singing for Diogo and ours were clapping, and in the 20th minute it was the other way around. You guys know how special English fans are and today showed the outside world that it is not only the players who make this league special.”Florian Wirtz scored his first goal forLiverpoolsince his potential £116m transfer from Bayer Leverkusen as Slot’s side extended their unbeaten run to seven games. “I am quite sure it was a relief for him,” said the Liverpool head coach. “I could see with his reaction when he scored the goal and it was the same with his teammates, they were really happy for him.“In football, rightly so maybe, we mainly get judged on results and individuals mainly get judged on goals and assists. We sometimes forget what else there is to do during a game. I think he has multiple good games for us but I also think he is getting better every game he plays. He is getting fitter and fitter and he was getting closer and closer to his first goal. It is not a surprise he scores today.“He will be the first to understand that one goal is not enough. So hopefully he will score many more goals for us than just this one. But I also liked his performance during large parts of the game today, I think he was special in a lot of moments.”Explore more on these topicsDiogo JotaLiverpoolWolverhampton WanderersArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

His mount was a little free behind the pace on the first circuit, and despite his big weight and the distance still left to travel, Bowen did not hesitate to allow him to stride on into the lead.Haiti Couleurs did not see another rival from there, and there were definite echoes of Native River’s front-running performance under a similar burden in this race in 2016, 15 months before his Gold Cup victory, as the eight-year-old powered clear with O’Connell turning for home and then held him at bay with an unflinching gallop from two out.This was the second “National” win of Haiti Couleurs’ career after his success in the Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse in April, and the initial reaction from bookmakers was to cut his price to complete a Grand National treble at Aintree in the spring.Paddy Power make him a 14-1 chance (from 20-1) for the world’s most famous steeplechase, but he also has a Cheltenham festival win on his record in the National Hunt Challenge Cup last season – a race in which Native River finished second in his novice season – and the 33-1 about Curtis’s gelding for the Gold Cup might not last long if it is confirmed as a target.View image in fullscreenSean Bowen steers Haiti Couleurs to victory in the Welsh Grand National at Chepstow.Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty ImagesFrom Curtis’s point of view, though, talk of Cheltenham and Aintree can wait. Like Bowen, she was winning her “home” National for the first time, and it was an impressive training performance to get Haiti Couleurs back to his relentless best after a disappointing run in the Betfair Chase last time out.“I’m absolutely delighted to get him back, I was upset about Haydock and I knew he was still a very good horse,” Curtis said. “He’s done that so well and aggressively today, he outclassed them and was back to his very best. Sean said he had to go to the front as he couldn’t hold him, and when he’s like that, you know he’s back to his best.“I’m Welsh, Sean’s Welsh and most of my staff are and it’s a really prestigious race we have wanted to win for many years.”Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday tipsShowLeicester12.05 Roi Du Risk 12.37 Kapamazov 1.12 Casa Loupi 1.47 Two To Tango 2.22 Jhentong Enki 2.57 Heeztheboy (nap) 3.32 Gentleman TobootCatterick Bridge12.18 Bravethewaves 12.53 Ballyeaston 1.28 Classical Sting 2.03 Ninna Collina 2.38 Redbridge Rambler 3.13 CamarrateSouthwell1.00 Cerelia 1.35 Ziggy’s Angel 2.10 Raging Raj 2.45 Bowfell 3.20 Hunky Dory 3.50 Sax Appeal 4.20 Toolatetonegotiate (nb) 4.50 Mr NuggetWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Bowen was touched off aboard Banbridge in the thrilling finish to Friday’s King George at Kempton, but a first victory in Saturday’s race was decent compensation for the runaway leader in the National Hunt riders’ title race.“It means so much,” Bowen said. “These are the races you want to win and to do it on a Welsh-trained horse for a Welsh trainer is special.“Becky actually used to babysit me a bit as a kid, so to do it for Becky is a bit like doing it for family, so that was amazing.

After a friend recommended Merlin Bird ID, a free app, she tried it in her London garden and was delighted to discover the birds she assumed were female blackbirds – “this is how bad a birder I was” – were actually song thrushes and mistle thrushes.“I’m obsessed with Merlin – it’s wonderful and it’s been a joy to me,” says Walter, a writer and human rights activist. “This is what AI and machine-learning have been invented for. It’s the one good thing!”View image in fullscreenScreenshots of the Merlin app in action.Composite: cornell.eduMerlin is having a moment. The app,developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithologyin New York, which listens for birdsong and identifies the species singing, has been downloaded 33m times, in 240 countries and territories around the world. Britain has the second highest total number of users – more than 1.5 million in 2024, an 88% increase from 2023. Every month, there has been a 30% increase in new users of the app, whose sound identification function was launched in 2021.Merlin has been trained to identify the songs of more than 1,300 species around the world, with more birds added twice a year. Different songs make distinct patterns on spectrograms and Merlin is trained to recognise these different shapes and attribute them to a species.For latecomers to birding, or those lacking a knowledgeable friend, the app has become their teacher. “My fear at first was I wouldn’t actually learn because I’m outsourcing my understanding of birds to this app,” says Walter. “But that hasn’t come to pass. It’s helped me continue my journey of learning.” Nowadays, she guesses, and uses Merlin to confirm her hunches. “It’s wonderful if you’re coming to bird-watching late and don’t really have a mentor,” she says.Angela Townsend from Bedfordshire began using Merlin after going on a nightingale walk one spring and being overwhelmed by the range of bird-voices in the evening chorus. She has found it has steadily built up her bird knowledge. “Warblers were just little brown jobbies but I can now recognise Cetti’s warblers and willow warblers when I’m out without having to put the app on,” she says.Mary Novakovich, author of My Family and Other Enemies, is another recent adopter. She has found it particularly useful when travelling across Croatia, where her parents are from. “I love putting a name to a face and a name to the sound,” she says. “It really brings you closer to the natural world, rather than it being disconnected from your life. It’s part of what makes life a joy.”Bird and birdsong encounters improve mental health, study findsRead moreMerlin is not flawless, however. The first time Kasper Wall, 12, tried it in his Norfolk garden, it detected a northern cardinal and a brown-headed cowbird – North American species not found in Britain.“I think it was figuring out where we live,” says Wall, who enjoys using it even though he is now an extremely knowledgeable birder. “A couple of weeks ago we were looking at a large group of goldcrest and it came up with a firecrest. I thought, ‘Oh, there must be a firecrest in here too’ and 30 seconds later we saw one, which was the first I’d ever seen. I like it and it’s very good but I wouldn’t say that it’s better than the best people at identifying bird-calls like [the naturalist] Nick Acheson. It can definitely be fooled.”Wall enjoys fooling Merlin with his uncanny impressions of a curlew, barn owl and greenshank.Acheson doesn’t use Merlin. He welcomes it, but points out it can replace learning. “Anything that gets people out, thinking about and reacting to nature is a great thing,” he says. “But there’s certainly a risk that people don’t learn and just abdicate responsibility for learning to Merlin.”He has noticed a glitch where Merlin interprets a certain type of chaffinch call as a redstart, leading to people being absolutely adamant that there is a rare bird in their garden. “There’s no substitute for a real person explaining to you how a birdsong feels and encouraging someone to engage with it emotionally,” he says.John Williamson, who works as a guide forNorfolk Wildlife Trust, has found Merlin repeatedly identifying high-pitched calls as a spotted flycatcher, a bird that is very unlikely to be found in the middle ofHickling Broad nature reserve’slarge reedbeds. “Merlin can’t do habitat,” he says.Merlin has also excited visitors by identifying a golden oriole, a very occasional rare migrant, in Hickling woods, but no one has actually seen the species. Williamson is convinced it is misinterpreting a fairly unusual “catcall” of a female jay, a common woodland bird.That said, Williamson finds it a “good tool” and welcomes how it is encouraging new people to enjoy birdsong, and particularly its mental health benefits. He knows one person who suffers from acute anxiety but Merlin has got him out into the world again and into nature, providing a focus for calming trips outdoors. “I find it impressive that an app can empower people to go out into nature,” he says.Research has found that birdsong is particularly beneficial to mental health, and has a lasting positive impact on wellbeing. For millions around the globe, that’s exactly what Merlin is doing.“It reminds you that there are birds knitted into your daily life,” says Walter. “It’s not about, ‘now I’m going to do a bit of birdwatching’, you may simply be walking through the park and you hear something and it gives you a sense that these birds are singing away all the time, even in London.”Explore more on these topicsBirdsArtificial intelligence (AI)AnimalsComputingWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Merriam-Webster’sword of the yearthis year is “slop”, referring exclusively to the internet variety.It came about shortly after the advent of popular large language models, such as ChatGPT and Dall-E, which democratised content creation and enabled vast swathes of internet denizens to create images and videos that resembled – to varying degrees – the creations of professionals.In 2024, it began to achieve peak cultural moments. Notable among these wasshrimp Jesus, a viral trend in which Facebook was briefly flooded with AI-generated images of the deity fused with crustaceans. Shrimp Jesus was quickly followed by hallmarks of the AI slop genre: videos ofold womenclaiming to celebrate their 122nd birthday, and minisoap operasabout the dramatic lives of cats.In 2025, the flood continued, growing more uncanny and more explicitly copyright-violating. This spring saw the advent of Ghiblification – that is, a trend in which users fromNayib Bukeleto the White House renderedimages, including of deportations, in the style ofHayao Miyazaki’s Studio Ghibli. This particular moment was enabled by OpenAI’s release of an image generator powered by GPT-4o; Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, jumped on the trend by Ghiblifying his X profile and writing the rather remarkablepost:>be me>grind for a decade trying to help make superintelligence to cure cancer or whatever>mostly no one cares for first 7.5 years, then for 2.5 years everyone hates you for everything>wake up one day to hundreds of messages: \"look i made you into a twink ghibli style haha\"— Sam Altman (@sama)March 26, 2025Miyazaki, the chief architect of Studio Ghibli’s distinctive, hand-drawn animation style, has elsewheresaid, on the subject of artificial intelligence: “I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all. I strongly feel this is an insult to life itself.”Other AI slop moments followed: a spate of videos of AI-generated obese people participating in the Olympics, pressure cookers exploding, more cats. Ibrahim Traoré, the leader of the military junta in Burkina Faso, became the centrepiece of an AI slop cult featuring videos of Justin Biebersingingon the streets of Ouagadougou.In some ways, AI slop has improved. Gone – mostly – are the days of six-fingered hands and missing limbs that characterised the output of early image generators. In some ways, though, AI slop has hardly changed at all. It is still uncanny and contextless, still aimed directly at the amygdala, still chasing virality by virtue of having the lowest barriers to entry imaginable: no plot, no exposition, surreal imagery and cats, cats, cats.Describing this flood of unreality as solely a technological phenomenon misses one of the main drivers of AI slop. In one view it is the endpoint of an algorithmically determined internet optimised for engagement and turbocharged with new, powerful tools. It won’t change as long as the platforms and their algorithms don’t.But it is also the product of an underlying global economy – one that is everywhere, increasingly dependent on a few powerful technology companies and a few powerful platforms, one which appears to offer dwindling returns for real work, but lavish fortunes for the lucky, viral few.AI slop creator is, after all, a profession. They come from everywhere – from the US to India to Kenya to Ukraine. In some ways, it can be argued that AI tools have enabled a strange globalisation of content, says Arsenii Alenichev, who studies the production of images in global health. Earlier this year, Alenichev noticed a flood of “AI poverty porn” on major stock photo sites. Many of the creators of the images, he said, appeared to have eastern European usernames.“I wouldn’t be surprised if these are just artists that are trying to generate extreme images of everything, hoping that someone would buy them,” he said.Making it in AI slop isn’t easy. Oleksandr, an AIYouTubecreator based in Chernivtsi, Ukraine, estimates that only the top 5% of creators ever monetise a video, and only 1% make a living from it.Oleksandr began his business in 2024, after retiring from being a professional volleyball player. He was deep in debt, he said, and at a low point in his life: his girlfriend had left him, his parents were living in occupied Mariupol. He started to join Telegram channels and watch YouTubevideoson how to make money from YouTube.His first efforts were music channels, playing AI-generated music over images of sexy AI girls. He had seven: retrowave, rock, jazz and more. At first he put a great deal of effort into each video, he said, but he realised quickly that that didn’t matter on YouTube. “It was a conveyor belt, with fairly low quality.”His videos got attention, standing out from hundreds of other similar channels, even to the point where a Japanese film-maker contacted him to license one of his pieces for a short movie.Then he expanded. At the high point of his business, he had a team of 15 people operating 930 channels, 270 of which he successfully monetised. They cleared up to $20,000 (£15,000) a month at one point, although YouTube often blocked or took down his channels – including the sexy AI girls – for unclear reasons.His content evolved. One fruitful niche he found was life stories – long anecdotes written by ChatGPT or Gemini, overlaid with visuals, which were extremely popular: “Grandparents listen to it before bed, or while walking in the park.”Another niche, he said, was videos on “vulgar adult themes” – such as erotic tractors – which were in great demand, but bordering on what YouTube allows. These channels were riskier to produce, but at times were easier to monetise, because they had less competition.With “erotic ones it’s easier, because they are blocked more often, so not many people want to bother and periodically recreate channels”, he said. “I saw the opportunity, and other people saw the difficulty.”Now, the work has shrunk somewhat: YouTube has become more aggressive with its takedowns of content, meaning he has to recreate channels. He and his team now take in closer to $3,000. But Oleksandr credits the platform – and the videos he watched – with changing his life, allowing him to resolve his debts and build a career he (somewhat) loves.It is not a site for artistic aspirations, though. A fair amount of the work involves adding nearly naked AI women to videos of tractors.“To make money here, you need to spend as little as possible,” he said. “YouTube is basically just clickbait and sexualisation, no matter how morally sad it is. Such is the world and the consumer.”A YouTube spokesperson said: “Generative AI is a tool, and like any tool it can be used to make both high- and low-quality content. We remain focused on connecting our users with high-quality content, regardless of how it was made. All content uploaded to YouTube must comply with our community guidelines, and if we find that content violates a policy, we remove it.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingYouTubefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a typical self-empowerment manual in which the pair expound on the secrets of entrepreneurial success while drawing on their personal experiences. At one point,they write: “Building a brand may be more important than building a business.”That was certainly Trump’s approach to business: he was theNew Yorkreal estate tycoon who turned his fame into a brand that symbolized luxury and savvy strategy – even if his companies filed forbankruptcy six times. Trump spent decades trying to use his name to turn a profit: he owned an airline and a university, and slapped his moniker on vodka, steaks, neckties, board games and even bottled water. Leveraging the fame he gained from the Apprentice TV show, he expanded to licensing Trump-branded global real estate projects built by other developers. In many of these ventures, Trump collected licensing fees, rather than investing his own money, ensuring that he profited even if thebusinesses collapsed.Today, Trump is using the US presidency as the ultimate branding opportunity. In his second term, he’s slapping his name on as many buildings, monuments and government projects as he can. Last week, Trump’sname was addedto the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which has served as a “living memorial” to the assassinated president since it opened in 1971. The institution was renamed by its board of trustees, a majority of whom were installed by Trump early this year after he appointed himselfas the center’s chairand purged its board.The year in patriarchy: Taylor Swift, Trump 2.0 and the Epstein files | Arwa MahdawiRead moreBut the Kennedy Center was named after JFK by anact of Congressin 1964, a year after his assassination, and Democrats argue that the center’s board does not have the power to rename it the Trump Kennedy Center. Still, the center’s trustees ploughed ahead and dispatched workers to installnew signagelast Friday, adding Trump’s name (in large capital letters) to the building’s exterior.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, tried to spin the rebranding as a boon for both Kennedy and Trump’s legacies, writingin a post on X: “This will be a truly great team long into the future! The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur.” But by grafting his name on to the center – and stacking it above Kennedy’s, no less – Trump is not honoring JFK’s legacy; he is colonizing the assassinated president’s memory.Before setting his sights on the Kennedy Center, Trump had already gone on a rebranding spree in Washington DC and across government programs. The state departmentadded his nameto the US Institute of Peace near the National Mall, while the Trump administration unveiled a new government website,TrumpRx.gov, where Americans can shop for lower-priced medications, and announced that new savings accounts for millions of children will be called “Trump accounts”.In October, the US treasurer, Brandon Beach, confirmed that his agencyhad drafteddesigns for $1 coins featuring images of Trump to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the US’s independence next year. And earlier this month, the National Park Serviceadded Trump’s birthdayon 14 June, which coincides with Flag Day, to its list of free-admission days for US residents at national parks. (The park service also eliminated its policy of not charging admission on Martin Luther King Jr Day and the emancipation celebration of Juneteenth, which are both federal holidays, unlike the president’s birthday.)For Trump, a building (or a warship) without his name on it is a missed chance to expand his brandTrump continued his self-aggrandizement binge this week: on Monday, he announced a plan for the US navy tobuild a new generationof massive vessels that will be called “Trump class” warships. Flanked by military officials at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, the president showed offthree posterswith the potential design of a new Trump-class battleship called the USS Defiant. Trump and Pentagon officials said they expected two battleships, which could costup to $15bn each, to be constructed over the next few years. And they said the US would eventually build up to 20 vessels as part of a “golden fleet” that will carry hypersonic weapons, high-powered lasers and nuclear-armed cruise missiles – all technologies that are still under development by the navy.At Monday’s announcement, John Phelan, the navy secretary, used plenty of superlatives to please Trump while describing the warship that will bear his name,sayingit “will be the largest, deadliest, most versatile and best-looking warship anywhere on the world’s oceans”.He added: “Our adversaries will know, when the Trump-class USS Defiant appears on the horizon, American victory at sea is inevitable.”But does the US navy need such massive and expensive ships, especially to confront adversaries like China, which relies on alarge fleetof smaller and cost-effective vessels? Some experts doubt the US warships will be effective, even if they can overcome seriousdesign flawsthat could prevent them from being built at all. By reviving an obsolete class of warship, Trump wants the US military to builda weapon with little strategic purpose other than to carry his name across the oceans.The president’s sycophants will find new ways to justify his narcissistic and authoritarian actions, even as Trump continues to expand his power and dismantle many of the safeguards put in place after the Watergate scandal that forced Richard Nixon toresign the presidencyin 1974. For a sitting president to order the construction of a fleet named after himself is unprecedented in US history. It aligns Trump less with George Washington and more with Kaiser Wilhelm II, the last German emperor who obsessed over building a powerful navy that would reflect his personal grandeur and abdicated his throne after Germany’s defeat in the first world war.But Trump is not swayed by history, or the actions of past presidents who refrained from slapping their names on everything within reach, especially while in office. In 2018, when Trump visited Mount Vernon during his first term, he seemed unable to grasp why Washington, the first US president, did not name his estate in Virginia after himself. “If he was smart, he would’ve put his name on it,” Trump said of Washington, according to areport in Politico. “You’ve got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you.”For Trump, a building (or a warship) without his name on it is a missed chance to expand his brand or, worse, the mark of a loser who doesn’t know how to take full advantage of his leverage. Nearly a year into his second term, Trump is busy establishing monuments to himself – and daring anyone to stop him from exploiting his presidential branding opportunity.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionRepublicansUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The event will be staged as part of National Poverty in America Awareness Month, the time every year when charities document the number of US residents surviving on low incomes.Of course, the president will do no such thing, preferring to summon the press to watch him rub shoulders with the billionaire class as he did at last month’s black tiedinner for the Saudi rulerand his entourage.Trump can be expected to ignore calls for policies to reduce poverty and to dismiss the annual awareness campaign, leaving him unencumbered by any guilt that past presidents might have felt looking in the mirror and seeing Louis XIV starring back at them.US poverty levels matter in the UK and across continental Europe because the rising level of poverty in the States –a trend that dates back to the turn of the century– is the direct result of a particular form of capitalism that increasingly popular rightwing parties say should be adopted.Nigel Farage’s Reform UK and Kemi Badenoch’s Conservatives laud the US, but seem to care little about how it promotes a style of capitalism that leaves millions of people on the side of the road, injured in one way or another, allowing the rest to work, spend and save without a thought for the less fortunate.You couldn’t have an opioid crisis in Europe in the way that hashappened in the US. You couldn’t have thescale of mental health crisis, or high levels of obesity or poverty. Even after years of austerity across Europe, the level of government intervention in the US remains so much lower.And more cinematically, the US also exports its financial crashes around the world, knowing that the cost to itself is a fraction of the repair job faced by countries that care about their people.If you feel any responsibility to the environment or to those who have fallen by the wayside, there is an easy path to lower taxes and low levels of regulation.It’s worth remembering this when you next read about how Europe’s economy only inches ahead each year, with the UK not far in front.A kinder nation, one that takes ordinary people’s views into account, is going to grow at a more measured pace, by definition. Regulation that prevents financial crashes might slow the adoption of whizzy new financial products, but pays dividends should the worst be prevented or the effect minimised. Again, it should be remembered that since 1929, it is reckless US governments that have exported financial chaos, not the more careful custodians of UK or European financial centres.For those who think there must still be a way to grow at a faster pace, there are countless reports about how UK and European governments could do a better job.Mario Draghi, the former Italian prime minister and ex-head of the European Central Bank, provided acomprehensive critiqueof Europe’s lack of growth and provided remedies, most of them involving further integration.Draghi is no socialist, but his effort was socialistic. Taken in the round, his reforms were designed to pay for a large and munificent state.Farage and Badenoch are unsurprisingly resistant to the ideas that underpin Draghi’s report and the lesson from the US is that European markets are not integrated enough.They prefer to take other lessons from the US. That financial markets should be set free, that monopolies are fine if it drives investment. And the poor and unhealthy should understand that it is most likely to be their own fault and for that reason can only expect the most rudimentary support from the state.It seems from studies of the modern electorate that older people are the most susceptible to the Farage/Badenoch argument. The only aspect of the state that is sacred is the health service – for obvious reasons.Everything else can be sacrificed to prevent the state from demanding more in tax from its citizens. The AfD in Germany, the National Rally in France and Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party all subscribe to the same philosophy.In the UK, there is a clear correlation between those over 60 and those voting with frustration and anger to destroy the society created by older voters.Without acknowledging the link to far-right parties on the continent and Trump’s White House, it is baby boomers who are coming out in favour of low regulation, a finance industry free to do its worst and leaving charity to look after the least well-off.Those with more progressive views are in a minority in this age group.The government should make the case for gradualism and how it protects most people. It guards against disaster and, when disaster strikes, has the capacity to offer support where it is needed. It builds resilience.The US casts its least fortunate aside in the most callous way. It’s true that it always has. But these days, its colossal wealth and income make that unnecessary.Explore more on these topicsBusinessViewpoint columnDonald TrumpUS economyEuropeEconomicsPovertycommentShareReuse this content"

Instead, we had to make do withKaty Perryspending 11 minutes on the edge of space as part of Blue Origin’s all-female crewed mission. Perrypromisedus all that, in service of women’s empowerment, the crew would “put the ‘ass’ in astronaut” and “make space and science glam”. Truly, one giant leap for womankind!Space may have got glam, but it was another glum year for many on Earth. The war in Ukraine continued, with increasing numbers of womenvolunteering to fight. The civil war in Sudan raged on, with the UN urging the worldnot to ignoreharrowing details of targeted sexual violence, torture, and abductions from the region. The slaughter in Sudan is so extreme that the blood can even be seen fromspace. Although I’m not sure the billionaires and celebs doing celestial joyrides in their expensive rockets are particularly bothered by that view.Meanwhile, a ceasefire was supposedly brokered in Gaza in October. But, as the past few months have made clear, it is effectively a ceasefire in name only: thegenocide, mediablackoutand aid blockade continue.Malnutritionremains rampant, particularly among children and pregnant and breastfeeding women. Babies who aren’t starving arefreezingto death.Over in the US, a year of Trump 2.0 has had a devastating impact on human rights protections at home and around the world. One of Donald Trump’sfirst actsas president was to reinstate the Global Gag Rule, which restricts aid from going to any groups that provide abortion services or advocate for abortion rights. The year also saw sustained attacks on access tobirth controlandabortion pillsin the US. Even a woman’s right to vote is now beingquestionedby some prominent Maga members.In fluffier news, Taylor Swift gotengagedto football star Travis Kelce, a man who once joked he needed to find “abreeder”. Kim Kardashian released apubic hair thongand failed the bar exam. (Or rather, the Washington Post opined, the bar examfailed her.) Sydney Sweeney got everyone talking about her “great genes” – but failed to get fans to show up for hermediocreChristy Martin biopic. Sabrina Carpenter sparked adebateon sex-positive feminism. And an awful lot of Maga women have apodcastnow, as well as exactly the sameMar-a-Lago face.And that’s just a snippet of a very exhausting 2025. To wrap things up, here aresix-sevenmemorable moments from the year in patriarchy. And six-seven is my brainrot, slightlyrage baitway of saying 12.1. A brain-dead woman in Georgia was used as a human incubatorAdriana Smith was almostnine weekspregnant when she fell ill and was declared medically brain dead. Under Georgia’s strict laws, abortion is banned after about six weeks of pregnancy and Smith waskept aliveto carry on the pregnancy, without any regard for what her family wanted and despite doctors noting the chances of her delivering a healthy newborn were very small. The newborn, called Chance, was delivered prematurely in June. As of early December, Chance wasstill in a hospital Nicu, unable to breathe on his own.2. The Trump administration let tens of millions worth of contraceptives go to wasteAfter the Trump administration brought in new laws that prohibit sending US aid to organizations associated with abortion services, the state department decided to let contraceptives valued atbetween $10m and $40mexpire rather than send them abroad to women in need. The Center for Reproductive Rights has said the loss of these contraceptives “could result in more than a million unintended pregnancies and thousands of maternal deaths”.3. Italy recognized the crime of femicideIn November, Italy’s parliament approved a law, backed by the conservative government of Giorgia Meloni, thatmade femicide a crime. It is one of veryfewcountries in the world to specifically classify every murder of a woman that is motivated by her gender as femicide.4. French parliament voted to add consent to rape lawThis historic move waspromptedby outrage over the mass rape ofGisèle Pelicot.5.Sanae Takaichibecame Japan’s first female prime ministerNot exactly progress considering the ultra-conservative politician, whocites Margaret Thatcheras an influence, then appointedjust two womento her 19-member cabinet.6. Thailand andLiechtenstein recognized same-sex marriageAfter a very long struggle by activists, Thailand became thefirst countryin south-east Asia to recognize equal marriage. In Europe, Liechtenstein’s marriage equality bill (passed in 2024) took effect.7. The REDACTED REDACTED Epsteinfiles got releasedWhile running for president in 2024, Trumppromisedto declassify the Epstein files. Funnily enough, he didn’t quite make good on that. For most of the year, the president tried, unsuccessfully, to get people to stop talking about what he termed a “Democratic hoax”. Finally, in December, a bipartisan push forced him to release a tranche of documents. The only problem was the “most transparent” administration in history redacted most of it. While we have learned afew new thingsabout how Jeffrey Epstein operated and who he associated with, justice still has not been even remotely served. Trumpmassively over-promisingand under-delivering? Who would have guessed it!8. The Andrew formerly known as Prince had a very bad yearIn November, after a lot of Epstein-related embarrassment, King Charles finallytook awaythe former Duke of York’s royal titles. He is now just Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor – and the butt of alot of jokes.9. Sean‘Diddy’ Combs was sentenced to more than four years in prisonOver the summer, the disgraced music mogul wasacquittedof the most serious charges against him, but found guilty of two counts of transportation to engage inprostitution. His team have asked Trump for apardon, but it hasn’t been forthcoming so far.10. Meta shut down global accounts linked to abortion advice and queer contentMeta has deniedescalating censorship, but campaigners say the company is taking its do-whatever-Trump wants approach to women’s health issues global. And Meta isn’t alone: a lot of companiesseem eagerto do whatever it takes to ingratiate themselves with the Trump administration.11. Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau went Instagram officialVery cool that the former Canadian prime minister isdatingan astronaut.12.

Dark humour feels vital to make light of everything that’s going wrong, but I’ve also been trying to draw cartoons that highlight reasons for hope, such as thefragile ceasefire in GazaorZohran Mamdani’s winin New York.View image in fullscreenVirginia Giuffre (3 November 2025).Illustration: Ella Baron/The GuardianMartin Rowson2025 has been remarkable not for what I’ve drawn but for what I haven’t. In 40 years of cartooning I’ve never known such an anonymous government, where nobody recognises 95% of the cabinet (apart from Wes “face like a full Brazilian” Streeting). Whether this is down to Morgan McSweeney’s shenanigans or them keeping their heads down until the day the nightmare ends doesn’t matter: it’s a tragedy. The wasted comic potential to be milked fromPat McFadden– dead spit for Death from a Brueghel painting – is a national disgrace.View image in fullscreenThe march of nationalism in mainstream politics (6 September 2025).Illustration: Martin Rowson/The GuardianNicola JenningsThis year I have drawn Donald Trump andVladimir Putinmore than anyone else. They are not people I want to spend my time thinking about, or looking at – however nobody is beyond satire and they are both sufficiently unpleasant to make a good caricature. I loathe them, but I approach drawing them with curiosity and the eye of analysis. A caricature is as much about the person’s expressions as it is about their features, and while Trump’s face is very active, Putin’s is still: only his mouth seems to move, so I go for his glare.View image in fullscreenWhat’s on the table for Trump and Putin (17 February 2025).Illustration: Nicola Jennings/The GuardianMy aim is to ridicule, to decipher the grins and glares, in order to expose the motivation of those in positions of power. And although I don’t believe cartoonists have the power to bring down governments, I do think we can change the public’s perception of those in authority, and these perceptions can stick. Even so, I am sure it is damaging for the soul to draw Trump so many times – and I am planning tosue for $10bn.Ben JenningsThe year has felt a bit like watching repeats of old news broadcasts while being strapped to a dentist’s chair having all of one’s teeth removed. Everything felt painfully familiar, from the unimaginable horrors in Gaza to the continued bloodshed in Ukraine, the ascent ofNigel Farageand “Donald Trump 2.OH-NO”. There were more revelations about (former Prince) Andrew and we even had a Labour government trying to bring back austerity.View image in fullscreenStarvation in Gaza (25 July 2025).Illustration: Ben Jennings/The GuardianThe tricky thing for cartoonists was to keep having something new to say in a year that often felt more akin to a recurring nightmare. However, cartooning remains a versatile and effective medium in order to try and capture the heated climate of our current times (both figuratively and literally); distilling the chaos into a single image and trying to squeeze out the odd laugh here and there where we can.

And when people talk past one another there are real-world consequencesSat 27 Dec 2025 14.00 ESTShareThe14 December Bondi Beach attacktargeting Jews at a Hanukah celebration has brought the issue of antisemitism into sharp national focus. In response, the New South Wales government announced measures to further curb hate speech and symbols, and, more controversially, new protest powers. This event and the government’s response have once again raised questions about the relationship between Jews, Israel, Zionism and anti-Zionism.Zionism is a Jewish national movement that sought to create a Jewish state, then to secure and sustain it. But “Zionism” is also a contested label: for many Jews it signifies safety, continuity and belonging; for Palestinians – and for many others – it denotes dispossession and ongoing domination. It’s clear that for different people, the word Zionism means very different things, which leads to people talking past one another – with real-world consequences.Originating in the late 19th century as a movement for Jewish national self-determination, Zionism was founded in response to the increase of a modern form of Jew-hatred grounded in pseudo-science and conspiracy theories, and the rise of European national movements seeking their independence. Early Zionists argued that the only solution for the precarious status of Jews as a perennially persecuted minority in Europe was through the establishment of a Jewish state.From the beginning of mass Jewish migration from Europe to Ottoman and MandatePalestine, the Zionist project collided with the fact of a majority Palestinian Arab population, engaged in building its own national movement. Zionism comprised a spectrum of political positions, including socialist, liberal, religious and militaristic and revisionist strands. Within these movements, there were internal arguments about the nature of the future state and the place of Arabs and Palestinians within it.In the nearly 130 years since the founding of the Zionist movement, the meaning of the term has continually evolved. The Holocaust, the 1948 war that accompanied Israel’s establishment, and the mass displacement of Palestinians (known by Palestinians as the Nakba, or the Catastrophe) reshaped what “Zionism” meant in practice. Since 1967 Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and its control over Gaza, alongside ongoing settlement expansion in the Palestinian territories, have made the term even more contested.Today many Jews see Zionism as a modern continuation of the centuries-old yearning for connection with the land of Israel, which is deeply rooted in Jewish history and liturgy. A commonly held view is that the state of Israel is necessary to protect Jews around the world from the possibility of ongoing persecution. This connection to Israel and support for Jewish self-determination are central to Zionist Jews’ sense of what it means to be Jewish.There is no consensus though on what that self-determination ought to look like, and Zionism has always encompassed a spectrum of meanings. Many Zionists advocate for a democratic Jewish state to sit alongside a democratic Palestinian state. Many are deeply critical of, even hostile to, the current Israeli government. At the extreme end of the spectrum are ultranationalists – including members of the Israeli cabinet – who reject Palestinian statehood and who advocate for annexation of the Palestinian territories and to entrench permanent unequal rights between Jews and Palestinians.For Palestinians and critics of Zionism the term signals displacement, inequality and the ongoing suffering of Palestinians since the establishment of the Israeli state. To them, the cost of Jewish statehood has been too great and the impact on Palestinians too devastating. Many describe it as settler colonialism; many as a system of oppression and unequal rights.For Jews who oppose Zionism, the role of statehood runs counter to their self-understanding of what it means to be Jewish.Many people arrive at their views from sincere commitments, whether to Jewish safety and continuity or to Palestinian freedom and equality. That does not mean all political programs are equally defensible, especially those that deny other peoples their basic rights. But it does highlight the problem with language that treats “Zionists” as collectively violent or subhuman, whether through labelling all Zionists as terrorists and genocidal maniacs, or claims that Australian Jews are legitimate targets because of their attachment to Israel. Similarly, we ought not dismiss all pro-Palestinian protesters as antisemites or Jew-haters.Findings from the Gen17 Australian Jewish community survey – conducted in 2017 to be replicated in 2026 as the Gen26 survey – found that 69% of Australian Jews identified as Zionist, 22% did not and about 10% didn’t know or declined to answer. Among those who do not identify as Zionist, there are a growing number of Jewish bodies opposing Zionism and who are in tension with the more established Jewish community bodies.Because Zionism carries multiple and often conflicting interpretations, recognising this diversity is essential to fostering informed dialogue, empathy and intellectual honesty. Understanding Jewish intergenerational trauma and the trauma Palestinians carry from decades of occupation would make the conversation harder to weaponise and easier to humanise. And recognising the historical, religious and cultural significance of the land to both Jews and Palestinians will help us to have a more robust public conversation.Recognising this diversity of thought and the humanity of those who hold those beliefs, we ought to draw a clear distinction between debating the merits of Zionism as an idea and harassing, doxxing or physically attacking those who identify as Zionist. In Australian public debate, “Zionist” is often used as a political descriptor. But it is also sometimes used as a stand‑in for “Jew”, which is where political argument turns into antisemitic targeting.It is possible for critics of Israel to argue that Jewish statehood has caused profound harm to Palestinians, while still recognising that targeting people because they are Jewish, or because of their political or cultural attachments, crosses a line from legitimate political disagreement into bigotry. The reverse is also true: defending the right of Jews to hold Zionist beliefs does not require endorsing every action or government of the Israeli state.David Slucki is the director of the Australian Centre for Jewish Civilisation at Monash University, where he leads the Monash Initiative for Rapid Research intoAntisemitism.

Yes, it was fine. But that is where I would like our relationship to endSat 27 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 27 Dec 2025 12.34 ESTShareWhen I buy something online, I don’t want to receive more than two emails: one to confirm my order has been received, and another to tell me when it will be delivered. The numerous notifications we receive while browsing, buying and then waiting for delivery are presumably meant to be reassuring. But since when is harassment reassuring?Imagine a world in which the second you walk into a shop, someone taps you on the shoulder and asks: “Can I help you today?” Then someone asks for your email address in exchange for a 5% discount. When you find what you are looking for and place it in your basket, this instigates more nuisance. “Hurry! Twenty-one other people have this in their basket too!” Of course 21 other people have this in their basket, it’s shower gel and a significant number of people shower. This doesn’t make you rush. It makes you thrilled that the consensus remains in favour of personal hygiene. You wander around the shop a bit more. Someone grabs your arm. “There is still an item in your basket. Don’t forget to check out!”At the till, there are more questions. “Do you want to give us your information, or check out as a guest?” You check out as a guest. People are meant to be kind to guests. But, after paying, someone screams into your face. “Sign up to this third-party website that has nothing to do with the store and get £15 CASHBACK!!!!!” It couldn’t sound more nefarious. You race out of the shop, pursued by a final assailant. “How did we do? Please rate our service from one to 5!”The bus ride home is no quieter. The driver remarkably announces: “Your item has been dispatched.” An old man next to you nudges your ribs and sagely whispers into your ear: “Your item is on its way.”When you make it home you are greeted by someone who has broken into your house to tell you: “Your item has arrived!” They then run off. They have stolen nothing but your time.At least it is all over. Your transaction is complete. You get into the shower and the cascading water brings you peace at last. Until you read the request that has been etched into the steam on the bathroom mirror. “Please review your purchase!”You do not. Because it is a toiletry item. It was made by a multinational conglomerate, not Andrew Lloyd Webber. And you are tired.Please. If you are a retailer, and you are reading this – leave me alone.Athena Kugblenu is a comedian and writerExplore more on these topicsShops and shoppingThe hill I will die onRetail industryInternetcommentShareReuse this content"

Now this culture must be future-proofed from the forces of globalisationRachel AroestiSat 27 Dec 2025 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 27 Dec 2025 15.19 ESTShareOn the face of it, British culture looks doomed. Our music industry is now borderline untenable, with grassroots venues shuttering at speed (125 in 2023 alone) and artists unable to afford to play the few that are left; touring has become a loss leader that even established acts must subsidise with other work. Meanwhile, streaming has gutted the value of recorded music, leading to industry contraction at the highest level: earlier this year the UK divisions of Warners and Atlantic – two of our biggest record labels – were effectively subsumed into the US business.In comedy, the Edinburgh fringe – the crucible of modern British standup, sketch and sitcom – is in existential crisis thanks to a dearth of sponsorship and prohibitively high costs for performers. Our film industry is at this point almost totally reliant on (dwindling) US funds; while Britain remains a popular filming destination due to tax breaks and appealing locations, the vast majority of the productions made here ultimately generate American profits.As the BBC, bedrock of our cultural life, lurches from crisis to crisis, the TV industry at large has been ruinously compromised by broadcasters’ inability to pay for programming due to advertising cuts and ballooning costs. Like film, it has become dependent on international investment – to the extent that many are concerned that we’ve lost the ability to make programmes exclusively for British audiences. Shows that cannot attract foreign money rely on goodwill, with directors, writers and stars of flagship dramas taking significant pay cuts just to get them made (see: the second instalment of the double-Bafta-winning Wolf Hall). Unlike US-based streamers, we are incapable of converting viewership into profit: ripped-from-the-headlines drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office attracted an audience of more than 13 million and still lost around £1m, something ITV boss Kevin Lygo attributed to its lack of sales in other territories.View image in fullscreenCool Britannia … Mr Bates vs the Post Office.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockHow on earth do we sustain an uncompromising, idiosyncratic arts sector in these circumstances? One result of the globalisation of entertainment is that success is now judged by the number of nationally indistinct eyeballs or eardrums culture can attract. As a small island, we are surely destined to matter less and less.Except something strange has happened. Amid this catastrophe, British culture is booming. Not only are we dominating the global zeitgeist, but we’re doing so with art that reckons with our heritage and sensibility in unprecedentedly thrilling and nuanced ways. Look at it all – from the viral trends that capture the British psyche like never before to the music, TV and films that grapple with the complex, often contradictory British identity – and tell me we haven’t found ourselves in a golden age.I Used to Live in England is a very British love letter to Britain. By an American. “I used to shop at Tesco’s and buy meal deals,” drawls musician Frankie Beanie, who released the track in June under his Supermodel moniker. “I used to say ‘Go Tesco’s’ instead of ‘Go to Tesco’s’,” he brags before referencing Wetherspoons, his familiarity with UK garage (“So now I can be the guy in LA that saysgarage instead of garage”) and £65 national rail journeys.Beanie isn’t the only yank bypassing the tired tropes – afternoon tea, bad teeth, the word “guv’nor” – to celebrate the real hallmarks of British life. Following 2024’s Britishcore trend, in which TikTok users from around the world embraced our quintessential texts (Trainspotting), institutions (Greggs) and figures (Gemma Collins), this year has seen a boom in all-round Anglophilia from across the pond: root causes include a romanticised perception of the UK as a sanctuary from Trump’s America and an unprecedented exposure to the nuances of the British sensibility via social media. “I love England so much,” declared Olivia Rodrigo during her Glastonbury headline set, citing Colin the Caterpillar, having a judgment-free pint at noon and English men, a reference to her current squeeze, the actor Louis Partridge. The pair’s transatlantic coupledom forms a key part of the “British boyfriend” trend, fuelled by the surfeit of young British actors dominating Hollywood, that has made UK men an aspirational accessory.View image in fullscreenViral hit … 28 Years Later.Photograph: Miya MizunoElsewhere, there’s been a global boom in popularity for the British content creators whose clownish provocation “feels equal parts Benny Hill, You’ve Been Framed, and Nil By Mouth”, as per Clive Martin, author of an article published by Vice in August titled How The World Fell in Love With a Summer of British Chaos. It seems like genuine familiarity with the UK has become a weird form of cultural capital: when New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani was asked about his listening habits, he waxed lyrical about the Arseblog Arsecast podcast and an extended version of One Pound Fish, a viral 2012 song by an east London market trader who ended up on The X Factor.Clearly there’s a novelty factor to this internet craze iteration of Cool Britainnia 2.0. Yet there’s substance, too: our wry fetishisation of mundanity and slightly crap small pleasures is finally being understood on a global scale. Meanwhile, in the more conventional artistic sphere, a far more profound reflection of Britishness is all the rage.Take pop music. In the 2010s, the British artists that enjoyed enormous global success: Adele, Ed Sheeran and Coldplay pedalled fairly beige fare that had little to say about this country. Fast-forward to now: for two summers on the trot we’ve been responsible for the transatlantic musical zeitgeist: this year, the Oasis reunion; last year, Charli xcx’s Brat. (The latter’s influence continued well into 2025, partly thanks to a belated and horribly misguideddiss track by Taylor Swift.) Both are quintessentially British in myriad ways. Oasis have, of course, been national mascots for more than 30 years: their combination of lairy terrace banter, mordant Mancunian wit, knowingly ludicrous braggadocio and Beatles nostalgia was a shortcut to the hearts of a population encouraged to romanticise the everyday, the past and the concept of having a laugh.View image in fullscreenClose encounter of the furred kind … Jade Thirwall performing at Glastonbury 2025.Photograph: Harry Durrant/Getty ImagesBrat, meanwhile, connected thanks to more up-to-date British references: happy hardcore, UK garage, dubstep. Yet at its root is an ironic, ideas-y British art school sensibility, whose current figurehead happens to be Charli’s close collaborator AG Cook, a Goldsmiths graduate who helped birthed hyperpop – the only genuinely new musical subgenre in recent memory – via his irreverent satire of artifice, consumerism, tech and good taste.Also like Oasis, Brat channelled a fuck-it candour and sardonic megalomania, this time in the guise of a privately educated party girl.In fact, that chaotic, gobby yet meticulously droll side of our national character was all over pop: from Lily Allen’s evisceratingly honest yet acerbically funny West End Girl to Lola Young’s expletive-laden Messy (which topped the charts in January) to ex-Little Mixer Jade’s debut album That’s Showbiz Baby! (sample lyric: “I am the it girl / I am the shit girl”). They share a vibe with Amelia Dimoldenberg, whose YouTube series Chicken Shop Date fuses social awkwardness, sandpaper-dry wit and the less salubrious end of the UK high street into a vision of peak Britishness that’s been lapped up in the US; she is currently the Oscars red carpet correspondent.If Charli’s RP-accented electropop was very us, then Kent-raised PinkPantheress’s melancholic version might be even more so. Since debuting on TikTok in 2020, the 24-year-old’s rise has been brisk (the social media platform’s tendency to serve niche UK content to global audiences results in chicken-and-egg-style popularity, see also: #Britishcore): this year she was nominated for the Mercury prize and two Grammys. She, too, leans on an overtly British nostalgia, overlaying drum’n’bass, jungle and big beat samples with evocatively desolate vocals that telegraph rain-lashed woe. PinkPantheress’ USP in the US may be mining this underheard musical history in an appealing accent, but she’s also digging deep into the feeling of Britishness. On the moodboard, she once told Rolling Stone, is “hope and lost hope”, the colour grey, Skins, “having a dirty kind of feeling” and the Streets, particularly Mike Skinner’s ability to evoke the sense that “life is so shit”. It was a take delivered, according to the interviewer, in that “distinctly British way we have of delighting in our own misery”.View image in fullscreenOrange theory … Devonté Hynes.Photograph: Alessandro Bosio/AlamyThis was also the year distinctively British rap properly crossed the pond thanks to Central Cee, whose debut Can’t Rush Greatness became the first ever UK rap album to enter the Billboard top 10, and did so with a grounding in UK drill and shout-outs for Sports Direct, the Uxbridge Road and the Vauxhall Astra. Having previously aligned himself closely with US R&B, in August Blood Orange’s Devonté Hynes released Essex Honey, an album suffused in pained nostalgia for his Ilford childhood whose “primary mood is a very British kind of late summer-into-autumn melancholy”, wrote the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis.In cinema, Tim Key and Tom Basden’s exquisitely sad The Ballad of Wallis Island – one of the greatest films this country has ever produced, according to Richard Curtis – proved an unlikely international hit while remaining, in Basden’s view “very British”: set amid blustery Welsh coastline, its emotional palette was dominated by repressed grief sublimated into awkward banter and a yearning for the past; references included Monster Munch, Gideon Coe and Harold Shipman. Faced with acclaim on the US festival circuit, Key did his national self-deprecation duty and wrested the prospect of failure from success by wondering if he’d accidentally made a film that only worked in America.Another ridiculously British film, Danny Boyle’s 28 Years Later, took in more than $150m worldwide. Boyle’s film was a kitchen sink drama – fry-ups and familial dysfunction in a two-up-two-down – in the guise of a zombie film that opened with an old VHS of the Teletubbies and crescendoed with the appearance of a Clockwork Orange-style gang paying sartorial tribute to Jimmy Savile. It was also an allegory for post-Brexit Britain: the community at its core are isolationists who channel nostalgic comfort via a vision of England that takes in Arthurian romance, the postwar village hall and pint-based ribaldry.View image in fullscreenFunny business … Such Brave Girls.Photograph: BBC/Various Artists Limited/James StackIf 28 Years Later was a sour, surreal yet beautiful paean to this country’s past,Adolescence– the second-most popular programme in Netflix history – was its nightmarishly future-facing counterpart. Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham’s six-time Emmy-winning tale of a 13-year-old accused of murder was the kind of provocative social-issues television that used to be our stock-in-trade – only none of them could boast 142million views. Painstakingly realistic – the police station scenes were eerily reminiscent of Channel 4’s obs-doc 24 Hours in Police Custody (Graham has admitted to being “obsessed” with the series) – it eventually descended into a chillingly ordinary domestic drama that recalled Mike Leigh at his most devastating.Elsewhere, Apple TV’s runaway hit Slow Horses – built on a bedrock of failure and flatulence and set in a recognisably depressing recreation of the capital – returned for a fifth series. Also returning, for a second outing, was Such Brave Girls, whose combination of stifling suburbia and extreme gallows humour is deeply entrenched in a dark British comic sensibility (the New York Times drew parallels with Peep Show, Pulling and Fleabag), despite being backed by influential US production powerhouse A24. All capture the spirit of UK life infinitely more accurately than The Crown or The Great British Bake Off or Ted Lasso – but not every depiction of Britain on screen has been so bleak. Industry, a HBO-BBC co-production most popular in the US, is possibly the most cool and sophisticated drama ever made about Britain: segueing from trading floor to dodgy boozer to gentlemen’s club to country cottage, creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay have managed to infuse their study of the black box power structures at the heart of UK society with gobsmacking drama and biting satire.Perhaps the panic about British culture dying out is premature. Or perhaps the disastrous effects are still to come. Either way, the most startling thing about this new age in which we are obligated to perform Britishness to the rest of the world is how creatively and authentically it is being done – and how well it is going down. So why can’t we use this present high to help lift our creative industries out of dire straits? In January, David Lammy announced a “soft power” taskforce, designed to turn our cultural achievements into benefits for the country, noting that despite our successes “we have not taken a sufficiently strategic approach to these huge assets”. There has never been a better time to monetise the global appetite for British culture, but 12 months later we’re still waiting for a plan of action.View image in fullscreenPlaying chicken … Amelia Dimoldenberg at the Oscars.Photograph: Sarah Meyssonnier/ReutersSome people do have actual ideas: Wolf Alice guitarist Joff Oddie has been among those petitioning for the introduction of a £1 ticket levy on arena gigs, with proceeds going to smaller venues (the policy was adopted earlier this year, albeit only on a voluntary basis). Even if we have shortsightedly allowed US tech companies to annex our TV industry, it’s not too late to claw back some cash: director Peter Kosminsky (Wolf Hall, The Undeclared War) is advocating for a 5% levy on UK subscription streaming revenues, with the money raised going towards a British cultural fund.In September, prolific screenwriter Steven Knight (Peaky Blinders, A Thousand Blows, the first film in the newly Amazon-owned James Bond franchise) told the Times that the answer to our current woes might be “creative nationalism”. The phrase may make you flinch – especially after a summer in which the St George’s Cross, long weaponised by the far-right, was displayed around the country as part of a nebulous patriotic campaign. Yet some strain of nationalism – in the autonomy and independence sense – may be necessary if we don’t want our popular culture to be permanently dependent on the whims of foreign conglomerates. (Disney’s decision to discard its underperforming Doctor Who reboot like an old snot rag should serve as a warning.) Either way, Knight’s outlook didn’t seem particularly exclusionary or tub-thumping: his version of Britishness – “a cross between Dad’s Army and SAS Rogue Heroes” – was based around rain, cold and our awareness “of our own absurdities”.The problem with creative nationalism might just be that: we are so in love with our failures and flaws that capitalising on success just isn’t a very British thing to do. If our cultural sensibility is anti-boosterish – rooted in self-deprecation, repression, chaos, irreverence and disappointment – perhaps we operate best on the back foot. The future is uncertain, but one thing isn’t: as 2025 comes to a close, British culture finds itself in a very British place.Explore more on these topicsCultureCharli xcxTelevision industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The podcast finds Marler, former rugby player and breakout star of TheCelebrity Traitors, impersonating a psychotherapist and subjecting guests to “totally unregulated psychological testing”. The mock-therapy conceit is hardly a new one, but on paper it still has the makings of a successful pod.Celebrity hostfresh from ratings-busting TV triumph? Check. Fancy studio setup for the viewing crowd? Check. Weird visual stunts that will leave audio listeners baffled? Er … check?The big news inpodcastingfrom the last 18 months has been the medium’s swift and unstoppable pivot to video. Where a podcast was previously defined as an audio recording available to stream online, it has since expanded to become an umbrella term taking in visual and audio content. The idea, at least in theory, is that audiences get to choose whether they watch or listen. But there are creeping signs that video is taking precedence, with audio considered to be secondary.Which brings us to Marler’s pod, the opening episode of which has its host in conversation with his fellow Celebrity Traitors contestantNick Mohammed. Before becoming an actor, Mohammed worked as a magician, which is presumably why Marler gets him to perform a card trick. It’s not exactly riveting visual entertainment, but if you are listening, it’s impossible to know what’s going on. While Mohammed does attempt to explain the mechanics of the trick, there is no tension and no sense, for the listener, of the sleight of hand at the heart of it.Sillier still is a so-called trust exercise where Marler blindfolds Mohammed and pretends to shoot a paper cup off the top of his head using a crossbow (in fact he uses a child’s gun – which is something you just cannot tell from listening alone). Again, it’s not good in either medium, but listening to it is like eavesdropping on a stranger telling a funny story but missing the vital plot points.This is not an isolated case of a visualised podcast seemingly forgetting about its listeners. A recent episode of the all-conquering Diary of a CEO WithSteven Bartlett, featuring insomnia expert Matthew Walker, saw Bartlett hand his interviewee a jar of gold coins to explain the concept of banking sleep before periods of stress. At no point was this visual aid described for the show’s listeners; instead, they just heard long pauses and incomprehensible shuffling sounds.View image in fullscreen‘Long pauses and incomprehensible shuffling sounds’ … Steven Bartlett recently baffled listeners to Diary of a CEO.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianSometimes the problem isn’t visual explainers or gags but simply crappy sound quality. Early episodes of The Rest Is Football podcast, in which hosts Gary Lineker, Micah Richards and Alan Shearer sat around a coffee table wearing tiny clip-on mics, sounded as if they were broadcasting from deep inside a cave. The problem was subsequently fixed, but the fact that the series is set to broadcast daily on Netflix for next year’s World Cup says a lot about where its values lie.For podcast host and audio critic Miranda Sawyer, the problem is clear. “A podcast made by people who come from a telly, YouTube or Insta background prioritises video rather than audio, and the result can be painful to hear. I’ve heard shows where one or all of the participants are on Zoom and one cuts out, and there’s no editing to make it better to listen to.” Asked if she believes the focus on video content is coming at the expense of audio quality, she says: “I think it comes at the expense of both. A podcast that is made by people who prefer audio means you get a desultory effort when it comes to visuals: presenters sitting in front of a studio bookcase, on a sofa that makes them slump, with mics in an awkward position.”Much of the drive behind video content comes from its potential as a marketing tool for the show. Footage can easily be clipped up and shared on social media to help drive audience engagement and, where possible, generate news lines. Eleanor McDowall, audio documentary-maker and director of Falling Tree, the production company behind series including Half Life and Short Cuts, notes that “in the hyper-visual landscape of social media, it’s always been a struggle to share audio eye-catchingly”. She adds that she can understand the draw for networks in having celebrities talking in digestible clips, though, she says, “I do get depressed thinking that the funder is more concerned with the ease of advertising something as opposed to the value of the thing itself.”None of this is to say that beautifully produced audio podcasts are a thing of the past. This October saw the launch of Adrift, an Apple Original podcast telling the true story of the Robertson family, who were shipwrecked in the Pacific in the early 1970s. It’s an audio-only series that goes to great lengths to place the listener in the dinghy with the Robertsons using multilayered sound design. Audible’s all-star remake of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone also comes with a rich and detailed sound palette, replicating echoing footsteps on Hogwarts corridors and the whoosh of an owl coming in to land.View image in fullscreen‘Sounded as if they were broadcasting from deep inside a cave’ … Micah Richards, Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer on The Rest is Football podcast.Photograph: Goalhanger PodcastsThere is, however, a certain type of podcast that is enamoured of studio furnishings, mood lighting and the celebrity in its midst, and which cares a lot less about the listener tuning in on headphones. Can McDowall see a time when audio and video split off again and become distinct mediums? “I hope so,” she replies. “The absence of images from radio and podcasting isn’t some failure of technology. These audio mediums have grown from a deep love of sound and its imaginative possibilities. When I hear people say the future of audio is essentially television, it makes me feel they never knew what was exciting about sound in the first place.”Judging from the speed at which visualised podcasts have taken hold, it’s clear that they are here to stay. Even so, the focus of major networks on eyeballs over ears overlooks not only the capacity of audio to spark the imagination but also its intrinsic convenience. One of the reasons I love audio pods is that they allow me to do other things while listening, such as walking the dog or cooking. For dedicated audiophiles, poor sound quality or content aimed primarily at viewers is unlikely to drive them to sit down and watch the visual version instead. They will simply switch off altogether.Explore more on these topicsPodcastsPodcastingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In May of this year, I went for an upright MRI for a minor injury on my arm, and the scan happened to catch the mass in my neck. By the following month, I had a diagnosis. People kept telling me it was “the good cancer”, the kind that can be taken out neatly and has a high survival rate. But I’m 54, and my dad died of cancer in his 50s, so that shadow came down on me hard.My eldest son was doing A-levels at the time, so we didn’t tell him at first. I felt as if I’d stepped across some irreversible Rubicon that you hear about happening to other people, but never imagine will actually come for you.After my diagnosis, I retreated. I barely left the house. My neck was bruised and swollen, as if I’d attempted some sort of gruesome Halloween makeup. I felt peeled-open and humiliated, as though strangers could look straight through my skin. Friends and family stepped up: my brother, who lives hours away, and I had this incredible chat for hours on a park bench in the sunshine. Still, I curled inward.It wasn’t until later that summer that my mum managed to coax me out for lunch and a trip to the Whitworth Art Gallery, in Manchester near where I live. There was aJMW Turnerexhibition on. I knew his name and his work in the way most people do: big ships, sweeping seascapes of blues and golds. The grand stuff of someone else’s life. I didn’t want culture or fresh air or anything that required being seen, but I agreed to go to please her.The exhibition rooms were dark and quiet, lined with sepia prints. My mum moved from caption to caption, reading each one carefully. I drifted behind her, barely looking. When you’re waiting for more test results, for the next consultant meeting, for someone to tell you whether cancer has threaded itself further into your body, nothing penetrates.I was about to sneak off to the cafe  when one painting stopped me in my tracks. The print was Mount St Gothard, from 1808. In it, a pack horse stands on a mountain path, exhausted and pausing to catch its breath, with its head hanging low to the ground. The cargo on its back looks impossible. It was like looking in a mirror.It felt absurd, recognising myself in a horse on a Swiss mountain painted more than 200 years ago. But there I was. The horse was me. The overburdened body. The sense of not knowing how much more of the journey there was to go. For the first time in weeks, something cut through the fog. My feelings – the ones I’d been hiding, managing, downplaying so I didn’t worry everyone else – had shape.It was a moment of recognition. I had been managing everyone’s expectations around my illness, and seeing the horse gave me permission to let some support in. Yes, being able to sit in misery, darkness and fear was a necessary part of the process for me, but it couldn’t be done for ever.There’s now a 10-mile tunnel through the mountain in the painting: it takes 14 minutes by car. The horse must have taken hours.Months later, with two surgeries to fully remove my thyroid completed, and radioactive iodine treatment ahead of me marking my final medical hurdle, I’m finally starting to feel more like myself. I’m back at work, and I’m even ready to pick up the creative bits of life I’d dropped: the DIY; the craft-making; the messier, more joyful things that make me feel alive.It wasn’t the diagnosis, or the operations, or even the relief of curability of my cancer that marked a turning point. It was Turner’s horse. He made it to the top of the mountain carrying all that baggage, and was going to go back down the other side and have that pack taken off. And so will I.Caroline HowarthShare your cultural awakeningsShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Or was it that blue sky day in September 2001 when the planes hit the twin towers? These images from the last 25 years chronicle modern history in the makingJonathan FreedlandSat 27 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTShareAt the turn of the century there was a modest debate, mainly conducted on the letters pages of the newspapers – back then, still the prime forum for public discussion – as to when, exactly, the new millennium and the 21st century began. Most assumed the start date was 1 January 2000, but dissenters, swiftly branded pedants, insisted the correct date came a year later. As it turned out, both were wrong.The 21st century began in earnest, at least in the western mind, on a day that no one had circled in their diaries. Out of a clear blue sky, two passenger jets flew into the twin towers of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 and so inaugurated a new age of anxiety – a period in which we have lived ever since.The historian Eric Hobsbawm had already spoken of the short 20th century, which ran from the start of the first world war in 1914 to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. It was followed by the long decade of the 90s, which came to resemble a contented pause,a holiday from history, until it was rudely terminated on that bright New York morning.The sight of it is still shocking. Nearly 25 years later, the portrait of an ash-covered sculpture, depicting a businessman and his briefcase, is as unsettling now as when it first appeared. Never mind that he was always a statue. The frozen Manhattan man, intact while everything around him lies in ruins, could be one of the petrified figures of Pompeii, a fully preserved emissary from a previous world: the world before 9/11.For a while, it seemed as if the new era would be entirely defined by the 11 September attacks and the response to them. The “war on terror” declared by George W Bush threatened to remake the globe according to the preferences of the nation that, after the expiry of the Soviet Union, was now a solo hegemon: the US. After the invasion of Afghanistan, which would see US troops installed in the country for two decades, came the US-­led conquest of Iraq and the toppling ofSaddam Hussein– along with his statue – bringing death and devastation there and roiling both the Middle East and politics across much of the democratic world, including Britain.The slogan of the hour was “the clash of civilisations” and plenty believed that struggle would dwarf all others in the new century. The reverberations of Iraq were certainly felt for many years, whether in the Arab spring, the birth of Islamic State or the persistent threat of violent jihadism. But that struggle has had to share space in the 21st century with others.Not that that was obvious right away. At first, it seemed as if hope might edge out fear, that the new millennium might see change for the better.Barack Obamawon a Nobel peace prize before he’d really done anything, in recognition of the optimism he stirred through his winning 2008 campaign, captured here in an image of the politician who, as he liked to remark, didn’t look like any other US president.These have been turbulent years, roiled by culture wars, a long-delayed reckoning over race and vast movements of peopleEasy as it was to deride that feelgood sentiment as“hopey, changey”,morevibe than reality, there was a lot of it about. Science and technology, especially, were thought to be full of promise. For some, that meant the excitement of the Large Hadron Collider, the biggest machine ever built. For others, it was the prospect of instant forms of social connection, delivered by a new breed of young, nerdy men able to turn 1s and 0s into magic. Just look at the image here of Mark Zuckerberg and fellow Facebook founder Chris Hughes, delightedly unaware that it was not the computer on Zuckerberg’s lap they had just opened, but Pandora’s box.For a while, the optimism held, with tech and its birthing of social media celebrated as a remedy for all manner of ills, even the one that had announced the arrival of the century. The men of violence had brought 9/11, but a decade laterFacebookand Twitter seemed to be harbingers of democracy, enabling those Arab spring uprisings, and others, against hated dictatorships.It would not work out that way, and not only because of the long shadow cast by the war on terror. On another September day, in another steel-and-glass citadel of finance, there came another collapse, one whose impact is still felt. The implosion ofLehman Brotherswas at the centre of a global crash that marked the end of an economic holiday from history that had endured since the 90s.The stagnation that followed, with wages static or falling in real terms, created the backdrop for the political upheavals that marked the next two decades. Yet it was far from the only shock the world had to absorb.The climate crisis was a constant throughout, as it is in this collection, making its presence felt in fire and flood, whether submerging Pakistan or New Orleans. (Bush’s catastrophic mishandling of that disaster is one more reason why he has been lucky in his latest successor: if it weren’t for the current occupant of the White House, W’s place as the most reviled US president of the early 21st century would have been assured.)In 2020, we were struck by a global pandemic that can still seem like a collective bad dream. To look at a photograph such as the one here of an elderly Spanish couple, separated for a hundred days and by sheets of plastic, is to ask: did that really happen?‘There are images no leader ever wants to be seen’: 33 pivotal US presidential moments captured on cameraRead moreThere are other pictures that look now like early warnings of trouble to come. The “separation wall” encircling theWest Bankis a reminder that, after the failure of peace talks at Camp David in 2000, there has been a further 25 years of Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to add to the decades that went before, culminating in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza that exploded on 7 October 2023 and has only recently paused. Similarly, the image from Ukraine in 2014 appears now like a premonition of the Russian invasion of 2022.These have been turbulent years, roiled by culture wars and a long-delayed reckoning over race – how extraordinary now to recall that taking the knee began with a single athlete making a single gesture – and by vast movements of people. The agony of today’s refugee crisis is distilled in the sight of a two-year-old child,Alan Kurdi, face down on a beach. That cauldron of discontents was stirred further by tech platforms that were no longer about old friends reconnecting, but about strangers dividing against each other, their sources of information filtered along partisan lines, until they could be persuaded to believe almost anything, and usually the worst.All of those currents fed into the movement that has defined the last decade or so, embodied by Boris Johnson and his notorious Brexit bus – a lie on wheels – and, of course, by the man who is the face of these times:Donald Trump. That movement is nationalist populism and it feeds on the many plagues of the 21st century, from stalled or declining living standards to social media, adroitly channelling unease and fear into hostility towards migrants, minorities and each other. Gaze upon the titans of tech come to pay homage to Trump as he returned to the White House in January and you see we are living through what the Italian writer Giuliano da Empoli calls “the hour of the predator”.Yet there are enough images of wonder here to believe the rest of the 21st century might be different: look at the selfie taken by theMarsrover to be reminded of what we are capable of. The next 25 years are no more preordained than the last. Like the cameras that captured these extraordinary moments, they are in our hands.Picture captions by Felix Bazalgette and Gabrielle SchwarzLiberty Plaza, New York, 2001By Susan MeiselasView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Susan Meiselas/Magnum PhotosWhen news came of the first plane crashing into one of the twin towers on 11 September 2001, Susan Meiselas cycled downtown with her camera – “moving toward what everyone else was desperately fleeing from”, with “no sense of the scale of what had happened”.For her, this image stands out as a rare moment of “stillness amid the chaos”. It shows a lifesize statue of a businessman, Double Check (1982) by John Seward Johnson II, surrounded by debris in Liberty Plaza Park, across from the World Trade Center. Initially Meiselas couldn’t tell if it was a real person.Today, she sees the statue as a symbol of the attempt to make sense of the enormity of 9/11 and its terrible aftermath: George W Bush’s “war on terror”. “A lot has happened as a consequence. Even the endless lines of security at the airport – these are small reminders of our distrust of each other.”GSAn Iraqi man comforts his son, 2003By Jean-Marc BoujuView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jean-Marc Bouju/APOn 31 March 2003, an Iraqi man and his four-­year-­old child were arrested by American forces and taken to a prisoner of war camp near the southern Iraqi city of Najaf. French photojournalist Jean-Marc Bouju snapped the moment just after they had removed the man’s handcuffs, so he could comfort his distressed son.The image won the World Press Photo of the year award, and captured for many the cruelty of the US’s invasion of Iraq. The hooded figure, attempting to preserve some humanity in an overwhelmingly hostile situation, foreshadows the infamous images of abused prisoners taken by American soldiers in Abu Ghraib prison, which would hit the headlines not long after.FBToppling of Saddam Hussein’s statue, 2003By Sean SmithView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianThe image of Saddam Hussein’s statue being pulled down in Baghdad as American forces entered the city on 9 April 2003 became one of the iconic images of the war. It was promoted by the Pentagon as a symbol of Iraqis joyously greeting the overthrow of their hated dictator.“I’m happy with the picture,” photographer Sean Smith says, “but not with things that may be ascribed to it – as a defining moment, say, because it wasn’t.” Even at the time, Smith felt “uneasy about becoming part of a false narrative”. He had been in Baghdad for months, as war had inched closer, and got to know many Iraqis. He knew the situation was more complex: “This wasn’t the liberation of Paris.” Most of the crowd that day, he remembers, were journalists staying in an overlooking hotel. “It was getting to their deadline time,” he remembers, “and they wanted a headline.”Looking back, Smith is also saddened by the illusion of finality the photograph represents. When he returned to Iraq for work years later, one conversation about the invasion stuck with him. When an American soldier argued that it had been necessary for the freedom of the Iraqis, an Iraqi interpreter replied, “All I know is that everyone knows someone who’s died.”FBSeparation Wall, West Bank, 2004By Alessandra SanguinettiView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alessandra Sanguinetti/Magnum PhotosIt is a symbol of one of the most enduring conflicts of the century. In 2002, during the second intifada, the Israeli government started to build what is known as the Separation Wall: a barrier between Israel and the West Bank, which it has occupied illegally since 1967. This image shows children dwarfed by an eight-metre-high section of wall at Abu Dis, a Palestinian village in the suburbs of Jerusalem cut off from the rest of the city. The permits Palestinians need to cross the wall are hard to obtain, so movement is severely restricted.The barrier, which has been deemed illegal by the International Court of Justice, was “presented as a security measure”, explains Emma Graham-Harrison, the Guardian’s Middle East correspondent, after a spate of suicide bombings targeting Israeli civilians. “However, it also functioned as both a land grab and a key step in enforcing separation. In some ways, it was a template for what Israel attempted to do with its fence enclosing Gaza: the idea that you could contain Palestinians physically without having to engage with them as fellow human beings or consider their political aspirations.”GSFacebook founders Mark Zuckerberg and Chris Hughes, 2004By Rick FriedmanView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rick Friedman/Corbis via Getty Images“I got a call from an editor,” Boston-based photographer Rick Friedman recalls: “‘I need you to go over to Harvard and photograph these two kids with their computers.’” It was 14 May, a few months after Zuckerberg and Hughes had founded a social media site that, in its earliest iteration, invited students to rate the attractiveness of female classmates. Friedman recallsthe young pair were “very agreeable”, but also remembers thinking, “Is this some kid trying to get a date with his computer?”FBChicken processing plant, 2005By Edward BurtynskyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Edward Burtynsky, courtesy of Flowers Gallery, LondonIt is sometimes said we are living in the Chinese century. Rapid industrialisation has seen China grow into an economic superpower – the “world’s factory” –accounting for up to 30% of global manufacturing output. Edward Burtynsky, whose acclaimed photographs document the effects of human industry around the globe, began working there in 2002. On one visit, struck by the number of chicken farms, he became curious about China’s food industry.This image shows one of the country’s largest poultry-processing facilities, the Jilin Deda factory in Dehui city, where products were being prepared for export to Japan. “I’m always trying to find ways to represent in one frame the larger-than-life scale of what’s happening,” Burtynsky says.GSDisaster girl, 2005By Dave RothView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoe Roth/Dave RothThe concept of a meme as a self-replicating nugget of information was first popularised by Richard Dawkins in the 1970s in the context of genetics. But it was in this century that memes took off online, and became household names.This image, declared “one of the most famous memes in history”, has humble origins. In 2005, Zoë Roth, AKA “Disaster Girl”, and her amateur photographer father were watching a local fire department training exercise, in which a donated house had been set on fire. Her father told her to smile and snapped the image. Drawn to the “evil” smile, people Photoshopped in other disasters – the Titanic, the Hindenburg.FBMan during Hurricane Katrina, 2005By Robert GalbraithView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Robert Galbraith/Reuters“George Bush does not care about Black people,” a 28-year-old Kanye West announced during a telethon to raise money for disaster relief in the wake ofHurricane Katrina. Making landfall on the Gulf coast on 29 August 2005, it flooded 80% of New Orleans, killing 1,500 people and displacing roughly 1.5 million – but it was the deeper faultlines in American society, brutally revealed by the disaster, that came to define it.As former MP Oona King, who visited the city shortly after the disaster, wrote, “The remarkable thing about Hurricane Katrina was that, like a bolt of lightning, it clearly and unavoidably illuminated the chilling impact of race.”FBParis, Lindsay and Britney behind the wheel, 2006Photographer unknownView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bauer-Griffin/GC Images“This photo became the moment that defined an era,” wrote Paris Hiltonon Instagramin November 2024, marking the 18th anniversary of this famous paparazzi shot of her with Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears at the height of their fame, crammed in the front seat of Hilton’s car outside the Beverly Hills hotel. The photo was splashed across the papers; in the New York Post, it ran with the headline “Bimbo Summit”.At the time, it was the quintessential image of 2000s celebrity glamour. All three women have since spoken out about their treatment by the media: the misogynistic scrutiny and judgment that spread far beyond celebrity circles. “They loved pitting women against each other,” Hilton has said. “It was so vicious.”GSRangers taking away a mountain gorilla, 2007By Brent StirtonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Brent Stirton/Getty ImagesThe Democratic Republic of Congo’s Virunga national park, Africa’s oldest conservation area, is exceptionally biodiverse – and one of the most dangerous places to work. Since 1996, more than 200 rangers have been killed in a series of conflicts.Photographer Brett Stirton took this picture after seven rare mountain gorillas were killed by hostile gunmen wanting to warn rangers not to disrupt illegal charcoal manufacturing in the area. Locals and park workers carried the bodies to a burial site. “Everyone was silent,” Stirton recalled later. “It was very reverent.”Not all is lost. Last year,analysispublished in the journal Science found conservation efforts around the world were helping stem the decline of biodiversity. “Our results clearly show there is room for hope,” one co-author said.FBLarge Hadron Collider, 2007By Simon NorfolkView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Simon NorfolkOne of this century’s biggest scientific discoveries took place in theLarge Hadron Collider, the world’s most powerful particle accelerator, which opened at Cern in Geneva in 2008. This photo was taken when construction was under way.Still the largest machine ever built, it consists of a 27km ring of superconducting magnets in a tunnel 100 metres underground. The magnets, chilled to a temperature lower than in outer space, are used to propel high-energy particle beams into collisions. By studying the results of these, particle physicists hope to answer questions about the essential workings of the universe. In 2012, they made a major breakthrough: the discovery of the Higgs boson, the so-called “God particle”.GSSteve Jobs with the first iPhone, 2007By Kimberly WhiteView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kimberly White/Corbis via Getty ImagesIn January 2007,Steve Jobsunveiled the first iPhone. “We are all born with the ultimate pointing device – our fingers – and iPhone uses them to create the most revolutionary user interface since the mouse,” the Apple CEO said. (For his demo, seen here, he had to follow a carefully planned “golden path” to avoid glitches; the software wasn’t yet finished.)The touchscreen smartphone was released six months later, totally transforming the way we communicate. Today more than 1.4bn iPhones are in use globally.GSLehman Brothers staff, 2008By Kevin CoombsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kevin Coombs/ReutersThis photo of staff at the Lehman Brothers offices in London’s Canary Wharf was taken on 11 September 2008. Over the past year, the global financial system had been showing cracks. Now Lehman was in trouble, with its share price plummeting and rumours of a buyout.“This meeting was called just before lunch,”said Gwion Moore(back left, minus the grey-suit banker trousers because his work clothes were at the cleaner’s). “A couple of senior bankers made a speech, saying, ‘We’re not going bankrupt, get back to work.’”Four days later, Lehman did go bankrupt. “Trust evaporated and funds stopped flowing around the world,” says economic historian Catherine Schenk. What followed was the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. “It reminded us that, as in 1930, failures in the richest countries could spark a financial crisis that had repercussions in markets everywhere.”GSConstruction of the Burj Khalifa Tower, Dubai, 2008By Philippe ChancelView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Philippe Chancel, courtesy of Eric Franck fine art/Rio fluency/Polka galleryShown here in the last stages of its construction – and already towering over everything that surrounds it – theBurj Khalifain Dubai has held the record for the world’s tallest building since opening its doors in January 2010. The neofuturist mega-scraper, with its 163 floors reaching 828 metres high, is not just a dizzying feat of engineering: it’s a symbol of the equally dizzying, oil-fuelled rise of the Gulf states in the 21st century.In this era of expansion, flashy development projects have become a major tool of soft power: what the critic Rowan Moore has called a “cultural and architectural arms race”. The race is still on: the Burj Khalifa is soon to be eclipsed by the Jeddah Tower in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, which is scheduled for completion – with a height of 1,000 metres – by 2028.GSBarack Obama on the campaign trail, 2008By Damon WinterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Damon Winter/The New York Times/Redux/eyevine“It was one of those moments that gets stuck in your head,” Damon Winter recalls. “Part of it was the irony that a memorable photo could come from such a banal setting – a podium in front of an American flag.” Yet everything lined up, from the shaft of light to Obama’s smile, and today the image captures something of the optimism and dynamism of his 2008 campaign – qualities absent from many other campaigns of the century. “It was a very optimistic time,” Winter says. “The country was experiencing this momentous change.”Unlike other politicians Winter had covered, Obama “seemed like the same person on stage as he was when interacting with people. It seemed to me that he was really interested in people.”FBNorthern lights over the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, 2010By Lucas JacksonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nasa/Nature Picture Library/AlamyIn spring 2010, after 187 years of silence, the Eyjafjallajökull volcano on the south coast of Iceland began a powerful eruption. It spewed fine volcanic ash high into the atmosphere, which began blowing towards the UK and western Europe. Almost all flights in the region were grounded due to fears that the ash would clog and stall jet engines.Stranded in Iceland, photographer Lucas Jackson was able to capture this spectacular image of the northern lights playing over the erupting volcano. “When you’re a photographer,” he told the Guardian in 2010, “it’s really rare to actually be exactly where you want to be to take the shot. We were laughing about how crazy it all was.”FBPakistan floods, 2010By Daniel BerehulakView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Daniel Berehulak/Getty ImagesIn the summer of 2010, record-breaking rains led to extreme flooding in Pakistan. At the peak, one-fifth of the country was submerged. Nearly 2,000 people died and more than 20 million were affected, with homes and crops lost. Though unprecedented at the time, such severe flooding has since become a recurring event, including this summer.As temperatures rise across the world, floods are becoming more frequent and intense. Unsurprisingly, poorer nations and communities are most affected. But, as UN secretary general António Guterres warned earlier this year, “No country is safe.”GSFukushima disaster,2011Photographer unknownView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Mainichi Shimbun/ReutersOn 11 March 2011, a massive 9.0 undersea earthquake off the north-­east coast of Japan triggered a tsunami that killed an estimated 20,000 people. More than a million buildings were damaged, including theFukushimaDaiichi nuclear plant, where three reactors went into meltdown after flooding of the power supply disabled the cooling systems. It was the worst nuclear accident in history after Chornobyl.Several workers were injured in explosions at the facility and more than 100,000 people in the wider region were evacuated to avoid radiation exposure. It’s estimated that 2,313 “indirect deaths” resulted from physical and mental stress, and that 29,000 people remain displaced.GSTahrir Square, 2011ByMoises SamanView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Moises Saman/Magnum PhotosThe central Cairo roundabout known as Tahrir Square became the symbolic centre of the Arab spring in early 2011, though the movement itself had began the year before in Tunisia, after market seller Mohamed Bouazizi, a target of government harassment and corruption, set himself on fire outside a governor’s office.“The Arab world was ripe with hope,” wrote Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Yet “these expectations were quickly shattered”. The assassination of Khashoggi that year, on the orders of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reflected the wider slide into violence: Syria, Libya and Yemen have since suffered years of brutal civil war, and Egypt remains under the iron-fisted rule of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who came to power after the protests.FBBoy in Liberia being treated for Ebola, 2014By Daniel BerehulakView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Daniel Berehulak/The New York Times/Redux/eyevineFrom late 2013 to 2016, the worstEbolavirus outbreak in history killed more than 11,000 people in the west African countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. The fatality rate for recorded cases was 40%, attributed to poor standards of care, mistrust of medical authorities and an international response prioritising containment over treatment.Daniel Berehulak photographed James Dorbor, eight, being carried into a clinic in the Liberian capital of Monrovia in September 2014;his health had deterioratedduring a three-hour wait to be admitted. His father was not allowed to embrace him when medical staff finally took him in, carrying him, Berehulak said, “like he was a bag of garbage”.GSMigrants above a golf club in Morocco, 2014By José PalazónView image in fullscreenPhotograph: José Palazón/ReutersIn 2014, Melilla – a tiny slice of Spanish territory in Morocco – became emblematic of the rise of “Fortress Europe” policies in the 21st century. Human rights activist José Palazón captured the moment a group of men attempting to cross Melilla’s border became stuck on a razor wire fence for hours while Spanish golfers continued their game below. Eight years later, Melilla would become the site ofa massacrein which at least 37 people trying to cross into Spain were killed by border guards.Palazón shared his photo on Twitter, with the caption: “Immigrants on the fence, expulsions and a game of golf. Only in Melilla.” The surreal image of inequality quickly went viral. “It seemed like a good moment to take a photo that was a bit more symbolic,” he later said.FBPriest at Ukraine’s Maidan protests, 2014By Jérôme SessiniView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jérôme Sessini/Magnum PhotosRussia’s devastating war onUkrainecan be traced back to “Euromaidan” – the anti-government protests, centred in Kyiv, that began in November 2013 after then president Viktor Yanukovych gave in to Russian pressure and withdrew from an agreement that would have brought the country closer to the EU. On the uprising’s bloodiest day, 20 February 2014, Jérôme Sessini, who had arrived just a day before, documented what he saw – “not even thinking about the danger” – including this Orthodox priest blessing protesters at a barricade. More than 50 of them were shot dead that day.GSOscars selfie, 2014ByEllen DeGeneresView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ellen DeGeneres/Getty ImagesThe origins of the term “selfie” are humble: an Australian man posting a substandard picture of his bruised lip to an online forum in 2002. “Sorry about the focus,” he wrote. “It was a selfie.” The next year, sales of phones with front-facing cameras began to increase and by 2013 “selfie” was Oxford Dictionaries’ word of the year.Organised by Ellen DeGeneres at the Oscars, this selfie broke the internet. Eleven years on, it might be cursed: Kevin Spacey would face damning sexual abuse allegations, Brangelina broke up.FBItalian rescue, 2014ByMassimo SestiniView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Massimo Sestini/eyevineThe number of people risking crossing the Mediterranean to Europe, fleeing wars and persecution in the Middle East and Africa, rose dramatically in the mid-2010s. In 2013, the Italian government launched its search-and-rescue operation Mare Nostrum, after hundreds died in two shipwrecks off Lampedusa.Shot from a helicopter, Massimo Sestini’s image shows 500 people on a boat 25km from Libya’s coast, before they were rescued by Italy’s navy as part of an operation controversially halted that year. At least 20,000 have died or disappeared in the Med since.GSThe death of Alan Kurdi, 2015By Nilüfer DemirView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nilufer Demir/Dogan News Agency/AFP/Getty ImagesOn 2 September 2015, photojournalist Nilüfer Demir saw the body of a toddler, Alan Kurdi, on a beach near Bodrum, Turkey. “There was nothing left to do for him,” she said later, “except take his photograph. And that’s exactly what I did.”Alan was born in Syria in 2012. His family had been trying to reach Greece, but soon after their boat launched, it overturned and Alan and his mother drowned. “I was holding my wife’s hand,” his grief-stricken father later told the media, “but my children slipped through my hands. It was dark and everyone was screaming.”Demir’s shocking image quickly spread. But, despite protests, a spike in donations to charities and western governments promising to do more, the Med remains the world’s deadliest border.FBCaitlyn Jenner, 2015By Annie LeibovitzView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Annie Leibovitz /Trunk ArchiveIt was a high point in the movement for trans visibility. In June 2015,Caitlyn Jennermade her public debut in a portrait by Annie Leibovitz on the cover of Vanity Fair. It instantly had positive support and Jenner became the fastest person to hit 1 million Twitter followers, before facing a backlash when she came out as a Trump voter.Since then, trans rights have been rolled back in the US and UK, but support remains strong. Earlier this year, the world’s largest trans pride march took place in London, with a 100,000-strong crowd.GSUsain Bolt’s Olympics “triple triple”, 2016By Cameron SpencerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images“There you go, I’m the greatest,” said Usain Bolt when he achieved an unprecedented three consecutive Olympic golds (in 2008, 2012, 2016) in three races. Here, in the Rio 100m semi-final, “Lightning Bolt” seems to have found time to flash the camera a smile. He was in fact checking whether the runner to his left was catching up: “I saw I had him covered,and I smiled.”GSThe Brexit bus, 2016By Jack TaylorView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jack Taylor/Getty ImagesBrexit is, for many, the ground zero of what Marina Hyde called “an age of gathering chaos and rising disbelief” in the UK.The “Brexit bus”, reportedly masterminded by Dominic Cummings but closely associated with Boris Johnson, became the subject of bitter arguments and a symbol of the chaos that has engulfed the UK since. Its slogan, claiming the UK sent £350m a week to the EU, was disputed, with the UK Statistics Authority deeming it “a clear misuse of official statistics”.Research by the Nuffield Trusthas shown Brexit has in fact put unprecedented strain on the NHS.FBColin Kaepernick taking the knee, 2016By Marcio José SánchezView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Marcio José Sánchez/APOn 1 September 2016, during a San Francisco 49ers pre-season game, the quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeled while America’s national anthem was played, in protest at police violence against Black people. His gesture was adopted byteammates– this photo shows him with Eli Harold and Eric Reid – then spread across the world, becoming linked to the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in spring 2020. The gesture was highly controversial: Kaepernick was ousted from the league a year later and has never again played for an NFL team.FBAn assassination in Turkey, 2016By Burhan OzbilicView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Burhan Özbilici/AP“We die in Aleppo, you die here,” shouted Turkish off-duty riot squad officer Mevlüt Mert Altıntaş after killing the Russian ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, at a gallery in Ankara, in protest at the actions of the Russian military in Syria. Soon after photographer Burhan Ozbilic snapped this unsettling image. Altıntaş was shot and killed by police.FBWomen’s March, 2017By Bryan WoolstonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bryan Woolston/ReutersIn January 2017,the day after Donald Trump’s first inauguration as president, millions of women gathered across the world – including 500,000 in Washington – mobilised by his misogyny and sexual assault allegations. It was one of the largest single-day protests in US history, and nine months later its energy fed into the#MeToo movement, which began as a disquieting story of one Hollywood producer’s abuse of women and soon turned into a global reckoning.GSAmazone, 2017By Andreas GurskyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: © Andreas Gursky/DACS, 2025, courtesy of Sprüth MagersIn 2017, the eminent German photographer Andreas Gursky, known for his vast, detailed, era-defining landscapes, trained his camera on anAmazonwarehouse in Arizona packed full of goods destined for customers. This century has seen internet shopping go from a niche experiment – in 2000, the Guardian reported that anxieties about postage time had led to a “collapse” of online pre-Christmas book sales – to one of the most common ways to make a purchase.FBSophia the Robot, 2017By Giulio Di SturcoView image in fullscreenPhotograph: @ Giulio Di Sturco“It was super weird,” recalls Giulio Di Sturco of his visit to a Hong Kong lab to photograph Sophia the Robot. “Pieces of robots everywhere, five guys working like mechanics – to think the future might be built in this kind of space.”The idea that Sophia represented a major leap in AI was big news: the next year, she became a citizen of Saudi Arabia – the first robot to be granted legal personhood anywhere. There were sceptics, however, and ChatGPT’s arrival in 2022 might suggest the future of AI is in chatbots and datacentres instead. But Di Sturco believes the humanoid robot’s time is still to come. “They were on the edge of something interesting,” he says.FBMegan Rapinoe, 2019By Franck FifeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter decades in which their game was dwarfed by men’s, women are winning fans for their playing and inclusivity. Megan Rapinoe’s victory pose after scoring for the US in the 2019 World Cup went viral: a symbol of both her athleticism and her advocacy on issues including LGBTQ+ rights and mental health.GSStormzy headlining Glastonbury, 2019By Samir HusseinView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Samir Hussein/WireImage“This is the best night of my entire life,” a 25-year-oldStormzytold the crowd during his historic set at Glastonbury in 2019, as the first Black British solo act to headline the festival. Wearing a Banksy-designed union jack stab vest, Stormzy crafted a set that both celebrated Black British culture – with guest performances from Ballet Black, WAR collective and Dave – and critiqued racism in the UK. Praised by everyone from David Lammy, Zadie Smith and Jeremy Corbyn to Adele and Ghetts, the performance went out of its way to educate its audience and reference the many acts that had come before to make it possible. “This was about arrival,” Smith wrote in the New Yorker, “of a king and his court and the many, many people who have hoped for this day.”FBCovid kiss, 2020By Emilio MorenattiView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Emilio Morenatti/APThis photo shows the emotional reunion of Agustina Cañamero and Pascual Pérez, a couple in their 80s, in a nursing home in Barcelona in June 2020. Husband and wife had been separated for 102 days in the first lockdown – their longest time apart in 59 years of marriage. The image has come to symbolise how lives worldwide were upended by Covid.The global health emergency was declared over in May 2023, and may feel like a distant memory. Yet more than seven million people have died to date, and many others are dealing with grief or long-term health issues. “Most of my generation have been affected in deep, developmental ways and that’s going to affect us for ever,” 21-year-old student Eoin O’Loughlin told the Guardian, in a 2023 series on the “Covid Generation”.GSStorming of the Capitol, 2021By Victor J BlueView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Victor J Blue/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesOn 6 January 2021, in the wake of Joe Biden’s election win, a crowd began to peel off from Trump’s fiery speech in which he accused the Democrats of stealing the election from him. Photographer Victor J Blue followed them as they broke into the Capitol buildings, and took this picture after they had been expelled – police officers, running out of pepper spray, were letting off fire extinguishers in an attempt to discourage protesters from breaking back in, which accounts for the “smoke” at the centre of the photo.FBLife on Mars, 2021By PerseveranceView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Nasa via APWas there once life on Mars? And could the planet, asElon Musk believes, offer us a home when Earth becomes uninhabitable? It’s no surprise its exploration has been the dominant story of the 21st-century space race so far. Nasa’s Perseverance rover landedin February 2021, searching for signs of past life, so we can better understand the planet’s habitability.This selfie, taken in 2024, is “such a nice encapsulation of what Nasa’s mission is all about”, says project scientist Katie Stack Morgan. Stitched together from 62 images (which is why the rover’s arm is missing), it shows Perseverance alongside the helicopter Ingenuity – the first aircraft to complete a powered, controlled flight on another planet. As for colonising the Red Planet, Stack Morgan points out we might first “ask whether we have been good stewards of our own planet”.GSGreek wildfire, 2021By Konstantinos TsakalidisView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Konstantinos Tsakalidis/Bloomberg/Getty Images“At that moment,” said 81-year-old Panayiota Kritsiopi, “I was shouting not only for myself, but for the whole village.” She was photographed as a huge wildfire on the Greek island of Evia forced thousands to flee and eventually burned more than half the island. Miraculously, Kritsiopi’s home would be spared; the fire reportedly stopped a metre from her house.That year was quickly surpassed by 2022, then 2024, as Europe’s hottest on record, while this summer saw the worst wildfire season in European history.FBActivists throwing soup at Van Gogh, 2022Photographer unknownView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images“It was surreal,” recallsJust Stop Oilactivist Anna Holland (right) of the day they and Phoebe Plummer approached a Van Gogh painting in the National Gallery, London, can in hand. “Almost before I knew it, we were throwing the soup.”The stunt was part of a wave of climate action that has flourished this century, focused on symbolic targets such as this (safely protected behind glass). Though the pair were sentenced to prison under Britain’s increasingly draconian protest laws, they inspired fellow soup throwers worldwide.FBThe death of Queen Elizabeth II, 2022By Ben StansallView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesThe queen’s death on 8 September 2022, at 96, ended a 70-year reign – the longest of any UK monarch.Some 250,000 people joined the (very British) queue to see her lying in state ahead of the funeral, itself watched by 29 million TV viewers in the UK.Here, her son, Charles III – at 73, the oldest person to succeed the throne – walks beside her coffin in Westminster Abbey. His grief is palpable, but beyond loss there is uncertainty: what next?GSIVF rhino foetus, 2023By Jon A JuárezView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jon A JuárezIn March 2018, tragedy struck: Sudan, the last northern white male rhino, died. With only two females left, the species was functionally extinct. Then, a flash of hope: a foetus created using sperm taken from males before they died.Sadly, the mother died of an unrelated infection. But tests showed the tiny foetus would probably have survived. Said photographer Jon A Juárez, “Though the story is bittersweet, the foetus proves the science works. If we support scientists’ efforts, we can still correct our course and make the planet a better place.”GSTaylor Swift’s Eras tour, 2024By Emma McIntyreView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Emma McIntyre/TAS24/Getty Images for TAS Rights ManagementThere was a period when Taylor Swift’s Eras tour – 149 shows in 51 cities over 21 months – seemed like it would never end. Neither did the appetite of her global fanbase, who packed out stadium after stadium for 3.5-hour performances of Swift’s greatest hits. When the international juggernaut finally concluded in December 2024, it was the highest-grossing concert tour of all time: more than $2bn in ticket sales. Her supremacy was confirmed.The success of the tour also reflected the post-pandemic boom in major live music events, driven by fans craving joy and connection, as well as by artists seeking to supplement their incomes in the era of streaming. Meanwhile, it’s often said that our century has seen the death of the monoculture. Swift, it seems, is one of the last stars standing.GSTrump assassination attempt, 2024 …By Evan VucciView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Evan Vucci/AP“Let me get my shoes,” were Trump’s first words to the Secret Service agents bundling him away, after a sniper’s bullet grazed his ear. It was what he said next, however, fist raised, that sealed the moment in history: “Fight!” The image galvanised his supporters and injected new energy into his campaign. Coming just weeks after Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance, this pivotal moment convinced commentators on both sides of the political spectrum that a second presidency was within his grasp.FB… and tech leaders at his inauguration, 2025By Saul LoebView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesIt is a defining image of power in 2025:Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk in the front row at Trump’s inauguration (Apple CEO Tim Cook is out of frame).The tech bosses – of Meta, Amazon, Google and Tesla – are collectively worth almost $1tn, a figure that reflects the sharp increase in inequality globally this century.The image also captures the political journey the US tech sector has been on, from darling of the left to throwing in its lot with the Maga right.FBThese 46 images show moments that tell the story of the first quarter of the 21st century.

Known for his surreally bittersweet short stories, George Saunders has written only one novel so far – but that one won the Booker prize. The follow-up to 2017’s Lincoln in the Bardo,Vigil(Bloomsbury) focuses on an unquiet spirit called Jill who helps others pass over from life to whatever comes next. She is called to the deathbed of an oil tycoon who is rapidly running out of time to face up to his ecological crimes, in a rallying cry for human connection and environmental action. Ali Smith’sGlyph(Hamish Hamilton) is a companion to 2024’s Gliff, and promises to tell a story initially hidden in that previous novel. Expect fables, siblings, phantoms and horses in a typically playful shout of resistance against war, genocide and the increasingly hostile social discourse. And inDeparture(s)(Jonathan Cape), Julian Barnes announces his own – this blend of memoir and fiction, exploring memory, illness, mortality and love across the decades, will be his last book. “Your presence has delighted me,” he assures the reader. “Indeed, I would be nothing without you.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Bloomsbury/PAThe Hamnet adaptation hits UK cinemas in January, but Maggie O’Farrell’s next novel isn’t out until June.Land(Tinder), a multigenerational saga which opens in 19th-century Ireland in the wake of the famine, is inspired by her own family history and centres on a man tasked with mapping the country for the Ordnance Survey. There’ll be much anticipation, too, forThe Things We Never Sayfrom Elizabeth Strout (Viking, May). The ultra-prolific Strout is adored for her interconnected novels, but this story of a man with a secret is a standalone, introducing characters we’ve never met before. InJohn of John(Picador, May) Douglas Stuart, author of much-loved Booker winner Shuggie Bain, portrays a young gay man returning home from art school to the lonely croft on the Hebridean island where he grew up. And September sees a new novel from Irish writer Sebastian Barry:The Newer World(Faber) follows Costa winner Days Without End and A Thousand Moons in transporting the reader to late 19th-century America in the aftermath of the Civil War.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jonathan Cape/PAApart from his pulpy collaboration with Keanu Reeves on The Book of Elsewhere, fantasy legend China Miéville hasn’t published a novel for adults since 2011’s Embassytown.The Rouse(Picador, September) has been 20 years in the writing and promises dark conspiracies and uncanny forces in a continent-spanning epic. Other returns to look out for include John Lanchester with a black comedy of entitlement and generational resentment set amid the metropolitan elite,Look WhatYou Made Me Do(Faber, March), and Life of Pi author Yann Martel’s ambitiousSon of Nobody(Canongate, April), in which a classical scholar uncovers a lost account of the Trojan war. The translated poem unfolds at the top of the page, with heartfelt footnotes addressed to his young daughter below, in a meditation on mythmaking, homemaking and storytelling. Gwendoline Riley has built a reputation as a deadpan genius of dysfunctional relationships; she follows 2021’s My Phantoms withThe Palm House(Picador, April), a sly dark comedy about a long friendship between two prickly people enduring in the face of the world’s disappointments.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Fourth Estate/PAAsako Yuzuki’s Butter, featuring a gourmet cook turned serial killer, has become a slow-burn sensation (“There are two things that I can simply not tolerate: feminists and margarine”). Author and translator Polly Barton are reunited inHooked(4th Estate, March), another exploration of food, friendship and female experience in contemporary Japan.Three award winners return. Tayari Jones took the Women’s prize for American Marriage in 2019;Kin(Oneworld, March) focuses on two motherless daughters in the segregated American south. Geetanjali Shree follows up her 2022 International Booker winner Tomb of Sand withThe Roof Beneath Their Feet(translated by Rahul Soni, And Other Stories, February), charting women’s lives in India. And inThe End of Everything(Serpent’s Tail, June), M John Harrison, whose previous novel The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again won the Goldsmiths prize in 2020, continues his unsettling destabilisation of our contemporary moment.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Oneworld PublicationsSecond novels to get excited about include Louise Kennedy’s follow-up to the award-winning and recently seen-on-TV Trespasses;Stations(Bloomsbury, September) traces the relationship of two Irish teenagers from the early 80s onwards. In Jacqueline Crooks’sSky City(Cape, August), the Fire Rush author focuses on a woman in 90s London trying to escape her past. Gabriel Tallent’s 2017 debut My Absolute Darling divided readers with its intense tale of an abusive father and his rebellious daughter; the follow-upCrux(Fig Tree, February) is a portrait of friendship and thrill-seeking between two young climbers in an impoverished California community . Megha Majumdar won high praise with her 2020 debut A Burning.A Guardian and a Thief(Scribner, January) is another depiction of Indian inequality, set in a near-future Kolkata ravaged by climate change; while inThe Last of Earth(Oneworld, February) Deepa Anappara follows her acclaimed 2020 adventure about children under threat in an Indian shantytown, Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line, with a historical novel featuring outsiders venturing into the Forbidden Kingdom of Tibet.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pan MacmillanShort stories from Colm Tóibín delve into the inner lives of people living far from home inThe News from Dublin(Picador, March), which ranges from Ireland to Argentina to the Spanish civil war, while American author Sigrid Nunez publishes her first story collection, the career-spanningIt Will Come Back to You(Virago, August).Finally, a treat for the autumn as Louisa Young embarks on a continuation of her aunt Elizabeth Jane Howard’s ultimate comfort read The Cazalet Chronicles, the sprawling saga of an upper-middle-class English family set around the second world war that has enthralled readers since the first volume was published in 1990.The Golden Hours(Mantle, September) opens at Christmas 1962, in a country on the brink of change. It will explore the final years of the old guard and the changing fortunes of the family, as well as new characters and new stories.To browse and preorder the titles in the 2026 lookahead, visitguardianbookshop.com.

But after his early music career faltered, he began to write about his troubled childhood – and hit a nerveSat 27 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTShareFromNewham, LondonRecommended if you likeDave, Bashy, NemzzzUp nextDebut mixtape planned for springIt’s a measure of how quickly Keaton Edmund, AKA Kidwild, has speed-run his way through a performing arts career that the rapper describes himself as being in the “comeback part of my life” at age 20.As a child he was acting opposite Beverley Knight in The Bodyguard in the West End and toured the production around China. He had a main role in four seasons of CBBC football drama Jamie Johnson and appeared on Casualty. You can see him dancing in the video to Stormzy’s 2017 single Vossi Bop, a baby-faced scamp swinging a baseball bat into the camera lens. It all made him grow up fast. “I was spending bare time alone, bare time with older people. So I just started seeing life for what it is. You get time to sit with your thoughts.”Bored during Covid,he ordered a microphone and began crafting rap songs of his own. Half a decade on, he now has millions of listeners drawn to his candid storytelling about his life’s struggles. But not until after a false start.By 17,he had signed to major label Atlantic Records – so young that his mum had to chaperone him to the signing. But after Edmund had released two tracks, the person who signed him left, and he was left in limbo. “For everything to just go cold, you start second-guessing yourself,” he says, speaking with expansive, gentle gestures on a Guardian office sofa, his features still almost as boyish as in that Stormzy video. “It’s kind of degrading, because you’re meant to be the next star, as they said, and then you just exist.” After a third track “didn’t live up to their expectation – I don’t know what their expectation was”, he was dropped.But that newfound freedom left him feeling “like I came out of jail”. He felt charged up at the prospect of making a career on his own. When his self-released track Indecisive started gaining traction in October 2024 – it’s since been streamed 29m times on Spotify – he was visiting family in St Lucia. “Everything I ever wanted was happening, and I’m just sitting at my grandma’s house in the village.” He flew home, then a day later he went to the studio and “in a flow state” wrote the hook to Redemption – one of the biggest British rap tracks of 2025. “How can I stop when I come this far? / I smile outside, deep down I’m scarred”, he rapped. Later in the year, on superb JBee collaboration If I Lose, he tells a lover: “I just want you to hold me.”Vulnerability has soared in rap over the last decade, but Kidwild is particularly soul-baring over his atmospheric, drill-adjacent beats. Is it taboo for men to be so open with their emotions? “It’s true – you see it in the suicide rates in men compared to women,” he says. “A lot of men don’t open up. With songs where I’m quite vulnerable, people message me and say: I relate to this so much. If they are one of them people who don’t like to speak on their emotions, at least they have Kidwild to relate to.”The most potent of these tracks is his recent single Forgive Me, about his relationship with his father who was imprisoned for a number of years. “I was calling your phone, never got no reception / The only pic I got of us is me in Reception,” Kidwild raps, crestfallen. “I remember the first time I got a call from jail,” he says. “I didn’t want to speak. I said hi, and that was it, just gave my mum back the phone.” On the track he spits out: “Is it a crime if I say I’m glad he got sentenced?” But after five years of no contact, they are beginning to reconcile. “When we speak about it now, I laugh because it’s like, now that I’m older, I understand life more. I see why I was angry.”A forthcoming mixtape is “a chance to talk my truth” and chart his difficult youth. “A lot of music now, there’s not much topic, it’s just like …” Vibes? “Vibes, yeah – which is good! I like vibes music. But I wanted to add something different, get in depth.”Explore more on these topicsCultureNew music for 2026RapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both are wearing ski masks and T-shirts bearing Nazi symbols.The German videos – titled Balaclava Kitchen – started in 2014 andran for monthsbefore YouTube took down the channel for violating its guidelines.But it offered a glimpse of how far-right groups have seized on cultural production – from clothing brands to top 40 music – to normalise their ideas, in a process that researchers say has hit new heights in the age of social media.“It’s frightening, honestly,” said Katherine Kondor, a researcher with the Norwegian Center for Holocaust and Minority Studies. “You can be radicalised sitting on your couch.”In affiliation with the Center for Research on Extremism (C-REX), Kondor is leading a six-country projectlooking at howthe extreme right uses aesthetics, from fitness influencers to memes and stickers, to spread their views across Europe.From Sweden to Spain, researchers found that extremist messaging was woven through cultural aspects of everyday life, both online and offline.“In Hungary we have some examples of extreme right bands becoming mainstream because they’re on the top 40 chart. I mean, what’s more normal than being on the top 40?” Kondor said.Member of far-right AfD party charged with making Nazi salute at ReichstagRead more“I have a stepson who sometimes sends videos and then I go down the rabbit hole to see who created them and it turns out it’s a far-right influencer.”So-called“tradwives”, referring to female content creators who promote traditional gender roles on social media, are another example.As the numbers of women embracing the concept online surges, the content’sfar-right rootshave been increasingly obscured. Even so, the views they often promote – from anti-feminism to a nostalgia for an imagined past – continue to boost far-right aims.These cultural elements serve as gateways, at times helping to reel people into extremism, Kondor said. “I think there’s a mistaken idea that people join the far right because they believe in that ideology and want to meet like-minded people,” she said. “But that’s not how it works.”While there are some who are driven by prejudices against certain groups or specific beliefs, or others who tag along with friends who are already involved, many are lured by the subcultures that encase these movements, she said.“They start listening to a band that they really like and start going to concerts of that band. Then they start meeting people there and it can escalate in that way,” Kondor explained.“When people find things that work for their aesthetic or their vibe, or they find music that they really like, that can really influence a person.”The link between extreme ideas and the cultural tools they opt to use is not always straightforward, she added, citing the example of a group of far-right extremists in the Netherlands with a penchant for hosting wine-tasting events.“They’ve also started their own food delivery,” she said. “It’s just wild that you can be ordering food from the far right and not know.”Extremists have long used culture to foster a sense of belonging among its members and gain attention among the wider public, said Greta Jasser, a research associate at Germany’s Institute for Democracy and Civil Society, which is also part of the six-country project.Previously, however, their strength in doing so relied on the talent pool of their members, as musicians, artists and camera operators were needed to create content. With the advent of generative AI, this is no longer the case.“Now there’s technology that we can use to generate an image or video in an instant or music within just a couple of minutes,” said Jasser. “So the playbook is old, but the speed is much faster.”The economics of social media have also transformed the process, leading to questions regarding who is creating far-right content and their motivations.“It could be posted by a bot. It could be anyone and anything wanting to generate income from producing as many AI videos and images as possible,” said Jasser.“Which then interestingly calls into question how ideologically driven many of these accounts are, or if it’s a way to generate revenue.”As the research continues, Kondor and her team have been weighing how best to educate the public about their findings, mulling strategies such as online content or tools that could help people better recognise the far right and the myriad of cultural elements they’re producing.“I think it’s often shocking to people,” said Kondor. “Right now it’s dangerous because we’re seeing a steady rise of the far right in every aspect of society. It’s more important than ever to figure out how to mitigate this.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The Gigantic website also listed the same fee for the recently built Co-op Live arena in Manchester.Restoration fees and levies have become a familiar feature on venue and ticketing websites in recent years – but the reader asked how they could be applied to these two almost brand-new venues, which opened in 2019 and 2024, respectively.When we contacted Gigantic, the company said we needed to speak to the promoter, and it changed its website to explain that this fee was to support grassroots venues.View image in fullscreenTottenham Hotspur Stadium opened in 2019 and cost £850m.Photograph: View Pictures/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesCloser inspection of the other fees that had been charged revealed that while the website listed a 10% booking fee, the reader had been charged 13% – with the 3% adding on almost £3 extra for each ticket purchased.A spokesperson from Kilimanjaro Live, the promoter of the Gorillaz tour, confirmed that the ticketing website had made an error and that all affected buyers would be given a refund of the difference.The story highlights how the plethora of fees being added to tickets mean that fans can quickly lose track of how much they should pay.Last year, research by the consumer body Which? found that extra charges including delivery and transaction fees, booking fees, service fees and order processing fees, canadd up to 25% to the costof concert and festival tickets.However, the 2025 Music Fans’ Voice surveyfound that only 35% of respondents were aware of all charges before reaching the checkout stage, while only 34% of respondents said they were aware of what each charge was for.Lack of transparencyAlice Andrews recently bought tickets to see the pop-rapper Pitbull at London’s BST Hyde Park in July 2026. The price of the three tickets without fees was £329.85. There was an added £3 transaction fee, a £3 sustainability levy, and a £37.50 service fee – making a total of £373.35.Like many music fans, she says she wants greater transparency over how much tickets will cost in total, and where this extra money goes.“I would like to know what my money is going to be used for if I’m going to pay a fee,” she says. “It has put me off big gigs before.”Andrew Simpson, a regular gig-goer, says that when looking at tickets for Haim at Manchester’s Co-op Live, on top of the £51.75 face value for a general admission ticket to stand, there was an £8 service fee, £2.35 handling fee, and £2.95 facility fee – bringing the total up to £65.05.View image in fullscreenThe Clapham Grand, an independent venue in London, now tells customers what additional fees will be used for.Photograph: Tim P Whitby/Getty ImagesWhen he looked for a breakdown of what the fees covered, the website said the facility fee “keeps the venue running, helping us to improve our services and experiences for all fans …”“This is just a meaningless sentence and tells me nothing,” Simpson says.Some independent venues, such as the Clapham Grand in London and Saint Luke’s in Glasgow, have listened to feedback from ticket buyers and now include a breakdown of expenses online that show what additional fees, such as a restoration levy, are for. Some specify what an added charge is for at the time of purchase – for example, it may be used to finance a new floor.When the Guardian approached Gigantic, it said the restoration fee was in fact a £1 Live Trust donation, where the money is given to smaller, independent venues via a scheme by the Music Venue Trust, a charity which acts to “protect, secure and improve UK grassroots music venues for the benefit of venues, communities and upcoming artists”.The reader who got in touch has received their overpayment back from Gigantic.Total costMark Davyd, the chief executive officer of the Music Venue Trust, says the reason there are so many fees is because of the number of players that are involved in selling tickets. Often fees are set by different parties involved in the process, all of whom argue that they need the money in order to deliver the service or product.He says transparency is actually “irrelevant” to fans, and that they actually just want the total cost to be what is displayed to them on the landing page.“That’s what fans want,” he says. “Delivering that requires government and trading standards bodies to recognise that, and a total rewiring of the terms of the contract.”Last month,the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched what it described as a “major consumer protection drive” focused on online pricing practices across a range of sectors including entertainment. These practices include“drip pricing”, which is where online shoppers are shown an initial price for an item or service, but then more fees are revealed (or “dripped”) as people progress through the buying process.View image in fullscreenA fan said a ticket to see Haim at Co-op Live had £13 of additional fees on top of the face-value ticket cost.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PAThe CMA citeda 2023 government reportthat found that drip pricing was particularly common when it came to event tickets (it indicated they were present at 93% of the businesses looked at).The competition watchdog said it had begun investigations into eight companies about their pricing practices, two of which were sellers of event tickets: StubHub and Viagogo. It said these two companies were under review over the mandatory additional charges applied when consumers buy tickets, and whether or not these fees were included upfront. However, it said that at this stage it had reached no conclusions about whether the law had been broken in any of these investigations.Explore more on these topicsTicket pricesConsumer affairsShareReuse this content"

First, he had visited Agra, to capture the Taj Mahal. The next morning, he awoke before dawn to visit the Yamuna River. Despite being one of the most polluted bodies of water in the world, locals can be seen fishing while visitors take boat rides from the ghat, the name for the flight of stairs that leads to the water.“In this image, the people on the boats are feeding the birds,” Ghai adds. “They call out ‘Aww, aww’ and the birds glide towards that spot, as if they instantly recognise the familiar call of kindness.”While Ghai toyed with the option of converting the image to black and white, he eventually chose to retain the colour. “This version felt more real – the gleaming hues of sunrise blending with the mist, the birds moving across the pale sky,” he adds. “It held the soul of the morning.”Explore more on these topicsPhotographySmart shotArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To warmly droning organ that hangs like the last streak of sunlight above a darkening horizon, Milovic assures someone that they haven’t offended her – but her steady Teutonic tenderness, reminiscent ofMolly Nilssonor Sophia Kennedy, suggests that their actions weren’t provocative so much as evasive. Strings flutter tentatively as she addresses this person who can’t look life in the eye right now. “I see you clearly,” Milovic sings, as the drums kick in and the strings become full-blooded: a reminder of the ease that letting go can offer.Laura SnapesThe 50 best albums of 2025Read moreAl Olender – The CycloneIn a year that saw thetroublingriseofAI-generatedslop music, there is something endlessly comforting about a song that can only have been written by a messy, complicated human. The first lines of Al Olender’s delightfully specific Cyclone, draw on a memory of driving to Queens to “try to get laid”, and from there the song takes our unwinding narrator to a Baltimore freeway, Planet Fitness bathroom, and, yes, the titular Coney Island attraction. It’s a well-trodden theme, though usually sung by classic dude troubadours such as Townes Van Zandt or Merle Haggard: no matter where she runs, she’s herself, and it’s a problem. But the song’s crescendo is one of the prettiest, and lasting, that I have heard in a while. After losing love (or maybe it was just some guy), the singer resolves to replace all of her glass with paper plates – “things I cannot break”.Alaina DemopoulosLisa Knapp and Gerry Diver – Long LankinThe 10 best folk albums of 2025Read moreThe most transfixing song too few people heard in 2025 has actually been around for nearly 300 years. Long Lankin, an insanely violent traditional folk murder ballad, has been performed by musical ghouls since at least the 1750s. Far more recently, its dark soul has been conjured by trad stars as esteemed asMartin Carthy,Shirley Collinsand Steeleye Span. Never, however, have I heard a version as bone-chilling as the one by the Englishfolk starLisa Knapp. (It appears onHinterland, her first album co-credited to her longtime partner in music, life and, for all I know, crime, Gerry Diver). Knapp’s quavering soprano manages to sound, at once, pristine and menacing, a silky ghost of a thing equally skilled at seduction and threat. The clarity of her tone has a Sandy Denny purity, but her vibrato portends imminent danger, underscored by Diver’s creepy-crawly glockenspiel and Pete Flood’s spooky drums, which have the jazzy surprise of Terry Cox’s work with Pentangle. While the musicians orchestrate the shifting perspectives of the lyric, Knapp delivers a vocal so arresting, you won’t know whether to shudder or swoon.Jim FarberMidnightRoba– Axis (featSaul Williams)Roba El-Essawy AKA MidnightRoba was the soulful voice of 90s British trip-hop band Attica Blues and has more recently been releasing music solo, including 2025’s self-released second album, Raise A Symphony – a call for “peace, love, justice, solidarity, righteousness, compassion, empathy and care”. Lead track Axis, produced by El-Essawy, is a maelstrom of splintered, IDM-style electronica, hypnotic interlocking loops, skittering, restless rushes of tabla and operatic vocals in tribute to the children who’ve been killed in Gaza and those grieving them. It features the guest incantations of poet, actor and activist Saul Williams, who has been nominated alongside New Age maestroCarlos Niñoat the upcoming Grammys and with whom El-Essawy recently performed at the Pitchfork London festival. An anthem for screaming into the void when it feels like no one is listening. As Williams says on the track: “It’s beyond exhausting.”Kate HutchinsonCleyra– There’s Nothing Happening Between UsThere is a tiny handful of blurred or obscured pics of Cleyra out in the world and even less biographical info, beyond the fact they’re a producer from Bristol in the UK. Perhaps that’s all to the good, allowing for greater mystery and deeper immersion into their mist-wreathed music, which seems to drift through the walls of a multi-room nightclub like an ex-raver in purgatory. Their album-length EP remember this body? features five universally strong tracks, from the reggaeton-adjacent Conundrum to the post-R&B soundscape Just Can’t Live Without Ya and three flavours of techno in between, including the 17-minute There’s Nothing Happening Between Us. That long runtime allows for a proper trip, as 4/4 drums chart a course through a murky sea with explosions emanating from the deep, before surfacing into cleaner drum programming and alarm sounds, as if returning to consciousness in an unfamiliar ambulance. Then ambient techno carries you back into a stupor. Few other dance producers attempted anything quite so ambitious in a single track this year.Ben Beaumont-ThomasDom Innarella – Call MeNew York’s humble neighbor to the east in the form of New Jersey has produced plenty of Italian American singing talent. (Looking at you, Sinatra). Now, 14 year-old Dom Innarella prepares to take the stage. His smooth falsetto originally launched him into TikTok-viral fame with listeners comparing him to a young Justin Bieber. Now, his own version ofBieber fevermay not be far behind. (Innarella-mania?) His past year was a big one, with the singer signing with Republic Records and releasing a series of throwback pop and R&B singles that harken back to Bieber’s early days. Aside from his breakout Bout Me and a recent cover of It’s Beginning To Look a Lot Like Christmas, Inarella’s acoustic and drum machine-driven Call Me reminds one of Usher’s glory days. No wonder why he’searned kudosfrom the man himself, along with J Balvin and Teddy Swims. With a debut album on the horizon, the future could belong to another voice from the Garden state.Rob LeDonneJammy – Right TimeJammy is an artist I first encountered back in 2017 withMargarita, a sad, post-summer ode to dreaming of a love that fades when the sun stops shining. It remains under-heard (a music video with fewer than 30,000 views, the Google search “jammy margarita” leading to recipes for a margarita with jam) but it’s a monster hit compared with his EP this year. The best track,Right Time, hasn’t even hit 60 views on YouTube (!) with a Spotify count not even notable enough to register (the artist himself only reaches under 3,000 listeners a month). It is therefore something of a public service for me to bring it to light, another mellow and lightly melancholic winner about a lost love, this time one who’s now in a new thankless relationship and maybe needs the help to get out? Or maybe he’s just fooling himself, a sense of delusion running through his back-and-forth, gently switching between cocksure and vulnerable. It’s too good to be kept a secret.Benjamin LeeAnika – Walk Away“The truth is I don’t really like myself / And the truth is I don’t really like anyone else” is an opening gambit so direct it almost dares you to flinch. But Walk Away never sinks into a confessional wallow; it keeps strutting forward as if refusing to grant despair the dignity of stillness. Annika Henderson’s voice arrives coolly detached, half-spoken, half-sung, floating above bright, jangling guitars whose breeziness feels deliberately mismatched to the venom in her words. That tension is the point. The Berlin-based hybrid artist – and former journalist – has always understood the power of saying things plainly, and Walk Away reads like column inches finally allowed to shout. It’s a four-and-a-half-minute anthem of irritation and self-loathing that somehow lands as liberating rather than bleak, its grunge-inflected pulse recalling the reckless candor of 90s alt-rock without leaning into nostalgia. The chorus doesn’t explode so much as sharpen, circling the same unsparing truths until they start to feel oddly cathartic. In an era of hyper-managed vulnerability, Walk Away is refreshingly unfiltered: a song that refuses both likability and apology, sounding all the better for it.Bryan Armen GrahamExplore more on these topicsMusic2025 in culturePop and rockIndieDance musicFolk musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This started life as a Lyonnaise dish that I sawAnthony Bourdainenjoy on his TV seriesParts Unknownat Daniel Boulud’s parents’ farmhouse. My adapted version could be a centrepiece of your New Year’s Eve party, where the molten cheese mixture can be spread on bruschetta and topped with pickles. Equally, however, it could be a main meal shared with friends alongside a salad, pickles and bread. Either way, it’s built for comfort and for joy. Happy New Year to you.Pumpkin fondueI used a 3kg kabocha squash, but if you can’t find one that big, get two medium-sized pumpkins instead.Prep15 minCook2 hr 15 minServes6-8 for dinner, or 20 as canapes3kg pumpkin(1 big or 2 smaller ones) – crown prince, delica or kobocha; it’s not about the overall weight, but the size of the pumpkin and the cavity7 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilFine sea salt1 tsp mixed spice1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced80g cooked chestnuts, chopped12 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked to get 1 tbsp500g mushrooms– the most exotic you can find – shredded or chopped smallBlack pepper50g unsalted butter50g plain white flour500ml whole milk100g gruyere(make sure it’s a vegetarian one), roughly chopped75g emmental(a vegetarian one), grated50g stilton(a vegetarian one), or other vegetarian blue cheese, roughly choppedTo serveToasted baguetteBaby cornichonsSalad leavesHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Using a small, serrated knife, cut a roughly 15cm-wide lid off the top of the pumpkin, then scoop out the seeds. Cut out (and reserve) a little extra flesh from the cavity to open up the hole a bit, then rub in a tablespoon of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a half-teaspoon of mixed spice.Heat three tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan, then add the chopped onion and the reserved pumpkin flesh left over from making the lid. Cook for six or seven minutes, until soft, then add the garlic, chestnuts, thyme and remaining half-teaspoon of mixed spice, and cook for two minutes. Scrape into a large bowl.Heat three more tablespoons of oil in the same pan, then add the mushrooms, half a teaspoon of salt and six grinds of pepper. Turn up the heat, cook for 15 minutes, until there is no liquid left in the bottom of the pan, then transfer the mushrooms to the onion bowl.In a medium saucepan, melt the butter on a medium heat and, when it’s frothy, add the flour and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and whisk for a couple of minutes, until smooth. Slowly whisk in the milk, beating constantly, until the sauce thickens, then take off the heat.Fold all the cheese bar 25g grated emmental into the mushroom bowl. Spoon the mix into the cavity of the pumpkin until it’s nearly full, then slowly pour in as much of the bechamel as you can. Pop the lid back on the top of the pumpkin, wrap the whole thing in foil and bake for an hour to an hour and 15 minutes, until a sharp knife passes easily through the pumpkin skin. Unwrap the foil just at the top, lift off and discard the lid and scatter the reserved 25g grated emmental on top of the filling inside. Bake for another 10 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and bronzed.Take the pumpkin out of the oven, carefully peel off the foil and serve from the tin or transfer to a platter. To eat as a canape, spread some bechamel on a slice of baguette and top with a cornichon (save the leftover pumpkin flesh for another use); for a main meal, scoop the flesh and bechamel on to plates and serve with bread, cornichons and salad leaves.Explore more on these topicsWinter food and drinkMeera Sodha recipesVegetablesFoodCheeseMain coursePumpkinrecipesShareReuse this content"
