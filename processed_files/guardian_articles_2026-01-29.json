What’s your go-to pastry recipe and, briefly, your favourite filling – savoury and sweet?TopTrampWell, as much as I can make it, I like to have a little block of shop-bought shortcrust or flaky pastry in the fridge. It’s so much easier to just roll it out and stick it on top. The pies have to be double crust. The one I make the most is slow braised, tiny chunks of steak with minced beef and roasted shallots, like a minced beef and onion pie. The kids love that with chips for Saturday night dinner. I like making chicken and mushroom with leek, although my partner’s a veggie, so she would probably say fish pie, with boiled eggs, which is a real labour of love, so I tend to save that for special occasions. I like a nice apple and cinnamon pie with a Demerara sugar crust, and cherry pie made with that really shit fake filling.The trailer for Whistle.What happened to your live-action remake of Captain Pugwash?keithrickabyThat was nearly 10 years ago. There was quite a good script. I think the money was coming from China, and I’m not sure they’d seen Captain Pugwash before. I think it was one of those things that never quite reached escape velocity. I do remember they just had normal names, and not the double entendres like Seaman Staines or Master Bates that everyone thinks were in the cartoon.Would you rather beAndy McNabor AndieMacDowell for the day?HesfalleninthewaterI would 100% want to be Andie MacDowell, not only for the chance to be Andie MacDowell, but to be a woman, just to see what it’s like. Only for a day though.View image in fullscreenNick Frost and Simon Pegg in Shaun of the Dead.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyCan you still salsa and would you consider Strictly?ukpidgeonI can still salsa. After Cuban Fury, I was mooted to do Strictly, but when I worked out how much work it would be, compared to the fee, it was a no. Plus, I was super fat, and I’ve always had an issue with the way they dress fat contestants on Strictly. They end up looking like a ball of satin, or like Violet Beauregarde in Willy Wonka, who turns into a giant blueberry. I have picked up some other skills as an actor. I can strip an MP5 [gun] blindfolded [as he did in Spaced]. I was asked to learn to knit for my latest job [as Hagrid in HBO’s Harry Potter], so I had lessons and thought: “Yeah! I can knit!”Had you seenThe Big Lebowskibefore playingMikein Spaced?PickmansModelI didn’t see The Big Lebowski until much later, so the Dude and Mike are completely similar by accident, even down to his glasses. I invented Mike, when I was 21, to make Simon [Pegg] laugh. Mike was a member of the territorial army, and had an eye disease which meant he couldn’t join the regular army, and had to wear glasses to correct his ocular wrong. It just happened to be a little bit John Goodman in The Big Lebowski.View image in fullscreenFrost as Mr Craven in Whistle.Photograph: Michael GibsonIf you could remake any film, where they all now have Hot Fuzz-style West Country accents, which would you choose?MrSOBaldrickI guess it would have to be something quite serious.

I’ve been there and seen them, because he and Edgar [Wright] became friends. That’s quite weird – being a fan of cinema as a younger man, and watching Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, then suddenly the director has your stupid face in the foyer of his cinema.Be honest – how many of the Harry Potter films / books had you seen / read when you were cast as Hagrid in the upcoming TVversion?TurangaLeela2I’ve seen all the films. We go through them all as a family during Christmas every year. We start on 20 December and finish a week and a half later. Before I was cast as Hagrid, my partner suggested trying to manifest it. So last Christmas, I watched all the films back to back on the Sky Harry Potter channel, while writing out the word “Hagrid” 7,000 times.View image in fullscreenPegg and Frost in Spaced.Photograph: E4 PICTURE PUBLICITYAs someone who also only started getting tattoos in my mid-30s, what made you start?bearvssharkI had one tattoo when I was 20. I fainted within five seconds. When I woke up, there were two Hells Angels lifting me back into my chair. I didn’t have any more until when my dad died when I was 40, as a way to turn spiritual pain into physical pain, and try to exorcise it. Now I’m 53, my whole top and arms are covered. It eventually got past exorcising dead family demons, to enjoying the pain a bit. I struggled for a long time with how I looked, in terms of being a mega fatty, and not being able to go to the beach without people laughing at you. The tattoos meant people didn’t focus on how much you weighed, so it was like a suit of armour.Would you ever consider playing some Shakespeare on stage, say Falstaff, Othello or Portia?CHARISMATAI’ve only ever done one thing on stage, in the 25 years of my career. As much as I loved it, it was quite stressful. My real love is making films and television. If you want me to be a Shakespearean character in a film, then yeah, I’d definitely do that.Does Simon Pegg still have you chained up in his shed?GarryiYes.

Cries of “bravo”, “brava” and “bravi” have become a celebrated part of the tradition, with shouted approval seen as evidence of connoisseurship.Booing, too, has a long history, and asa brave stand-inat the Royal Opera House found out on Tuesday night, its impact may sometimes seem a little blunter.The incident unfolded during a performance of Puccini’s Turandot when the tenor Roberto Alagna, singing Prince Calàf, fell ill after the second act and was forced to withdraw.The company’s head of music, Richard Hetherington, gamely sang from the wings while choreologist Tatiana Novaes Coelho performed the role on stage. But when the third act resumed without Nessun Dorma because of the aria’s technical difficulty, the decision drew boos from some audience members angered at missing one of opera’s most famous moments.Drama at the opera as Royal Opera chief steps in for sick tenorRead moreWhile that may have seemed harsh on the stand-in, the crowd’s displeasure does not appear to have been aimed at him personally. After Tuesday’s performance, one X user criticised the ROH for not having a replacement performer available to “deliver the version of Nessun Dorma they’ve been singing in the shower since puberty”. The RBO has said Calàf is not the type of role for which a cover typically stands by during every performance.Hetherington may also take comfort from booing’s long history in opera, although audiences in Britain are generally much more restrained than in Italy, said the opera historian Flora Willson.“Opera seems to provoke more vocal reactions than spoken theatre or musicals, but mostly booing is directed at opera singers, whose job it is to perform frankly astonishing athletic feats on a nightly basis,” she said.Willson compared the way audiences respond to opera singers to football. “But of course yelling and chanting in a football stadium doesn’t actually prevent a game from continuing in the way that a wave of booing can disrupt an unamplified musical performance,” she said.At Covent Garden, there were riots in 1809, when the theatre management raised the ticket prices, Willson said. There were also protests at several opera performances in 1840 because the star baritone of the day Antonio Tamburini hadn’t been hired for the season.In those days the theatre ran on a subscription system, so the audience felt a direct sense of ownership and right to complain when its preferences weren’t prioritised. Today, opera houses in the UK, including the ROH, are run on a different model.“Audience demographics have also changed hugely over the past two centuries,” Willson said. “In combination with broader shifts in audience behaviour in classical music – which saw audiences start to sit still and in silence throughout performances – opera audiences have generally become much, much less rowdy.”John Berry, the former artistic director of English National Opera and co-director ofScenario Two, said he had been in European theatres where the booing had started in the interval. “It’s a tradition in some theatres but uncommon in the UK,” he said.Traditionally, creative teams receive the brunt of the booing at a curtain call, Berry said, and some directors “are well prepared to put on their hard hats before they walk on to the stage”. But while a few isolated boos don’t affect the success of a show, Berry said he always found booing singers “distasteful”, especially when social media has given audiences the tools to vent their dissatisfaction.“Singers are human and sometimes they soldier on and sometimes their voice disappears completely within the hour,” he said. “Although very disappointing, these things happen – it’s a live performance, not a film, that’s what makes the whole experience of live theatre so powerful and unpredictable.”The former Guardian columnist and opera enthusiast Martin Kettle said sometimes booing “can reflect the booer’s passion” for how they want the opera to sound and look. “But it can be very boorish, and we live in an increasingly boorish culture. Social media is often aggressive and I suppose that translates into the opera house,” he said.Kettle witnessed a particularly cruel incident of booing at the ROH once, when a heckler shouted “rubbish” at a 12-year-old actor during a production of Handel’s opera Alcina. The heckler was drowned out by cheers from the rest of the audience (and banned for life from the venue). “It was just horrible,” he said. “It’s often an assertion of a reactionary and narrow view of what an opera ought to be like.”The opera critic Tim Ashley said pantomime-type booing particularly worried him, “where people boo a villainous or flawed character, irrespective of the quality of the performance. It can be unpleasant, and deeply unfair on the singers.”Ashleywitnessed this during a production of Madama Butterflyat the ROH a few years ago. When Marcelo Puente, playing Pinkerton, took his curtain call, he was greeted with boos, despite giving what Ashley called “one of the most complete and convincing portrayals of the role to be heard for some time”.For Willson, the events of Tuesday night represented “an operatic perfect storm”. Alagna is a big-name star in the operatic world, Turandot is a popular opera – often billed as a great first opera for those who want to give the art form a try – and Nessun Dorma is the best-known three minutes of music in the whole of opera.“For better or worse, that one hit aria will have been the main reason some audience members wanted to see Turandot – and the idea that it could suddenly be cut mid-performance may have seemed outrageous,” she said.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HouseLondonGiacomo PuccinifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Another country to tick off his list and he always feels a lot better about himself when he’s abroad. Less noise from his unhappy MPs. Plus he loved the pomp and ceremony that came with it. The large flags. The military bands. A country that treated him with respect. Almost. Besides, Mark Carney and Emmanuel Macron had both made recent trips. He had seen their holiday photos. Now it was his turn. He couldn’t bear to be left out.The Chinese? Not so much. They couldn’t really see the point. But they would schedule in a couple of meetings on the condition the UK government gave the green light to the new “mega embassy” near the Tower of London. Consider it done, said Keir. All systems go for the first prime-ministerial visit since Theresa May in 2018.Chinese state media views Starmer’s visit as act of economic pragmatismRead moreThere were a few more conditions.Xi Jinpinghad made it clear there would be a joint press conference with himself and Starmer. Xi doesn’t take well to answering hostile questions from the media. Instead there would be a joint statement in which they mouthed mostly bland platitudes. A way of filling dead air. Keir had quickly agreed. Any opportunity to prevent a possible diplomatic incident was fine by him. He would handle the British media in his own way. Taking a long time to say not very much. Words that would die within milliseconds of broadcast. As though his entire plan for the trip had been to get as little TV coverage as possible. An unusual strategy. But the only one that made any real sense.The meeting between Starmer and Xi had been scheduled to last 40 minutes. Hardly worth a four-day trip with a large trade delegation, you’d have thought. Maybe the two leaders really didn’t have anything much to say to each other. Certainly not for public consumption at a bilateral meeting in Beijing. Or maybe it was all a bluff. Shoot low and when the meeting runs to double the estimated time, both sides can claim it as a sign of how well they were getting on. Or maybe the simultaneous translation failed and the two leaders had to get the other’s sentences repeated back in their own language.Then the end-of-summit statements. For Keir this was everything he had dreamed of. Sitting at the same table as a previously hostile superpower. Though obviously he wasn’t going to do more than allude to any potential differences. That generally wasn’t seen as a great idea on a first date. What Britain needed withChinawas a “sophisticated” relationship.View image in fullscreenThis was everything Keir had dreamed of ... though obviously he wasn’t going to do more than allude to any potential differences.Photograph: Carl Court/ReutersMmm. Are you sure about that, Keir? A sophisticated relationship is one in which either one or both of a middle-class or celebrity couple are routinely unfaithful to one another but stay together for the sake of convenience and appearances. Was that what Keir meant? Did he want to sign off some deal that was worth more to China than it was to Britain? While turning a blind eye to China funding and providing weapons to some of the world’s rogue states. Actually, yes. That was what he meant. Any relationship was better than none.Xi used his opportunity to bestow a little largesse. The Labour party had shown great wisdom in its efforts to improve relations. The last few years had done neither country any favour. Here Xi took a swipe at Kemi Badenoch for trying to inflame hostilities at every opportunity. Keir might have suggested to the Chinese that they shouldn’t take this too personally. Kemi was a one woman piece of liability-driven performance art. Just the previous day she had first said she wanted to see the back of her rightwing drama queens before telling the centrists they also were no longer welcome. She won’t be happy until the Tory party is hers alone. Along with human tick Chris Philp.There would be new opportunities opening, Xi went on to say. Though he wasn’t at all clear what they might be. But let a hundred flowers bloom and all that. There had been twists and turns that had been in neither country’s interests. Now was the time to put those differences aside. Well, some of them. Let’s be grown up. Of course China was spying on the UK. Just as the UK was spying on China. It was hardly Xi’s fault if his spies were more effective than ours. “Range far your eye over long distances,” Xi concluded, quoting a Chinese proverb. Maybe he knows more about Keir’s long-term prospects than we did.Later in the day, Starmer chose to give a number of interviews to British reporters. While they all appreciated the good vibes, could Keir talk through some of the tangible gains he had made? Er, top secret, but Chinese companies would no longer supply outboard motors to people smugglers. Not directly at any rate. Who knew what happened on secondary markets. The smuggling gangs must now be in a right panic.And Brits would now get visa free access to China for 30 days. Just like Germany and France. This was a huge win, said Keir. There were other deals potentially in the offing in the future. It felt very much as if the Chinese were all out to sell to us. Rather than buy. I hope our trade delegation aren’t too disappointed about that.Moving on. Had Starmer mentioned the British Hong Kong dissidentJimmy Lai? And all those MPs who had been sanctioned by the Chinese state? Yes, I did, said Keir. But very quietly. More of a mumble, really. Probably when Xi needed to take a toilet break. Still, someone on the Chinese delegation had said the prime minister’s comments had been noted. But they would be making no plans to activate any changes any time soon. Don’t watch this space.Finally the news we had all been waiting for. Starmer might not have been able to restrain himself from offering the Chinese a return state visit to the UK. Maybe not in so many words. But definitely some heavy hints. He just couldn’t help himself. He had known the previous year that it had been a mistake to offer Donald Trump a state visit on their first meeting. He had tried to play it cool. Not give away the one bargaining chip he had. The only thing Trump wanted from the UK. Other than flattery. Now he had done it again. If only he was better at deferred gratification.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe politics sketchXi JinpingChinaForeign policyTrade policyAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

Yes,we’ve had David’s aphorisms at Davos;Romeo on the Willy Chavarria catwalk;Cruz on tour;Victoria’s reunion– not to mention the various fulsome Instagram posts from both parties. But no rebuttal, no apologies, no tears. Then, the remaining Beckhams hit Paris fashion week and finally we got our first statement.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.David Beckham – once the most famous footballer in the world, now its most famous parent – was in town to wingmanVictoria Beckhamas she became a knight of the Order of Arts and Letters. But he was also there for the optics. The remaining kids flew in. So did their partners. Some wore Victoria Beckham, others wore Loewe, everyone looked demure and sober and matchy-matchy, what a celebrity astrologist might call “a united front”.But it was David, walking into La Réserve Paris on Monday – a hotel so fancy it has more suites than rooms – that finally shifted the discourse. He was carrying a ludicrously capacious tan canvas Hermès Haut à Courroie bag (rarer than a Birkin if you can fathom that) and wearing a Momotaro jacket made from indigo-dyed sashiko dobby fabric. Forget the five-figure handbag – sashiko is a form of decorative reinforcement, or “visible mending”, from Japan. It also translates as “little stabs”. Oh, Brooklyn, what have you done?Even for someone as gifted at manipulating the media landscape as King Beckham, this reading is, admittedly, a bit of a reach. Was he sending a vestiary message to his estranged son or was he wearing something comfy on the Eurostar? Is David aware of sashiko – has he even read Sophocles’ play Oedipus Rex? Are the family tabloid fodder or arch-manipulators of it?“[The jacket] could be deliberate”, says Andy Milligan, brand consultant and author of Brand It Like Beckham. “He’s surrounded by the right people. And for all brands, how you appear – your costume, your demeanour, the way you comport yourself – is critically important. Whether the semiotics are overt or covert.”David Beckham is not some courtier trapped by the rigid social mores of the palace – a silenced beauty there to be gazed at. But he also kind of is. He is part of a brand for whom intense scrutiny has never been incidental and who understand that, in this age of AI, social media and fungible truths, image is everything. Put simply, is this David’s clapback costume?View image in fullscreenMaking a statement … Chiara Ferragni at the Schiaparelli show in a leather power suit.Photograph: Abdul Saboor/ReutersThe clapback costume is Lily Allen dressing up as the French schoolgirl Madeline in reference to her song of the same name, which she wrote after discovering the identity of one of her ex-husband’s lovers. It’s Bella Hadid wearing an outrageous string bikini the same day as breaking up with her boyfriend. It’s influencer Chiara Ferragni, freshly acquitted this month after facing fraud charges linked to her 2022 charity collaboration for selling branded pandoro, attending a Schiaparelli show wearing a girlboss leather suit.It is, of course,Diana, Princess of Wales, whose famous shirred black dress, worn to a gala in 1994 shortly after her husband confessed his affair to the BBC, coined the term “revenge dress”. “Images have always had more power than words, long before social media,” says Jacki Vause, CEO of Dimoso PR and co-presenter of the podcast The Rest Is PR. “And what is more powerful for a family we associate with fashion than what they wear? In crisis management, we always tell people to pay more attention to how they are than what they say,” she says. “[In this situation], the written word is very low down the list.” With Beckham and the like, it’s less about getting revenge and more about saying something, anything. Because where words fail, clothes do not.View image in fullscreenRevenge dressing … Diana at London’s Serpentine Gallery in her famous frock.Photograph: Princess Diana Archive/GettyFor context: it’s been a week sinceBrooklyn Beckham, heir apparently not of the Beckham family, wrote on social media about his upbringing. “I have been silent for years and have made every attempt to keep these matters private,” he began. “I do not want to reconcile with my family. I’m not being controlled, I’m standing up for myself for the first time in my life.” He went on to describe how his mother danced “very inappropriately on me in front of everyone” at his 2022 wedding to Nicola Peltz, and trademarked his name in 2016, restricting his ability to strike deals. The rest of the family was collateral, but seems to have picked their side. It’s hard to pity a nepo baby brand – but harder to side with the people who struck the initial deal.This is particularly true in a landscape in which crisis management is a 360-operation, says Vause, adding that the Beckhams “warmed to the idea of using digital media for branding purposes earlier than most”.“Fashion has been used to shape the conversation around David since he was a footballer,” agrees Milligan, pointing to the hair, the sarongs, the leather jackets. “It’s all about keeping the brand in the conversation.”View image in fullscreenModern and pointed … Wallis Simpson dressing with intent.Photograph: Granger/Rex/ShutterstockRoyals – Diana, Meghan, the late Queen, in her post Brexitnot-EU-flag hat– are a prime example. Vause points towards Wallis Simpson, the American divorcée whose relationship with Edward VIII led to his abdication, as inspiration: “[She] always cocked a snoot at the royals by dressing in a particularly modern and classy way, without saying a word.” The fame-fashion relationship is an open secret, and this forensic approach to character management often comes down to what these people – ostensibly brands – wear. As a family who built their business on fame, “this naturally involves having fans who look at you”.We live in a visual age, and without pictures, there is no story – before words are read, judgments are made. Clothes have not replaced the written word, but they are, like it or not, a valid communication tool for anyone in the public eye, as important as they are immediate to parse.

It is the UK branch of an Iranian software corporation, Towse’e Saman Information Technology (TSIT).The company makes popular computer games, a payment platform capable of helping Iranians skirt sanctions, and Gap Messenger, a sleek purple messaging app billed as an Iranian alternative to Telegram.But whileGap’s public profilesays the app is encrypted and does not share its data with third parties, Iranian digital rights experts say their investigations contradict those claims.A report fromFilterWatch, an organisation monitoring Iran’s internet censorship, has accused Gap Messenger of being among the “main actors and entities that participate in the Iranian government’s internet control and suppression efforts”.Mahdi Anjidani, TSIT’s chief executive, has alsowidelyespousedpro-regime viewsin Iranian media – including pushing for draconian censorship measures on a broadcast by state television.View image in fullscreenIn an interview with an Iranian tech publication, Mahdi Anjidani praised Iran’s elites for overcoming international sanctions by ‘turning threat into an opportunity’.Photograph: LinkedInA report from an Iranian independent newspaper suggests that one of his businesses, a social network called Virasty, has a government partner in the form of the former Iranian deputy communications minister Amir Mohammadzadeh Lajevardi. Anjidani has also posted a picture to Facebook appearing to show himself and the former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Gap and Anjidani’s other platforms are a part ofIran’s domestic internet, a parallel network inside the country. Developed over the course of a decade, this national internet offers a skeletal, government-controlled option for connectivity to 93 million people who are otherwise almost completely cut off from the outside world.The national internet is a tool designed to enable the longer-term survival of a regime that has killedpossibly tens of thousandsof people in the past weeks as part of a crackdown on escalating anti-government protests.That crackdown has been accompanied by one of the most severeinternet shutdownsin history,a precise, fine-tuned blackoutintended, say experts, to cut off Iranians while allowing their government to continue to function and make money.A feature of the national internet is domestic messaging apps, which Iranian authorities haveenergetically promotedover the past years, and which include Gap. Several separate Iranian digital rights experts said the point of these apps was to shepherd users on to platforms the regime could monitor.“The overall point is control. Local platforms make it easier to monitor conversations, collect data, and silence dissidents, without the legal and technical barriers that exist for global services,” said a researcher at Outline Foundation, an anti-censorship organisation. “This isn’t about boosting local innovation. It’s about consolidating surveillance and shrinking the space for independent expression.”Gap boasts more than 1m downloads on Google’s Play store, and4m moreon Cafe Bazaar, an Iranian app store. It offers a built-in payment service, as well as games, online calls and animal-themed stickers.FilterWatch’s report concluded that Gap Messenger appeared to have at least once handed over information on its users to Iranian censorship authorities, according to emails leaked from the attorney general’s office in late 2022.Neither Mahdi nor Hadi Anjidani responded to emails from the Guardian. When a reporter knocked on the door of theBrightonhome address where TS Information Technology was first registered, Hadi briefly opened the door, then shut it without a word. A neighbour said the family was reclusive, and rarely interacted with the rest of the neighbourhood.At the BizSpace workspace in nearby Hove, where TS Information Technology keeps an office, a receptionist said Hadi Anjidani had used the space for at least 13 years, but came in only for appointments. A phone call to this office went unanswered.Mahdi Anjidani’s Facebook page shows a picture of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with imagery from TSIT’s Kings Era game.Photograph: FacebookIn Iran, Mahdi Anjidani has been featured on apodcastand profiled as an up-and-coming techentrepreneur. His Facebook account highlights high-profile meetings: with the son ofDubai’s Sheikh Makhtoum, as well as with Ahmadinejad, who in one picture appears to be standing next to a tabledisplayingAnjidani’s game Kings Era.In an interview with an Iranian tech publication, Mahdi Anjidani described himself as a “child of the Islamic Revolution” and praised Iran’s elites for overcoming international sanctions by “turning threat into an opportunity” and meeting the country’s software needs.In anotherinterview, with an Iranian startup accelerator, Anjidani appeared to field questions about getting around sanctions on Iran, government support for his app, and his “satellite offices” in England, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.On a 2024 broadcast by Iranian state media, he inveighed against foreign-owned messaging apps and VPNs – tools that allow Iranians to circumvent surveillance – and appeared to suggest ways the government could crack down on these.Anjidani was “reiterating the threats of the government, which shows how close he is to the government”, said an Iranian researcher who asked not to be named, fearing reprisals.While the ongoing internet shutdown means Iranian corporate records are largely unavailable, Gap Messenger is not the whole extent of Hadi and Mahdi Anjidani’s business. Archived versions of their site and public information connect them to an array of companies, including an Iranian social network, an SMS-based advertising service, and MihanPayment, a platform thatintegrates withthe Iranian banking system to allow Iranians to perform international transactions.Another Iranian digital rights researcher said the privileges of creating and operating domestic platforms such as these in Iran were reserved for a few: “Anyone who is allowed to have a messaging app in the country – you’re talking about the level of oligarchs around Putin.”Explore more on these topicsData protectionCensorshipWest SussexIranAppsBrightonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

While this matter is looked into, I feel it is my noble duty not to allow my chains of office to be put through a process.”Tamworth council described Harris as a “rogue landlord” and said he – as well as the management agent Touchstone – had ignored repeated warnings about the “dangerous conditions” at the properties.The council found the properties had no heating or access to hot water, no working fire alarms, inadequate cooking facilities and unsafe access to outdoor areas.“The six-bedroom properties, which housed multiple tenants, failed to meet even the most basic of living standards and legal requirements,” Tamworth said.View image in fullscreenHarris says he takes ‘full responsibility’ for the condition of the homes.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe news will be embarrassing for Reform UK as its candidate in the Gorton and Denton byelection in Greater Manchester, Matt Goodwin, declared tackling HMOs would be one of his priorities. Lee Anderson MP, the party’s chief whip, has previously raised concerns to the government about the “sharp increase in the number of HMOs, many of which are poorly managed”.The Reform leader of the council, George Finch, acknowledged the resignation and thanked Harris for his service as chair. “It would be inappropriate to comment on the details while the proper process is ongoing, and I would urge others not to speculate,” he said.A 75-year-old, who did not want to be named, who lives on the same street as Harris’s HMOs, said both properties had “gradually fell into disrepair” and Harris “just simply refused to do anything about them”.“What we hadn’t realised was quite what the state of the houses inside was and the pitiful state that residents were [in],” she said.View image in fullscreenThe council issued emergency prohibition notices on the properties.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianAnother resident, 73, said she had spoken to someone living at the one of the properties who said that they had not had hot water for two years. “I said: ‘Well, how do you manage?’ He said: ‘We boil kettles and there’s an electric shower.’”She described her surprise to discover the landlord was a Reform party chair atWarwickshirecouncil. “Somebody like that is of high standing,” she said. “We asked him to sort out the problem, he totally ignored us.”Ben Clarke at Tamworth council said the state of the properties left the local authority with “no choice but to act” and issue two emergency prohibition notices.The residents had been offered support and advice, the council said, adding that it was considering further enforcement action in relation to the properties owned by Harris.Touchstone has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsWarwickshireReform UKStaffordshireRenting propertyHousingEnglandLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

It involved 100,000 women in Sweden who were part of mammography screening and were randomly assigned to either AI-supported screening or to a standard reading by two radiologists between April 2021 and December 2022.The AI system worked by analysing the mammograms and assigning low-risk cases to a single reading and high-risk cases to a double one by radiologists, as well as highlighting suspicious findings to support radiologists.Mammography screening supported by AI reduced cancer diagnoses in the years after a breast screening appointment by 12%, according to the research, published in The Lancet. There were 1.55 cancers per 1,000 women in the AI-supported group compared with 1.76 cancers per 1,000 women in the control group.More than four in five cancer cases (81%) in the AI-supported mammography group were detected at the screening stage, compared with just under three quarters (74%) in the control group, and there were also almost a third (27%) fewer aggressive sub-type cancers in the AI group compared with the control.Dr Kristina Lång, from Lund University in Sweden and the lead author of the study, said that AI-supported mammography could help detect cancers at an early stage, but that there were caveats.“Widely rolling out AI-supported mammography in breast cancer screening programmes could help reduce workload pressures among radiologists, as well as helping to detect more cancers at an early stage, including those with aggressive subtypes,” Lång said.“However, introducing AI in healthcare must be done cautiously, using tested AI tools and with continuous monitoring in place to ensure we have good data on how AI influences different regional and national screening programmes and how that might vary over time.”Breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women aged 35 to 50, with more than 2 million people globally diagnosed with the disease each year.Although the study showed the apparent benefits AI could bring to mammography screening, the researchers do not support replacing healthcare professionals with AI, as screening still requires at least one human radiologist to perform the reading with AI support.Dr Sowmiya Moorthie, a senior strategic evidence manager atCancerResearch UK, said the findings were promising but urged caution.“Using AI to assist in reading mammograms can be more efficient, but there’s a concern that it can lead to missing some cancers. This study helps to address concerns, but the results are from a single centre, so more research will be needed to know for sure if this will help save lives,” Moorthie said.She added: “With a growing number of people expected to be diagnosed with cancer in the years ahead, innovations like this will be vital to improving the NHS, but it’s important that they are properly evaluated to ensure people affected by cancer are helped rather than harmed.”Simon Vincent, the chief scientific officer at Breast Cancer Now, said: “This first trial underlines the huge potential of AI to support radiologists in breast cancer screening. Screening is a vital tool for early detection, and the sooner the disease is found, the better chance of successful treatment.“This study shows real promise for earlier diagnosis that could improve and save lives, which is why trials launched last year in the UK exploring the use of AI within the NHS breast screening system will be important in determining the safest and most effective way to use these tools to find more cancers early.”Explore more on these topicsCancer researchAI (artificial intelligence)Breast cancerMedical researchCancerHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s actually comforting knowing that I’ve got two brothers on the other side,” Joshua said. “I’ve lost people before, but I don’t think I’ve lost people like that, my left and my right.“Throughout this journey I have been on, it’s not easy and I didn’t even realise that [yeah], I’m the big guy … but I was walking with giants man that kept me protected, kept me shielded, but I understand my duty. I understand what they wanted to do for their families so what my goal is, is to continue to help them achieve their goals.“I know in my corner of the world, I know what I’ll be doing. I know what we’ll be doing to continue … I don’t want to say their legacy, because I had a lot of those questions about legacy during my fight in Miami.“It ain’t about legacy, it’s just about doing what is right and I know I am going to do what is right by them.

It has risen by more than a quarter this month and hit a new high of just under $5,595 (£4,060) an ounce on Thursday.It dropped sharply later in the day to $5,250 (£3,810) as speculation swirled about possible US action in Iran, but that remains almost double the price as when Donald Trump’s second term in the White House began a year ago.Silver, meanwhile, was trading below $30 (£22) an ounce when the president prepared to announce his “liberation day” tariffs last April, but has since almost quadrupled in price, to more than $118 (£86) an ounce, with the most rapid run-up coming in the past month.Giuseppe Sersale, a strategist at Italy’s Anthilia, said the market had “all the hallmarks of a mania”, describing recent price moves as “parabolic”.So what’s driving the rush?Goldhas always been the ultimate “safe haven”asset, acting as a store of value in the face of inflation risks or broader economic and geopolitical uncertainty, all of which Trump has provided in spades.The administration’s aggressive policies – including punitive tariffs on trading partners, threats to annex or bomb other countries such as Greenland and Iran and increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to make it cut interest rates, includinglaunching a criminal caseagainst the central bank’s chair, Jerome Powell – have sent investors scurrying for the precious metal.Trump resumed his onslaught on Powell after the Fed’slatest decision to hold rates on Wednesday, posting on social media: “Even this moron admits that inflation is no longer a problem.” However, analysts warn tampering with the Fed’s independencerisks further stoking price rises.Daniela Hathorn, a senior market analyst at Capital.com, summed the situation up: “Gold and silver are reflecting more than short-term market stress; they are signalling a re-pricing of trust. Trust in currencies, in institutions, and in the stability of the post-cold war economic order.”The idea here is that even if US inflation were to get out of control, undermining the value of the dollar (an idea known as “debasement”), gold would hold its value. However, the same argument applies to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which have not been subject to the same buying spree as precious metals.What else is going on?As the World Gold Council (WGC) pointed out in its quarterly data release this week, another driver has beencentral banks adding to their reserves. This trend appears to represent a modest diversification away from the standard reserve asset of treasuries, as US government bonds are known, as Trump’s chaotic approach raises anxiety about the idea of holding billions of dollars in IOUs from Washington.However, WGC’s analysis also showed that while “central bank buying remained a prominent and additive factor” to global demand, such purchases were actually 21% lower in 2025 than a year earlier, at 863 tonnes.Instead, as in many booms and bubbles, a significant part of the recent uptick appears to represent retail investors – either buying into the “safe haven” trade amid catastrophic headlines or just seeing the price spike and piling in.Louise Street, a senior market analyst at WGC, said that last year “consumers and investors alike bought and held gold in an environment where economic and geopolitical risks have become the new normal”, adding: “Investment demand stole the show as investors raced to access gold through all available routes.”In the UK, the Royal Mint website urges retail consumers to “take the first step towards fortifying your financial future with the timeless allure of gold”.The silver price appears to have been caught up in the same speculative frenzy as gold in recent weeks – perhaps because its lower price makes it more approachable as an asset class.What about the dollar?Concerns about Fed independence and the broader stability of US policymaking are not just fuelling precious metals, but also seem to have been putting downward pressure on the dollar, whichhas been on the slide in the past week or so.The euro broke through $1.20 (£0.90) on Tuesday before falling back modestly, while £1 was worth $1.38 on Thursday, up almost five cents in a fortnight. As Eszter Gárgyán of UniCredit put it in a research note: “The dollar has come under renewed depreciation pressure since mid-January, as geopolitical risks, rising trade tensions and concerns regarding Fed independence have resurfaced.”The Trump administration has sometimes seemed conflicted about whether it wants to see a weaker dollar – to aid the president’s endeavour of narrowing the trade deficit – or a stronger currency, as a symbol of economic power. The greenback fell to a four-year low against a basket of other currencies on Wednesday, after the president shrugged off the currency’s weakness, saying: “No, I think it’s great.”But his Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, asked later about rumours there could be coordinated central bank action to prop up the wobbling Japanese yen, insisted: “We don’t comment, other than to say we have a strong dollar policy.”Rapid market moves in Japan, with government bond yields up sharply as investors bet on a spending splurge after theupcoming snap election, are complicating the picture.If investors are cooling on the US, why haven’t share prices tanked?Far from tanking,US stocks have performed strongly over the past 12 months, driven disproportionately by the “magnificent seven” tech companies, whose revenues have been soaring on the back of the AI boom. Including dividends, the S&P 500 was up 17.9% in 2025.While many analysts, and a fair few tech bosses, fret that current elevated share pricesmay be a bubble, investors appear to believe that, as Chuck Prince, then chief executive of ill-fated bank Citigroup put it back in 2007, “as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance”.And they are likely to have been buoyed up by hopes of fresh interest rate cuts in the coming months, if US inflation remains under control.Similarly, unlike a year ago when there was a brief sell-off in treasuries, the “sell America” narrative does not seem to have extended to bond markets – yet.Explore more on these topicsGoldInvestingSilverCommoditiesCurrenciesStock marketsDonald TrumpexplainersShareReuse this content"

It may be that in the next 50 years, perhaps in the next 20, some homes around here will have to be abandoned.”Stanton spoke to the Guardian atNorthmoor pumping stationnear Bridgwater as six giant temporary pumps fired six tons of flood water a second off the saturated moors into the River Parrett.View image in fullscreen‘Intense rainfall is hitting us more often,’ said Mike Stanton, the chair of the Somerset Rivers Authority.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianThe emergency pumps had been craned into position to back up the permanent ones afterStorm Chandra, in a desperate attempt to stop homes in nearby villages such as Moorland and Fordgate from flooding.The two communities hit the headlines around the world whenthey were inundated in 2014. Millions of pounds was invested in trying to keep water at bay, but by mid-afternoon on Thursday the level at a nearby monitoring point was at 7.76 metres (nearly 25ft 6in). Flooding of property is possible when it goes above 6.6 metres.With yet anothersevere Met Office weather warningfor rain in force on Thursday afternoon and evening, the fear was growing that water would once again reach homes.View image in fullscreenDiggers move earth to protect a home near Moorland.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianJulian Taylor, who lives in Fordgate, had moved many of his belongings upstairs. “I suspect we’re going to have to evacuate,” he said. “The water is advancing even faster than in 2014. I don’t know where we’ll go. We’ve been pressing them for weeks to get more pumps in.”On the edge of Moorland, the Notaro family, who are well-known local builders, were busy moving earth and bringing in stone to build a bund – an embankment – around their home. They did the same in 2014 to keep the water away.The Moorland village hall was turned into something of an emergency meeting point. AnEnvironment Agency(EA) incident command unit and a mobile police station were parked outside.View image in fullscreenLocal people in Moorland have praised individual Environment Agency staff and their efforts.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianThroughout the day on Thursday villagers visited, spoke to EA staff and comforted one another. Some were in tears. “I’ve stopped looking at the media and at the EA readings on the website,” said one Moorland resident, who asked not to be named. “It’s just too stressful for me. I’m just keeping my head down and hoping.”Local people praise the individual EA staff who work the pumps trying to keep their homes clear of water. They are also grateful that the Parrett is being cleared of silt – on Thursday, a small Dutch dredger was engaged in a routine chug up and down the river. But they criticise the body’s chief and the UK government for not doing more.View image in fullscreenA dredger clearing the River Parret of silt.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianTheFloodingon the Levels Action Group (Flag) warned on Thursday that residents faced another “catastrophic” flood. It accused the EA of not being “agile” enough as Chandra headed towards the south-west of England, arguing the temporary pumps should have been moved in sooner.The group also called for Northmoor pumping station to be upgraded so it was not necessary to bring in extra pumps every time there was a serious storm.Jim Flory, the EA environment manager for Wessex, denied the reaction had been slow. “We think that our response has been ahead of the curve,” he said. Additional pumps had been put in even before agreed “trigger points” for them had been reached.Three storms –Goretti, Ingrid and now Chandra – have battered the south-west of England this year. Extreme rainfall is becoming more common and more intense in many parts of the world because of human-caused climate breakdown.View image in fullscreenSome Moorland residents fear they will have to evacuate.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianFlory said parts of south-westEnglandwere seeing record-breaking rainfall. At a rain gauge in nearby Taunton last week, the wettest seven-day period (20-26 January) was recorded for at least 30 years. The catchment area for the Parrett and Tone rivers has received 207% of the long-term average January rainfall.‘Like a sea out there’: flooded Somerset residents wonder how water can be managedRead moreThe EA and UK government say many millions has been invested into raising roads, improving drainage and boosting pumping capacity.The floods minister, Emma Hardy, said: “Flooding is devastating and my thoughts are with the people affected. I am in regular contact with the Environment Agency on their response to the ongoing flooding who, alongside local authorities and the emergency services, are already taking action to keep communities safe. I urge residents to follow local advice over the next few days to ensure they stay safe.”Explore more on these topicsSomersetFloodingUK weatherEnvironment AgencyEnglandExtreme weatherClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what you need to know to navigate the trollingSteve RoseThu 29 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 15.07 ESTShareIt started with an image of Trump as a king mocked up on a fake Time magazine cover. Since then it’s developed into a full-blown phenomenon, one academics are calling “slopaganda” – an unholy alliance of easily available AI tools and political messaging. “Shitposting”, the publishing of deliberately crude, offensive content online to provoke a reaction, has reached the level of “institutional shitposting”, according to Know Your Meme’s editor Don Caldwell. This is trolling as official government communication. And nobody is more skilled at it than the Trump administration – a government that has not only allowed the AI industry all the regulative freedom it desires, but has embraced the technology for its own in-house purposes. Here are 10 of the most significant fake images the White House has put out so far.Trump as king19 February 2025View image in fullscreenDonald Trump as king in a fake Time magazine cover.Illustration: @WhiteHouseThe first AI image posted by the White House X account sets the tone for Trump’s second presidency – marking a turning point in which the shitposting that had been associated with the far-right online culture that brought Trump to power moved from fringe message boards, such as 4chan and Reddit, to mainstream platforms.The image was posted alongside an announcement of the repeal of New York City’s congestion pricing, and leant into fears that Trump would govern as a king. The New York governor, Kathy Hochul,held up the imageat a press conference when she announced that she would defy attempts to block the congestion charge: “New York hasn’t laboured under a king in over 250 years. We sure as hell are not going to start now.” The congestion charge remains in effect.In another post onTruth Socialin October, the president posted an AI video depicting himself as a president-king, crown on head, flying over “No Kings” protesters in a jet fighter and dumping faeces on them. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, defended the post, saying: “The president uses social media to make a point. You can argue that he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media for that. He is using satire to make a point.”Studio Ghibli meme of a woman being deported27 March 2025View image in fullscreenIllustration: @WhiteHouseOpenAI’s Studio Ghibli-inspired meme generator became asensation in March2025, with its uncanny ability to translate any image into the beloved anime studio’s house style (without Studio Ghibli’s permission or approval).The White House applied it to a woman in tears as she was arrested by Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents before being deported. The original photograph, and the woman’s name and alleged crimes, are also included in the post.For Caldwell, this demonstrated just how up to date the White House is with online trends. “They’re hopping on brand-new, fresh memes,” he says. He suspects White House staffers might be regular visitors to Know Your Meme. “The Studio Ghibli meme trend kicked off on March 25 on X; we covered it the following day; and then the White House covered it the day after that.”Trump as Pope3 May 2025View image in fullscreenIllustration: @realDonaldTrumpThis image is proof of Trump’s willingness and ability to insert himself into any conversation, even ones that have nothing to do with him, and shows how effective that can be.Predictably, the image went viral, made global headlines and wasmet with outragefrom Catholic groups and politicians. “There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,” wrote the New York State Catholic Conference. “We just buried our belovedPope Francisand the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.”As so often happens with such shitposting, those who ​took offence were accused of lacking a sense of humour. “They can’t take a joke?” Trump said soon after at a press conference. “You don’t mean the Catholics, you mean the fake news media … the Catholics loved it.”Trump as Jedi4 May 2025View image in fullscreenIllustration: @WhiteHouse/XTrump has been the subject of flattering fan art throughout his political career (remember the digitalTrump trading cards?), but AI has made the job a whole lot easier. On 4 May, the White House crashed Star Wars fans’ special day with this image of the president as a jacked Jedi, lightsaber in hand, garlanded by flags and eagles. Who cares if his lightsaber is the wrong colour (the good guys’ are blue), or that the White House’s claim to be the Rebellion not the Empire rang laughably hollow? This was pure fantasy art.In 2022, one of Trump’s trading cards clumsily grafted his headshot on to a superhero body; last July he was slightly less clumsily grafted on to the body ofSuperman, to gatecrash the launch of the new movie. The same month, the White House portrayed a besuited Trump heroicallystriding into the Colosseum. Fans and allies have generated reams of similar content themselves.Hakeem Jeffries as a Mexican29 October 2025View image in fullscreenIllustration: @WhiteHouseWhy did the White House choose to put the Democratic house leader Hakeem Jeffries and the senate leader Chuck Schumer in sombreros and have them holding plates of tacos? It doesn’t matter. They look a bit silly, and it’s provocatively offensive, and once again, the world’s attention is colonised.The image illustrates how difficult it is to respond to this type of content. It’s part of a running joke, stretching back to a deepfake video Trump posted a month earlier, which slapped a crude sombrero and moustache filter over Jeffries. That video was roundly condemned as offensive and racist , not least by Jeffries himself (who replied by posting a genuine image of Trump with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein) . TheTrump administrationthen doubled down, playing the video on a loop on screens in the White House briefing room for several hours and creating more images in a similar vein, which kept the trolling going.Welcome to the Golden Age1 January 2026View image in fullscreenIllustration: @WhiteHouseFew people outside the Trump administration believe the US is in a “golden age”, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeating the claim. In January, the White Houseposted an AI videoof a golden White House facade behind a shower of gold coins with the text “The White House? She’s in her Golden Age”, backed by Bruno Mars’ track 24K Magic.Even if Trump’s Midas touch is more a figment of his imagination, this type of wishcasting is more effective than it appears. According toone paperby the academics Michał Klincewicz, Mark Alfano and Amir Ebrahimi Fard – who coined the term “slopaganda” – “neural representations of information that were shown to be false continue to influence people’s beliefs and reasoning after being corrected”. In other words, even when you know it’s fake, your brain still kind of believes it.Which Way, Greenland Man?14 January2026View image in fullscreenPhotograph: @WhiteHouseOn the face of it, this seems like a straightforward “Trump wants Greenland” post. However, it has a much darker message.Again, the post is riffing on a popular meme, Caldwell explains: the “dramatic crossroads” image originated with the manga series Yu-Gi-Oh!, and started gaining traction online around 2021.The slogan “Which way, Greenland man?” seems to reference a 1978 neo-Nazi text titled Which Way, Western Man?, in which the white supremacist author William Gayley Simpson called for violence against and the deportation of Jews and Black people, and argued that Hitler was right.“It’s absolutely shocking to see such images being deployed by this administration,”said Heidi Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, which monitors US neo-Nazi groups. “The idea appeals to racists and white supremacists who think only white people should be in positions of power.”In August, the Department of Homeland Securityposteda mock recruitment advert for ICE with an image of Uncle Sam at a crossroads and the slogan: “Which way, American man?” Earlier this month, the US Labor Department posted an image with the slogan: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage”. Critics pointed out that it had overtones of Hitler’s “Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer” (“One people, one realm, one leader”).Stand with ICE Propaganda poster15 January2026View image in fullscreenIllustration: @WhiteHouse“AI is very good at constantly reiterating images from the past, so it can create this nostalgic imagery of traditionalism,” says Daniel de Zeeuw, an assistant professor in digital media culture at the University of Amsterdam. Thus the extremist messages of the present – such as ICE’s militarised policing – can be inserted into more reassuring and familiar graphic styles, such as patriotic recruitment posters,80s action-movie postersor 1950s public information campaigns (as with arecent imageof Trump as a friendly milkman).AI is inherently backward-looking, says de Zeeuw, as it is fed on historical images. This aesthetic is in keeping with the Make America Great Again movement, which is constantly evoking a “better” past. Another stark example was the Department of Homeland Security’s chilling post from last December: an image of a vintage car at a deserted, palm-fringed beach with the slogan “America After 100 Million Deportations”. Ironically, the original was painted by a Japanese artist,Hiroshi Nagai, who complained that it had been used without his permission.The arrest of Nekima Levy Armstrong22 January 2026View image in fullscreenAn image of Nekima Levy Armstrong posted by Kristi Noem (left) and a manipulated image of her posted by the White House.Composite: Guardian Design/@Sec_Noem via X/@WhiteHouse via X“It’s not going to be on Twitter,” said the agent filming the Minneapolis civil rights lawyer Nekima Levy Armstrong, one of the city’smost prominent activists, as she was arrested last Thursday. Within hours, though, it was: the Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem posted a still from the video, in which Armstrong seems composed and shows little emotion.Half an hour later, the White House X account posted a significantly altered version of the same image: this time, Armstrong is exaggeratedly upset, tears streaming down her face. Her skin tone also appears to have been darkened. The image was captioned: “Arrested: far-left agitator Nekima Levy Armstrong for orchestrating church riots in Minnesota.” In fact, Armstrong was demonstrating at a church service led by an allegedly ICE-affiliated pastor, and was later released without charge.Until this moment, the White House’s AI-generated output had been conspicuously outlandish: there was little danger of mistaking it for reality. This image purports to be an authentic photograph – or at least omits to mention that it is not. It is not so much AI-generated trolling as an AI-assisted deepfake.As with Musk’s recently shared Grok tool, which removed women and children’s clothing without their consent, there is also something abusive about it: AI has been used to attempt to humiliate a woman by manipulating her image, to make her look weaker and more distressed than she actually was.The fact that the deepfakery is not all that convincing is part of the point, de Zeeuw thinks. “What is being communicated here is the falsification itself: you’re showing your ability to falsify images, to falsify evidence.”After the fakery had been called out, the White House deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr posted the response: “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.”The Nihilistic Penguin23 January 2026View image in fullscreenIllustration: @WhiteHouseIn response to this image of Trump and a penguin walking towards a Greenland flag, some observers pointed out that penguins actually live at the south pole. But that’s missing the point of these types of post, says Robert Topinka, a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London. “People continue to interpret them as if they’re meant to be a legitimate claim, or an argument or a piece of evidence, but they’re emotional hooks.” Their purpose is to stir up the base. “White House staffers have said they use AI because it’s the fastest way to get content out. It’s not the fastest way to say something that’s true; it’s the fastest way to push their propaganda.”To those in the know, this is a riff on the “nihilist penguin” meme, which has gone viral on TikTok in the past few weeks. It’s based on a scene from Werner Herzog’s 2007 documentary Encounters at the End of the World, in which one penguin inexplicably separates from the colony and wanders off towards the Antarctic interior, and certain death. “But why?” Herzog wonders. Many have asked the same of Trump’s quixotic attempts to acquire Greenland.The image resonates with what Naomi Klein and ​Astra Taylor ​christened “end times fascism”, says De Zeeuw, where tech industry leaders and their enablers are almost willing the end of the world as we know it, striding towards oblivion like Trump and his penguin companion. “It’s like they know they’re moving toward the end, but they do so joyfully.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpAI (artificial intelligence)Trump administrationUS politicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)featuresShareReuse this content"

But they surely seem to be: samurai armour is so vital, so electric, with its grimacing, moustached, black face masks and full-body metal and fabric plating. The crests of their helmets incorporate eagles, dragons, goblins, even a clenched fist of metal emerging from one warrior’s head. It’s so intense you feel a presence.View image in fullscreenMenace … a 17th century suit of armour with bullet-proof cuirass.Photograph: The Trustees of the British MuseumThen again, the samurai always were ghosts in their suits. The metal mask became their face to the world, their carapaces transformed them into someone else. This idea that in battle the warrior becomes other, a bloody demon, is not unique to Japan: Viking “berserkers” lost themselves in a ritualised frenzy and may have believed they changed into bears. Armour in medieval Europe, too, was never just practical but a second skin, a full metal jacket suppressing softness and symbolising the steely transfiguration of normal souls into killers. But no culture has ever put quite as much creativity into blood-lust as Japan did from the 13th century – when samurai courage saw off Mongol invaders – until the abolition of this class in the 1800s.One of these eerily inhabited cyborg armours has been lent by the Royal Collection. It was was a gift for James VI of Scotland and I of England by a son of the second shōgun of the Tokugawa dynasty – but a barbed gift. Opulently crafted from lacquer, silk, deerskin and metal, its surface pulses with menace and mystery. It sent a clear message to far-off Britain: mess with us at your peril.That was no idle threat. Painted screens, scrolls and books depict samurai armies in action. A rider in a samurai battle scene by Imamura Zuigaku Yoshitsugu is studded with arrows but they’ve lodged harmlessly in his thick armour. His unprotected horse, however, bleeds from an arrow wound near its heart. On the ground, a warrior lies in glorious armour that is no use to him now, for his head has been cut off. So that’s what those elegant blades with their sweeping curvature – displayed nearby – are for.View image in fullscreenMinamoto no Tametomo on the Isle of Demons, by Katsushika Hokusai.Photograph: The Trustees of the British MuseumThe British Museum’s exhibition, however, does not just honour the art of war but embraces love and peace. We meet the warlord with a song in his heart. In a 19th-century painting by Kano Eishun, a samurai literally takes time to smell the flowers as he rides among orange blossoms. And it was samurai nobles who were the most prestigious clients of early modern Edo’s pleasure quarter, the “floating world”. In a painting from Chōbunsai Eishi’s 1790s handscroll, Twelve Erotic Scenes in Edo, we see the silhouette of a samurai making love to a courtesan behind a screen while in the foreground two women caress the shiny blade of his long unsheathed sword.Maybe this perverse piece of shunga art goes to the heart of this exhibition’s appeal. Samurai warfare was violent yet theatrical, cruel but glamorous, lethal but sexy. Before a samurai blade sliced you up, their demonic appearance held you transfixed.You feel bereft when you reach the abolition of the samurai elite as Japan in the 1800s tried to modernise. Photographs of the last samurai seem to show the passing of something wondrous from the world. And when the 20th century released new horrors of mechanised mass warfare there was no place left for myth or chivalry. In the west and east, the rituals and costumed theatrics that were part of feudal societies were irrelevant, especially after the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.View image in fullscreenModern times … Duck and Man 2025, by Noguchi Tetsuya.Photograph: The Trustees of the British MuseumSo the exhibition’s finale is inevitably disappointing. You meet a lifesized Darth Vader, touted here as a modern-day samurai but for me not as scary or mysterious as the originals. More to the point is a display onYukio Mishima, as he is known to the west, whose novels explored the appeal of samurai violence and passion in a banal, commodified modern world, before he left it by committing seppuku, a traditional ritual of self-disembowelment.The samurai emerge here as so much more than killers: as patrons of the arts, sensitive to nature, masters of civilised ways. And yet I’d trade it all to see a samurai charge. The ghosts of dead warriors inside their empty suits dominate the show. There are many forms of artistry here but nothing is more expressive than these portraits in steel, silk and lacquer. It’s an extraordinary encounter. Samurai armour embodies a merciless truth about the human condition and what it can become.Samurai runs atthe British Museum, London, 3 February-4 MayExplore more on these topicsArtJapanBritish MuseumAsia PacificDesignExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Local law enforcement seized the computers, cell phones and reporting materials from all staff, as well as from the homes of one city council member and paper co-owner Eric Meyer, without incident – though they met the impassioned resistance of Meyer’s 98-year-old mother Joan, the paper’s other co-owner, who threw her walker to the ground and declared the raid “Nazi stuff”.Undertone review – disappointing podcast horror is mostly skippableRead more“This is illegal,” Eric Meyers warns the officers, as seen in a new documentary on the episode. “You’re going to be on national news tonight.”He was not wrong. Though the raid could seem small potatoes, Marion being a rural town of approximately 1,900 about 60 miles north of Wichita, it soon became international news – a symbol of press freedom under attack in a country whose president routinely declares media to be “the enemy of the people”. In national press, the story was quick, troubling and tragic, especially after it was revealed that Joan, “stressed beyond her limits” by the raid, died of a heart attack the next day. In Marion, however, the story was, as small town things tend to go, much more complex, idiosyncratic and gossipy, personal histories and resentments refracted under the spotlight.Seized, directed by Sharon Liese, manages the difficult task of bridging the two perspectives without jarring the viewer, allowing local characters to complicate the story without ever losing sight of its import. Filmed in and around Marion beginning a year after the incident, this clear-eyed doc mercifully rejects the impulse, so common in large outlets such as this one, to flatten a local saga into a tidy and politically expedient narrative (and I say that as a former small-town reporter firmly on the side of local news).The subjects, as presented in a brisk 94 minutes, are as colorful as any movie character, allowed room to demonstrate the contradictions that serve, as one resident puts it, as a “microcosm of America”. Liese is sharp-eyed on where political ideologies warp under close inspection and personal stakes. Some residents respect the paper’s willingness to criticize town leaders; some wish it would stop printing embarrassing police records of every single arrest. Some think Meyer, a proud and stubborn man, is a bully. A majority seem mostly upset that he cited children’s letters to Santa, an annual newspaper tradition, as evidence of the education gap post-Covid.Fascinating vox pop surveys aside, Seized offers the most thorough explanation yet of what led to the raid, which is equal parts sinister and amusingly petty. In short, and I will be simplifying because it is confusing and worth watching unfold in all its dishy glory: the paper, tipped off by a restaurateur’s ex-best friend that she was driving without a license, was accused of identity theft by said woman, who was also allegedly involved with the police chief, who initiated the raid. The former mayor is involved. A judge, somehow, signed off on it. It’s quintessentially, almost endearingly, small-town stuff, but Liese, recruiting severalKansasmetro reporters as talking heads, makes clear that none of this should ever have merited a search warrant.‘If you want to nuke your life, do crack’: raw Courtney Love documentary hits SundanceRead moreIn the current timeline, Meyer’s paper strives to keep on keeping on with but one veteran reporter (Phyllis Zorn, a delectably tart old-timer), an office manager (Cheri Bentz, who I wish I got to know more) and a cub reporter, Finn Hartnett, loaned from New York. Hartnett, a soft-spoken and endearingly affectless twentysomething, openly desperate for any job, serves as the outsider’s view both into the idiosyncrasies of Marion county and the work of hyperlocal reporting in 2025, with scant resources and formidable politics. His crash course in old-school newspaper work – how to use a landline, why to make calls – make for some of the film’s most enjoyable scenes, as do tributes to the hilariously feisty Joan, a longtime steward of the town’s memory.At times, I wanted the film to dig in a bit deeper, especially as it sets up understandable, nuanced tension between Meyer, a stalwart who views journalism as a “calling” worthy of crappy pay and negative reactions, and Hartnett, a social media native more wary of backlash and concerned with the paper’s local reputation; it does not play well when Meyer receives national awards for press freedom, while also seeking an example-setting $10m – far more than insurance coverage – in civil suits against the county.But also, who can blame him, when press freedom remains so gallingly tenuous in the US; just days before the film’s Sundance premiere, the FBI raided the home of aWashington Postreporter, owned by billionaire Trump allyJeff Bezos. Those names remain, a bit frustratingly, outside the film’s scope. You can probably guess who voted for who, but there is no mention of the attention black hole in charge.Though I remain fascinated by how idiosyncratic personal politics translate upwards, that is probably for the best. Seized is, ultimately, a defense of the press through precise specificity on the smallest scale. “This is not a particularly corrupt town,” Hartnett notes on his final day of work. “I think that, to an extent, people just aren’t used to having a local newspaper these days.” How sad, and how commendable, then, that the Marion County Record soldiers on.Seized is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewDocumentary filmsSundance film festivalFestivalsNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesKansasreviewsShareReuse this content"

The sender was Quobna Ottobah Cugoano, a free Black man living in London, one of roughly 4,000 people of African descent in the city at the time. Inside the package were pamphlets describing the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade and the brutal treatment of enslaved people in Britain’s Caribbean colonies. The accompanying letter, signed “John Stuart,” Cugoano’s alias, urged the heir to the British throne to read the “little tracts” enclosed and to “consider the case of the poor Africans who are most barbarously captured and unlawfully carried away from their own country”.Africans, Cugoano warned, were treated “in a more unjust and inhuman manner than ever known among any of the barbarous nations in the world”.At the time, Cugoano was employed as a domestic servant by the fashionable painters Maria and Richard Cosway, whose home stood just two blocks from Carlton House. Richard Cosway had recently been appointed principal painter to the Prince of Wales, and his residence at Schomberg House on Pall Mall had become a gathering place for artists, aristocrats and politicians. Weekly salons and concerts drew members of the highest society – events sanctioned by the prince himself. Through this employment, Cugoano gained something rare for a former enslaved man: regular, direct proximity to Britain’s elite and to the royal family.Cugoano used it to full advantage.British crown was world’s largest buyer of enslaved people by 1807, book revealsRead moreSchomberg House was a monument to social ambition. Its grand drawing rooms opened on to gardens that stretched almost to the edge of Carlton House’s own grounds. Cosway, newly elevated by royal favour, filled his home with lavish furnishings and dressed his Black servant in flamboyant bespoke livery – crimson silk or velvet trimmed with lace and gold buttons. In Georgian Britain, Black servants were fashionable accessories, visible symbols of wealth and imperial reach. Kings, princes, admirals and aristocrats employed them. In portraits of elite families, Black attendants hovered at the margins, holding trays, opening doors, silent witnesses to English life.Cugoano, however, was not silent.Born around 1757 in a Fante village on the coast of what is now Ghana, his childhood ended abruptly when slave traders raided his community. At 13, he was kidnapped, marched in chains to the coast, and forced onboard a slave ship. He later described the Atlantic crossing as a passage of terror, a “state of horror and slavery”. The ship delivered him to Grenada, where he was sold and forced to labour in a plantation slave gang.View image in fullscreenOttobah Cugoano.Composite: AlamyAfter nearly two years, his enslaver brought him to England in late 1772 – just months after Lord Mansfield’s famous ruling in the Somerset case, which declared that enslavers could not forcibly remove enslaved people from England. Though narrow in legal scope, the decision sent shockwaves across Britain. Many believed, mistakenly but hopefully, that touching English soil meant freedom.Cugoano soon claimed his liberty. Whether he fled or was cast out is unclear, but freedom in London was precarious. Formerly enslaved people were vulnerable to kidnapping and resale. On the advice of “some good people”, Cugoano was baptised at St James’s Church, Piccadilly, adopting the name John Stuart so that he “might not be carried away and sold again”. An Anglo-Christian name did not guarantee safety, but it offered camouflage.Over the next decade, Cugoano learned to read and write, became a devout Anglican, and embedded himself in London’s small but vibrant free Black community. By the mid-1780s, he had joined a group of Black activists calling themselves the Sons of Africa – former enslaved men, sailors and Black loyalists who had supported Britain and George III during the American Revolutionary War. Together, they wrote letters, published pamphlets, lobbied MPs and challenged the illegal seizure of free Black people in Britain.One such intervention saved a man named Harry Demaine, who had been recaptured by a Jamaican planter and dragged onboard a ship bound for the Caribbean. Acting swiftly, Cugoano and another Son of Africa alerted the abolitionist lawyer Granville Sharp, who secured Demaine’s release just minutes before the ship sailed. Demaine later said that he had planned to jump into the sea rather than be returned to slavery.These were acts of resistance carried out in the shadow of royal power.Cugoano understood that abolishing the slave trade would require more than rescue missions. It would require the support – or at least the acquiescence – of the monarchy. For generations, enslaved people across the British empire had petitioned the king, believing him to be a distant source of justice, capable of overriding colonial cruelty. Abolitionists, too, recognised the symbolic power of royal endorsement.From his post at Schomberg House, Cugoano watched the Prince of Wales up close. He observed his vanity, his appetite for praise, his obsession with legacy. And so, when Cugoano finally wrote to him, he tailored his appeal accordingly.If the prince used his future power to end the “iniquitous traffic of buying and selling men”, Cugoano promised, his name would “resound with applause from shore to shore” and be held “in the highest esteem throughout the annals of time”. It was a calculated appeal to ambition: history, glory, immortality.View image in fullscreenThoughts and Sentiments on the Evil of Slavery, by Quobna Ottobah Cugoano.Photograph: PenguinThe following year, Cugoano sent the prince a copy of his newly published book, Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic of theSlaveryand Commerce of the Human Species. It was the first anti-slavery treatise written by a formerly enslaved African in Britain. He reminded the prince that enslaved Africans had no ambassadors, no formal representatives. Their only hope was to “lay our case at the feet of your Highness”.The Prince of Wales kept the book, and it still sits in the royal collection. He did nothing else.Cugoano also sent his book to George III, adopting a different strategy. To the king – head of the Church of England – he appealed to Christian duty and moral responsibility. Justice and humanity, he wrote, were the motives behind his work, and surely a sovereign would be pleased to support the natural liberties of men.Yet Cugoano’s book did not flatter monarchy. It indicted it.For centuries, he argued, European kings had sanctioned, defended and profited from the buying and selling of African captives. In Britain, the transatlantic slave trade had not emerged accidentally or at the margins of power. It was formally established by royal authority when Charles II granted a monopoly charter to the Royal African Company. Successive monarchs and their families benefited from that investment in slaving. To claim royal innocence now, Cugoano insisted, was a fiction.The king and his relations occupied the most exalted position in British society. Yet as the descendants and beneficiaries of England’s first major investors in the slave trade, George III and the royal family set a corrupt example for the nation to follow.Monarchydid not merely preside over slavery; it normalised and legitimised it.View image in fullscreenKing George III, by Sir William Beechey (c. 1800).Photograph: mauritius images GmbH/AlamyChristian justifications for bondage, Cugoano continued, collapsed under scrutiny. Enslavers routinely denied religious instruction to the people they claimed to civilise. Plantation slavery was not benevolent guardianship but a regime of terror. If kings and nations possessed the power to prevent such injustice and refused to act, how could they expect God’s favour – or escape his judgment?This was no polite appeal. It was a warning.The British government, Cugoano wrote, continued to “traffic in the human species”, a crime “established by royal authority” and still supported and carried on by a Christian government.Responsibility did not rest solely with slave traders or planters but with the nation as a whole – and most heavily with its sovereign. Kings and “great men”, he argued, were “more particularly guilty”.Unless George III intervened to end Britain’s slave trade, he said, divine retribution would follow.White abolitionists carefully avoided such language. They courted royal goodwill, emphasising mercy rather than blame. Cugoano refused. He had no intention of holding back his disgust for the British people and the sovereign who had profited from his enslavement and ignored the ongoing anguish and death of countless Africans. Cugoano demanded immediate abolition, universal emancipation, and the political inclusion of Black people as free subjects – positions most Britons, abolitionist or not, considered dangerously radical.“But why,” he asked, “should total abolition, and an universal emancipation of slaves, and the enfranchisement of all the Black people employed in the culture of the colonies taking place as it ought to do, and without any hesitation, or delay for a moment, even though it might have some seeming appearance of loss either to government or to individuals, be feared at all?”Few listened, and Cugoano’s book initially attracted little attention. Yet his ideas did not disappear.By 1791, an abridged edition gained influential subscribers – artists, aristocrats, politicians. The movement he helped build gathered force. Abolition spread from pamphlets to parliament, from London drawing rooms to the far edges of Britain’s slave empire.View image in fullscreenA blue plaque for Ottobah Cugoano on Schomberg House in Pall Mall, London.Photograph: Lucy Millson-Watkins/English Heritage/PACugoano himself vanished from the historical record soon after, his final years unknown. But one trace remains: the book he placed in royal hands, the arguments laid at the feet of a future king, and the silence that followed.The monarchy had been confronted – directly, unmistakably – by a man who had survived its slave system and refused to thank it for his freedom. The opportunity for moral leadership was offered. It was declined.That silence would echo for generations.This is an edited extract from The Crown’s Silence by Brooke Newman, published by Harper Collins on 29 January at £25.

There is a way out – but it’s going to take collective effortRebecca SolnitThu 29 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 05.20 ESTShareGatheringSummer after summer, I used to descend into a creek that had carved a deep bed shaded by trees and lined with blackberry bushes whose long thorny canes arced down from the banks, dripping with sprays of fruit. Down in that creek, I’d spend hours picking until I had a few gallons of berries, until my hands and wrists were covered in scratches from the thorns and stained purple from the juice, until the tranquillity of that place had soaked into me.The berries on a single spray might range from green through shades of red to the darkness that gives the fruit its name. Partly by sight and partly by touch, I determined which berries were too hard and which too soft, picking only the ones in between, while listening to birds and the hum of bees, to the music of water flowing, noticing small jewel-like insects among the berries, dragonflies in the open air, water striders in the creek’s calm stretches.I went there for berries, but I also went there for the quiet, the calm, the feeling of cool water on my feet and sometimes up to my knees as I waded in where the picking was good. At home I made jars of jam. When I gave them away I was trying to give not just my jam – which was admittedly runny and seedy – but something of the peace of that creek, of summer itself.I once read an essay in which a man tried to figure out how much per pound his garden tomatoes would cost if he factored in the price of all the materials and the hourly rate for his own labour. It was ridiculous and intentionally so, because growing tomatoes gives so much more than a certain number of pounds of fruit. There’s the exquisite smell of tomato leaves, and the sense of time that comes from watching a plant grow, observing pollinators visit, seeing a flower become a fruit, tracking its ripening. There is the pride of doing something yourself.What the tomato-grower was pointing toward is what my friend, the environmental activist and author Chip Ward, long ago called “the tyranny of the quantifiable”. You grow tomatoes for the process, not just the product, to garden as well as to eat. To do as well as to have.It doesn’t matter if you hate blackberries and tomatoes, gardening and wading; everyone has their own version of deep immersion in the moment, of engaging with the world in an embodied and sensual way, whether it’s dancing or dog-walking, cake-decorating or dirt-biking. What does matter is that we are beset with the ideology of maximising having while minimising doing. This has long been capitalism’s narrative and is now also technology’s. It is an ideology that steals from us relationships and connections and eventually our selves. I want to defend these things we are urged to abandon. This isn’t an essay about AI per se; it’s about what gets lost when we unthinkingly accept what AI offers us. It’s an attempt to describe and value just what it is that gets overlooked or devalued.Connecting (and disconnecting)Silicon Valley is full of tyrants of the quantifiable. For decades, its oligarchs have preached that our criteria for what we do and how we do it should be convenience, efficiency, productivity, profitability. They have told us that to go out into the world, to interact with others, is perilous, unpleasant, inefficient, a waste of time, and that time is something we should hoard rather than spend.This ends up meaning that we can minimise our presence in the world and maximise time spent working and online, which also means maximising alienation and isolation. This has involved a reordering of society right down to our retail landscapes. Many things have become harder to do in person. Of course, there are well-recognised upsides, but the downsides are no less real: public spaces and public life have withered, including some of the places in which we once acquired our goods. All those errands – buying milk or socks (in the past, I would have said the newspaper) – meant moments of human contact, moving among strangers and making acquaintances, maybe observing the weather and the natural world. These activities meant becoming more familiar with your surroundings, feeling at home beyond the confines of what you rent or own.All this, I believe, underpins democracy: ease with difference, familiarity with the lay of the land, a sense of connection and belonging, knowing where you are and who’s out there, relationships – however casual – to people beyond your immediate circle. To embrace the tyranny of the quantifiable is to dismiss the subtle value of these daily acts out in the world and the ways they generate and maintain networks of relationships.So we have withdrawn, while being constantly told this is good, and it has turned out to be bad in a thousand small ways, weakening public life and local institutions, isolating us. Chronic withdrawal can lead to a yearning for contact, or simply a sense of loss at its absence. But it can also lead to something else: a growing inability to cope with that contact. It can transform a sense of something missing into aversion, or numbness, or unreal expectations about what human contact should be. The resilience to survive difficulty and discord, to brave the vagaries of unmediated human contact, must be maintained through practice. Silicon Valley-bred isolation robs us of that resilience.View image in fullscreenMcDonald’s customers in New York order at a digital kiosk.Photograph: Robert K Chin/AlamyWhile writing this, I dropped into a casual Indian restaurant I’ve been going to for years, only to find that, since my last visit, the system had changed so that you no longer say your order to a fellow human. Instead, you punch it in on a touchscreen even if someone is behind the counter. I helped the next customer, an old woman who just wanted a cup of chai, figure out the screens for her order. The process took us so much longer than saying “a cup of chai, please” and precluded any human contact with the servers, though at least she and I interacted with each other. The servers seemed miserable, their tasks more mechanised and less social than before. Here in San Francisco, which has been annexed by Silicon Valley, these screens for placing orders are now in more and more eating establishments that still offer face-to-face service. I wonder if people choose them over speaking to the cashier out of that aversion to contact that technology has inculcated in us.A few days later, I wandered into a bookstore in a neighbourhood frequented mostly by young people, many in the tech industry, and asked the guy at the desk if they had Karen Hao’sEmpire of AI. He pulled a used copy off the counter he had just priced, and then we bantered a bit. At the end he thanked me for interacting beyond the minimum. That was rare these days, he said. “People under 30 don’t make eye contact.”Lovelettersminus theloveHaving convinced a lot of us that we don’t want to go out and have unmediated contact with other people, Silicon Valley is now telling us we do not want to do our own thinking, creating or communicating with other humans. “You’ll never think alone again,” said one advertisement for an AI product called Cluely. The ad seemed confused about what thinking is and oblivious to why we might want to do it ourselves. These companies often suggest that things we have always done are too hard to do.The price of giving up many activities is the atrophy of the ability to do them. The sociologist and psychologist Sherry Turkle, who has followed the evolution of computer technologies since the 1970s, writes that she wanted to raise an empathic child. “I knew that without the ability to spend quiet time alone, that would be impossible. But that was where screens began to get us into trouble. Our capacity for solitude is undermined as soon as we introduce a screen.”Perhaps the ability to be alone and to think and act alone, though seldom thought of as an activity, is one that matters. (Among the dismal stories of AI adoption I came across was one in the Atlantic about a man who “consults AI for marriage and parenting advice, and when he goes grocery shopping, he takes photos of the fruits to ask if they are ripe”. Ripeness is something you can judge by smell and feel as well as by appearance, but if you outsource it long enough maybe you forget how to make decisions or what a ripe fruit should smell and taste like.)In 2025, the startup Cluely marketed its AI assistant with an advert featuring a young man wearing smart glasses, similar to those that first appeared asGoogle Glassin 2014 (other companies now offer glasses that do this, including Meta). Glasses of this type, which have internet access and tiny screens, operate on the premise that as you move through your day you need constant help, outsourcing basic decisions, checking facts, being reminded of appointments, in essence being babysat by your headgear.In the Cluely advert, the young man (who’s actually one of the product’s creators) gets a steady stream of prompts for talking to a young woman on their first date. So much of what tech offers is solutions to non-problems, or to problems that need to be solved though other means. Why is the young man incapable or afraid of talking without coaching? Is he really talking to his date or is he relaying instructions? How would she feel if she knew she were talking to an algorithm via her distracted date’s phone? With continued use, he may become even less capable of doing what we’ve all done for ever: converse, which is an act of collaborative improvisation.The point of a date is presumably to connect, but in this interaction it’s reframed as something like a business opportunity. He wants to impress the girl, but if she is impressed, it won’t be with him. Ned Resnikoff writes in his newsletter, chiming in with Turkle: “Cluely’s explicit promise is to abolish solitude – and, in effect, to abolish thought. All dialogue with one’s self is to be replaced by queries put to a large language model.”In its current incarnation, tech is arguing that we can outsource even intellectual labour to AI. It has led to an epidemic of cheating as students haveChatGPTdo their homework. Having a large language model do your creative and intellectual work is maybe the most extreme example of dispensing with the process while claiming the product. But in education, the ultimate product is not your term paper or essay or grade point average; it’s your self. You are supposed to emerge more informed, more capable of critical thinking, more competent in your field of study. The students who begin by cheating their professors end by cheating themselves.The tyranny of the quantifiable tramples over the question of what it is we get from doing the work, why we might want to do it, how writing – which is mostly thinking – can be part of developing a self, a worldview, a set of ethics, a greater capacity to understand and use language.Someone told me that her friend was having a chatbot write her husband a poem for their anniversary, which made me wonder if the husband desired a polished product or an expression from the heart. In Edmond Rostand’s 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac, the big-nosed title character ghostwrites love letters for his friend to the Roxanne both of them love. She comes to realise it’s the author of the letters she really loves. What happens when you realise the true love who touched your heart isn’t even human? Accepting it as your AI lover seems to be one answer.I am baffled by the embrace of AI erotic relationships, and wonder if porn paved the way by accustoming so many of us to watching images of bodies touching each other while our own bodies remain untouched, except by ourselves. An AI lover can give you only a pale shadow of embodied Eros. Sex with an actual person tends to involve all the senses. It’s biological, two animals coming together to do something far, far more ancient than our species.Sex also involves demands and risks, because the needs of the other person may not align with yours; intimacy means intimacy with that otherness, the possibility that things will go wrong, that there will be pain and rejection. That is the price of admission for intimacy with humans, and for the possibility that things will go right, and the fortifying joy when it does.One argument for AI companions is that they are always there for you: on when you want them on, off when you want them off, with no needs of their own. Yet behind this lies a capitalist argument that we’re here to get as much as possible and give as little as possible, to meet our own needs and dodge those of others. In reality, you get something from giving – at the very least, you get a sense of being someone with something to give, which is one measure of your own wealth, generosity and power.We were designed to give; the gifts were meant to circulate. Love is too often discussed as a sort of good you want to stockpile, harvest, collect, even extract, but to be loved without loving is a sad accomplishment, a miser’s hoarding of someone else’s wealth. The work of loving is also the work of forging a self and a life.Naming thetroubleAll this is partly a language problem. Silicon Valley’s corporations are constantly recruiting us to embrace their goals and their language. Corporate capitalists teach us to be more like them, to value efficiency and profitability and forget about values that might matter more in the end. We lack the language that would let us prize the arduous, the uncomfortable, the slow and wandering, the unpredictable, the vulnerable or risky, the intimate, the embodied.We resist the tyranny of the quantifiable by finding a language that can value all those subtle phenomena that add up to a life worth living. A language not in the sense of a new vocabulary but attention, description, conversation centred on these subtler phenomena and on principles not corrupted by what corporations want us to want.I want to praise difficulty, not for its own sake, but because so much of what we want, we get through endeavours that are difficult. The difficulty is why doing something is rewarding; you have accomplished something, exerted effort and skill, stayed with the trouble, tested your limits, realised your intentions – or sometimes failed at all these things, and that too can be important, as can learning to survive failure. There’s not much sense of reward in eating potato chips on the sofa unless you’ve overcome great difficulties to arrive at the sofa, in which case the sofa rests on the summit of a metaphorical mountain. (Of course, some difficulties are just miserable and there’s no reason not to avoid them: I’m not advocating for taking up the lifestyles of medieval peasants.)In this era, people seem to prize the pursuit of physical difficulty in the form of athletic feats and working out. At the same time, more emotionally and morally challenging work is often dismissed or dodged (perhaps because the results are not as obvious as washboard abs). We are persuaded that we should avoid it, and then we are offered a host of commodities and services to make life easier.But arduousness can be rewarding, and all-encompassing ease can be corrosive and, in the end, miserable. The capitalist agenda of maximising getting and minimising giving has some application in commerce but impoverishes life.EmbodimentI once loved a man who was often distant or discordant when wide awake but who let go of his defences when he was drowsy. Some mornings we’d wake and then fall asleep in each other’s arms, in a bliss before words and thoughts, in an embrace in which holding and being held, giving and receiving were inseparable, in which our characters that did not fit together particularly well seemed irrelevant to bodies that fit together flawlessly. So much of what we have to give each other is ourselves, our embodied animal selves, before and beyond words. But the embodied life is another thing we are encouraged to avoid or devalue or ignore.In the summer of 2025, torrential rain produced a terrible flood in Texas in which more than 100 people drowned, including at least 27 girls and camp counsellors at a Christian summer school. On the radio, I heard a minister say that he was on his way to visit families and while he didn’t know what he could say to them, he could go and be with them. This is the old way of comforting the bereaved: go be with them whether or not you have the words.We are social animals who need to be with other humans, whether it’s at a carnival or funeral or the ordinary times in between. There is a sense of belonging that goes deeper than words when we are with people who care about us, and even more so when we are in alignment, whether it’s two people falling into step on a walk or a dozen dancing together or a congregation praying or 10,000 marching together.Beginning in 2006, the cognitive psychologist James Coan did a series of experiments on married women and hand-holding: it turned out that a person given a mild electrical shock would have a much calmer reaction, measured in brain and body, if her husband was holding her hand (a stranger’s touch provided a lesser mitigation, and happier marriages meant the hand-holding was more effective). The result was not surprising, but it is a reminder of who we are and what we need.A lot of people have become familiar with the old studies on fight-or-flight responses to danger, sometimes now modified into “fight, flight or fawn”, but there is a different response that is less well recognised: tend-and-befriend. In an emergency, some of us turn to each other for safety. We derive comfort from other people. Which is among the reasons why inculcated isolation is so dangerous to our health. Coan noted in a recent interview that the normal approach to studying the brain and the mind is to isolate a person. But, as he pointed out, the normal state of being human over the aeons is not isolation; it’s being with others.Coan and his collaborators on a peer-reviewed paper wrote: “Throughout most of human history, emotional healing wasn’t something you did alone with a therapist in an office. Instead, for the average person facing loss, disappointment, or interpersonal struggles, healing was embedded in communal and spiritual frameworks. Religious figures and shamans played central roles – offering rituals, medicines and moral guidance.”Discussing AI in an interview, the neuroscientist Molly Crockett described interactions with “Dalai Lama chatbots” that could dispense credible-sounding spiritual advice. But she contrasted that with actually meeting the Dalai Lama himself and asking him the same question – about the role of outrage in activism – that she later asked the chatbots. “When I was there, when I was receiving that teaching from him, it reverberated through my whole body.I felt some knowledge shifting in my very bones, and I understood how outrage and compassion and social justice can play together – in a way that I still struggle to put into words.”A lot of spiritual teachings are simple; the challenge is to live them. A meaning, a truth, can sink into you, get incorporated into your worldview in a way that can be transformative, or not. Crockett’s example suggests that the face-to-face interaction may incorporate – literally embody – teachings in ways that disembodied information sources cannot.View image in fullscreenComposite: Artwork by Anais Mims and Guardian Design. Source Photographs by Getty ImagesI was talking to Crockett one summer in New Mexico’s high country, as a warm August day was turning into a mild night. She was telling me about the push by tech corporations for us to accept digital substitutes for lovers, friends, therapists, even grief counsellors, and I realised that what lay behind this push was something familiar: scarcity. The rhetoric was that somehow on this planet of 8 billion people there were not enough people to go around, and therefore we had to accept technological substitutes.There is no shortage of human beings. As with most problems with capitalism, there is only a distribution problem. The same industry that has done so much to undermine our relationships to self and others is pushing AI, in part by ignoring the possibility of other solutions, deeper social changes. It is a problem dressed up as a solution.Being togetherOne of the key things about AI companions in their current phase is their agreeable sycophancy. Vulnerable users have been encouraged in their delusions of grandeur, or have fallen into paranoia from bots urging the user to distrust everyone else, or have plunged into suicidal despair, with the helpful chatbot offering advice on how to kill yourself. The stories are horrific: of people abandoning their relationships with other human beings, of growing estranged, sometimes encouraged to grow suspicious; of a man in early stages of dementia getting lost when he attempts to take a long journey to meet the chatbot who’s promised him an erotic encounter that cannot be delivered because there is no body for him to meet.We don’t need flatterers; we need kind people in our lives who will tell us the truth when we’ve veered off course. Chatbots cannot do this, not least because the only information they have about us is what we supply. The very rich already suffer from sycophancy, from living in echo chambers, and it untethers them from reality – including often the reality of their own mediocrity, and this seems truer of the oligarchs of Silicon Valley than almost anyone.“Part of what keeps us sane is other people’s perspectives, which are often in tension with ours,” Carissa Véliz, an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Oxford’s Institute for Ethics in AI, told a Rolling Stone reporter. “When you say something questionable, others will challenge you, ask questions, defy you. It can be annoying, but it keeps us tied to reality, and it is the basis of a healthy democratic citizenry.”Many therapists concur, noting that friction will inevitably arise when we deal with other human beings, by contrast with the frictionlessness of our dealings with AI sycophants. Friction often leads to the rupture and repair of a relationship, which will strengthen it. “What many people don’t realise about therapy, however, is that those subtle, uncomfortable moments of friction are just as important as the advice or insights they offer,”writes therapist Maytal Eyal. “This discomfort is where the real work begins. A good therapist guides clients to break old patterns – expressing disappointment instead of pretending to be OK, asking for clarification instead of assuming the worst, or staying engaged when they’d rather retreat.”Among the things real friends can do and AI cannot: bake you a cake or drive you home, hold your hand or live through a crisis or a celebration with you. And because of that difference people need to have real friends. More than that, people need real communities and social support systems.The solution to technology is not more technology. The solution to loneliness is each other, a wealth that should be available to most of us most of the time. We need to rebuild or reinvent the ways and places in which we meet; we need to recognise them as the space of democracy, of joy, of connection, of love, of trust. Technology has stolen us from each other and in many ways from ourselves, and then tried to sell us substitutes. Stealing ourselves back, alas, is not as easy as walking out the door. We need somewhere to go and, more importantly, someone to go to who likewise desires to connect.Weizenbaum’s nightmares: how the inventor of the first chatbot turned against AIRead moreThe connections that matter to our humanity are not only to each other. They’re with the whole natural and social world. Animals, wild and domestic, should be counted as part of the irreplaceable companionship that makes our lives meaningful and sometimes joyful. They remind us that there aremany kinds of consciousness and that our species is itself not alone.For that, too, there is no substitute. The natural world is a reminder of a universe far beyond us, of deep time, of patterns and rhythms of nature, and of every scale – from the microscopic to the Milky Way. To seek it out is to be willing to feel small in the context of this vastness, and perhaps one of the seductions of technology is its promise to make us feel big, caught up in the dramas and incentives of our egos, contained within the limits of human-made technologies.We are told that machines will become like us, but in many ways they demand we become more like them. To let that happen is to lose something immeasurably valuable. That immeasurability is what makes this struggle difficult, but what cannot be measured can be described or at least evoked and valued. It cannot be boiled down to simple metrics such as efficiency and profitability.Resisting the annexation of our hearts and minds by Silicon Valley requires us not just to set boundaries on our engagement with what they offer, but to cherish the alternatives. Joy in ordinary things, in each other, in embodied life, and the language with which to value it, is essential to this resistance, which is resistance to dehumanisation.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignThe best stories take time.

Ask people what they think of Labour policy on benefits and they will probably talk of seizing the winter fuel allowance from freezing pensioners. Or that £5bn snatched from disabled people, until Labour’s own MPs prevented it. These were the signifiers that set the wrong tone early on. Late, far too late, abolishing the two-child limit has not made the same impression on public perceptions, despite the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) this week reporting it as being behind what could be thegreatest ever fall in child poverty in a parliament.The government fails to herald its progress in reversing the worst the Tories did to benefits. Why? I’m not sure if it is ineptitude or a political decision not to trumpet its many progressive policies.At the Fabian thinktank conference last week, I had an “in conversation” session with Stephen Timms, the minister who probably knows more and cares more about social security than any other MP. As financial secretary to the Treasury, he took the ChildPovertyAct through parliament in 2010. In opposition, he chaired the work and pensions committee scrutinising the Tory years. Now as minister for social security and disability, he chairs two crucial reviews, one on personal independence payments (Pip) for disability and one on universal credit.The basic benefit for adults has never risen in real terms since the 1970s, he said. Now for the first time since then, universal credit’s standard allowance will rise above inflation every year for each of the next four years. It always was, and still is, a pathetically low sum to live on, at £98 a week from this April for a single person, but that 2.3% real rise will slowly make a positive difference.“Reducing child poverty is whatLabourgovernments do,” Timms says: any child poverty graph reveals which party was in power when. His universal credit (removal of two-child limit) bill that he takes through parliament in a few weeks will lift about 450,000 children out of poverty, and will benefit another 100,000 taken above the line because they now qualify for free school meals. Increasing child poverty is what Conservatives always do. They pretended to support the 2010 Child Poverty Act in David Cameron’s wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing pre-election phase, but scrapped all those targets once in power. Timms watched them cut benefits to their lowest real terms for 40 years, propelling the number of children living in poverty to 4.5 million.Labour has changed direction since the shock of that attempted £5bn disability heist: Timms makes it crystal-clear Labour will not be doing that again. His Pip review will not make disability cuts, news that will come as a great relief to those who lost trust. Timms says Pip will rise with inflation up to the next election. Although numbers of new claimants are starting to fall, the Office for Budget Responsibilitypredicts the Pip bill will go on rising, but Labour has accounted for that in its envelope of benefit spending. No more cuts, except by getting more people into work. He reminds us why panic about the “rising” benefit bill is bogus: the proportion of GDP spent on working-age benefits has not changed for 40 years; it’s still at 4-5%.On his universal credit review, more good news. One of UC’s worst features was imposing a five-week wait on new claimants: it projects many with nothing to live on into instant and permanent debt repayment and rent arrears, sending food bank use soaring. Expect that to end. He talks emotionally of a conversation with the late Frank Field, benefits guru, protesting at the five-week delay. Field asked why, when he was minister and forms were filled in by hand, manually processed, driven by van to a centre and assessment managed without computers, it took only seven days to pay out? Yes, absurd, Timms agreed.But the point of that wicked five weeks was political, a deliberate policy, designed to “mirror the world of work” by paying monthly to many used to being paid weekly, with erratic hours, with no leeway to wait. To “mirror” work, they had to prove they spent 30 hours every week applying for jobs on pain of severe “sanctions” (benefit cuts), drivingemployers to protestat mountains of utterly unsuitable applications. Don’t forget those punitive policies where local jobcentre managers were threatened into “sanctioning” as many claimants as possible, tripping them up with unreachable appointments.Instead, Labour sets out to reprise its highly successful “new deal for young people” from 1998, when it brought down an inherited high youth unemployment rate with personal attention from jobcentre staff well trained to support, not punish: it worked. Of course, there was always a backstop of “conditionality”. Similarly, thefuture jobs fundfor the young, responding to the 2008 crash, was a proven success, though instantly abolished in 2010.Now with the number of Neets – young people neither in work nor education – at nearly a million, Labour’s youth guarantee currently being piloted is about to do it again, with work coaches trained to give that same support.All of this is good news. Good enough? It never is, but it is reversing the poison of the George Osborne, Iain Duncan Smith years. Last time they returned to government, the Tories obliterated most of Labour’s advances, so how can Labour nail down progress irrevocably this time? Only by changing underlying public attitudes, defying the right’s “scrounger”, “skiver” epithets. That will take a Labour cabinet talking up the good a well-designed benefit system does, never more than in rescuing the young fallers in a Covid-damaged generation. Lack of a guiding story about the best it does has been this government’s failure.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionBenefitsPovertyYoung peopleUniversal creditChildrenSocial exclusioncommentShareReuse this content"

Leadership from below succeeded when politics as usual failedThu 29 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 08.44 ESTShareFor most politicians and journalists, the answer to nearly every question is to look up. Not at the moon, the stars or even the chimney tops, but at their leaders: the people who sit atop institutions, wield power and set the line that others follow. The top of the totem pole is the sole focal point, and the stories that count usually come from the heights of power.Bend your neck back far enough and Davos becomes not a talking shop in a Swiss ski resort, but a gathering of world leaders; Keir Starmerflying into Beijingis a summit of great powers; even who should be the MP for Gorton and Denton is really all about theLabour leadership. For this piece, the Guardian’s research librarians counted how many times the words “leader” or “leadership” appeared across the British press. Over the past week alone, the rough total stands at 2,000. A third of those stories concern one man: Donald Trump.“We know a lot about what fifth-century Greece looked like to an Athenian citizen,” observed EH Carr in his classic What is History?, “but hardly anything about what it looked like to a Spartan, a Corinthian, or a Theban – not to mention a Persian, or a slave or other non-citizen resident in Athens.” Sixty-five years later and our daily news remains wall-to-wall Athens, with scarcely a Spartan vox pop.Until a week such as this one, which reminds us that power doesn’t belong only to the powerful. Just look at the disarray inflicted on Trump, head of the world’s sole superpower, by Minneapolis, a city with barely more people than Croydon.After months of resistance by Minnesotans, the president’s immigration chief,Gregory Bovino, has been forced out of the city. Trump’s head of homeland security, Kristi Noem, faces either thesack or impeachment. Key members of his team aretearing stripsoff each other. And the Republicans’ signature domestic policy – the terrorising of multicultural Democratic cities by thousands of mercenary bullyboys, masked up and kitted out like they’re taking Basra – isnow opposedby a clear majority of Americans.Left to conventional leaders, this would not have happened. Just last week in Washington, a crucial number of Democratic representatives defied their own party toside with Trumpand pump more money into the immigration crackdown. Just last week in Davos, thousands of the highest-paid executives in the world – billionaires such as Stephen Schwarzman, whotakes more in an hourthan the average American earns in a year – dutifullyqueued upto hear the Orange Ego ramble on. Facing the administration’s classic mix of sweeteners and threats, the US’s media empires, its best universities and top law firms have folded like origami.Trump doubtless expected the same in the icy midwest. Instead, his troops faced a nonviolent fightback. Tens of thousands across Minneapolis and Saint Paul turned out week after week to protest, even when it was so cold, wrote one reporter, that he couldn’t take notes: “The ink in my pens had frozen.” Despite the state executions that have been all over the world’s news, despite being teargassed and assaulted, ordinary Minnesotans still turned out.When others went into hiding rather than face the immigration gangsters, their neighbours made sure they got food and supplies. And yet others acted as ICE-watchers, monitoring the violence and barbarism of armed thugs whose salaries come from US taxpayers. Many have kept on their civic duties despite the killing of Renee Good, a poet and mother who ICE employees shot in the face then called a “fucking bitch”; and Alex Pretti, a nurse executed by a gang of seven agents, apparently for holding up a phone.These two ordinary people were murdered by their own government, then slandered by it. Their corpses were tagged as “domestic terrorists”. Their fellow Minnesotans have been attacked as an “organised illegal insurgency” by Joe Lonsdale, a cofounder of Palantir. On one thing, he was right: the activists have been very organised, providing training to newbies, turning restaurants into field hospitals, running elaborate networks to get provisions to those Minnesota families in fear for their own safety. But an insurgency this is not, not when mums tooting whistles are battling masked men toting guns,paid up to $50,000just for signing up to ICE; not when a smartphone camera is wielded against teargas; or when hecklers are handcuffed and hauled off.The hub of this work is south Minneapolis, last in the world’s headlines six years ago as the site whereGeorge Floyd was killedby police officers. Some of those who rose up in the Black Lives Matter protests of that period have clearly reawakened their old networks. Others note that Minnesota regularly topsmeasures of social trust: in other words, its residents are among the most likely to place their trust in their neighbour across the road, rather than the leader at the top of the pile.Two are dead in Minneapolis. Trump is to blame | Kenneth RothRead moreThe resisters in Minneapolis provide an example of what the historian Moshik Temkin calls leadership from below. In his recent book, Warriors, Rebels and Saints: The Art of Leadership from Machiavelli to Malcolm X, Temkin writes how under authoritarian rule, societies will turn to “leaders who have few followers and no institutional power”. He gives the resistance in Vichy France as an example. “They might not be able to openly call themselves leaders or reveal themselves as leaders or reveal themselves at all. We might not ever even know their names.” Their power comes not from their direct impact, but from their example.Against the ethnic division sown by the White House, a significant number of Minnesotans have shown neighbourliness. Recoiling from the aggression and overreach of Trump’s lieutenants, Americans have been presented with an example of homespun solidarity. The Battle of Minneapolis is not over: ICE agents are still teargassing schools and threatening protesters (“You raise your voice, I erase your voice,”one bullyboy saysinto a camera, from the safety of his SUV). Bovino’s replacement, Tom Homan, is not much of an improvement: he helped createICE’s practice of separating kidsfrom their parents. But after a year in which the American establishment has talked of a vibe shift and a new Trumpian orthodoxy, citizens in the US and around the world can see it is not so: that it is resisted by them in the face of military hardware and unconscionable aggression.This week, Minneapolis offers those who would tell the story of the US a different narrative, although what it will be is inevitably unclear. For EH Carr, the importance of any president or his protesting crowds is never settled once and for all, but debated forever by those looking back with questions of their own age. As he wrote, “The historian belongs not to the past but to the present”. All of us will one day form the raw material of history; we will all belong to the future. That should change how we act now.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMinnesota ICE shootingsOpinionICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Donald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

We need to have this discussion.”Removing US as World Cup host would be eminently sad – and entirely justified | Alexander AbnosRead moreMeanwhile, Fifa’s disgraced former president Sepp Blatter, long the sport’s amoral center, now almost 90 years old and never one to pass up the opportunity to take a swing at his successor, further undermined this World Cup. On Monday, heendorsed commentsby a former Fifa anti-corruption lawyer –breaks fourth wall to glance directly into the camera with a smirk– to “avoid the United States!”The heads of about 20 European soccer federationsdiscussed the possibilityof a boycott. And between Donald Trump’s threats against Greenland, his administration’s actions in Venezuela, his various travel bans, and killings by federal agents during his immigration crackdown, clearly some kind of international rebuttal is called for. But whether soccer’s authorities are really in any position to do so is questionable. And the cost and ramifications of a potential boycott should be fully thought through.For one thing, it’s worth considering who will actually be punished. It’s doubtful that Trump cares enough about the World Cup to save it from a would-be boycott by backing down on the policies mentioned above. If there were no longer a margin in it for him, he’d likely do much the same ashe will with the upcoming Super Bowl: dismiss it, ignore it, and move on.The Trump administration, then, probably wouldn’t be materially hurt by aWorld Cupboycott. It may be embarrassed, but then is that even something it is capable of or cares about? The oligarch class that keeps Trump in power wouldn’t really be damaged either, as they have no significant stake in the thing – Fifa gets the lion’s share of the proceeds.Fifa would certainly be affected, but probably not as much as you’d expect. It will surely still make its broadcast income, and the sponsorship money, and it has already collected huge amounts of the ticket revenue it stands to make. It would be egg on the organization’s face, sure, but they also seem to have moved on from such quaint considerations some time ago.The influencer World Cup: Fifa and the TikTok deal targeting an avalanche of postsRead moreIn the end, the brunt would be borne by the boycotting teams and their fans, who don’t get to play in, or watch, a World Cup with their country in it. And, more directly, the many people who would work the tournament and benefit from the tourism it will generate. This may be a small price to pay in the grand scheme of things, but only if a boycott actually has any sort of effect.Which, well, let’s return for a moment to Göttlich and his deep cut to the Olympic boycotts, when the US and much of the west snubbed the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow over the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan. The USSR and much of the Eastern Bloc then counter-boycotted LA in 1984. Neither boycott accomplished very much at all, other than political posturing. The Soviets would not withdraw from Afghanistan until 1989. Yet two Olympics were pretty much spoiled. Lots of athletes lost their chance to compete, while others had their accomplishments affixed with a massive asterisk.To hold up the Olympic boycotts as some sort of paradigm for how withholding participation in a sporting event can be wielded as an effective political tool is ahistorical.There have hardly been any boycotts in the context of the World Cup. Defending champions Uruguay refused to go to Italy for the 1934 World Cup because so few European countries had showed up when it hosted the inaugural edition four years earlier. In 1938, Uruguay and Argentina sat out afteran incident involving Peruat the 1936 Berlin Olympics. African countries boycotted the 1966 World Cup in protest over their continent getting just one-third of a berth, to be shared with Asia and Oceania – successfully, as Africa got a full berth in 1970. And the USSR refused to play a qualifier against Chile for the 1974 World Cup after the overthrow of socialist president Salvador Allende.For some reason, the community that orbits the global game feels a ceaseless compunction for football to affect the wider world in a positive way. It’s a noble notion, a kind of immutable idealism that runs deep through a fundamentally cynical sport. The trouble is that in this case, there really isn’t much a hand to be played. An administration unconstrained by convention, aspirations of global leadership, or diplomatic politesse probably won’t be bothered about a bunch of countries staying away from a World Cup.All the better to show up and lodge your protest in person. Nobody will hear you if you’re not there to speak up.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May. You canpreorder it here.

I totally get itDave SchillingThe actor was promoting her new lingerie line – and in 2026, marketing requires more than a glossy adThu 29 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 10.12 ESTShareIwould hate to have to launch a new product in 2026. Imagine a scenario where you’ve developed some ingenious new widget that costs millions of dollars to design, produce and bring to market. You could have quit numerous times. You probably wanted to, because there’s a new season of The Traitors and you have to catch up. But you never surrendered. You persevered, and your brilliant invention is ready for the world. All you have to do now is convince a society besieged by a nonstop cavalcade of crises to care.If the US government could kindly stop sending paramilitary forces to occupy major cities, that would be great for my brand.This is the predicament faced by poor Sydney Sweeney, the actor best known for HBO’s Euphoria and the recent film The Housemaid. This week, Sweeney debuted a new lingerie line called “Syrn”. I presume it’s meant to be pronounced “siren”, since that’s a suitably sultry-sounding name. Also, confusing, which might be part of the brilliant marketing plan behind the launch. If you baffle enough people, they’ll be sure to Google you to seewhat your damn problem is anyway. If I was the marketing lead on this project, I would have suggested “Syren”, since that at least has a real vowel in it, like most actual words. Unfortunately, “Syren” was thename of a Confederate blockaderunner during the civil war, which we (andvery particularly Sydney Sweeney) would probably want to avoid associating with.The lingerie line emphasizes sizes for all body types, allowing women the freedom and comfort of bras that are designed for their physical realities. Sweeneyissued a press releasein which she said: “I wanted to create a place where women can move between all the different versions of who we are. I love working on cars, I go water skiing, I’ll dress up for the red carpet then go home to snuggle my dogs. I’m not one thing, no woman is.” I’m far from an expert here, so forgive me if I ask how often women go water skiing in lingerie? Perhaps I’m just not invited to these events.The Hollywood sign at 100: how a hillside ad became an enduring monumentRead moreRegardless of the state of my social calendar, these are noble goals, ones that I’m sure Sweeney legitimately cares about. She speaks eloquently in her statement about the frustrations of being a young woman unable to find undergarments that fit her properly. Unfortunately, theBlack Mirror-style worldwe live in is dictated by attention and how much you can generate by endlessly pedaling on the metaphorical stationary bike of social media. On top of that desperation for “impressions” (the number of people not just interacting with your posts, but also just plain old looking at them for a split second), you throw on the variety of catastrophes that dominate the news cycle. Good luck releasinga movie about the horrific injustices of impersonal, dispassionate, AI law enforcement! I’ve gotten my fill from the real thing, thank you.Now, try to launch a bra line fronted by a celebrity many of us got sick of around the time she wasaccused of advocating for eugenicsin a jeans advert. Naturally, panic sets in, and the need for ahigh-value stuntbecomes paramount. Sydney Sweeney’sstunt of choicewas heading up to the Hollywood sign in the hills of Los Angeles, climbing it and decorating the area with bras. The Hollywood chamber of commerce hasvoiced displeasure; according to theLos Angeles Times, Sweeney had permission to film in the area, but filming the sign itself requires a license – and climbing it isn’t permitted.The days of taking out a glossy ad in a magazine to announce a new venture are over. You have to do things of questionable legality to get anyone to notice you. It’s not enough to be a successful movie star with a massive social media following. You have to leave your underwear lying around in public. I’ve tried that, and let me tell you, it only gets attention from your local mental health service providers.As you all know, I’m not famous enough to do such things. I’m just a regular guy who orders fast food through a smartphone app so I don’t have to put clothes on to go to a drive-thru. But I still need attention. I need to promote this article, so people read it. I write about things like Sydney Sweeney’s underwear in order to ensure you’ll notice. I wake up every morning hoping someone will care about what I’m doing. If they don’t, I’ll get washed away in the tide of the numerous, far more important things that are happening on the planet every hour.In that respect, how different am I from Sydney Sweeney, or any other glittering media personality? I might not be sharing a yacht with Jeff Bezos or bathing in hundred-dollar bills, but I have the same inherent need to keep up with the ebb and flow of the modern world’s unquenchable thirst for eyeballs and earholes. She perpetrated this stunt for the purposes of getting people like me to write about it, which in turn hopefully encourages you, the audience, to buy her lingerie. I’ve been ensnared by the same cruel bear trap of need that restricts us all. The only question is, will I ever become desperate enough to saw off my own leg to escape?Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsSydney SweeneyOpinionAdvertisingcommentShareReuse this content"

This time, I had to stop and capture the evidenceThu 29 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 13.06 ESTShareSomething’s been bothering me on my commute toCardiff. I usually take the train, but when I have to drive, just after I’ve passed Cardiff City stadium, I always get a red light just before a railway bridge. It’s not the red light I object to, it’s the giant electronic billboard right there, its brightness of such ferocity that I feel it burning my retina. And, as is the way with these things, the moment you see anything up there you’re interested in, it changes again.So it was that I kept half-seeing something so astonishing – and not in a good way – that I thought I must be mistaken. And then either the billboard or the traffic lights would change, and I’d be on my way. As time went on, I even started slowing down as I approached this junction to try to catch the offending ad. But even when I got a good look at it, I thought I must be mistaken. Eventually, at 6am one Saturday morning over Christmas, I parked, readied the camera on my phone, and waited. The roads were deathly quiet, neither car nor soul anywhere. Just me, my phone, and this wretched sign. All in the cause of seeking confirmation that I had indeed found the most egregious use of an apostrophe in history.And there it was. I checked the photo and saw my eyes had not been deceiving me. I wish they had been. An advert for, and I quote, WALE’S LARGEST VAPE SHOP. I’m no pedant, and I appreciate it’s tricky to know where to put a possessive apostrophe when the word ends in S, but –ye gods! – this is quite something. And it was only when I’d captured it for posterity that I realised (so entranced had I been at the WALE’S) I’d missed CHEAPEST PRICE’S.It’s weird, because I can’t see any such aberrations on the company’s rather well put-together website. It might even all be a ruse to grab attention. If so, it’s worked a treat with me. If only I was a vaper, I’d give them some custom and perhaps summon the courage to have a quiet word.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinionAdvertisingCardiffLanguageWalescommentShareReuse this content"

He names Renee Good and Alex Pretti, both killed by federal agents amid protests. He rages against “Miller and Noem’s dirty lies”, referencing the faces of the Trump administration’s onslaught against immigrants.In its familiar structure, with chords any beginner musician can play, it echoes protest songs of the 1960s. But unlike Blowin’ in the Wind or A Change Is Gonna Come, it doesn’t speak in metaphor. That probably means no one will be singing this song around the campfire 50 years from now; we can only hope the youth of tomorrow will be unfamiliar with private DHS armies. But it also leaves no doubt about its message. Springsteen, who says he wrote and recorded the song in the span of a weekend, has no time for ambiguity, and the result is a sense of urgency and genuine fury. Streets of Minneapolis sacrifices timelessness for raw feeling.Bruce Springsteen releases anti-ICE song dedicated to MinneapolisRead moreThat’s not to say the song lacks lyricism. Springsteen stages the scene on Minneapolis streets as a battle between the people and their violent oppressors, with images of “fire and ice” and “an occupier’s boots”. It’s rooted in the folk tradition, with references to the US national anthem – “Against smoke and rubber bullets / In the dawn’s early light” – andechoes of the Bible– “We’ll take our stand for this land / And the stranger in our midst.” The title itself harkens back to Springsteen’s own hit Streets of Philadelphia, which addressed the Aids crisis. And, importantly for a protest song, it’s highly singable, with a verse-chorus structure and a built-in chant: the recording features voices yelling: “ICE out!” (It also has a big harmonica solo, essential to any 60s-style anthem.)And despite the song’s tale of blood and tyranny, it’s unexpectedly hopeful. It celebrates the protests and the city’s unity – “In chants of ‘ICE out now’ / Our city’s heart and soul persists / Through broken glass and bloody tears / On the streets of Minneapolis.” And it situates the crisis as a historical event – “in the winter of ’26” – using another folk-song trope, perhaps as an unconscious reminder that we’ve faced tragedy before and emerged from it.Yes, it’s all a little on-the-nose. In an era whenbeing cringeis the ultimate sin, it’s tough to write an earnest protest song, and Streets of Minneapolis is very, very earnest. But it works because it doesn’t pretend to be anything else.Sixty years after the 60s, music hasn’t forgotten politics. Recent decades have seen theirshare of protest songstargeting inequality, police violence andDonald Trump himself, by artists ranging fromHERtoGreen Dayto theLinda Lindas. Springsteen himself has remained politically outspoken, condemning Trump in a series ofonstage speeches last yearand prompting the president to declare him a “dried-up prune of a rocker”. (Trumpis olderthan the dried-up prune.) But with every day bringing a new travesty and cruelty becoming normalized, the time is ripe for a renaissance in protest music.The musician and activist Billy Bragg has already written asong, City of Heroes,celebrating the resistance in Minneapolis. “They use teargas and pepper spray against our whistles and our phones / But in this city of heroes, we will protect our own,” he sings, adapting Martin Niemöller’s “First they came for the socialists” as he laments how so many stay quiet in the face of brutality. Like Springsteen, Bragg wrote and recorded the song in a matter of hours.

Steve Jobs had announced the launch of the first iPhone, the sub-prime mortgage crisis was bubbling up in the US, the EU had enlarged to include Romania and Bulgaria, andIndiahad for the first time become a trillion-dollar economy. This was when trade talks between Delhi and Brussels were initiated for the first time. But it wouldn’t be until this very week, almost 20 years later, that a deal was signed after a few final months of unusually accelerated negotiations.On Tuesday, the president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Council António Costa and India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, announced the “mother of all deals”, which promises to bring together about 2 billion consumers and a quarter of the world’s GDP. Theagreementopens parts of India’s famously protectionist domestic market with a focus on exporting manufacturing and services; in return, middle-class Indian consumers will find it cheaper to buy European cars and wine. The overarching EU-Indiacomprehensive strategic agendais really much larger in scope, taking in defence and security, commitments to multilateralism, mobility and cooperation in a range of areas.Why the sudden change of pace, after 20 years of stops and starts? The answer has everything to do with Donald Trump. The EU-India free trade agreement unveils the emerging silhouette of a post-US world order amid relentless threats to territorial sovereignty, punitive tariffs and the weakening of multilateral institutions.The original talks had proceeded slowly over differences on cars, alcohol, agriculture and dairy – and were abandoned in 2013. They were resumed in 2022 as the post-pandemic world sought to “de-risk” anddiversify supply chainsbeyond China. Ironically what brought the deal to the finish line was not China but the looming shadow of Trump. In December 2024, even before the inauguration of his second presidency, the US president had spooked Europe byreviving the ideaof owning Greenland. That a close ally was threatening territorial sovereignty prompted a widely shared sense of Europe being “home alone” amid frictions in the tightly woven transatlantic relations.To add to the chaos, on his first day in office Trumpimposed punishing tariffson America’s neighbours, Canada and Mexico – a move that culminated in the “liberation day” taxes levied on 90 countries across the world. India was hit with one of thehighest tariff ratesof 50%, which included an additional 25% because of its purchase of discounted Russian oil. And most recently the tariff weapon was wielded once again against the EU and the UK when eight countries sent a few Nato soldiers to Greenland. As a result, the US is not just seen – as recentpublic opinion surveysshow – as undependable in Europe, but as an outright threat.Now “de-risking” and “decoupling” are back in vogue in Europe – except that the target is Trump’s America, rather than China. And what is at stake is not just supply chains but also the strategic capacity to act against coercion. The recent move by the French government toban officialsfrom using US video-conferencing software like Zoom and instead promote its home-grown Visio platform is a case in point.The wide scope of the evolvingIndia-EU partnershipsuggests a move towards greater convergence in terms of the commitment to multilateral institutions, and cooperation in a range of areas ofsecurity and defence, research, mobility and connectivity, including enhanced engagement in the Indo-Pacific region. As the US withdraws to the western hemisphere (through the so-called Donroe doctrine), the Indo-Pacific region, which was once central to US engagement in Asia, is now more open to collaboration with the EU.‘Mother of all deals’: EU and India sign free trade agreementRead moreThe trade deal is the largest of its kind but is also part of a growing trend as many nations attempt to forge new alliances. Brussels recently concluded a trade deal with the South American Mercosur trade bloc, withseveral more in the pipeline; India has made agreements with the UK and New Zealand in the last few months alone. While ratification and implementation take time, and may even hit a roadblock or two (likethe delayin the EU-Mercosur deal), it suggests a shift that is unmistakable. The world many outside the west have long dreamed about – of multipolarity, strategic autonomy, even de-dollarisation – is taking shape, first slowly and now rapidly.A day before the EU-India summit, EU leaders were for the first time guests of honour at India’s Republic Day celebrations, invited to witness the military parade and colourful pageantry. The emerging pictures were a world removed from the gloom that has overtaken the European mood in recent months. They projected bonhomie, even optimism.The world is moving on.

Despite the authorities cutting off communications and destroying evidence, it is clear that a regime never reluctant to shed its citizens’ blood has done sowith unprecedented zeal, sensing anunprecedented threatfrom unrest across the country, challenging not only its policies but its very existence.Officials have reported 3,000 deaths, but human rights groups have tallied many more, and a network of medical professionalshas estimatedthat 30,000 could have been killed. Security forces shot people dead as theyfled a fireand arearresting doctors for helping the wounded.Alongside the fury at this vengeful regime is anger at another leader: Donald Trump, who urged Iraniansto keep protestingand promised them that “help is on its way” – thenplayed downthe slaughter. Now the US president haswarned via social mediathat “a massive Armada is heading to Iran”, and that “the next attack will be far worse” thanOperation Midnight Hammer, the US strike on nuclear sites last summer. Iran’s muted response, and its weakening over the last year, has emboldened him, as has his seizure of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, referenced in his post. But protesters were forgotten: instead his demand was “NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS”.Mr Trump is notoriously unpredictable: in his first term, he called off an attack on Iran 10 minutes before it happened. But his newfound interventionism has wrenched the spotlight from the Epstein files, and Iran threats distract from Immigration and Customs Enforcement brutality at home and his climbdown over Greenland. Iran is afar more popular targetthanDenmarkamong his base.Many Iran analysts now see a“zombie state”– unable to ensure even a basic standard of living or to defend its sovereignty; apparently unable to renew itself; but as tyrannical as it is frail. However, military intervention could come at huge human cost and would not bring democracy – even if that were Mr Trump’s aim. More likely would be the emergence of a strongman, perhaps from the Revolutionary Guard, orregime collapseand chaos. If he were serious about non-proliferation, the best hope – albeit now harder than ever – would be to seek a revised version of the JCPOA deal which he did the most todestroy.Israel sees a weakened, chaotic Iran as in its interests. Turkey, Saudi Arabia and others are trying to hold the US back because they fear a strengthened Israel, a surge in migration and instability in a region attempting to sell itself as a dependable investment. As weakened as it is, a cornered regime couldstill do damage– particularly in the strait of Hormuz, a critical artery for global trade – if it believes that inaction would only make it look an easier target. Economic concerns seem more likely to shift Mr Trump than humanitarian considerations.The EU on Thursday designated the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist entity – a largely symbolic measure given the extent of existing sanctions. Governments can and shouldpress for a moratorium on executions, support attempts to reconnect Iranians with the internet, and fund NGOs documenting abuses. In the longer term they should consider how to supportcivil societyand help to strengthen it. They should also provide safe passage to activists whose lives are in danger. Military intervention is not the answer – but neither is indifference to the suffering of Iranian civilians.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

An estimated 18% of leaseholders in England and Wales – around 1m households – have a so-called “modern ground rent” lease, with escalating charges that make it impossible in many cases to remortgage or sell. Cost-of-living pressures, including food and energy price rises, make it all the more urgent that their situation is addressed.Angela Raynerwas right to argue in the Guardian last week that ministers must pick a side.This market should never have been allowed to develop in the way that it has. An investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority found no evidence that leaseholders get anything for these annual fees – which are separate from service charges that pay for the maintenance of common areas. Campaigners for leasehold abolition are right that the rent-seeking behaviour of freeholders is wrong. Mortgage lenders, as well as politicians, should have put their feet down years ago.But while the case for reform is clearcut,wealthy freehold investorswere never going to let it happen without a fight. In 2024, Matthew Pennycook, then in opposition and now Labour’s housing minister, said that the then Tory government“should be courageous” in pressing ahead with reform, disregarding industry threats. Unfortunately, and despite this week’s announcement of a ban on new leasehold flats and a ground rent cap of £250 on existing leases, Labour, too, is showing signs of timidity.For theleaseholders with the worst deals, the cap will come as a relief – although it should have been set lower, and is unlikely to be in force before 2028. The 40-year period before ground rent is phased out, in favour of nominal “peppercorn rent”, is also too long. A reasonable grace period would have been much shorter.But even with the cap, and the overdue abolition of forfeiture – enabling freeholders to seize properties if ground rent is unpaid – plenty of problems remain. The Tories’Leaseholdand Freehold Reform Act took the first step with a ban on new leasehold houses. But the continued sale of leasehold flats was one of many loose ends left hanging. These must be dealt with before existing leaseholders can have confidence that their role as cash cows will end.One outstanding issue is the right of residents to manage their buildings, which ought to be more easily available as an alternative to freehold purchase. Another is the way that freehold prices are decided. Inflated valuations based on hypothetical development values, introduced by the last government, must be rejected.October’s victory in the high court, in achallenge to 2024 legislation brought by landowners, ought to have emboldened ministers. But instead of moving confidently to a new commonhold model – already the norm in countries including Scotland – they appear fearful.Such doubts must now be banished, and next steps set out. This is a matter of politics as well as principle. Labour cannot afford to disappoint voters who were promised improvements in living standards. Since modern ground rent is a recent invention, those affected tend to be younger adults who may have student loans to repay as well as biggermortgagesthan their parents. Mr Pennycook was right when he urged the Tories to be brave in standing up to property investors. He and his colleagues should try a dose of the same medicine.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

All three have identified the need for those countries that desire to maintain world peace, promote a collective approach to trade and security, and settle disputes by arbitration, should combine to create a body outside of the sphere of the US, Russia or China.There is a growing consensus on the need for a non-aligned coalition of the middle powers, andMark Carneyhas emerged as the spokesperson able to articulate a platform around which nations of goodwill can cluster.To begin the walk along this “third path”, as defined by Mark Carney,Keir Starmerand other western leaders must be forthright in convincing their electorates that this venture will need significant long-term investment. It is a rallying cry which can potentially fracture an already sceptical and bruised electorate, and the work must begin now to convince voters that without such an endeavour, their current way of life can not be assured.Peter RiddleWirksworth, DerbyshireIn 1823, William Webb Ellis, frustrated with the constraints of football, picked up the ball and ran. His defiance birthed rugby – a game where the rules were rewritten, and physicality became central. Today, we seeDonald Trumpdoing much the same in politics. Fed up with the established rules, he has picked up the ball and run, not just changing the game but enforcing his own version of it. He also enforces these new rules and positions himself, as the classic bully does, as the referee of the game too, altering the rules to suit as he sees fit.His opponents, however, are still playing by the old rules. They dangle a foot, hoping to trip him up, or gently tackle with outdated conventions. But rugby isn’t football. The old tactics no longer apply. To stop Trump, his opponents must match his force, wrap their arms around his waist and bring him to the ground. Otherwise, they risk being left behind as the game evolves around them. Mark Carney’s call atDavosfor “middle powers” to unite resonates here. Perhaps these nations, locking together like a scrum, could form the barrier needed to halt this free-running disrupter before he causes further carnage on the field of play.Richard WoolertonCosby, LeicestershireJonathan Freedland rightly points out that a new world order is possible based on a balance of the “middle powers … of the democratic west”. Freedland was concerned here with international relations; he does not address the problem of how to restore democracy in America. The constitutional principle of “checks and balances” was designed to prevent any one of the three branches of government – legislative, judicial and executive – from overreaching its power.The Trump power grab has made it clear that this principle is inadequate. In fact, it depends upon consensus, and is no guarantee against someone who does not agree to play by the rules. It has not, for instance, prevented Donald Trump from building a domestic paramilitary force for his own use. No one in America seems to be thinking about the future – everyone is simply reacting to the present.The best thing that could happen now is a debate – probably initiated by the Democratic party, but ultimately it would need to be non-partisan and with representation from all three branches of government – about whether there is something more durable to replace the checks and balances system, or how to rebuild it with more binding and enforceable powers.Dr Lorens HolmReader emeritus, University of DundeeHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The children of Instagram will be next, 25 January)? Many parents feel under immense pressure from family and friends to share their children’s photos. Academicresearchwith parents shows that many struggle to reconcile their concerns about protecting their children’s privacy with their desire to make their family proud and to respond to family demands to share photos with them.There are increasing numbers of parents who are making money out of sharenting, but we also need to think carefully before we criticise these parents and consider why they may be doing so.Researchagain shows that pressure on parents to ensure their children do well, expectations that parents are physically present to support their children, and workplace environments that fail to support parents juggling home and work, are all key drivers for them becoming influencers. And where parents start earning money through sharenting, but subsequently express concerns about harming children’s privacy, it can be a struggle to get out of it.It is in the interests of social media platforms and the brands that work with influencer parents to ensure that parents post content regularly and that their posts are of interest to a wide audience. Pictures of children are appealing to a wide audience; they sell products. The information that sharenting parents reveal on social media, and also what the parents visiting platforms reveal, is valuable to those platforms.Let us stop criticising parents and instead think about how best we can ensure that parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles understand the potential consequences of sharenting. There are alternatives to mainstream social media that parents can use to share photos with their families privately, such as theKinandFamilinkapps. Instead of criticising parents, why aren’t we telling them about these options?Dr Claire BessantAssociate professor, Northumbria Law School, Newcastle upon TyneHear, hear! Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is absolutely right about children’s right to privacy and parents parading their children on social media. I hope that one day their right to privacy is protected, and that exposing children’s lives for the world to consume will be recognised as a sign of harm. Psychological abuse is already recognised in safeguarding legislation. There is a right to privacy in article 16 of theUN convention on the rights of the child, and in article 8 of the European convention on human rights.What will it take before parents and society see this practice for what it is – inherently damaging to children? With governments exploring banning young people from accessing social media, surely the natural companion is that young people shouldn’t be paraded on social media either? The harms of being on social media and documenting your life on social media are well documented. Why is there an exception that allows parents and caregivers to inflict this harm on those who are too young to consent?Parents are wringing their hands at the erosion of their teenagers’ self-esteem because of social media, but they put their children on that path. They modelled it for them. Granted, when we started we didn’t know it was wrong. But now we do. So let’s stop.Rachel LintheLittle Downham, CambridgeshireExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingSocial mediaChildrenFamilyDigital medialettersShareReuse this content"

As one of “the infantry” playing in and helping to run an amateur orchestra in my city, I wholeheartedly agree with James Murphy’s view that striving with others to give the best possible performance embeds our humanity and connection to each other.It also teaches us something invaluable and increasingly hard to find. And that is that we can only make this kind of musicwithothers and not by ourselves alone. We need each other to play a symphony. We have to work together, listen to each other, follow each other, stay connected. We put the “me” to one side and become an “us”. It’s one of the best collaborative and collective experiences we have available.That’s the only way to make it work and for the magic to happen. The connection between classical music and global politics isn’t immediately obvious – but the invaluable experience gained through playing this music together provides a much-needed antidote to the prevailing zeitgeist of “me first” and divisiveness that is dragging our world to its knees.Chris ScarlettSheffieldHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

So that’s all I can say.“Are [Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz] better right now than me and all the other guys? Yes, they are. I mean, the quality and the level is amazing. It’s great. It’s phenomenal. But does that mean that I walk out with a white flag? No. I’m going to fight until the last shot, until the last point, and do my very best to challenge them.”Serena Williams open-minded about return to tennis: ‘I’m gonna see what happens’Read moreThis match-up will mark Djokovic’s fifth consecutive grand slam semi-final, a remarkable development at 38. He struggled physically in the final stages of each of his four semi-final runs last year, his body unable to withstand the physical strain of six best of five sets matches. But this year Djokovic has spent only nine hours and seven minutes on court while playing 11 completed sets.In theory, this is an extremely positive development for Djokovic, who managed to conserve energy across five rounds and should finally head into his match against Sinner in good physical shape. The problem is that despite being in the semi-finals, he has not won a set since the third round. After receiving a walkover against the 16th seed Jakub Mensik in round two, he was thoroughly outplayed by Lorenzo Musetti for two sets before being handed a remarkable slice of luck. A set away from one of the biggest wins of his career, the Italian wasforced to retire due to injury.Of his 53 previous grand slam semi-finals, the all-time record, there have been numerous instances when Djokovic has entered the final two rounds injured, out of form or struggling in other ways – but usually he has at least been able to draw upon the confidence of winning tennis matches. Here, the Serb faces off against the player who has won more hard-court matches than anyone over the past two years and has dominated their past five meetings with wins over Djokovic at theAustralian Open, French Open and Wimbledon. It is difficult to remember another time when Djokovic entered a big match as such a heavy underdog.Before they take to the court, Alcaraz will attempt to continue his pursuit of the career grand slam as he faces by far his toughest challenge of the tournament in the No 3 seed, Alexander Zverev. There are many details that paint a favourable picture for Alcaraz, who is yet to drop a set in the tournament and continues to play great tennis without the lapses in focus and application that accompanied his genius during his early years on the tour.However, he will still have to produce a quality match against an in-form Zverev who has performed at a high level during the tournament. Zverev is serving well, he has struck his forehand with authority and aggression in the decisive moments, and he has handled himself well in past matches against Alcaraz, their head-to-head record tied at six wins apiece. Still, both Alcaraz and Sinner are exactly where they want to be at the Australian Open as they stand one round away from a potential fourth consecutive major final between them.Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenNovak DjokovicJannik SinnerAustralia sportTennisShareReuse this content"

Martin O’Neill can focus on the most important factor in that he has guided the Scottish champions into the Europa league’s playoff phase. Job done, once again, for the effervescent O’Neill. Ferencvaros or Stuttgart lie in wait after Celtic closed in 21st place.Celtic were fully deserving of their win in what unexpectedly developed into an entertaining clash with Utrecht. O’Neill, thought to be a managerial yesterday’s man not so long ago, continues to do his bit for 70-somethings everywhere. The Irishman will know Celtic must improve to make meaningful, further progress in this competition but such detail can wait. Even continuation in theEuropa Leaguehad looked a long shot at one point. Utrecht will be delighted to see the back of a tournament which yielded just a single point from eight grisly fixtures.Europa League: goals and action from all 18 games in league phase finale – liveRead more“I think over the past couple of weeks we have shown great resilience,” said O’Neill. “I am delighted with the result. The performance, for the most part, was terrific.”This occasion marked more than two decades since O’Neill last managed Celtic in a home European game. Milan were the visitors for a scoreless draw then, in a period when Celtic jousted with the best on the continent. The intervening years have not been particularly kind to Celtic in European context but in O’Neill they have a manager who relishes foreign forays. Far from seeing progression to the knockout stage as a distraction from a domestic title race, he will relish the challenge.Here began what has scope to be a hugely significant few days for Celtic. Victories overUtrechtand Falkirk, coupled with making headway in the transfer market, would raise confidence among supporters who have been unconvinced by much of the campaign so far. The good news to begin with was that Utrecht, already eliminated from this competition and treading water in their domestic league, looked hugely favourable opposition.That notion was proven to be correct rather quickly. It remains to be seen whether Benjamin Nygren will emerge as a strong Celtic player but the midfielder does have a useful knack of scoring goals. He converted a rare, right-foot cross from Kieran Tierney to send Celtic in front. Utrecht decided it was wise to leave Nygren in splendid isolation, six yards from their goal as Celtic completed a short corner routine.View image in fullscreenArne Engels scores Celtic’s third goal from the penalty spot after just 19 minutes.Photograph: Russell Cheyne/ReutersThe second for Celtic was even more disastrous from the visitors. The goalkeeper Vasilis Barkas – once and forgettably of this parish – played the ball directly to the feet of the onrushing Daizen Maeda. In his rush to clear Maeda’s ball across goal, the Utrecht captain Nick Viergever sent the ball into his own net.Any sense Utrecht’s evening could not get any worse, and rapidly, was wrong. The referee, Mohammad Al-Emara, was sent to the monitor to assess a potential handball by Dani de Wit at a Tierney cross. The Finn harshly determined De Wit was guilty, affording Celtic a penalty which Arne Engels cracked home. Celtic have not enjoyed many blissfully straightforward fixtures in this campaign, so were entitled to revel in this one. Utrecht’s supporters, realising the ludicrous nature of their team’s display, took to cheering when three passes were strung together.Some further relief did arrive for those fans before the break. De Wit curled beyond the motionless Kasper Schmeichel from 20 yards to reduce the deficit. It was a smart finish, not at all in keeping with anything the Dutch side had offered until that point.Celtic’s second half challenge was to reduce this to a non-event. As Adrian Blake flashed the ball across the front of Schmeichel’s goal after three minutes of the restart, a warning had been served.It was Blake’s next intervention which triggered panic in the stands. A low shot from 25 yards should not have caused Schmeichel a particular problem yet the Dane was unable to even palm it away. His shortcomings have been an ominous feature of Celtic’s recent history. O’Neill later admitted his team were “flagging”.Celtic now needed breathing space. It arrived via an unlikely source, Auston Trusty heading an Engels corner high into the Utrecht net. It is a funny old game; on Sunday, Trusty’s red card at Tynecastle helped Hearts to win a point against Celtic. Now, O’Neill had cause to be hugely grateful to his centre-back.Trusty’s header extinguished Utrecht’s hope. Amid a raft of substitutions, the game fizzled out in a manner which suited Celtic just fine. O’Neill does not expect to be in office beyond May. If a Celtic upturn in fortunes under his watch continues, it will become reasonable to ask why that should be the case.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueCelticUtrechtmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Marinakis, the Forest owner, would be public enemy No 1 if Sean Dyche’s side end up across town in Athens.Celtic make Europa League playoffs, Forest brush off Ferencvaros, Villa fight back to beat Salzburg – liveRead moreForest cruised into the playoff round with a one-sided victory against the Hungarian championsFerencvaros, Igor Jesus maintaining his impressive goalscoring form to cap a fine few days for Dyche. James McAtee, one of those afforded a chance to impress, completed the scoring from the penalty spot to condemn Robbie Keane’s team to a 4-0 defeat.The last time Forest won three successive home games in a European competition, in 1979, it culminated in them lifting their first European Cup under Brian Clough. While there is a long way to go this time, these are the kind of nights that foster hope of at least reaching the showpiece in Istanbul in May.A week is a long time in this game. Seven days after being booed off by the majority of the Forest supporterswho travelled to Braga, they blew away Ferencvaros, ending the Hungarian side’s unbeaten record in this competition and also their hopes of a top-eight berth.The galling thing for Forest is had they claimed victory in northern Portugal then owing to their margin of victory here and results elsewhere, Dyche’s side would have automatically advanced to the round of 16 themselves. Then again, that way supporters would not have another European adventure to tick off next month, Friday’s draw in Switzerland determining their opponents.“We want to play at a level that shows our intention in theEuropa League, one that hopefully gets you excited about the next round, too,” was Dyche’s mission statement in his programme notes and half an hour after kick-off, those words felt akin to something of a premonition.Forest could feasibly have led by three or four goals but had to make do with a two-goal advantage at the interval, with the homegrown captain, Ryan Yates, one of five changes fromSunday’s victoryat Brentford, influential in both.View image in fullscreenJames McAtee slots home Nottingham Forest’s fourth goal from the penalty spot.Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPAIt was Yates’s first-time cross that the Ferencvaros defender Bence Otvos put past his own goalkeeper and four minutes later Yates seized on a heavy touch by winger Cadu and Igor Jesus moseyed forward unchallenged. The Brazil striker ran at the visiting captain, Ibrahim Cissé, who inadvertently diverted the Forest forward’s shot into the far corner via the faintest of deflections.Forest added a third soon after Nicolás Domínguez’s header struck the base of a post. Ibrahim Sangaré flipped a pass over the top of the visitors’ back line and Ferencvaros allowed it to bounce on the edge of their 18-yard box. Igor Jesus was alert and, after pouncing on the loose ball, he dispatched a first-time effort into the corner.Ferencvaros offered only glimpses of quality, Bamidele Yusuf’s bullet header against the bar a case in point but that did not stop Dyche introducing Morgan Gibbs-White, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ola Aina midway through the second half. Gibbs-White, who saw his penalty saved in Braga, allowed McAtee to seal the win from 12 yards and keep the confidence flowing. “We think we can go all the way,” Yates said.This was hardly a showing to enhance Keane’s CV but, as he pointed out afterwards, there was always going to be a gulf between the teams. “The difference is £650m-worth of players on the field,” Keane said. “I’m disappointed but, overall, I think we’re realistic.”The former Republic of Ireland striker, who went on trial at Forest as a teenager, has established a fine reputation coaching overseas, at Maccabi Tel Aviv, where he won the domestic double, and more recently in Budapest. Keane’s assistant, Stephen Glass, played with Dyche at Watford, while their analyst, Phil Hudson, spent 11 years on the staff at Middlesbrough.If it feels like it could be a case of fate on Friday, the same goes for Keane, who could be reunited with Celtic and Martin O’Neill in the playoff round; Keane played on loan at Celtic in 2010 and under O’Neill for Ireland. Ferencvaros, second best here from the moment Kristoffer Zachariassen’s sixth-minute header cannoned off the inside of a post, will face either Celtic or Ludogorets in the next round.“Maybe it is written in the stars, myself against Martin,” Keane said. “He has given a lot of energy to the club and the players since coming back. It was a club that was very, very down. Regardless of who we play, it will be two tough games.”Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueNottingham ForestFerencvarosmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Elite golfers, who were already obscenely rich, take the bounty on offer from a Saudi Arabian-backed disruption model before shuffling back whence they came – essentially for a trivial penalty – when the novelty wears off. This is hardly sport at its purest. Instead, an admission byBrooks Koepkaand Patrick Reed that they blundered in believing the fairways were greener on the LIV side. The PGA Tour, desperate to portray itself as the big boy in the playground, welcomes one-time pariahs back with open arms. Other golfers who spurned LIV’s fluttering eyelashes scratch their heads, wondering why they bothered.There is, however, an underlying and endearing point. All the petroleum pounds in the world are no substitute for legacy. Trying to match the achievements of Arnold Palmer, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy carries significance. LIV golf has no relevance beyond its own domain. Saudi Arabia has made inroads into various sports but, in golf, the kingdom is unquestionably doomed. LIV is on the road towards oblivion, far earlier than most had anticipated. Only those who will gain financially from its continuation can try to spin an alternative story.Patrick Reed quits rebel LIV Golf tour in latest blow to Saudi-backed breakawayRead moreExecutives at thePGA Tour, who feared for their business when LIV blasted on to the scene, are besides themselves with excitement. No wonder; for years they were berated about their approach to all things LIV. Koepka and Reed may be unlikely revolutionaries but have now lit the touchpaper on LIV’s demise. This circuit, which observers reckon might have burned through $6bn (£4.35bn) since its establishment in 2022, will fail with its objective of seriously rivalling the PGA or DP World Tours.Scott O’Neil, the LIV chief executive, is very fond of telling those under his watch that the tour is not all about the money. Perhaps O’Neil works for free. In fact, LIV is notevenabout the money, as Koepka and Reed have demonstrated. Astonishingly (not really) a team contest between the RangeGoats and the HyFlyers carries no broader relevance whatsoever. Sportspeople like money; the sensible of them like status much more.The most intriguing element now is how and when Saudi Arabia backs out of its LIV experiment. There has to be an element of face saving, just as there must be realism. How do they accept defeat gracefully? Any exit strategy will come from people who hate the notion of their money being wasted or that they have not been taken seriously enough. For Yasir al-Rumayyan, the head of the Saudi Public Investment Fund, LIV has been an intensely personal project from the outset. At Newcastle there is Champions League football. Cristiano Ronaldo continues to bring eyeballs to the Saudi Pro League. Boxing and Formula One operate at the top level in the kingdom.Golfis the one sporting entity Saudi Arabia will ultimately not crack. This is a blow to Rumayyan’s reputation.The Saudis could offer Bryson DeChambeau $500m, $600m or $700m to remain as the poster boy of this tour, just as a degenerate gambler would chase losses in vain. It is not in the interests of DeChambeau – or Jon Rahm, or Cameron Smith – to remain in a world which is so lacking in competitive depth. LIV signed these golfers as major champions. Before this season, they picked up Thomas Detry, Victor Perez, Elvis Smylie and Michael La Sasso. LIV could rumble on in the background as a third-rate operation but that would seem to contradict everything the Saudis want to stand for. Why bother subsidising low-grade golf professionals? A more salient move would be trying to formalise a long-rumoured alliance with the DP World Tour, thereby retaining at least some foothold in the sport. Yet with the PGA Tour underwriting prize pots in Europe, the DP World Tour will be careful as to whose tune it chooses to dance.View image in fullscreenBrooks Koepka is another player to abandon LIV and return to the PGA Tour.Photograph: Seth Wenig/APThe prospect of Saudi Arabia abruptly halting its LIV cashflow cannot be ruled out. Wider market forces are relevant. The Financial Times reported in recent days that Saudi Arabia has scaled back its flagship, futuristic Neom project amid spiralling costs and delays. “We need to reprioritise,” said an official. One wonders how that squares with bestowing $10m on the Cleeks for finishing top of the pile at LIV Virginia. Golf insiders struggle to apportion an asset value to LIV, given its astronomical rate of cash outflow.None of this is to decry completely what LIV has done. The PGA Tour – previously complacent and comfortable – needed the shake-up created by competition. It would be wrong to suggest LIV events are vastly inferior to those on other tours. For ageing golfers – Lee Westwood, Henrik Stenson and Ian Poulter among them – this was the ultimate payday. LIV brought Anthony Kim back from years in the wilderness. It has also provided a decent playing platform for those who simply do not enjoy PGA Tour life.The party is coming to an end, abruptly or otherwise. It is one that will be defined by prodigality. In golf, it is not merely jargon to suggest following in the footsteps of giants is important.Explore more on these topicsLIV Golf SeriesPGA TourBrooks KoepkaEuropean TourSaudi Arabia and sportGolfUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

However, he has also committed to appearing on The Rest is Football podcast, which will be presented by Gary Lineker in New York.Leon Goretzka says Donald Trump ‘makes us feel not only German but European’Read moreDuring Euro 2024 the then BBC trio of Lineker, Richards and Alan Shearer recorded episodes of The Rest is Football together in Berlin, but the BBC’s decision to stay at home and Lineker’s split from the corporation last year have created issues in terms of filming together during the World Cup.In another complication, The Rest is Football is expected to be shot to higher production standards this summer owing to a distribution deal with Netflix, which will be making the podcast available on its platforms after a £14m deal agreed last month.Netflix’s deal with Lineker’s production company, Goalhanger, is understood to include a commitment to produce more than 40 Rest is Football video podcasts during the World Cup, which the streaming platform will want to feature as many big-name guests as possible.Lineker will be in Netflix’s New York studio throughout, with other pundits to join him when they are available. The BBC has told its pundits that it is happy for them to do other media work during the World Cup and many are expected to do so, but it will not subsidise the cost. As a result Richards’s travel costs will have to be met by Netflix or Goalhanger.Shearer will be in the US throughout the tournament on co-commentary duties for the BBC, so there is more chance of him presenting The Rest is Football alongside Lineker in person.View image in fullscreenGary Lineker (left) and Alan Shearer will both be in the US this summer for the World Cup.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAThe Match of the Day presenters Mark Chapman, Kelly Cates and Gabby Logan will be based in the Salford studio for the bulk of the World Cup, although one or more of them may travel to the US later in the tournament, particularly if England or Scotland reach the latter stages.The trio will also have podcasting duties during the World Cup as presenters of The Sports Agents, which is expected to record its programmes remotely.The BBC chose to base its World Cup coverage in the UK in part because the huge travel distances involved would affect its commitment to reduce its carbon footprint.The expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams, resulting in an increase from 64 to 104 matches, has also influenced its thinking. Despite this rise the BBC’s matches will be shown on its main channels rather than on iPlayer, with UK rights shared with ITV.The BBC and The Rest is Football declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsFootballBBCWorld Cup 2026PodcastingnewsShareReuse this content"

Only Adil Rashid has taken more wickets than the 30-year-old for England’s T20 side in the past two years.Ben Duckett is missing from the XI to play in Pallekele, not considered for selection after hurting his right index finger while fielding inEngland’s ODI series-winning victory on Tuesday. Tom Banton will bat at four in his first appearance of the tour, with Jacob Bethell at three.Phil Salt, not part of the 50-over setup, will resume his T20 opening partnership with Jos Buttler. Speaking before the news of Archer’s inclusion, Salt claimed that India are “far and away the strongest team” at the upcoming World Cup.Such a ringing endorsement for the defending champions should probably be expected. India have lost only one T20 series since theirsemi-final defeat by Englandat the 2022 World Cup, andvictory at the 2024 editionhas not slowed them down, with only six losses in their past 40 matches.Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have departed but Abhishek Sharma, the left-hander who punished England with a 37-ball century in Mumbai last year, has filled the space in electric style, topping the International Cricket Council’s T20 batting rankings.View image in fullscreenPhil Salt will resume his opening partnership with Jos Buttler in the first T20 international against Sri Lanka.Photograph: Punit Paranjpe/AFP/Getty Images“I think the [Indian Premier League] is probably a massive part of it,” said Salt. “They obviously had their turning of the corner after we beat them in Adelaide in the 2022 World Cup, probably a combination of all those things.“They’re so dangerous with so much strength and depth. You need your luck at the right time in tournament cricket – everyone’s going to need a bit to beat them.”Salt is right behind Abhishek in those rankings. The 29-year-old has been pivotal for England in the shortest form,an unbeaten 141against South Africa last summer his fourth T20I hundred. In his last international series, against New Zealand in October, he contributed a match-winning 56-ball 85. After 50 T20Is, the numbers are in decent health: an average of 38.5 to go with a strike rate a touch under 170.“I really like watching [Abhishek] bat,” Salt said. “I’ll be honest with you, last night I was disappointed because he got out early [against New Zealand]. It’s something that’s in the back of my mind – it’s nowhere near the front of my mind – but I’d like to catch him. I’d like to go past him in the rankings. That’s been my goal for a while, even when [Suryakumar Yadav] was number one. A completely different batter, but I still wanted to catch him.”Despite his 20-over dominance, Salt lost his ODI spot after last year’s Champions Trophy. He said he has “not asked that question” about where he sits in England’s plans for that form. “At the moment it’s about being the best T20 player I can be.For me, focusing on myself, I’ve got an opportunity to say: ‘This is my chance in my career to be the best I can possibly be at T20 cricket’, to put all my energy into that. That’s the way I see it right now.“As of right now, everything’s about being the best T20 player I can be and winning as many games as possible for England.”Salt has never faced Sri Lanka before but, having talked in the past about studying footage and bowlers’ pitch maps, will do his homework. “I’m not a spreadsheet man. But I’ll be having a good chat with Rupert [Lewis, the team analyst] at the ground [at training]. Watching as much footage as possible of these guys. I think that’s the most important bit for me.“I’ll have a good look at [Sri Lanka] in the warm-up, when the bowlers are bowling. More than anything right now, it’s for me to have clarity on where they miss, what their plans are. It’s really simple, it’s not Moneyball by any stretch of the imagination.

With theSix Nationschampionship commencing next week, England’s full-back wants one-handed “flapping” by chasing players to be banned, with all jumpers required to make a two-handed effort to catch the ball.With the England coach, Steve Borthwick, suggesting he expects Wales to kick the ball “50 times” when they come to Allianz Stadium next weekend, Steward says it is now much harder to collect high balls with consistent success because of the spoiling tactics of onrushing opponents encouraged by the crackdown on defensive escort runners.Bundee Aki to miss Ireland’s Six Nations opener against France over ‘disrespect’Read more“It’s probably more difficult than ever to come down clean with the ball with this new law,” said Steward, confirming he would be “a big advocate” of a tweak to the existing regulation. “A law change where they have to make a genuine attempt to catch the ball would be really positive. It’s too easy for wingers just to be a nuisance.“It probably lacks a bit of skill just being able to throw your body in and flail an arm. I’ve struggled with it because I have that expectation of myself that you want to come down with absolutely everything. It’s very difficult to do that nowadays.”Steward, in line to start at No 15 against Wales, has also revealed the situation has forced him to alter his technique in a way that puts opponents at greater risk of injury. “Before I could probably go up with less speed and less height,” said Steward. “Now you have to be at max speed and max height and get your knee in the right position if you want to come down with the ball.“It’s so much more physical in the air now. It used to be quite a safe space. Now you have to be braver and almost expect a collision every time you go up. I used to turn my body a bit and almost lead with my hip. Now I’m trying to catch a lot squarer so my knee is a genuine battering ram.“If a winger is trying to flap they often turn their back so it’s almost like: ‘Right, I’m going to try and knee you in the back as hard as I can.’ As hard as that is, that makes them think twice about coming and flapping again. It’s almost prioritising the physical bit rather than the ball which is a bit different. But that’s something I’ve had to do. You have to adapt if that’s the way the game goes.”Clamping down on flying “taps” would effectively mirror the situation surrounding one-handed knockdowns by defenders that are penalised by referees. On the plus side, the increasing number of loose balls potentially offers more opportunities for broken-field running and counterattacks. It has yet, however, to reduce repetitive box kicking by teams hoping to benefit from any “crumbs” that might fall their way.The 25-year-old Steward predicts there will be plenty more “up-and-unders” in this year’s Six Nations. “I think we will see an increase in contestable kicking in this tournament, for sure. With the law changes it’s become a tactic a lot of teams will go for. Teams are being smart now and you can see them putting players on the other side of the ball. It’s almost like a game of chess.”There are others, however, who like the existing law on the grounds it encourages a fairer contest for the ball. The world champions, South Africa, unsurprisingly, would prefer to stick with the status quo with more defensive knock-ons potentially leading to more scrums. “We are going in the right direction with how the aerial contest has been cleaned up,” said the assistant Springbok coach Mzwandile Stick.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionEngland rugby union teamSix Nations 2026Six NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was finally cleared of the allegations when the Crown Prosecution Service withdrew the charges in 2023, after his ex-partner stepped back from giving evidence at a retrial.The CPS said at the time: “We have determined there is no longer sufficient evidence available to proceed in respect of the controlling or coercive behaviour charge and that it is no longer in the public interest to prosecute the remaining assault charges.”Since the collapse of the case, there have been growing calls for the 52-year-old to be included among the prestigious list of the Premier League’s greatest players. Giggs made 963 appearances for United from 1991 to 2014, scoring 168 goals. He holds the record for most Premier League titles won by any player, at 13. In December, Giggs said the Hall of Fame was “not something that I really think about”. He told the Daily Mail: “If it happens, great. If it doesn’t, then I won’t lose sleep over it.”The Premier League is understood to have been in dialogue with Giggs’s agents since 2020 and conversations were last held before the most recent Hall of Fame induction ceremony in November.In a statement, not directly addressing the situation of any one player, the Premier League said: “The hall of fame shortlist is selected at the discretion of the Premier League in consultation with members of the Premier League awards panel. The final inductees each year are determined by the existing members of the hall of fame. The shortlist is reviewed on an annual basis with a number of factors taken into account including previous shortlist voting data, eras, player positions and achievements. New players who meet the criteria for selection become eligible upon their retirement from professional football.”Explore more on these topicsRyan GiggsManchester UnitedWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump did not give a start or end date for the ceasefire.Both Russia andUkraineseemed surprised by Trump’s public announcement of the agreement. Zelenskyy later wrote that a ceasefire on power plants and other vital energy infrastructure had been discussed between the two sides and that he “expects the agreements to be implemented”.“The situation is unfolding overnight and the reality at our energy facilities and in our cities will reflect this in the coming days,” he said.Russian and Ukrainian social media channels close to the military had speculated about a short ceasefire before Trump’s announcement, but the reports had not been confirmed. On Thursday morning the Kremlin declined to discuss whether an energy ceasefire had been negotiated.Trump also claimed he had informed Ukrainian officials about the ceasefire. “Ukraine … almost didn’t believe it but they were very happy about it,” Trump said.‘An attempt to break people’: Bucha holds out amid Russia’s weaponisation of winterRead moreTwo recent Russian missile and drone strikes left more than1 million people in Kyiv without powerand more than 6,000 buildings without heating, according to Reuters.

Asked about security guarantees the west had pledged to Ukraine in the event of a deal, Ushakov said: “No one agreed on this.”Ukraine and Russia are expected to continue talks in Abu Dhabi this weekend that will focus specifically on military contacts and efforts at monitoring a potential ceasefire.Trilateral talks including US officialslast week were the first time the three sides had sat down to negotiations since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022.Ushakov was guarded when asked whether the talks were at an advanced stage. “We held the first round of negotiations within the framework of the security working groups. That’s where we are,” he said.LiveRussia launches ‘brutal’ attack on Ukraine’s two largest cities – videoOn Thursday evening, Zelenskyy said he had intelligence that Russia was preparing for a new strike against Ukraine. “Our intelligence has provided information on this issue and it is necessary that the US,Europeand all our partners understand how this discredits the diplomatic discussions,” he wrote.Earlier, he had warned of Russia “using the negotiating process with the cynical, harsh goal of delaying new measures of pressuring Russia [to make peace] that could work”.Earlier this week, a Russiandrone strike on a Ukrainian passenger trainkilled five people onboard, according to Ukrainian prosecutors.

Local media said Schafroth was reported to the police and fined.Avaaraq Olsen, the mayor of Sermersooq district, which includes the capital, was outraged. “Raising a flag at our capital cultural centre, the flag of a military superpower that for weeks has been implying military force against our country, is not a joke. It is not funny. It is immensely harmful,” she said in a statement.‘Are they going to bring their violence here?’: Fear – but little preparation – as threat of invasion looms over GreenlandRead moreOlsen said Greenlanders, particularly children, were worried and afraid about the current situation. “When you amplify those fears for content, clicks or laughs, you are not being bold or creative. You are adding to the distress of an already vulnerable population,” she said.“So, pause before you film. Think before you stage something ‘funny’. Consider whether your next question or stunt will inform the world or simply make a child cry or a family feel less safe in their own country.”Greenland’s government is working to alleviate the stress and anxiety among the population caused by Donald Trump’s repeated threats to seize the Arctic territory.Schafroth is known inGermanyfor his involvement in the satirical programme Extra Drei, which is broadcast on the NDR channel and attracts more than 1 million viewers. In a statement to Germany’s Der Spiegel and the Ritzau agency, the channel expressed its regrets after the incident.Trump’s longstandingterritorial designs on Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, have triggered the most serious crisis in Nato’s history. He has since backtracked on a threat of using force to acquire Greenland and begun talks with Copenhagen and Nuuk.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandGermanyDenmarkEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It also documented the use of formaldehyde, a known human carcinogen, on several occasions to treat fungal infections on fish at organic farms.The tribunal’s decision this week is the culmination of an 18-month battle for disclosure, after WildFish first requested to see Soil Association’s reports under environmental information regulations in May 2024.Soil Association Certification had argued that it was not a public body and so any legal disclosure obligations lay with its delegating authority, the environment department (Defra).It appealed against an initial decision by the Information Commissioner’s Office, but this was dismissed by the independent first-tier tribunal – a decision that could have wider implications for other control bodies operating in the organic food production sector.Dominic Robinson, the chief executive of Soil Association Certification, said the organisation had not sought to withhold information. He said it was contracted to provide the information to Defra, which in turn determined the appropriate disclosure.“It is the right reporting channels for the information, not the reporting of the information itself, that is in question and that we seek to ensure is clearly set out,” he said.The Soil Association is now holding a public consultation on tightening its standards for organic salmon, after last year warning it could withdraw from the sector unless progress was made on environment and welfare by summer this year.Explore more on these topicsFoodFish (Food)Fish (Environment)Fishing industryFood & drink industryRegulatorsFood safetynewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "Temperatures in Minnesota can plummet to under -10C in the winter. Photograph: Chris Kieger/ReutersMinnesota housing project to draw energy from water stored deep underground, 45 years on from city’s initial researchByPhil McKennaThu 29 Jan 2026 12.33 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 12.35 ESTShareNearly half a century ago, the US Department of Energy launched a clean energy experiment beneath the University ofMinnesotawith a simple goal: storing hot water for months at a time in an aquifer more than 100 metres below ground.The idea of the seasonal thermal energy storage was to tuck away excess heat produced in summer, then use it in the winter to warm buildings.Now, 45 years after the first test wells were drilled under the university’s St Paul campus, one of the first large-scale aquifer thermal energy systems in the country is being built less than 10 miles from the original test site.The Heights, a mixed-use development rising from a former golf course on the city’s Greater East Side, will tap thermal energy from an aquifer 100 to 150 metres below ground.Groundwater from wells spread across the northern half of the 45-hectare development will be drawn by high-efficiency electric heat pumps, powered in part by solar panels, to provide low-cost heating and cooling with little greenhouse gas emissions for 850 homes and several light-industrial buildings.The groundwater could also serve as a thermal battery, storing excess heat in the summer for use in the winter, said Michael Ahern, senior vice-president for system development at Ever-GreenEnergy, the firm designing the heating and cooling system.The system will be one of the first large-scale aquifer thermal energy projects operating in the US since the Department of Energy field tests in the 1980s, although more than 3,000 similar systems havebeen built worldwide, according to a 2024 study, with the vast majority in the Netherlands.Marc Hoyer, a retired scientist who worked for the Minnesota Geological Survey and the University of Minnesota, worked on the St Paul project in the 1980s. He and other survey members took turns sleeping in a trailer next to wells, waking each hour to record temperature and pressure gauge readings as part of their round-the-clock monitoring of the system’s performance. Seasonal storage promised to “significantly reduce the need to generate primary energy in the United States,” and aquifers were seen as “the most cost-effective approach,” concludeda federal reportpublished in 1991 by what is now known as the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.Hoyer, now 82 and living in Maryland, said it felt good to hear that the technology was drawing renewed attention in the US. “I figured nobody cared about it,” he said.‘The LED ofheating andcooling’Compared with conventional heating and cooling methods, aquifer thermal energy storage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 74% according to the 2024 study. That represents an efficiency increase similar to switching from conventional incandescent lighting to light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, according to the Department of Energy.“This is the LED version of heating and cooling,” said Yu-Feng Lin, director of the Illinois Water Resources Center.Aquifer-based heating and cooling works similarly to air-source heat pumps, an electric technology that relies on outdoor air to warm and cool buildings. The devices are highly efficient, but when temperatures spike in the summer or plummet in the winter, the fans and compressors used by air-source heat pumps have to work harder, reducing their efficiency when they are needed most. But while the air temperature in Minnesota can swing from the 30Cs in the summer to under -10C in the winter, the aquifer beneath The Heights remains approximately 10C throughout the year.View image in fullscreenMichael Ahern of Ever-Green Energy shows where the wells will be drilled at The Heights.Photograph: Phil McKenna/Inside Climate News“Think about how much energy you are saving there,” said Lin, who is a principal investigator foran international consortium led by the US Geological Surveythat develops standards and best practices for thermal energy storage. “A lot of people think about geothermal as just hot lava [and] hot steam that pushes a turbine to generate electricity. That’s not all of geothermal.”And charging a portion of the aquifer with warm water in the summer can raise its temperature by several degrees, making winter heating even more efficient, Lin said, while cooling other parts of the aquifer with cold water in the winter can reduce the amount of energy required for air conditioning in the summer.The system is similar to geothermal heating and cooling networks already in useelsewhere in the region, which use layers of rock and sediment as sources and sinks of thermal energy. The main difference is that aquifer geothermal requires far less drilling.The costs for the two approaches are comparable, as the water wells used for aquifer geothermal are larger and significantly more expensive to drill. Aquifer geothermal also requires access to shallow underground aquifers, which do not exist everywhere but are a good fit for Minnesota, which has an abundance of subsurface water.“It kind of makes sense to utilise that local resource,” said Rob Thornton, president and CEO of the International District Energy Association, an industry group.AlocalresourceOn a tour of the site in late June, Ahern’s boots sank into soft mud from a recent rainstorm. “This was all just a golf course. You can kind of get a sense of it from the rolling hills.”While the Trump administration is quickly phasing out tax incentives for wind and solar, credits for geothermal projects approved as part of the Inflation Reduction Act remainlargely intact. The aquifer thermal energy system at The Heights – including the wells, heat exchangers and pipe network – will cost about £8.9m ($12m) to construct. This does not include the heat pumps and other equipment that will go in each building. Federal tax credits should cover about 50% of the system’s total cost, Ahern said.For Cheniqua Johnson, a St Paul city council member representing Ward 7, an adjacent neighbourhood on the city’s east side, the projected cost savings for residents of The Heights could be significant.“It is the difference between paying a $200 to $300 per-month bill, and less than $100,” said Johnson, who is also treasurer of the Saint Paul Port Authority. “That is what we’re striving for.”Johnson added that many people in her community had had their gas or electricity shut off by their utility company because they were unable to pay their bills.Darcy Solutions, an aquifer geothermal energy startup in St Paul, is overseeing well drilling for a separate geothermal system on the location which will provide heating and cooling fora new service center for Xcel Energy, a gas and electric utility that will be the first large employer to move in at the site.Kristine Williams, Saint Paul Port Authority’s chief development officer, said the geothermal effort there could be a sign of things to come.“I think that this type of industrial development, while it’s unique today, is what we will see going forward,” Williams said.This article originally appeared onInside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organisation that covers climate, energy and the environment.

Much of this new capacity will be devoted to the vast electricity needs of AI, with a third of the 252 gigawatts of gas power in development set to be situated on site at datacenters.All of this new gas energy is set to come at a significant cost to the climate, amid ongoing warnings from scientists that fossil fuelsmust be rapidly phased outto avoid disastrous global heating.Chart showing gas-powered capacity increasingThe gas projects in development in the US will, if all completed, cause 12.1bn tonnes in carbon dioxide emissions over their lifetimes, which is double the current annual emissions coming from all sources in the US. Worldwide, the planned gas boom will cause 53.2bn tonnes of emissions over projects’ lifetimes if fulfilled, pushing the planet towards even worse heatwaves, droughts, floods and other climate impacts.“Locking in new gas plants to meet uncertain AI energy demand means hard-wiring decades of pollution into a gambit that could be solved with flexible, clean power,” said Jenny Martos, project manager at GEM’s oil and gas plant tracker.“As the AI bubble inflates, the US must decide whether it will double down on a fossil future while the rest of the world pivots to renewables.”Several countries around the world are betting big on gas, according to GEM’s tracker, which tallies projects that have been announced or are at various stages of construction. Last year, China, the world’s largest carbon emitter, installed 22.4GW of gas, its most gas capacity ever for single year.But it is the US that is leading the way, accounting for nearly a quarter of all global gas capacity in development, followed by China, Vietnam, Iraq and Brazil. Texas is the center of this boom in the US, with 57.9GW of new gas power under way last year, leading Louisiana and Pennsylvania. In 2026, new gas additions are set to surpass the annual record of 100GW of new gas added in the US, set in 2002.chart showing  US leading on gas fired capacity globallyMuch of this power will be swallowed up by vast datacenters being built by tech companies to grow the AI industry. The growth of AI has been enthusiasticallypromotedby Donald Trump, with the president stating his administration will do “whatever it takes” for the US to lead in AI, vowing to sweep away “foolish rules” that slow the build-out of datacenters.The proliferation of datacenters has, however, caused abumpin greenhouse gas emissions and boosted demand for electricity. This has raised power bills for many Americans,despite Trump’s promise to cut such costs in half in his first year in office.chart showing US gas-fired power plant capacity triplingThe administration has alsoblockednumerous clean energy projects and has escalated the export of liquified natural gas, with both measures raising the price of energy for American households, experts say. Domestic gas prices rose last year and, after a static 2026, areforecast to surge again next year.“Frenzied datacenter growth with little transparency or guardrails puts the public at risk of massive cost increases,” said Steve Clemmer, director of energy research at the Union of Concerned Scientists, whichpredictselectricity demand in the US could explode 60% by 2050 due to new datacenters.A grassroots backlash against datacenters over power bills and the facilities’ rampant use of water has, however, halted some projects and caused a political headache for Republicans, with Trumprecently promisingthat big tech companies such as Microsoft will “pay their own way” for the new infrastructure, although details on such a plan are scant.“I said, You can’t create this much energy,” Trump conceded recently at a speech in Davos, Switzerland. “We needed more than double the energy currently in the country just to take care of the AI plants, and I said we can’t do that.”The datacenter juggernaut shows little sign of slowing down, however, withplanssuch as tech giant Meta building a $1.5bn datacenter, powered by gas, in El Paso, Texas.In western Pennsylvania, meanwhile, a shuttered coal plant isset to be resurrectedas the largest gas-fired facility in the US in order to service a datacenter campus. The plan for the 3,200-acre Homer City site, about 50 miles east of Pittsburgh, has divided the local community, according to Tom Pike, director of campaigns at the Clean Air Council, a local green group.“The coal plant was an environmental monstrosity, but it was a pillar of the local economy and some people are nostalgic for that,” Pike said.“But no one wants to live next to a datacenter. The ammonia, and the smell of that, from gas will be worse than the coal plant, and the power generated will be used in service of private profit rather than keep households’ lights on.“There’s no way it won’t impact power prices, either. There is tremendous public concern about this plan.”Explore more on these topicsGreenhouse gas emissionsGas (Business)Gas (Environment)AI (artificial intelligence)Climate crisisFossil fuelsEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

A precious necklace that has been draped around a seaside Town in England called Margate.”She said she had known Emin for more than 25 years and was a fan of “her extremely personal and provocative work”, and she praised her for creating a “remarkable” artist residency programme at TKE Studios, which invites young artists from around the world to stay and paint for several month-long stints.She said these artists “would have no place to paint and develop their talent and be a part of the many exhibitions that happen around Margate”.View image in fullscreenMargate has been transformed in recent years as a result of an influx of artists, musicians and celebrities.Photograph: Phillip Roberts Photography/Alamy“I’ve been there a few times now and I’m always struck by the commitment and passion of all of these artists. Hungry, possessed, and extremely grateful to have this opportunity. They all have very touching stories to share and honestly it’s so refreshing to witness them working in such a dedicated way,” Madonna wrote.As well as calling the local community of writers and performance artists, photographers and painters “my idea of heaven”, she shared her love for a local Italian restaurant, which “I’m not giving anyone the name of because then everyone’s going to go there and it only has one table,” she said. Local people have speculated she was referring to Bottega Caruso.In October, Isle of Thanet News reported that the singer had been spotted at the Carl Freedman Gallery and Emin’s TKE Studios and that she ate in the family-run restaurant, which has a single long sharing table for diners to sit at.The Sunreportedthat Madonna was spotted last weekend attending the grassroots arts festival Off Season, which takes place in art studios and warehouses across the town.Madonna is not Emin’s first celebrity visitor: in August the actor and singer Gina Gershon, who has starred in Cocktail, Showgirls, Face/Off and High Rollers, joined the artist at Margate Pride.The once-struggling seaside town has been transformed in recent years as a result of an influx of artists, musicians and celebrities – although it still retains pockets of deprivation, with some neighbourhoods ranking among the poorest in the UK. Many longer-term residents have been frustrated to find they are increasingly priced out of the local housing market by the town’s gentrification.The opening of the Turner Contemporary sparked interest in the town’s creative credentials, while its moniker as “Shoreditch-on-Sea” was cemented when the former Libertines singer Pete Doherty opened a hotel, the Albion Rooms, in 2017. Doherty left Margate in 2020, though he returned to captain Margate FC in a friendly in 2025.The Crown star Emma Corrin is another famous local resident, while Lily Allen, Sam Mendes and Olivia Colman have all been spotted perusing the town’s sandy shores and streets lined with coffee shops, art galleries and independent restaurants.In 2023, Pedro Pascal, the star of The Last of Us, was spotted with the art podcasters Robert Diament and Russell Tovey at the Rhodes Gallery to see an exhibition dedicated to him, only to find it closed. The trio took a selfie captioned “Margate art friends reunited”.Explore more on these topicsKentMadonnaTracey EminEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Many of these changes are designed to help spot potential issues before they become a risk to patient care.View image in fullscreenVivaan Sharma was seven years old when he was harmed by leg-lengthening surgery carried out by Jabbar.Photograph: Family handout/PA“We know this comes too late for the families affected by this issue, but we are committed to ensuring our hospital is a better and safer place for all current and future patients.”The report found that 36 children suffered severe hurt, such as delayed diagnosis or failed surgery, while 39 patients came to moderate harm and 19 patients were mildly harmed, such as being given unnecessary general anaesthetic. The study also reported that 642 patients did not come to harm that could be attributed to the surgeon.The report follows aprevious reviewof the hospital’s paediatric orthopaedic service by the Royal College of Surgeons afterconcerns were raisedby some patients’ families as well as staff.Some of the children reportedly ended up with one leg up to 20cm shorter than the other, while others were left with ongoing chronic pain and one child had a limb amputated, which experts said later could have been avoided.Gosh said it had already implemented the royal college’s recommendations, which included more training on dealing with complaints, better support for whistleblowing, all surgical patients to be reviewed by multidisciplinary teams, and ensuring the most complex cases were discussed with the Royal National Orthopaedic hospital.Jabbar, who now works in the United Arab Emirates, no longer has a licence to practise medicine in the UK.Responding to the findings, NHS England announced its own independent review, due to start in February, which will focus on potential failures in governance. An NHS England London spokesperson said: “The issues raised in the report are deeply distressing for everyone affected. As the commissioner of services, we have a responsibility to make sure the NHS learns and improves when standards fall short.View image in fullscreenJames Wood, of Great Yarmouth, is among those who suffered ‘severe’ harm and was subjected to an ‘unacceptable’ standard of surgery.Photograph: Family handout/PA“We are commissioning an independent patient safety investigation to examine how Great Ormond Street hospital responded when potential harm was identified within the limb-lengthening service. This will add to the existing understanding of what happened in this case and make sure that the NHS learns from this to protect children, young people and their families in the future.”Julia Reynolds, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, which is representing some of the families of the children affected, said too few families were asked by the review team about their cases, in effect ignoring them again.“Patients have been left too long to learn that Gosh now acknowledges the severe harm that Yaser Jabbar caused to children in his care and that they did not listen when patients and even other staff raised concerns.“Although reassurances have been offered, only time will tell that Gosh has understood that managers need to listen to patients who tell them they believe something is wrong with the treatment they have received.View image in fullscreenJames Wood was 12 when he came under the care of Jabbar.Photograph: Family handout/PA“AsMartha’s lawhas shown all too tragically, this pattern of listening to families too late is something that NHS managers and staff need to address and deal with urgently.”She added that “families need to be involved” – instead they were yet again “treated as peripheral to the learning and remediation process”.Georgina Wade, an associate solicitor at Tees Law, said: “We are supporting a number of patients and their families who have been profoundly affected by Mr Jabbar’s treatment.“In some cases, children with already complex or life-limiting conditions were subjected to unnecessary and invasive procedures that have left them with ongoing, and in some cases permanent injuries. Families describe the emotional and physical toll as devastating, alongside a complete loss of trust in a system they relied on for years.“Many are still coming to terms with the shock of what has happened and are seeking accountability, transparency and reassurance that lessons will be learned to better protect children in the future. I would urge anyone who has been affected by the investigations to reach out to us.”A royal college spokesperson said it was “extremely upsetting to learn that Great Ormond Street hospital’s independent review has identified harm to a significant number of children”.They added: “Fully understanding what has happened is essential so that lessons are learned and families receive the clarity and support they deserve.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This case is truly shocking. Our deepest sympathies are with all the children and their families who have been harmed.“We are working with NHS England and regulators so Great Ormond Street hospital implements all safety recommendations outlined by the Royal College of Surgeons in 2023, including robust systems in place for staff and patients to raise concerns and ensure this cannot happen again.“NHS England will launch an independent investigation into the management and culture of the hospital.”Explore more on these topicsHospitalsChildren's healthLondonDoctorsChildrenHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Sixteen images were identified of a schoolgirl shot “from under a classroom table with the camera angled in a manner designed to capture intimate parts of her body”.In all on Thursday Chan admitted new offences against a further 16 victims, 10 of whom were children at the time. The offences are 12 counts of taking and making of indecent images of children, one count of sexual assault, 11 counts of voyeurism, and six counts of outraging public decency. Video shows him committing a sexual act in a classroom on his own.The Metropolitan police said Chan had also placed covert cameras around his own home for voyeurism, such as recording people getting changed, and had recorded himself sexually assaulting a woman while she slept at his home in Finchley.Chan will be sentenced next month for all 56 offences he has admitted against children, girls and women. He is expected to face a long period in jail and a life sentence is a realistic prospect.At the nursery some of his victims were as young as two, with Chan sexually assaulting four children on nursery premises in broad daylight. Police have found about 25,000 indecent images of children in his possession, and they believe he also worked as a children’s karate instructor.Detectives continue to examine images believed to have been recorded by Chan on 69 devices such as phones, tablets and USB sticks.The extensive offending has led parents from the Bright Horizons nursery to demand answers.The families said: “We are sickened to learn that Chan committed appalling offences apart from his time at Bright Horizons Finchley Road. Our thoughts are first and foremost with those affected by these new charges.“Understandably, these further crimes raise deeply troubling questions about how safeguarding systems could have failed so badly that someone who was a prolific and persistent offender was able to secure employment as a nursery worker and offend without intervention for a number of years.“The harm caused by crimes like these does not end in court; victims and their families live with the consequences every day. Safeguarding is meant to protect children, and when it fails, accountability cannot stop with one individual.“Organisations and those responsible for enforcing safeguarding standards must answer too. No parent should have to wonder whether the most basic checks, protections and accountability are optional.”Det Supt Lewis Basford, who is leading the ongoing investigation, said:“Vincent Chan is a dangerous and predatory individual, and the scale of his abhorrent offending is shocking.“Chan’s history demonstrates to us that he has sought out positions of trust involving contact with young girls, which allowed him to commit his crimes unchecked for so long. He has repeatedly exploited the trust of those around him, proving himself to be a danger to all girls and women.”Anyone affected can contact a National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children helpline on0800 028 0828, between 8am to 8pmExplore more on these topicsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Symptoms include severe pain in the abdomen, nausea and fever, with patients often ending up in hospital.While acknowledging that pancreatitis is rare, on Thursday the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) updated itsguidance, after an increase in reports of acute pancreatitis to the agency’syellow card scheme, which monitors any adverse reactions to medications and medical devices in the UK.To date, there have been 1,143 reports of acute and chronic pancreatitis to the yellow card scheme among patients taking semaglutide or tirzepatide, with 17 reported fatalities. Nearly all (973) were logged in 2025, of which 807 concerned tirzepatide and 166 were related to semaglutide. To date, there have been 146 reports of acute and chronic pancreatitis from those taking liraglutide and 61 from those taking dulaglutide.Dr Alison Cave, the MHRA’s chief safety officer, said: “Patient safety is the MHRA’s top priority and we continually monitor the safety and efficacy of all licensed medicines. For the vast majority of patients who are prescribed GLP-1s, they are safe and effective medicines, which deliver significant health benefits.“The risk of developing these severe side effects is very small, but it is important that patients and healthcare professionals are aware and alert to the associated symptoms.“If you, or someone you care for, is taking GLP-1s and you notice symptoms such as severe, persistent stomach pain that may radiate to the back and may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting, then we advise you speak to a healthcare professional and report it via our yellow card scheme.”Separately, the MHRA said that patients taking GLP-1s had been recruited to theYellow Card Biobankstudy, a collaboration between the MHRA andGenomics England, which will investigate whether the risk of an inflamed pancreas can be influenced by an individual’s genes. The agency said: “It is hoped this will help to predict which patients may be most at risk of adverse reactions and prescribe the safest medicines accordingly.”Responding to the announcement, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, which makes Wegovy and Ozempic, said: “Patient safety is of the utmost importance to Novo Nordisk. We recommend that patients take these medications only for their approved indications and under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional, who can also advise on potential side effects.“We continuously collect safety data on our marketed GLP-1 medicines and work closely with the authorities to ensure patient safety.”Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Mounjaro, said: “Patient safety is Lilly’s top priority. We take reports regarding patient safety seriously and actively monitor, evaluate, and report safety information for all our medicines.“The Mounjaro (tirzepatide) patient information leaflet warns that inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis) is an uncommon side-effect (which may affect up to 1 in 100 people) and advises patients to talk to their doctor or other healthcare professional before using Mounjaro if they have ever had pancreatitis. We continue to work with the MHRA to ensure that appropriate safety information is available to prescribers.“We encourage patients to consult their doctor or other healthcare professional regarding any side-effects they may be experiencing and to ensure that they are getting genuine Lilly medicine.”Explore more on these topicsWeight-loss drugsHealthDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

Apple’s earnings per share, $2.84, also surpassed Wall Street’s estimate of $2.68 per share. Last year, during the company’s first quarter, it reported $124.3bn, typically Apple’s biggest of the year after holiday shopping.iPhone revenue shot up 23% since the same period last year. The company pointed to strong sales of its new line-up of the iPhone 17, which debuted in September. The slate of new smartphones, in particular the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro, has reinvigorated demand for Apple’s products, especially in China, where sales had been lagging behind projections.This quarter the company drove strong results in China with sales in the region climbing 38%. In a call with investors on Thursday, Cook said the growth was largely driven by iPhone sales.“It was the best iPhone quarter in history in greater China,” Cook said. “Our install base reached an all-time high in both greater China and mainland China.”Worldwide, Cook said the number of Apple’s active devices, including iPhones, Macs and other products, has reached 2.5bn, up from 2.35bn that the company announced a year ago.It is widely rumored that Apple is planning to debut its first folding phone sometime in 2026, which would bring it in line with Samsung, Motorola, Google and other companies, which have offered folding smartphones for years.Over the past year,all eyes have been on Apple’s roadmap for integratingartificial intelligenceinto its products. The company has shown steady financial growth as iPhone sales haveremained strong, but investors have worried thatAppleis getting left behind its competitors when it comes to AI.The companyannouncedearlier this month that the rebooted version of its voice assistant, Siri, will be powered by Google’s Gemini AI models. On the earnings call, Cook said a “more personalized Siri” is coming this year and the company believes the refreshed assistant “can unlock a lot of experiences and innovate in a clear way with the collaboration”.Thomas Monteiro, a senior analyst at Investing.com, said Wall Street may be overly fixated on splashy AI instead of the strong demand for iPhones, adding that Apple’s strong quarterly revenue will likely help it weather growing AI spending. “Despite market participants continually punishing Apple stock for the company’s perceived lagging suite of AI offerings, the unseen iPhone 17 demand shows that the actual consumer market is prioritizing execution, pricing discipline, and ecosystem reliability over headline, often incremental AI features,” he said.Last quarter, Apple reported a new record for fourth quarter revenue, coming in at $102.5bn. The news came just days after the companyhit a $4tn market valuefor the first time. Apple’s stock kept rising to hit an all-time high in early December. It’s fallen 10% since then, but is still up year-over-year. In extended trading on Thursday, Apple’s stock rose more than 1%.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyAppleQuarterly resultsnewsShareReuse this content"

I did it because being a mayor has always been my dream job.“[But] we are on the front lines of a very important battle, and it’s important that we aren’t silenced. This is not a time to bend our heads in despair or out of fear that we may be next, because if we do not speak up, if we do not step out, it will be your city that is next.”Frey has been outspoken for weeks against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement [ICE] deployment. Shortly after thekilling of another local resident, Renee Nicole Good, by an agent on 7 January hetold the agencyto “get the fuck out of Minneapolis”.He said the city had hitherto been safe and and a scene of falling crime figures, but it had become less safe as “chaos reigns supreme” because of the Trump administration’s deployment, tagged “Operation Metro Surge”.“It is less safe when families do not feel comfortable going to school or buying food at the grocery store because they’re worried that their very family might get ripped apart,” he said. “It is less safe when we have roving bands of agents marching down the street just looking for somebody who might be concerned. I got to tell you, everybody is concerned when you have that kind of occupation.”Apart from the deaths of Pretti and Good, the ICE operations have resulted in the detention of several school children, including a five-year-old boy, Liam Ramos, who was sent to a facility in Texas along with his father. There have been several high profile clashes with residents who are US citizens, including one episode when a woman was violently pulled from her car after a verbal altercation, when she told agents she was trying to reach a doctor’s appointment.Frey accused agents of targeting individuals on the basis that they might be of Somalian, Latino or Asian origin and said the goal was less about immigration than silencing opinions and narratives that differed from the administration’s.He was applauded when he accused the White House of a following a “might is right” philosophy, singling out Miller, Trump’s influential deputy chief of staff, who is seen as the aggressive architect of the anti-immigration crusade.“Stephen Miller has pushed for this concept, calling it the iron law of the world that might makes right,” said Frey. “Stephen Miller is wrong. Time and again, America has rejected this notion that might makes right.”In a rallying call directed at fellow mayors, he said: “We do not back down to bullies. We stand up for democracy.”Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisMinnesotaMinnesota ICE shootingsTrump administrationUS politicsWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

The warrant sought all ballots from the 2020 election in the county, tabulator tapes, ballot images and voter rolls, according to a warrant obtained by the Guardian.FBI executes search warrant at election office in Fulton county, GeorgiaRead more“My constituents inGeorgia– and I think much of the American public – are quite reasonably alarmed and asking questions, after the director of national intelligence was spotted bizarrely and personally lurking in an FBI evidence truck in Fulton county, Georgia, yesterday,” said the senator Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat. “I encourage all of us on a bipartisan basis to pursue the facts as quickly as possible to understand whether the office of the director of national intelligence is straying far outside of its lane.”In a statement released on Wednesday, the senator Mark Warner, of Virginia, described Gabbard, a former representative and army veteran known for adhering to widely debunked conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, as “totally unqualified” to be one of the nation’s spymasters, citing her presence in Georgia during “a federal raid tied to Donald Trump’s obsession with losing the 2020 election” as evidence.Gabbard only had two reasons to be there, Warner said: either she “believes there was a legitimate foreign intelligence nexus – in which case she is in clear violation of her obligation under the law to keep the intelligence committees ‘fully and currently informed’ of relevant national security concerns – or she is once again demonstrating her utter lack of fitness for office that she holds by injecting the nonpartisan intelligence community she is supposed to be leading into a domestic political stunt designed to legitimize conspiracy theories that undermine our democracy”.View image in fullscreenTulsi Gabbard arrives as the FBI conducts a ‘court-ordered search warrant’ in Union City, Georgia, on 28 January.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAAn unnamed senior administration officialtoldCNN today that foreign threats to election integrity justified her presence, saying: “Director Gabbard has a pivotal role in election security and protecting the integrity of our elections against interference, including operations targeting voting systems, databases, & election infrastructure. She has & will continue to take action on President Trump’s directive to secure our elections & work with our interagency partners to do so.”Gabbard has not personally explained her reasons for being at the warrant operation at a warehouse in Georgia. But she isreportedly compiling researchreexamining the 2020 election on behalf of the White House and Trump, an activity that would normally be outside the scope of her office.Gabbard’s staff told news reporters at the Fulton county elections offices that she would make a statement on Wednesday evening, but never did. Photographers captured her at the site amid the moving trucks for boxes of five-year-old documents.The seizure has roiled Democratic lawmakers in Georgia, who are calling for an explanation.“The 2020 election has been litigated,” said the representative Nikema Williams of Atlanta in aletterto the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, sent on Wednesday. “By continuing to raid election locations in Georgia, the Department of Justice (DOJ), this raid serves to intimidate Fulton county voters and election officials, rather than to further any legitimate law enforcement aim.”Representative Joaquin Castro, a Democrat from California on the House permanent select committee on intelligence, called for an explanation in an interview on Thursday with CNN.“It’s extremely unusual that the DNI [director of national intelligence] would be present for this type of domestic operation, and it’s something that the intelligence committee should investigate right away, should exercise its oversight power and bring Tulsi Gabbard in to the committee to explain exactly what happened,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGeorgiaTrump administrationFBIUS politicsElection interferencenewsShareReuse this content"

Their lawyer, David Aïoutz, said his client would be present at the state prosecutor’s office then.The official and former official have not been named.Documents from the prosecutor’s office seen by Reuters describe both individuals as “defendants” in the case and indicated that past and present town hall officials could be held responsible for safety failings at Le Constellation bar.The bar’s French owners, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, who face formal charges of negligent manslaughter, negligent bodily harm and negligent arson, were until now the only suspects under criminal investigation in the tragedy.The fire also injured 116 people, most of them teenagers. The dead include 21 Swiss nationals, nine French citizens, six Italians, and citizens of Belgium, Portugal, Romania and Turkey; the average age was 19.Authorities believe the blazestarted in the basement party room of the crowded bar after sparklers attached to champagne bottles were held too close to the ceiling, which was clad with soundproofing foam that caught fire.Questions have been raised about the presence and accessibility of fire extinguishers in the basement, and whether the exits – including a reportedly narrow single staircase up to the bar – complied with regulations.Jacques Moretti was held in preventive custody for nearly two weeks before being released on bail of SFr200,000 (£189,000) on 23 January. The couple were due to be questioned again separately on 11 and 12 February, the documents said.There was outrage earlier this monthwhen the town’s mayor, Nicolas Féraud, admittedcouncil safety officers had not carried out the obligatory annual safety check of Le Constellation since 2019.The investigation aims to shed light on the exact circumstances of the fire and the extent to which health and safety regulations had been observed, and to establish potential criminal responsibility on the part of the owners, staff and authorities.Officials for the municipality and the prosecutors’ office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Prosecutors rejected the council’s request to become a party to the case, which would have given it the same status as the victims.“There are … reasons to believe that the municipality failed in its duty to enforce the various regulations for which it was responsible [and that are] intended to safeguard the lives and physical integrity of the bar’s customers,” one document said. “Failings could be attributable both to staff members and to members of the town council, past and present.”The Morettis have expressed their “indescribable grief” and promised to cooperate fully with the investigation.The fire was one of the worst disasters in modern Swiss history and the biggest blow to its reputation since the 2023 collapse of Credit Suisse bank, said Alexandre Edelmann of PresenceSwitzerland, which promotes the country’s image abroad.Explore more on these topicsCrans-Montana fireSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Between 2017 and 2022, England and Wales more than doubled wine production from 5.3m to 12.2m bottles, according to WineGB. It expects wine production to double again to 24.7m bottles by 2032.Vines are being planted as far north as Yorkshireand Scotland as the changing climate and new growing methods make UK wine-making more feasible.Pommery and Taittinger, two of France’s best-known champagne houses, both bought land and planted vines in England about a decade ago, while the world’s biggest sparkling wine producer, Germany’s Henkell Freixenet, snapped up the English wine estate Bolney in 2022.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryKentWineFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

We would go back to the days of having to offload cabin bags and put them in the hold – it was one of the number one causes of delayed boarding in the old days.”Bag charges made up a large proportion of more than £2.5bn in easyJet’s annual income from extras, or ancillary revenue, “and that would have to be passed on” in fare rises for all passengers, he said.“I just can’t explain how stupid it would be, just crazy European legislation,” Jarvis added.While on some easyJet flights, the advertised fare can cost less for a passenger than the price of bringing on luggage, Jarvis argued the total cost represented “incredible value”.The airline was rapped this week by the advertising watchdog for claiming the cost for bringing luggage was as little as £5.99. The Advertising Standards Authority said easyJet had not provided evidence that such prices were widely available. Jarvis called the ruling “irritating” but said easyJet had now amended the wording on its website.Meanwhile, he said easyJet was talking to Starlink with a view to eventually offering wifi on its planes, but had concluded, like Ryanair, that “the economics of the deal don’t work … When the time’s right, we’ll look to add that service, but it’s not today”.A recentpublic spatbetween Ryanair’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, and Starlink’s owner, Elon Musk, over the worth of its wifi saw both calling the other an “idiot”.While Musk’s political activities in the US have been followed by adrop in Tesla salesin Europe, Jarvis said he would not shy away from the brand association: “It will be difficult to deliberately buy an inferior product for your customers because you have opinions on the CEO.“Equally, if you weren’t buying [Starlink], you’d probably be buying the other one from Jeff Bezos. It’s always going to be one of the guys when it comes to satellites.”The comments came as the airline announced increased losses for the last quarter, a pre-tax loss of £93m, up 50% from the same period the previous year, despite a 7% rise in passenger numbers for the period.Jarvis said the losses were partly due to investment in bases at Milan Linate airport and Rome Fiumicino airport, where the airline has to initially run unprofitable routes under a regulatory agreement.He said January bookings for the year ahead were at record levels, with the airline’s passengers travelling further afield to destinations including Morocco, Tunisia, Cape Verde and Georgia.Explore more on these topicseasyJetAirline industryEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Shares inOcadodived almost 10% on Thursday after it announced that Sobeys would be shutting the Calgary facility, saying it was “largely due to the Alberta grocery e-commerce market’s size and the rate of expansion being slower than originally anticipated”.The decision came less than three months after Ocado’s US partner Krogerclosed three warehouses, knocking almost a fifth off the UK company’s value.While Ocado is known in the UK as an online grocer, much of its business is built on providing its proprietary software and robotics, known as the Ocado Smart Platform, to other companies to run their delivery operations.The company’s main route to expansion is via deals to supply its online shopping tech around the world but it faces competition from rival providers while many retailers are focusing on fulfilling orders from stores – a more flexible and often cheaper option.Sobeys will continue to serve customers of its Voilà online grocery service through two customer fulfilment centres (CFCs) using Ocado tech in the Greater Toronto and Montreal areas. Plans for another site in the Vancouver area remain on hold.Tim Steiner, the chief executive of Ocado Group, said: “Sobeys is an important partner to Ocado, and we have taken a pragmatic approach to refining the network and placing our partnership on the right footing … Online grocery in North America has continued to develop, and Ocado’s technology has evolved significantly since our first CFCs were launched in the region.“The changes we have made in our relationships with both Sobeys and Kroger represent a reset of our North American business, placing those partnerships in the best position to secure long-term growth, while reopening a substantial market for Ocado’s much evolved technology.”Ocado said it expected to receive £18m in compensation during the current financial for the closure of the CFC in Alberta, which was set to reduce its fee revenue by £7m in the year.The latest setback comes as Ocado continues to report losses despite growing sales. The group reported a 13% increase in revenue to £674m in the six months to 1 June but made a loss of £137m before one-offs including a gain on the valuation of its joint retail venture with Marks & Spencer.Some analysts have argued that Ocado’s large robot-run customer fulfilment centres do not work economically in developed economies such as the US andCanada, potentially hitting the scope of its expansion.The model has faced competition from the likes of Deliveroo and Uber Eats, which use small bikes and mopeds to make deliveries direct from stores.The remaining Sobeys delivery centres plan to adopt Ocado’s new Swift Router system, which is designed to help them serve a higher proportion of same-day and short-lead-time orders.Explore more on these topicsOcadoCouriers/delivery industryRetail industryCanadaSupermarketsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, only 244 of the remaining branches still provide a full-range of services, including mortgage advice and in-person cash and cheque deposits.It will also leave 291 branch-based workers at risk of losing their jobs. Santander said there would be an unspecified number of alternative roles that staff could apply for and that it and would begin consulting with unions as it pushes through its plans.The bank said it would contact potentially vulnerable customers who would be affected by the closures by phone to help them find other ways to bank.The decision to slash more than 12% of its UK branches comes as the bank prepares for its takeover of TSB. The £2.6bn deal, whichwas announced in July, has prompted fears of job cuts and branch closures across the combined group.The takeover would make it the third largest UK bank in terms of personal current account deposits, behind Lloyds and NatWest. Santander will have to consider how to strip out duplicate roles and branches, and whether to scrap the 215-year-oldTSBbrand, which could disappear from UK high streets.TSB serves 5 million customers through its 175 branches and 5,000 staff. Santander UK has about 14 million customers served out of 350 branches across the country, with 18,000 staff before the latest job cuts.A Santander UK spokesperson said the bank was still waiting for regulators to approve its takeover of TSB. Those approvals would be needed before Santander could make any potential changes to its operations in relation to the deal.It is also facing the prospect of a hefty compensation bill linked to a motor finance scandal, with Santander UK having already putaside £295m to cover potential payoutsto car loan customers last year.In October, its outgoing chief executive, Mike Regnier,urged the government to intervenein the regulator’s plans for an £11bn compensation scheme, claiming current proposals could end up inflicting “significant” harm to consumers, jobs and the broader economy.The Communication Workers Union, which represents Santander UK bank staff, said it had raised concerns over the impact of branch closures on staff and was “fully committed to minimising job losses”.“We want staff to be given retraining, reskilling and redeployment opportunities where this is possible … We believe Santander UK should be doing everything it can to protect its workforce and the local economy.

No More Dream (2013)At the start of their career,BTSwere marketed as a cross between a Korean idol band and a blinged-out rap act: “Our life is hip-hop,” offered band member Suga early on. No More Dream is actually far tougher-sounding than you might expect: the vocals growl, the backing blares, the double-bass sample that drives the intro is great.19. Mikrokosmos (2019)View image in fullscreenHere come the mirror men … BTS.Evidently written with arenas twinkling with thousands of (lucratively branded) light sticks in mind, Mikrokosmos offers a brand of electronic pop that’s both melodically pretty and epic-sounding. Whether you choose to believe the claim that its title actively encouraged fans to bone up on ancient Greek philosophy is up to you.18. Save Me (2016)Part of BTS’s appeal clearly rests on the strikingly un-macho vulnerability they project. Save Me is a case in point. The music is upbeat, bearing the influence of tropical house, electropop and – in the rhythm track of the chorus at least – dubstep. But the vocals deal in breathy desperation: “I’m trapped in myself and I’m dead.”17. Mic Drop (2017)Already huge in Korea and Japan, a remix of Mic Drop by EDM DJ Steve Aoki gave BTS their first US Top 30 hit and breached the UK charts. Still, the original might be the best: trap-fuelled pop, with a distinct hint of Missy Elliott’s Get Ur Freak On about its hook.16. Run (2015)Not to be confused with 2022’s Run BTS, Run is a finely turned example of the band’s gradual shift towards a more straightforwardly pop-oriented style. There’s still rapping here, but what really sticks with you is the wistfulness of the melody and the euphoric surge of the house-fuelled chorus.15. Idol (2018)A riposte to that perennial bugbear, the haters – “I do what I do,” it counsels crossly, “so you just mind your own business” – Idol intriguingly blends South African house variantgqomand traditional Koreanpansori(narrative song), heavy on synthesisedgayageum (zither) and thejanggu (drum). Nicki Minaj turned up on the remix, evidence of BTS’s mounting US popularity.14. Burning Up (Fire) (2016)Another career milestone, Burning Up (Fire) was the first – but not the last – BTS track to top Billboard’s global digital sales chart. It’s a melange of surprisingly harsh-sounding electronics derived from the world of stadium dubstep, stop-start dynamics, sneering, faintly Beastie Boys-esque rapping, and a hook that lodges in your brain from first listen.13. Dope (2015)Banned in Korea for its apparently vulgar lyrics – which perhaps tells you rather more about Korean censorship than the lyrics themselves – Dope lauds BTS’s own work ethic, and decries those who suggest the band are merely puppets: “The media and adults say we have no will … they’re the enemy.”12. Boyz With Fun (2015)Boyz With Fun flew in the face of BTS’s pivot towards a heartfelt brand of pop, applying their rap vocals to a knowingly daft, preposterously fun slice of party-starting disco, complete with a hook line that calls back to Funkadelic’s oft-sampled 1975 anthem Get Off Your Ass and Jam.11. Boy With Luv (ft Halsey) (2019)View image in fullscreenBubblegum … BTS live.Photograph: Bighit MusicBTS’s sixth album, Map of the Soul: Persona, was allegedly based on psychoanalyst Murray Stein’s book Jung’s Map of the Soul: An Introduction, although it’s fair to say you wouldn’t know from the first single. Decorated with a guest vocal by Halsey, Boy With Luv was BTS at their lightest: perfectly turned, toothsome bubblegum pop.10. Boy in Luv (2014)You could, if you wished, view Boy in Luv as a kind ofK-pophomage to the mid-80s productions Rick Rubin created for Def Jam. Certainly, the immense beat and distorted rock guitar has a hint of Run-DMC’s Raising Hell or the Beastie Boys’ Licensed to Ill, albeit with a massive pop chorus attached.9. Butterfly (2015)By the time of their fourth mini-album, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Part 2, BTS had far outgrown their original hip-hop-inspired remit. Butterfly is a feather-soft, breathily delivered ballad, with an unexpected lyrical reference to Haruki Murakami. The Prologue Mix, released in 2016, dials things down further until the whole song sounds like a sigh.8. Black Swan (2020)The first single from Map of the Soul: 7 struck an oddly sombre and jaded note. Over a languid hip-hop beat and the sound of agayageum, the lyrics strongly suggested BTS had had enough of fame: “The heart no longer races when the music starts to play.”7. DNA (2017)A couple of months after its release in South Korea and Japan, DNA provided BTS with their US television debut when they performed the track at the American Music Awards and stole the show. Their astonishingly intricate choreography might have grabbed attention, but DNA’s effervescent pop-EDM clearly had a role to play.6. Dynamite (2020)The first ever US No 1 single by a South Korean band, Dynamite was apparently intended as a corrective to the Covid pandemic. Like another lockdown-era hit, Dua Lipa’s Future Nostalgia, it sounded like a party in full swing, offering a precision-tooled 21st-century pop take on disco euphoria.5. Fake Love (2018)A classic angst-drenched BTS ballad, supersized for maximum impact: echoing stadium rock guitar, immense trap beat, epic synths, shout-along hook. Intriguingly, some fans interpreted its lyrics, most notably the line about “trying to erase myself and make me your doll”, as being directed at the strictures of the K-pop industry.4. Butter (2021)View image in fullscreenFrom left: V, Suga, Jin, Jung Kook, RM, Jimin and J-Hope.Photograph: Lee Jin-man/APAmid BTS’s penchant for high-concept albums, Butter was designed, according to band member Jimin, with nothing more lofty in mind than to be “easy to listen to”. It achieved its aim via hook-laden 80s-inspired funk: there’s a tang of classic Jam and Lewis productions to the synths, a touch of Daft Punk to its sound.3. I Need U (2015)‘It’s ended up being nothing to no one’: can K-pop overcome crisis?Read moreThis was the song that turned BTS into K-pop’s biggest stars, still rooted in hip-hop but more pastel-toned than their previous releases. The backing carries a suggestion of synthesised panpipes and a hint of the musical box, a sweetness at odds with the lyrical vehemence: “I can’t take it! I don’t give a shit!”2. Blood Sweat and Tears (2016)The perfect example of BTS’s ability to absorb voguish musical influences into their sound – in this case the chugging dembow rhythms of moombahton – without sacrificing their identity. It might fit with 2016’s trends, but Blood Sweat and Tears still somehow sounds different, at one remove from the rest of the era’s pop.1. Spring Day (2017)Still the heartfelt BTS ballad to end all heartfelt BTS ballads nearly a decade on from its release, Spring Day was initially inspired by the 2014Sewol ferry tragedy, in which 304 people died, 250 of them high school students; the video comes replete with visual references to the disaster. But you don’t need to know the background to feel the song’s emotional punch. The rapped verses feel closer to impassioned spoken word than hip-hop swagger, and the melody is tear-jerking, which means however grandiose the music gets – booming drums, fizzing EDM synths, a big chorus – it always feels downcast.Explore more on these topicsBTSRankedPop and rockK-popfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The feted photographer, now 90, witnessed major conflicts and disasters up close for decades. You can only imagine, through his widely published black and white pictures, how that might have affected him.McCullin’s latest exhibition, Broken Beauty at the Holburne Museum in Bath, begins with four recent pictures of ruined Roman sculptures. These images – the white ruins photographed against black backgrounds so they float – are reminiscent at first of museum postcards, representations of representations that refer to ancient history and myths of fatal ambition, desire and domination. There’s a crouching Venus, her arms missing and head half-shattered. A hermaphrodite struggles to get away from a lascivious satyr. A headless Amazon and the Roman emperor Commodus, known for his uninhibited cruelty, are fighting on horseback. Their pockmarked surfaces and broken limbs suggest the collapse of the great empires, the fragility of ideals that are obliterated by time, like marble.A homeless man sleeps standing up – McCullin is drawn to these liminal statesMcCullin seems to search for continuity in these sculptures, an acknowledgment that we’ve always been like this – and always will be. And perhaps also, they are a justification for his own role, in representing it, something he has devoted his life to. Will his images of horror have the same kind of beauty, with the distance of centuries?McCullin stopped going to wars in the mid-1980s. He has since photographed landscapes in Somerset, where he lives, looking for solace and healing. But his pictures of the countryside are hardly anodyne: he makes a pond look like a pool of blood, spindly trees scratching the sky like torn limbs. His moribund visions turn open spaces into oppressive, brooding environments stalked by ghosts. If there’s beauty in this darkness, McCullin makes it hard to see.View image in fullscreenAncient and modern … the reclamation yard shot, a shell-shocked US marine and Crouching Venus, about to be hung in the new show.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianThis small exhibition spans more than 60 years of work, from his first published picture of a notorious gang in Finsbury Park, London, that kickstarted his career in 1958, to iconic images from the Biafran war and the Aids crisis. The presentation is unfussy and straightforward, but all the drama is in McCullin’s photographs, glimpses of some of the bleakest moments in living memory. Many of the most harrowing images here focus on young men – their abhorrent propensity for violence but also their resilience and grief.The picture of a group of young Christian Phalangists mocking the dead body of a teenage Palestinian girl who lies on the floor in front of them as they serenade her with sickly smiles and a stolen mandolin, still makes my stomach turn, though I have seen it many times. You think, too, of McCullin standing there, looking at the scene. In another picture, a 15-year-old boy stares right at you, his face glossy with tears. He is at his father’s funeral, having lost him to Aids. Young landmine victims waiting for medical aid, young Palestinian soldiers, topless and carrying guns. A shellshocked young marine’s vacant stare – a reflection of the horror of what they have seen, fighter and photographer. These young men, who once held the optimism of the future, are now ruined bodies among wrecked homes.There are also several pictures from McCullin’s extensive body of UK work, of industrial landscapes and workers, homeless people and poverty on the peripheries. A homeless man in Shoreditch, London, sleeps standing up. McCullin is drawn to these liminal states, somewhere between life and death, past and present.‘It’s been a cesspit, really, my life’: war photographer Don McCullin on 19 of his greatest picturesRead moreThe conflict pictures have a sense of speed that McCullin’s work since could never have. It’s hard to believe he was able to take the pictures in real time. A triptych made in Belfast in 1971 shows riot police edging around the corner of a building, ready for the attack of a man in a suit armed with a plank who advances from the other side, catching the moment he hurls his weapon, blindly, towards their shields.The landscapes can never hold the same immediacy and urgency as photographs like these. They are the “blunt side of the knife”, as McCullin has said, unable to pierce or wound us in the same way. Alongside the ancient ruin photographs and the still lifes McCullin makes in his garden shed, these landscapes are intended, perhaps, as a reprieve for the viewer, and for McCullin himself.His interest in landscapes and still lifes is derived from the spectral presence of his previous subjects. McCullin has talked of the “twisted smiles of corpses” he sees everywhere. This show is a very brief introduction to McCullin’s immense contribution to photojournalism. But it shows that it is in proximity to devastation and death that McCullin’s work feels most alive.Broken Beauty by Don McCullin at the Holburne, Bath, from 30 January to 4 MayExplore more on these topicsPhotographyDon McCullinreviewsShareReuse this content"

The debut feature from writer-director Ian Tuason, about horror podcasters who receive a set of mysterious recordings, has elements of Paranormal Activity, Session 9, Hereditary, The Ring, The Blair Witch Project and The Exorcist, enough sighs of familiarity to give horror fans a scary case of deja vu. It’s not that total originality is expected at this particular moment (this weekend’sSend Helphas been touted as Misery meets Castaway), but given the genre’s overcrowd, it’s hard to see what pushes Undertone above the noise.Chasing Summer review – incoherent small-town comedy is a baffling car crashRead moreWhat it does do is make for an impressively resourceful use of a low budget, the whole thing costing about $500,000. It’s all shot in one house (Tuason’s actual home) and for the most part, any sinister goings on are restricted to audio footage, heard through the headphones of our lead Eva (Nina Kiri, who reminds me of a young Alice Eve). She’s living back home with her terminally ill mother, fending calls from a thoughtless boyfriend and patiently awaiting those from her friend, and maybe one that got away, Justin (the voice of White Lotus breakout Adam DiMarco, replacing the original voice after the A24 acquisition). The pair co-host a podcast that analyses creepy tales, Eva as the skeptic and Justin as the believer, the pair’s flirtatious pitter-patter positioning them as the Mulder and Scully of the audio world.Eva is struggling – her mother isn’t eating and has stopped communicating, she’s worried she might be pregnant, she’s barely sleeping – and while the podcast has provided an escape, their latest discovery is starting to make things worse. Justin has been sent an email with 10 audio files (what if Session 9 plus one) which follow a couple as the boyfriend records his partner’s sleep-talking. Each file gets progressively more concerning, spinning the pair off into research that goes from playing children’s songs backwards to reading up on a demonic figure who kills children (there are also elements of a less effective screenlife thriller like Searching or Missing). Eva soon finds it hard to continue convincingly playing Mulder as the lines blur between what she’s hearing on the tapes and experiencing in the house.Tuason neatly exploits a relatably vulnerable position we’ve all put ourselves in, when the volume is too high on those noise-cancelling headphones that are a little too effective. What else might be happening around us that we’re not aware of? His camera pans back and moves around as Eva is recording, keeping us with her audio but allowing us to see what she can’t, and the build works until it doesn’t. The formula starts to get repetitive as Eva records in small increments then fears something creepy is in the house (the podcast’s start-stop-leave-sleep-start-stop-start-pause recording technique feels wildly inefficient), and as Tuason adds more hokey elements to the plot, as characters essentially read out Wikipedia entries, one’s interest starts to fade. Hinging the plot on the killing of babies is of course magnetically awful, but Tuason’s corkboard plotting gets tangled up in itself, and while the clips still provide unsettling moments, it’s unclear what anything truly means.After starting slow, Tuason then lets loose in the last act, turning a campfire tale into a rickety funhouse, throwing everything at the wall as if he were making Poltergeist fanfic. Kiri’s fear remains palpable, but ours has long gone, the move from audio tease to visual bombast proving to be a grave, and exhausting, mistake. But Tuason also wants to remain inscrutable, and so ends with a now all-too-familiar “is that it?” endnote, giving us the worst of both worlds. We’re led down a dark alley and then stranded, earlier promise fading into a crash of unscary confusion, Tuason never able to really find a way to link the world of the audio files and the real world (unlike in, I know it’s a broken record but, Session 9). It’s a film that manages to be both cluttered and empty.Undertone is ultimately less standalone horror and more sizzle reel for what Tuason can do (as well as warning of what he can’t quite do just yet), and as that it’s worked just fine. Not only did it get snapped up at Fantasia fest by A24 for a reported seven-figure deal, but it’s also nabbed him the Paranormal Activity reboot, inviting him into the world of Blumhouse. Scarily effective then, and a far more satisfying ending than anything he’s yet to conjure.Undertone is screening at theSundance film festivaland is out in cinemas on 13 MarchExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewHorror filmsSundance film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

David Baddiel’s Cat Man is purr-fect TVHe gets bitten by a grumpy moggy, bathes with lions and visits a home for disabled felines. This heartfelt, hilarious three-part homage to kitties is pure comfort viewingGeorgie WyattThu 29 Jan 2026 07.44 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 07.46 ESTShareDavid Baddiel has a mission “to fulfil a lifelong dream of spending as much time as possible with cats”. He wants to put felines in the spotlight and challenge common misconceptions about them being “sneaky, evil and lazy”. Baddiel gets stuck in. He meets famous cat influencers such as Atticus – a stunning ragdoll with 96,700 Instagram followers, who was asked byParamount to perform a promotional motorbike stuntfor the latest Mission: Impossible film. He does kitten yoga, hand-feeds two chatty cheetahs and even bathes with lions. It’s every cat person’s dream!The show’s premise is that cats are popular on social media. The hashtag #catsofinstagram currently hasmore than 212m postson Instagram’s mobile app, and#cat ranked among the top 100trending hashtags. Yet hardly any TV shows are made about cats and their owners. Instead, cat owners, like myself and Baddiel, are often subjected to cruel stereotyping. A few years ago, cat ownership was even mocked by the current US vice-president, JD Vance, who dismissed his rivals in the Democratic party as “childless cat ladies”. Not any more. Enter David Baddiel: Cat Man.From the start of the show, it’s clear that Baddiel really,reallyloves cats. His face lights up every time he meets one. He even sprays himself with catnip to get the attention of the celebrity influencer catKing Louis– a big, caviar-scoffing British shorthair who has 139,000 Instagram followers. King Louisbites Baddiel for playing the “bongos” on him. The “bongos” are a gentle rhythmic pat on either side of the rump. As a passionate cat person and member of the WhatsApp group Apocalypse Meow, I know a true cat person when I see one. David Baddiel is one of us.View image in fullscreen‘Brightens your dreary January’ … David Baddiel: Cat Man.Photograph: Jo Maney/Channel 4Unlike many celebrity-led documentaries, Cat Manis by no means trivial. Baddiel has cats himself: Tiger, Zelda and Ron. They all feature in the show, through home videos and a brief appearance on set. Tiger goes upstairs, and Ron hides behind a wall. However, during the filming of episode one, Baddiel’s 15-year-old cat Pip becomes unwell. Despite his daughter Dolly’s best efforts, Pip dies. Have a hanky on standby – I was a quivering wreck. Because there is nothing trivial about Baddiel’s very real tears on camera. Those tears represent the many people like me who have struggled withthe loss of a pet. As David says: “55% said they hid their grief for fear of being ridiculed.”Cat Man does everything to sway the haters, too. We meet Holly and Colin, who run Holly’s Merry Moggies rescue centre, which cares for disabled cats. People reject some felines because they don’t “look good” on social media. How could you resist Bertie the tabby, who was born with no eyes? Or Dr Susan, a very chatty cat show exhibitor who knows everything about the animals. She is the proud owner of Lucy, an 11-year-old neutered bengal stunner with more than 40 rosettes. Lucy has twice won the Supreme,whichis the cat version of Crufts, run by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (essentially the Kennel Club for cats, but with a much better name). Baddiel attends the Supreme with Dr Susan, who is hoping for a third win, but is sceptical, given Lucy’s age. Lucy does win, and you would have to be dead inside not to have wanted it for them both.Better yet, Cat Man has several celebrity cat enthusiasts: Ricky Gervais, Jonathan Ross and Lou Sanders among them. Each has the same level of affection as Baddiel. “Dogs are PAYE.Catsare freelance,” jokes the comedian Josh Widdicombe, before casually confessing to sharing a glass of water with his. If he isn’t ashamed of that relationship, neither should any cat person be. However, I wouldn’t drink that water.View image in fullscreen‘A stunning ragdoll with 96,700 Instagram followers’ … David Baddiel with Atticus.Photograph: Channel 4All good documentaries must have a balance. Enter the comedy legend and cat hater Frank Skinner, who describes the creatures as “sinister”. He says he prefers dogs: “Dogs are slapstick. Cats are satire.” However, when Baddiel mentions the cat they (sort of) shared more than 20 years ago, Chairman Miaow, I spotted a soft smile and a twinkle in Skinner’s eyes.David Baddiel: Cat Man is the ultimate comfort viewing. If seeingDavid Baddielhand-feeding and cuddling Larry, the No 10 feline, doesn’t brighten your dreary January, perhaps even make you love cats, nothing will. I came away feeling proud to be a passionate cat person and, like Baddiel, I don’t care who knows it.David Baddiel: Cat Man’s final episode airs on 30 January.

A triumph of noise for noise’s sakeStuart HeritageThu 29 Jan 2026 06.35 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 06.37 ESTShareBy now, the fallout fromBrooklyn Beckham’s Instagram broadsideagainst his parents has reached a point of total saturation. There have been news reports, memes, obsessive TikTok deep dives and newspaper thinkpieces covering the story from every conceivable angle. “Brooklyn Beckham is doing his best” said the New York Times. “It’s time to believe adult children when they speak out against their toxic parents,” said BuzzFeed. “The Beckham family feud is every mother’s worst nightmare,” said the Independent. And on it went.So you have to respect Channel 4 for gazing out across this exhausting event horizon of a story and identifying a gap in the market. Until now, nobody has managed to turn the Beckham family drama into a shrill 30-minute primetime documentary where a lorryload of content creators flap their hands while providing no new information or insight. Thanks to Beckham: Family at War, that gap has been filled. Congratulations, everyone.What a baffling documentary this is. It offers a surface-level explanation of the story (a young man severing ties with his apparently controlling family), which would have been handy for a mainstream novice audience, but the entire thing is fully geared towards the sort of terminally online person who already knows the drama in forensic detail, and those aren’t people who are likely to watch Channel 4 on a midweek evening.“Trump and Greenland, tension in the Middle East and ICE in Minnesota,” begins the show, accompanied by footage of terrifying world events. “It was already shaping up to be a huge news week … but then came Brooklyn’s online honesty bomb.” Which, you have to admit, is a wildly plucky way to open a documentary.The documentary’s recapping of the story is breathlessly ridiculous, told via talking heads who run the gamut from people who have Instagram accounts to people who have TikTok accounts. We see the posts they made reacting to the story then we see them reacting to their own posts from the confines of a dingy talking-head dungeon. “I looked at his story and I was like ‘Oh my God,’” one of them says, teeing up the baseline level of expertise we should expect.If you were being extremely sympathetic, you could argue that Beckham: Family at War acted as a celebration of a media event that briefly united the countryIt also skims over the biggest reverberations of the story, namely that “[DJ] Fat Tony gave much-needed context” to claims about Brooklyn’s wedding on This Morning, and that archive footage of the Beckhams proves that “the awks moments kept coming”. Some substance eventually arrives, in the form of a psychologist and a resilience coach (here to contextualise the difficulties of being brought up in the public eye), as well as a brief discussion of the financial implications of trademarking the names of your children into adulthood. But this is quickly waved away as soon as it arrives, presumably out of embarrassment that they take any of this seriously.It’s a Brooklyn v Beckham Inc disaster: what happens when the elephant in the room goes rogue | Marina HydeRead moreIf you were being extremely sympathetic, you could argue that Beckham: Family at War is a celebration of a media event that briefly united the country. In that sense, it is less a documentary and more a weird mutation of those I Love the 1980s shows that used to fill up schedules, where paid talking heads would overenthusiastically react to past events. Except that theBrooklyn Beckhamthing is so recent that nobody has gained the space to apply much in the way of context, so it’s really more I Love This Thing on Instagram That Literally Only Just Happened.The interviewees are all careful to both-sides the issue. For everyone who expresses sympathy for Brooklyn, depicting him as a clueless nepo-baby ragdoll who finds himself being hurled around at the whims of two powerful families, there is another quick to praise David and Victoria Beckham’s impenetrable wall of brand management. Perhaps the most telling moment is when an interviewee proudly declares himself to be “Team Drama”. It doesn’t matter what happened, or who it happened to, because the main thing is that it’s messy and public and famous people are involved.That’s Beckham: Family at War in a nutshell. It is The World at War for people who’ve just been banged on the head, a triumph of noise for the sake of noise.

It is, however, utterly bananasSarah DempsterThu 29 Jan 2026 03.01 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTShare‘Iam charting a more venturesome course outside this society and in doing so I am being true to myself!” snorts BenedictBridgerton(Luke Thompson),flaring his philandering nostrils as Lady Violet (Ruth Gemmell) looks on aghast. “But you still have two sisters who must marry and their fate depends on the family reputation,” she snaps, bustle crackling with maternal indignation. “This requires you to be a gentleman and not … a rake!”At this point, when faced with such period-specific umbrage, it is customary for the casual viewer to insert her monocle and refer to her dog-eared copy of The Crashingly Inevitable Downton Abbey ComparisonsCompanion. And in many ways Bridgerton, bless its ridiculous socks, continues to invite such comparisons with open arms. There are costumes. There is a house. There are scones (pronounced “scones”, of course, not – heaven forfend – “scones”) and scrunch-faced toffs clearing their throats at news from the shires. There are scullery maids a-titterin’ an’ a-gossipin’ and footmen with calves like bowling balls plotting to relieve dignitaries of their britches. There is a string-heavy score that becomes aroused at times of narrative tension and actively tumescent at the sight of a poorly secured cravat.But then the casual viewer watches a scene in which a mysterious society newcomer gasps “It is midnight!” into the face of her enraptured new beau before fleeing a masked ball to return to her secret job as a put-upon maid to her evil stepmother. Chastened, the casual viewer will close said Companion, remove her monocle and, as is customary, reach for the laudanum. This, unequivocally, is Bridgerton. Any similarities to Downton Abbey – and, indeed, any other earthly television series, living or dead – are purely superficial. The Regency romp, based on the series of eight novels by American author Julia Quinn, operates in a world of its own making. It is, as the fourth season makes only too plain, quite, quite bananas.View image in fullscreenWe shall go to the ball! … Luke Thompson as the rakish Benedict Bridgerton.Photograph: Liam Daniel/NetflixHere we are in Mayfair again, girding our bustle as the dandies and debutantes ofle bon tonprepare for another season of balls, courtship, gossip and bums.Francesca (Hannah Dodd) has returned with muscular husband Lord John (Victor Alli) from her home in the Scottish Highlands. Hovering in the wings is John’s spirited cousin, Michaela (Masali Baduza), who brings with her the promise of raised eyebrows and covert Sapphic sauce.Meanwhile, having outed herself at the end the third series as enigmatic gossipmonger Lady Whistledown, the freshly married Penelope Bridgerton (Nicola Coughlan) now finds herself a favourite of Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel, her performance unapologetically pitched two-thirds of the way up a polystyrene beanstalk in Nantwich Civic Hall). “I tire of debutantes,” HRH tells Penelope at Lady Bridgerton’s inaugural masked ball. “Let us turn our attention this year instead to offering up a leading suitor to fire the competition!”Enter the second son, who is, as previously stated,a rakeand is thus not tobe trusted. “Benedict Bridgerton!” shouts everyone at intervals of 30 seconds, shaking their fists at the debauchee as he scampers from the scene of his latest conquest like a dog with a string of sausages. Could his burgeoning “across the class divide” relationship with the plucky, Cinderella-like Sophie (Yerin Ha) tame him? Or will scheming stepmother Lady Araminta Gun (Katie Leung) apply a cold spoon to the lovebirds’ blossoming ardour?While we ponder the possibilities, there is dialogue (“Like the Greeks your baton has been passed!”) and exposition – vast slabs of the stuff that sit in the middle of scenes and block our view of Queen Charlotte’s extraordinary wig (this season’s look: concussed terrier).It’s all utterly bananas. But crucially, it is sincere about it – and its commitment is admirable. The costumes and sets are exquisite, the Cinderella stuff is startlingly free of cynicism and there is much tenderness in the romance department (fret not, bum fans: the banging continues apace).Though previously resistant to Bridgerton’s charms, I am now forced to concede that its puddingy mix of clunking soap and fairytale wish-fulfilment is … watchable.

The adopted and quite possibly the natural daughter of poet and librettist Giulio Strozzi, she grew up in the bosom of the Venetian intelligentsia, taking part in debates from the age of 15. Her tally of 120 published works for solo voice was unequalled by any of her contemporaries. Despite remaining single, she managed to support four children on the income from her music alone. The quality of her output is matched only by Monteverdi.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Virtuosissima Sirena.Photograph: ArcanaVirtuosissima Sirena comprises a handful of cantatas and arias interspersed with effervescent trio sonatas by Legrenzi and Castello. Accademia dell’Annunciata’s lineup of two violins, cello, theorbo, double harp and harpsichord lends the music a shimmering sweetness that’s perhaps more sumptuous than the composer would have expected but is nonetheless enchanting.The musical language is full of madrigalian effects: dissonant intervals to express pain; measured rests to convey sighs and tears. Laura Catrani’s unfussy soprano is emotive in L’Amante Segreto (The Secret Lover), a bittersweet lament over a drooping ground bass, and lively in Costume de Grande (Customs of the Great), Strozzi’s setting of one of her father’s poetic tilts at high society. Riccardo Doni’s direction lets this music breathe and therefore speak.Explore more on these topicsMusicClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Virgin is a series of poems and prose stories aimed at busting myths and challenging stereotypes about sex and the body.McNish tackles the persistently weird and outdated notions of innocence and purity around young women: “Do not tell me which touches have mattered the most / This is your obsession not mine.” In Send Nudes she notes how any shame about those who have sent “a snapshot of your body stripped autumn bare” lies with the person who broke trust by sharing or mocking it, and not with the sender.McNish narrates and, as you’d expect from a poet and spoken word artist, she brings her entire self to her performance, as though she is in the room. Her reading is expertly paced, withering in places and full of tenderness and humour.Elsewhere, she takes issue with the idea that men who have had lots of lovers are “Lotharios” who are good at sex, whereas women are “sluts”. And it is with a note of incredulity that McNish examines the expectation in certain communities that women must be virgins when they marry. It is, she notes, “property-related … instilled by those in power during times when a wife was quite literally, legally, a possession passed from father to husband”.Further listeningCursed DaughtersOyinkan Braithwaite, WF Howes, 9hr 25minWeruche Opia, Diana Yekinni and Nnei Opia Clark are the narrators of this time-hopping tale about a curse passed down through the women in one family that ensures all will be unlucky in love.VagabondTim Curry,Penguin Audio, 10hr 38minThis bracingly sweary memoir skimps on personal details but reveals much about the actor’s career, which peaked with the part of Frank-N-Furter in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.Explore more on these topicsPoetryAudiobook of the weekHollie McNishreviewsShareReuse this content"

Madeline Cash has spotted that a combination of tenderness and satire may be precisely what our times require. Lost Lambs, her debut novel about the Flynn family, is a witty, quickfire book set in a small American town, punch-drunk on clever, skewering lists and infested typographically by the gnats that plague the local church the family attends (“explagnation”, “extermignation”).The Flynns are in a mess. It was easy for Catherine and Bud to be passionate when he was a young rock star and she was an aspiring artist. But since then they’ve acquired three daughters and a lot of Tupperware. Catherine succumbs to the advances of Jim, an amateur artist who gives her “the youthful comfort of being understood”. He’s rekindled her artistic ambitions, prompting her to decorate the Flynn house with nude self-portraits and proclaim an open marriage. She doesn’t yet know that Jim has a collection of pottery vaginas in his basement (“each of these pussies has touched my life”).Harper, 13, is a child genius who has taught herself six languages but is “mythically bored” and regularly suspended from school. Louise suffers from the “plight of the middle child”, stuck “in a prison of her own mundanity”. Escape is offered by yourstruly, an online lover who advises her to invest in equipment to make explosives. Finally, there’s 17-year-old Abigail, the family beauty. Too much makeup tells men you’re only interested in one thing, her mother warns. “Good,” Abigail responds. “It saves me the trouble of telling them myself.” Her latest conquest is War Crimes Wes, a former soldier who now works in private security for Paul Alabaster, the town’s megalomaniac billionaire shipping magnate, who also employs Bud in his accounts team.Cash’s virtuosic wit allows her to warm hearts at the same time as satirising the worldSo here they are, ready to go, in need of a plot – and Cash turns out to be brilliant at plotting, an often underrated art. It’s provided by a combination of church and commerce. Between them, Paul Alabaster and God compete for the Flynns’ souls, with God mediated by Miss Winkle, the local do-gooder who runs the “Lost Lambs” support group that Bud is sent to when he’s too depressed to function at work. One night, a drunken Bud kisses her clumsily as tea splashes from their mugs and they immediately have “wholesome and arousing” sex that turns out to be what Bud needs, more than sex with his hot but dissatisfied wife. Bud now attempts, in the clumsy but ultimately noble manner of the comic hero, to be a better person, and this brings him into conflict with Paul Alabaster.For ages, Harper – bored enough to go through the Alabaster accounts on the family computer – has been telling Bud that there is a shipping container delivered annually that isn’t properly accounted for on his spreadsheets. Now that Bud is trying to be his best self for Miss Winkle, he asks Alabaster some difficult questions. Meanwhile War Crimes Wes is also investigating Alabaster, worried that Abigail has been marked out as the sole female recipient of an invitation to his next high-security party. And Abigail’s best friend, Tibet, a conspiracy theory addict, has been drawn towards speculation that Alabaster’s yearning for eternal youth has led him into vampiric blood sucking. Of course it’s all going to coalesce around the party itself; of course the conspiracy theorists will turn out to have been right all along; of course the sisters will find that they’re more loyal and more sisterly than they’ve feared.The priestesses of the book are Miss Winkle and Tibet. Miss Winkle brings an interestingly unfashionable vision of goodness. “Do you want to berightor do you want to behappy?” Bud asks Harper at the start of the book. Then he chose happiness; by the end, Miss Winkle has revealed that there’s no happiness without rightness, and everyone in his increasingly extended family is learning it too. This goodness is complemented by Tibet’s new kinds of truth. She is convinced that if we each experience “only a tiny fraction of reality”, then we have to come up with new models of pooled knowledge. This leads in her case to an odd vindication of online conspiracy theories, but the novel itself offers its own vision of collective truth.Cash’s virtuosic wit allows her to warm hearts at the same time as satirising the world. The plot may sometimes take up too much of the novel’s air; the typographical gnats may be a little winsome (should that be “wignsome”?); but in an age when the conspiracy theorists do indeed turn out to be disturbingly right as well as disturbingly wrong, and when old-fashioned tenderness and laughter are ever more required, Cash is a happy and energising new voice.Lara Feigel is the author of Custody: The Secret History of Mothers (William Collins).

For more than half a century, the wiry, weird, difficult and awkwardly horny artist (now in his 80s) has been churning out underground comics that lay bare his deepest neuroses, and reflect yours back in the process.Now he is being celebrated in an ultra-high-end London gallery, with pages ripped from his notebooks and framed up like the finest of fine art. Except this isn’t fine, it’s filthy and angry and paranoid. It’s classic Crumb: skinny men quivering with worry and fear and hormones in a cruel, uncaring, senseless world – filled with towering women in thigh-high boots, obviously.The best works are the simplest, the visual one-liners. Crumb flushes himself down a toilet, with graffiti on the wall saying: “Here I sit and can’t get started, tried to shit and merely farted.” Abject, miserable failure and gross humour, that’s Crumb’s world. In other self-portraits he has a gun pressed to the back of his big goofy head, or he’s whingeing about how no one could possibly understand him. “Self flagellation perhaps,” it says in one drawing, “or maybe it’s true!” He’s a terrible, and hugely relatable, mixture of supercharged self-hatred and extreme arrogance.View image in fullscreen‘A broken, terrible dork’ … Untitled.Illustration: © Robert Crumb, 2007. Courtesy the artist, Paul Morris, and David ZwirnerHow could he not be? The world he sees is nasty and brutal and politically anguished. An alien laments the greed and deception of the human race in one image. A miserable man with a dripping nose weeps: “I’ve blown my life, I’m fucked.” Everywhere you look you see happy, healthy humans ignoring and dismissing the poor, tortured little weirdos in their midst.The only solace in any of this comes from women: giant, towering, buxom Amazons. Crumb worships them, idolises them, grasps desperately on to their thick legs. He is a broken, terrible dork, but these women are something good in the world, something pure. In one almost sweet drawing, a little bald guy in a hospital gown tells a huge glamazon that he is so happy and filled with love. “Every moment is significant!” it says in big bold letters in the sky. Where’s the paranoia and resentment and self-flagellation? All gone, apparently, the instant a babe comes into view.Downstairs, the works are all prints from a 1980s notebook, but upstairs it’s mainly original drawings. Direct, hilarious, experimental: he’s got a great compositional eye, a brilliant way with line, and an unbelievably unique style. Up here, there’s even more paranoia, even more horniness – guys either throttling their own genitals or pulling their own hair out. There’s no in between: it’s total sexual deviancy or total anguish. What a life.View image in fullscreenLoving, pure and simple … Crumb’s portrait of his wife.Illustration: © Robert Crumb, 2025. Courtesy the artist, Paul Morris, and David ZwirnerOne portrait of his wife, Aline Kominsky-Crumb (who was also a noted comic artist), swimming in the Med, feels different. It’s not horny or paranoid or gross or intense, it’s just loving, pure and simple. A little moment of unblemished joy in an otherwise pretty vile world.Robert Crumb: ‘I am no longer a slave to a raging libido’Read moreI don’t know what is gained from seeing most of Crumb’s work in a gallery context, framed and whacked on a wall instead of in a printed publication. At best it gives you the time and space to consider each image, to take every one as a single, important, elevated thing instead of just another anxious page in a long stream of anxious pages. At worst it destroys the experience of reading through the work, undermining the original intention and format. The narrative, more comic-booky images don’t work as well when framed on a wall. Crumb is obviously worthy of being shown in a swanky Mayfair gallery, but equally, there is nothing wrong with comic books. They’re cheap, easy, dirty and real, just like Crumb.Either way, Crumb remains singular and hilarious. “There’s no end to the nonsense,” it says in big letters on one wall downstairs, and let’s hope not. Because when the nonsense is by Crumb, it’s pretty damn brilliant.R Crumb: There’s No End to the Nonsense is atDavid Zwirner, London, until 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsArtDrawingRobert CrumbGraphic designComics and graphic novelsExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Is it a gig?” ponderedwriter Robert Macfarlane, introducing the second half of this quirky classical-meets-folk performance. By the end,melodeon and harmonica player Will Poundhad drawn his own conclusions: the encore – an upbeat, gently madcap arrangement of the Sailor’s Hornpipe – would be “a rave”, he joked, to polite giggles from the unequivocally well-behaved audience.Not that the evening had lacked moments to inspire toe tapping and chin bobbing.Percussionist Delia Stevenssaw to that, as she danced between instruments laid out around her like at a jumble sale – among them a set of mixing bowls, one toy piano, a guitar balanced next to a vibraphone as well as numerous drums, shakers and contraptions I’d be pushed to name, mostly played two or three at a time. As a duo, Stevens & Pound bill themselves as a “left-field folk” act. Their mashup of Pound’s folk background and Stevens’s classical training is all about high-energy, rhythmically driven virtuosity.The Silent Planet, their “reimagining” of Holst’s beloved orchestral suite The Planets, featured poetic narrations from Macfarlane accompanied by atmospheric improvisations fromBritten Sinfoniasoloists as well as Stevens and Pound, before conductor Clark Rundell took the reins for each movement. There were some wonderful effects: terrifying, warmongering blasts of conch shell for Mars, bright flares of horn in Mercury, a whirlwind hoedown for Venus. But it also sprawled noisily, the movements sliding into each other in their rapid switches from drones to jigs and reels, while Ian Gardiner’s orchestration lacked the finesse of Holst’s original. Only the new movement, Earth, threaded with the tune of All Things Bright and Beautiful, briefly allowed more breathing space before yet another syncopated romp.The first half showcased older meetings of folk and classical. Britten’s diffident English Folksong Suite andGrainger’s irresistibly knowing Lincolnshire Posy – which saw the Britten Sinfonia’s wind and brass joined by members of Sinfonia Smith Square – bookended a Stevens & Pound medley that transformed the same folk tunes into funky tilts at tango and bluegrass.

Should somebody tell them what he did?Amy WildThu 29 Jan 2026 07.09 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 10.14 ESTShareWhen British people think of Jimmy Savile, it isn’t typically as someone whose style to admire. But at screenings of 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, the latest film in the 28 Days Later franchise which was released this month, that does seem to be what some US filmgoers arethinking.In the film, a murderous cult known as “the Jimmies” stalk the ruins of post‑apocalyptic Britain. Led by Sir Jimmy Crystal, played by Jack O’Connell, the sect are instantly recognisable for their cheap tracksuits, bleached blonde wigs and particular mannerisms.For viewers in the UK, Crystal is unmistakably reminiscent of the entertainerJimmy Savile, whose decades-long history of sexual abuse was only revealed after his death. Over more than 50 years, Savile exploited his fame and access to positions of trust to abuse hundreds of people, most of them children. His crimes took place backstage at television shows such as Top of the Pops but also in hospitals, children’s homes and institutions in which he had cultivated influence and free rein.The film’s producer, Danny Boyle, and O’Connell have been clear that Sir Jimmy Crystal was designed as a Savile-inspired figure. Boyle told Business Insider that the character draws on Savile’s entire pop-cultural footprint, “all kind of twisting in this partial remembrance” that Crystal’s followers then recreate as an image.O’Connell told the Hollywood Reporter his character “models himself on the memory of this figure that was always on TV”, describing it as a warning about the dangers of weaponised nostalgia and unchecked power. “It totally exists in the story to unsettle,” he said.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

It’s not clear when the characters in Bone Temple would have encountered him, given that the peak of his fame predated their fictional lives. But the gang idolise Savile not because he is sinister but because the world never knew the truth, and in this story, never would. The irony, of course, is that the audience do, which is why the imagery is meant to unsettle, not inspire fancy dress.In the US and Canada, however, the reference appears to be lost on some fans of the franchise. Clips, photos, and even dedicated fan accounts of the Jimmies are circulating on social media, showing viewers turning up to screenings dressed as the “Jimmy Gang”, wearing tracksuits, gold chains, cigars, and the signature white bob, seemingly unaware of the real-life Savile scandal that inspired them.Some videos go further, imagining specific dance moves each Jimmy would perform, showcasing their cosplays, or enthusiastically idolising Sir Jimmy Crystal as a character in his own right.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

Netflix’s Tiger King star Carole Baskin once fell victim to a bad-taste prank by the Australian comedian Tom Armstrong, who paid for one of her $199 personalised video messages asking her to record a birthday greeting for Savile and convicted paedophile Rolf Harris. Baskin later insisted she had no idea whom either man was when she made the video.The Guardian’s Peter Bradshawdescribed 28 Years Later: The Bone Templeas a film “in which there is real human jeopardy and conflict. Non-zombies are more cinematic.” Yet perhaps the more disturbing horror is that figures such as Savile, within a generation, can be reduced to a wig, a look or a meme, and stripped of the context that once made them truly monstrous.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

Spattered against the white walls of theAlmeida theatreare several thin streaks of blood. Underneath them a particularly gruesome-looking hand axe rests on a table. And on the other side of the room, a clue to who the perpetrator might be. Discarded next to someone’s laptop is a business card – bone-coloured, raised black lettering – bearing a familiar name: Patrick Bateman.Him again.It’s 35 years since Bret Easton Ellis’s third novel, American Psycho, unleashed Bateman on his rampage of sadistic violence, and it seems we’ve never stopped wanting more. In the decades since, Bateman has stabbed and slashed his way through a Hollywoodmovie, an unlikely hitmusicaland all kinds of internet memes (“I have to return some videotapes”). A remake of the film, reportedly starringAustin Butleras Bateman, is in the works, but before that areworked musicalis returning to the place it first appeared, hence my visit to rehearsals at the Almeida today. As I watch the cast perfect harmonies around the names of typefaces (“Tiiiimes, New Roh-oh-man”), I wonder how a story about 1980s Wall Street bankers – complete with oversized mobile phones and references to Sony Walkmans – has remained so relevant? Should we be worried that it has?To answer this question we have to understand Bateman himself. Obsessed with designer labels, male grooming and ludicrous fine dining (swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade, anyone?), Bateman’s money and status-obsessed existence was a pitch-perfect send up of US capitalism during the Reagan era. Yet the satirical element seemed to be lost on critics at the time. The Guardian’s Joan Smith, using a line as brutal as any Bateman murder, dismissed the novel as “nasty, brutish and long”, whereas a moral panic about the book’s graphic acts of violence against women prompted Simon & Schuster to pull out from publishing it at the last minute (Ellis kept his $300,000 advance, then found a new home with Vintage). The controversy has never entirely gone away – even now, the novel can only besold in Australiaif shrink-wrapped.View image in fullscreenA song and dance about it … Rehearsals for the new musical.Photograph: Marc BrennerPerhaps unnerved by all the fuss, Ellis himself claimed the novel was inspired largely by his property developer father and the bankers he hung out with for research. He wasn’t being entirely honest. “I didn’t want to own up to the responsibility of being Patrick Bateman,” he said in 2010, “so I laid it on my father, I laid it on Wall Street.” In reality, Ellis admitted he was writing abouthis own“rage … boredom … my loneliness, my alienation”.It wasn’t just Ellis who related to Bateman and the book’s themes of alienation and despair; as time went by the novel transcended the controversy to become a slow-burn success. “I don’t think it would be as widely read if the point of the book was specifically an attack on yuppie culture,” Ellis said. “I think there’s a larger feeling that people respond to in the book.” So what, exactly, is this dark energy that it holds?Arty Froushan, who plays the lead in the new musical, says he was slightly offended by how many of his friends said Bateman was the “perfect role” for him. But you can see what they mean. Froushan has the requisite preppy looks and, from watching him rehearse, he really gets across Bateman’s constant sense of status-anxiety. Is his business card stylish enough? Why doesn’t he own his own tanning bed? The references might have changed, but Froushan believes these issues have only got worse with the rise of the internet. “Instagram is such a horrific amplifier of it, this constant neurotic comparison that we carry out with our peers and the sort of disconnection that fosters,” he says. “It offers the illusion of connection and connectivity, but actually you end up feeling completely isolated and it discourages empathy.”View image in fullscreenThe cover of the 1991 novel.It’s a horrible thought, that there might be some Bateman in all of us – obsessing about our frown lines, or scheming how to make our holiday look better than it really is on social media, all while the world burns. But maybe we don’t need to be so hard on ourselves. Because surely much of the reason why we still turn toAmerican Psychoafter all this time is that – perhaps before anything else – it is unremittingly hilarious. Over its 400-plus pages, there is little in the way of plot or character progression, and a lot in the way of bitchy dialogue and endless running jokes such as the increasingly deranged topics – eg toddler murderers – discussed on Bateman’s beloved Patty Winters Show. When he brings up the real-life serial killer Ed Gein during drinks with his friends, one of them replies: “Is he the maitre’d at Canal Bar?” At a U2 concert, a bored Bateman spends the show trying to work out if The Edge is wearing Armani or Emporio, before it emerges he doesn’t actually know which one The Edge even is. Perhaps the most telling running joke is the way nobody seems to recognise anyone else – Bateman is mistaken for one of his peers on virtually every other page, the implication being that all these people blur into one.By keeping the dialogue virtually unchanged and condensing the story into just over 100 minutes with something approaching a story arc, Mary Harron’s filmshouldimprove on the novel. It has certainly become what defines American Psycho in the eyes of the public, cleverly incorporating Bateman’s earnest reviews of Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis and the News with his scenes of unhinged violence. And yet there’s something about the novel’s seemingly unnecessary length – the way Ellis, just 22 when he started writing it, masterfully maintains the voice page after page – that really drags you into the inanity of Bateman’s world.Bateman’s representative in 2026 is Andrew Tate, who shares his fetishisation of status, working out and the dehumanisation of womenEllis was hugely influenced by style mags such as GQ (“A bold striped shirt calls for solid coloured or discreetly patterned suits and ties,” says Bateman) and today you hear that same detached tone as TikTok’s auto-generated voice talks you through people’s mundane daily routines. Ellis was intrigued by how gay tropes and rituals, such as working out and waxing, were being adopted by straight alpha males, and has claimed his book was “probably the first novel about a metrosexual”. What the public didn’t know at the time was that the man who conceived Bateman – a massive homophobe – was gay himself.In so many ways, American Psycho crashes headfirst into today’s cautious debates around identity politics. It enraged feminists on publication and you certainly couldn’t imagine a writer getting away with some of the gratuitous sex and violence scenes today. Ellis trawled through autopsy reports for his research, dragged himself into a place that repulsed him: sex workers get maimed with coathangers; heads are stored in freezers. Yet often it’s Bateman’s intrusive thoughts that are more chilling to the reader than his gory actions: while discussing gossip columnists and bistros, Bateman casually tells the reader about a waitress he “raped with a can of hairspray last Christmas when I was skiing … over the holidays” before returning to his thoughts on the lousy acoustics of the venue he’s in.View image in fullscreenMaking a killing … Christian Bale in the 2000 American Psycho film.Photograph: Lions Gate/Sportsphoto/AllstarReading the book still carries with it the frisson of a guilty secret. “You wouldn’t tell a first date you were reading it,” is how one colleague puts it, and it’s true I didn’t feel entirely comfortable reading it on the commute to work. But is it really misogynistic? Harron believed her film was really an attack on male fragility, asking a question that particularly resonates today: what on earth is going on with men right now?That means all men. One obvious comparison to Bateman are the members of Oxford University’s Bullingdon Club, which produced two recent British prime ministers in David Cameron and Boris Johnson. In 2013, the Mirror reported that one initiation ceremony for joining the club involved burning a £50 notein front of a beggar, a taunt beloved by Bateman and his pals. But American Psycho’s targets are broader than just society’s elite. Perhaps Bateman’s true representative in 2026 is Andrew Tate and his followers, who share his fetishisation of status, working out and the dehumanisation of women. When you look at the rise of “incel” communities, pickup artists, grindset culture, tech bros and wellness gurus slapping beef tallow on their faces, American Psycho’s message seems depressingly more pertinent than ever.Rupert Goold, the director who first brought American Psycho to the Almeida and who is restaging it as his swansong before heading off to take charge at the Old Vic, says the book has an “almost Dostoevsky quality” that evokes “a kind of loneliness”. This means it can map on to all sorts of modern malaises, and Goold is attempting to use this incarnation of the musical to examine the modern manosphere. “People like [fitness influencer]Ashton Hall, who has millions of followers and lives this totally Patrick Bateman life where he wakes up at five in the morning, puts his face in ice and then reads self-help books and works out.”View image in fullscreenHe means business … Matt Smith in the 2013 Almeida production of American Psycho.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyAnd yet there is a huge irony at play. Because in recent years Patrick Bateman – specifically Christian Bale’s movie persona – has become a kind of aspirational figure for the very same men he was designed to mock. In some quarters he is held up as being the ultimate “sigma male”, a masculine archetype who sits at the top of the food chain, yet also slightly outside it, refusing to conform to society’s rules like the typical alpha male. (It should be noted that Bateman isn’t really a sigma male, given he is driven by a relentless need to fit in.) The “sigma face” – a smug pout while simultaneously frowning, modelled on one of Bale’s expressions in the film – has become a huge meme.How has this misunderstanding taken place? Kanye West’sLove Lockdownvideo was inspired by Bateman’s sterile apartment, and thejourneythe musician has been on since then seems pertinent. Ellis was interested in writing a book that was all about surface, yet it’s now being read by some on this same surface level; Bateman as a good looking, muscular, rich idol who gets the girls and does what he wants to them. The fact Bateman’s descriptions of sex sound pretty teenage and virginal probably helps them to appeal to a younger audience. It’s hard to know what Ron DeSantis’s excuse is, though: the Florida governor used Bateman footage in a2023 videoaimed at promoting his anti-LGBT credentials while running for the Republican presidential nomination.Like Bateman, Trump is obsessed with surface: the TV ratings, the prizes, the sycophancyWhich brings us, of course, to DeSantis’s rival in that race. There aren’t many things Bateman authentically loves, but – along with Les Misérables and the 1980s output of Genesis – he is a huge admirer of Donald Trump, even recommending the then businessman’sThe Art of the Dealto the detective investigating one of his murders. Ellis chose Trump to be Bateman’s idol because back then he was a distilled representation of the elite – a showman who loved money. But now he’s president, the comparisons are even stronger. Like Bateman, Trump is obsessed with surface: the TV ratings, the prizes, the sycophancy. Also like Bateman, Trump has constructed his own reality. In American Psycho, we’re never quite sure whether or not what Bateman is telling us is happening is actually happening. Sound familiar?When I first read the book, it seemed fairly obvious to me the murders were only happening in Bateman’s addled mind as he approached a nervous breakdown. He made little effort to cover them up, after all, leaving his apartment with body bags and with blood on his clothes. But, of course, Bateman is rich and privileged. Even when he tells people what he does in his spare time they don’t listen. Like Trump, Bateman could “stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody” and get away with it. In other words, he’s hiding in plain sight. Forget not all heroes wear capes; Bateman shows that not all villains wear masks.A common line about the politics we find ourselves saddled with these days is that it’s “beyond satire”. How could you make, say, aVeep-style comedy about a US administration far more ludicrous than anything the writers could ever come up with? It’s a question I pondered while writing this piece, the backdrop to which was Trump seizing Venezuela’s president, threatening to invade Greenland and defending the shooting of a mother by ICE agents. Ellis was warning us where hyper-masculine capitalism was heading, but we got distracted by all the blood and gore on the surface. Now that we have a real life American Psycho in charge of the world, his darkly comic novel looks like the most lethal satire of all.American Psychois at the Almeida theatre, London, to14 March.Explore more on these topicsAmerican PsychoBret Easton EllisTheatreAlmeida theatreAndrew TateMen's healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Shortly after, Persson duetted with Tom Jones on a cover of Talking Heads’ Burning Down the House, which was included on his mega-selling Reload album. Then there was another tonal switch, to lamplit folk-rock and brawny Americana on 2003’s Long Gone Before Daylight; and another on 2005’s Super Extra Gravity, full of bright pop-rock.There hasn’t been another Cardigans album since, and Persson has ruled out the possibility after the departure of guitarist Peter Svensson, but the band reformed for live shows in 2012 and have sporadically toured since. Around the band, Persson has been an engaging vocal foil for Manic Street Preachers – their song Your Love Alone I s Not Enough reached No 2 in the UK singles chart – and Scottish folk singer James Yorkston, and as well as a 2014 solo album, she released two albums under the name A Camp, featuring various collaborators including her husband, film composer Nathan Larson.The Cardigans’ next UK gig is on 27 June at London’s Eventim Apollo, and ahead of it Persson will answer your questions about her life and work – post them in the comments below before noon on Monday 2 February, and we will publish her answers in the 6 February edition of the Film & Music section, as well as online.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockFilm & Music reader interviewcalloutShareReuse this content"

You decide who is playing happy familiesFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonThu 29 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 08.33 ESTShareThe prosecution: ChloeIt’s thoughtless to wheel me out to his familyas a formality. I need my own space sometimesMy husband Edwin comes from a big Colombian family, which is very different from the kind of environment I grew up in, and it leads to conflict between us.I had one sibling, a brother, but he passed away in a car accident when I was nine. My mum died a couple years ago. I grew up quite detached from my parents and was never that close to my father. As a result, I’m very independent and I like my own space.Dating Edwin was a challenge at first, as he is the complete opposite. He wants to be with me all the time, but also wants me to spend time with his family. He’s like a big labrador.Edwin loves kids. He has five brothers and sisters and around 20 nieces and nephews. I also like kids, but I like my space too. We’re in our early thirties and want a family one day, but not yet. The other week he got annoyed when I wasn’t able to go to his goddaughter’s seventh birthday party with him because I’d made plans to attend my best friend’s birthday.We were surrounded by his whole family and the kids were screaming. After hours of board games, I had to lie down because I had a headacheHe said: “But what will people think?” It seemed that his biggest concern wasn’t about us spending time together, but about me showing my face in front of his family. I told him that I have a life, and that I’d made plans to be at my friend’s birthday ages ago, but he wasn’t able to see it from my point of view. He even said I was being thoughtless. But I think it’s thoughtless to wheel me out to his family just as a formality. I don’t even know his goddaughter very well.Edwin also got annoyed with me at Christmas. We were surrounded by his whole family and kids were screaming. After hours of board games, I had to lie down because I had a headache. He told me later that was rude, but to me it would have been ruder if I had stayed up with a scowl on my face.Maybe Edwin finds it hard to see my point of view because he and I only see my father twice a year: it’s way less hands-on. We’ve been together for four and a half years and get on very well, but he needs to understand I can’t always spend time with his family.You be the judge – send us your domestic disputesRead moreThe defence: EdwinFamily is at the centre of things. I want Chloe to feel included and to show my relatives we’re a unitIt hurts when Chloe calls my family “a lot”. When you grow up surrounded by noise and people coming and going, you forget that not everyone experiences family the same way.For me, family has always been at the centre of everything: not because it’s perfect, but because it’s constant. When things go wrong, you don’t retreat. I didn’t lose anyone growing up like Chloe did, and we’ve talked about how that’s shaped our attitudes. I admire her, but she is so hyper-independent at times – when we first started going out, it was hard for her to let me in.When I ask her to come to family events, it’s not about wheeling her out like a prop. It’s about inclusion, showing everyone that I have my person and that she’s part of us. When Chloe doesn’t come, I feel a little silly and maybe a bit exposed. Everyone asks me where she is, because there’s an expectation in my family that she should come to everything I go to as we are a unit. She doesn’t get that and it’s hard sometimes.I know she has a low social battery, and at Christmas when she disappeared to lie down, I wasn’t angry – I was embarrassedMy goddaughter’s party symbolised our togetherness, and I had to fend off lots of questions from relatives, which was embarrassing. Chloe said she had a friend’s birthday but that wasn’t a super-important event either. I knew it was important to her though, which is why I didn’t get annoyed.I know she has a low social battery, and at Christmas when she disappeared to lie down, I wasn’t angry, just embarrassed because I had to cover for her in front of my family.When it comes to having kids, I worry that she may want to parent them differently. She likes her space, whereas I prefer being in a community and having everyone coming over to help with the baby. I love her, but I also love the big family chaos.I’m trying to adjust to her way of being, but we don’t spend time with her family. That’s not my fault – or hers. But I do need her to see that when I ask her to come to my family events, it’s not about optics, it’s about belonging.The jury of Guardian readersShould Edwin put less pressure on Chloe?I’m with Chloe. Just as Edwin has his family, Chloe has her friends and her obligations to them. And we all have the right to rest, regardless of circumstance. Edwin’s expectations are unfair.Jessica, 21Chloe understands their different perspectives and tries to accommodate them. I find it disturbing that Edwin labelled her headache break as rudeness. His own words suggest that this is more about his ego when he is with family.Eleanor, 66Edwin’s wish to include Chloe in family events is rooted in love and his culture, but he frames her need for space as something to overcome rather than respect. Without clear expectations, this mismatch risks long-term resentment – especially if they have a family together.Chris, 37Edwin and his family expect Chloe to be wholeheartedly present at all gatherings, and there’s no wriggle room for Edwin to explain her absence. He needs to explain to his family that Chloe has a different approach and may not always be present.Simon, 45Edwin must listen to what Chloe is saying and stop needing to “show” her to his family. Families can mean well while being intrusive. This conflict could deepen with the arrival of a newborn, as a baby can leave new parents overwhelmed and exhausted.Avril, 71Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: is Edwin expecting too much of Chloe?The poll closes on Wednesday 4 February at 9am GMTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherRandy should stop quoting song lyrics at his wifeduring serious conversations.60%of you said yes –Randy is guilty40%of you said no –Randy is innocentExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Does this teach children important lessons – or just make them feel isolated and ashamed?Emine SanerThu 29 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 04.28 ESTShareAcouple of weeks ago, a video posted on TikTok by Paige Carter, a mother in Florida, went viral. Carter explained that she had thrown her daughter’s iPad out of the window when she had been misbehaving on the way to school, and she films herself retrieving the tablet, now with a cracked screen. The video has been watched 4.9m times, and Carter was congratulated in the comments, with one person writing “Learning Fafo at an early age: top tier parenting.” Welcome to the parenting trend that doesn’t seem to be disappearing: “Fuck around and find out.”Inanother video, when a small child announces he is going to leave home, his mother says “see ya”, shuts the front door behind him, and turns off the outside light – then opens the door to him screaming and pounding to be let back in (it has been liked 1.5m times). He had learned, said his mother, “the meaning of Fafo”.Last summer, a piece in the Wall Street Journal heralded the rise of Fafo parenting and the end of “gentle parenting” – a trend that began about 10 years ago as a response to the more authoritarian “naughty step” parenting of the early 2000s, which has been blamed for everything from entitled young adults destined for disappointment by the cruel realities of life to societal collapse itself. Gentle parents reported being exhausted from taking the lead from their child, carefully explaining every decision, watching their every move and naming each emotion their child might be feeling, in a calm and tender way.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Holly Szczypka/The GuardianA backlash against gentle parenting had been brewing for some time. “You could watch Instagram all day with people taking the mickey out of it,” says Prof Ellie Lee, director of the Centre for Parenting Culture Studies at the University of Kent. She says that “parenting has become very intensive”.Advocates of Fafo say it teaches their child independence and the consequences of their actions, even if those consequences are uncomfortable or, at the extreme end, harsh. Critics say it relies too heavily on fear and humiliation, and that while children might comply as a result, it damages trust. Done properly, however, there isn’t much to separate the styles: true gentle parenting embraces boundaries and consequences, and Fafo doesn’t have to be punishing. But this is online-influenced child rearing, where extremes are pushed, nuance is out and polarisation is in.“I’m a fan of children experiencing natural consequences, at the level of ‘I’m not going to keep battling with my child about them wearing a coat,’” says Dr Maryhan Munt, a psychologist and host of the How Not to Screw Up Your Kids podcast. “If they don’t tidy away their toys, and someone treads on one, something gets broken. That, I think, can be good learning. What I have more of an issue with is: ‘OK, see what it’s like to try that fizzy drink you keep going on and on about.’ As parents, our role is to provide the boundaries and scaffolding for our children. Where it’s relevant, there can be natural consequences. But when we tip over the edge to almost like, ‘I can’t be bothered, if that’s what you want to do, just do it,’ then I think that’s where it sends the wrong message.”Children don’t just learn from consequences, they learn from how adults stay present with them through those consequencesGentle parenting methods, or at least what people often think that involves, can leave parents feeling burned out, says Dr Emma Svanberg, a psychologist and author ofParenting for Humans. “For me, that’s about parents feeling they’ve been told they must validate, empathise, explain and absorb dysregulation without ever having experienced this themselves in their own childhood, and with very little structural support. I think Fafo might be a reaction to that – a pendulum swing from something that can be interpreted as permissive to something that can seem more authoritarian.”Fafo is appealing, Svanberg says, because “on an immediate, explicit level it gives permission for parents to relax, to bring in natural consequences rather than endless negotiation with an unwilling, ‘non-compliant’ child”. For those parents who grew up in the 90s, they know where they are with a tough love style. The emergence of Fafo, she says, “happened at the same time as nostalgia for 1990s parenting, and we tend to find it easier to repeat patterns which are familiar to us. After a lot of pressure on parents to parent in specific, child-focused ways in the context of intensive parenting, it is almost inevitable that there would be some shift on a societal level.”Also, adds Munt, new parents observing older childen who have been raised “gently” may feel the method was not all that good for them: “The evidence seems to be that we’re just getting more and more anxious children.”But there’s a danger in taking Fafo too far. Svanberg says: “Children don’t just learn from consequences; they learn from how adults stay present with them through those consequences. If Fafo becomes emotionally hands-off – ‘you’ll learn the hard way, I’m not getting involved’ – children may internalise shame, feel unsupported or struggle to make sense of experiences developmentally beyond their capacity. The risk isn’t independence, it’s emotional isolation and shame.”When Gaby Gonzalez became a mother and joined toddler groups, she noticed different styles among other mothers. “You have the helicopter parents, you have the one who intervenes every two minutes.” Fafo parenting appealed to her. “The acronym sounds harsh, but you are allowing a safe, age-appropriate consequence instead of constant intervention.” Given her children’s young ages, these are small-scale. If her three-year-old wants to jump in a puddle in the park, Gonzalez will let him, even if it means taking off his wet clothes in the car on the way home. “We do a simple talk-through. I’ll ask him, ‘Oh, what happened? You’re cold. Why are you cold?’”Gonzalez, 41, is from Los Angeles, raised by Mexican parents “in a Fafo style, now I think of it”. At 12, she was expected to contribute to the family business, and at 13, living in Mexico for a while, she learned to drive, sitting on cushions to be able to see. “I had my dad there to support me, because I had a clear and safe dynamic with them, [but] I never experienced ‘gentle parenting’ with them.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Natalia  Lebedinskaia/Getty ImagesGonzalez now lives in the UK, and is building anonline community of mothers. She thinks Fafo is slow to take off in the UK. “People are more cautious,” she says. “Whereas in America and other places in Europe, I see people embracing it.” It’s a style, she hopes, that will shape the “children I want to raise, and I don’t want to raise asshole kids. I need to make sure [my son is] going to be a great, productive citizen of the world, who is inclusive and worldly and open to experiences.”You could argue that that is a fairly universal parenting goal, equally important in gentle parenting – it’s just that it has been misinterpreted. “What many people have practised under the guise of ‘gentle parenting’ is actually high-intensity, child-centred, permissive parenting with very little attention to adult limits, power or context,” says Svanberg. “Many parents have found this incredibly overwhelming because when children don’t have clear boundaries or expectations placed on them, and parents are stressed to the max because of lack of support, children tend to escalate. Fafo pushes back against the idea that parents must prevent all discomfort or distress. The risk is that it swings the pendulum from overinvolvement to under-responsiveness, and even punitive withdrawal.”Is the permissive end of gentle parenting in danger of raising “asshole” kids? “Absolutely,” says Gonzalez with a laugh. She saw it in her career as an early years specialist. “If you don’t have all the right tools and knowledge, it can bite you in the ass. Children thrive within clear rules, guidance and boundaries. That’s where I’m coming from.” The Fafo style, she says, is not “parenting running loose. You have to make sure that you know what it is and be safe.” This is not parenting for the lazy, either – the way Gonzalez describes her approach sounds as much work as gentle parenting, whether it’s helping your child understand the results of their actions or picking up the pieces when things go wrong for them.Children thrive within clear rules, guidance and boundaries. That’s where I’m coming fromTypical Fafo examples that have emerged online include forgoing the battle to get a child to wear their coat and letting them get cold instead, or letting them go to bed hungry if they refuse to eat their dinner. Scenarios such as these won’t seem all that remarkable to anyone who grew up in the last century, but it is the sort of faultline that has opened up, especially on social media, between parents at each extreme. Discussions about parenting styles, says Lee, “have now become so tied to identity expression”.The idea of “parenting styles” emerged in the 1960s, with the American psychologist and researcher Diana Baumrind’s three types: authoritarian, permissive and, taking the best aspects of both, authoritative. “It was [Baumrind] trying to find a way through the conflicts that were emerging between a traditionalist view of relationships between generations, and all the things that were starting to become characteristic of the 60s,” says Lee. Authoritative parenting – which many gentle and Fafo parents would both say they’re doing – “has, at its centre, a combination of what she calls warmth and demandingness”.It requires a sense of adult, or parental, authority, which in turn requires a clear distinction between adults and children. “What’s happened over time is that whole borderline between adulthood and childhood has become very fragmented,” says Lee. In broad terms, childhoods are no longer what they were – children’s time is regimented and filled by their parents; they lack physical spaces to play; they’re exposed to adult media and academically tested relentlessly at school – but neither are adulthoods. Grown-up children are remaining at home for longer, housing is unaffordable and jobs are unstable. Then add in the general online noise and conflicting messages, as well as the polarisation of everything, including parenting.“People are, in quite an individuated type of way, trying to work through it,” says Lee. “They flip-flop between messages that tell them you’ve got to pay intense, continual attention to every single feeling your child has about anything, to telling your child to Fafo. I think both are horrible.”Is there a political dimension to each? As the Wall Street Journal article put it: “The paradigm of gentle parents versus Fafo parents isn’t quite Snowflake Kids versus Maga Kids, but there’s a whiff of that.” Lee says: “There may be some of that going on.” The term Fafo has a rightwing flavour: on social media, it is more likely to be used not in a parenting context, but in approving posts about the actions of ICE in the US. There is a general “anti-woke” dimension to “some of the reaction to gentle parenting,” says Lee. “It would be unsurprising if it’s become bound up with a culture war.” (For the record, Gonzalez would definitely not describe herself as rightwing.)But Lee adds it is hard to make broad claims about parenting and political leaning. Look at the discussion about vaccination in the US, she points out. The US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine critic, has slashed routine childhood vaccinations. “You might think about that as part of Trumpism and Maga, but it’s got a big appeal among so-called crunchy mums [who favour a natural lifestyle], attachment mothers and that alternative medicine world. It’s quite difficult to map politics on to some of these phenomena.”If there is a backlash against gentle parenting, it’s hardly new. It has been nearly 30 years since sociologist Sharon Hays wrote The Cultural Contradictions of Motherhood on the intensification of child rearing, shouldered predominantly by mothers. “There’s been a ramping-up of demands which say to mothers, in particular, that you’ve got to spend more time with your children, otherwise you’re going to screw them up and society is going to fail,” says Lee.“I think the popularity of Fafo tells us less about parents becoming harsher or more relaxed, and more about how unsupported families are,” says Svanberg. “When parenting advice swings between extremes, it often reflects structural failure – too little community, too little rest, too much pressure on individual parents to get it ‘right’.”Fafo parenting is just the latest to grab attention online. “Then it will be something else, but it’ll be another form of the same thing,” says Lee. There are already signs of this, of course. Scrolling through TikTok, I spotted a parenting style that isn’t child-led and where consequences for actions play out, but without the humiliation or the “I told you so” stance that some parents online seem to revel in. Its name? Gentle Fafo.Illustrations byHolly SzczypkaExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingFamilyChildrenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you’re ready to wet your whistle with something delicious that won’t have you stumbling into the next day with a sore head, read on to discover the best no- and low-alcohol whites, reds and rosés from my taste testing (as well as a couple of mid-strength options), perfect for any time, any place.The best non-alcoholic and low-alcohol winesNo- and low-alcohol white winesView image in fullscreenModerato Colombard cuvée révolutionnaire, 0.5%£14 at Wise Bartender£14.50 at Majestic (£12.50 as part of Mix Six package)Born from French winemaking heritage, this alcohol-free white is one of the few that could truly be mistaken for the real thing. The Colombard grape is typically high in acidity, with fresh floral aromas and notes of lemon, grapefruit and peach, and its flavours stay on the tongue well after the last sip. Moderato’s founders, Fabien Marchand-Cassagne and Sebastien Thomas, are pioneers in the alcohol-free wine movement in France, establishingLe Chai Sobre(the Sober Cellar), the country’s leading production centre for alcohol-free wine.View image in fullscreenThomson & Scott Noughty non-alcoholic blanc, <0.5%£10.50 at Ocado£11.30 at Abel & ColeNoughty is a premium, organic, non-alcoholic wine brand that has raised the bar for what alcohol-free wine can achieve. For about £10, its white, with less than 0.5% ABV (about as much as a ripe banana), is great value for money. Made from chardonnay and chenin blanc in South Africa, this is a fresh, crisp wine with an authentic wine-like texture. It’s dry, too, so it won’t be mistaken for fruit juice, unlike some other alcohol-free offerings.View image in fullscreenBolle chardonnay, <0.5%£19.99 at Bolle Drinks£19.99 at AmazonBolle has already taken the non-alcoholic sparkling wine world by storm, and booze-free imbibers love it for its fine bubbles and authentic taste and texture. This is the first non-alcoholic still wine in its range: made mainly from the chardonnay grape, with a bit of the Germanic variety Silvaner added in. It’s crafted as a wine and then dealcoholised. No sugar, flavours or aromas are added, so you get real chardonnay notes of apricot, lemon and apple, alongside a silky mouthfeel and bright acidity. The traditional chardonnay bottle looks the part, too. Very smart.View image in fullscreenBrown Brothers Moscato Zero 2023, 0.5%£9.75 at Bakers & LarnersBased in Milawa, Victoria, Brown Brothers is one of Australia’s leading family-owned wine companies. Its Moscato Zero is a “vintage” bottle, with all the grapes from one year, and is on the sweet side with a gentle spritz. The muscat grape, which makes moscato wines, is one of the only varieties that still tastes “grapey” once it’s made into a wine – making it the perfect accompaniment to dessert or a cheeseboard.View image in fullscreenTorres Natureo, 0.0%£5.45 at OcadoWhen one of the biggest wineries in the world gets on board with alcohol-free wine, it’s definitely worth a look. As with Brown Brothers, Torres has chosen muscat grapes for its white Natureo, delivering a semi-dry wine. From the Penedès region of Spain, Catalonia’s famed wine-growing area, all of the grapes are from a single year. This floral wine is fresh and smooth on the palate, with notes of golden apple, pear and orange blossom, which pair beautifully with a seafood paella.View image in fullscreenSchloss Wachenheim AG ‘Eisberg selection’ pinot grigio, 0.0%£8 at Majestic (£7 as part of Mix Six package)£9 at Wise BartenderPinot grigio is one of the most popular white wines in the UK. Established in the Pfalz region of Germany more than 100 years ago, this winery considers itself a boundary-pusher in regular winemaking – and now a global pioneer in alcohol-free wines, too. This dealcoholised pinot grigio is actually more expressive than many alcoholic versions, with notes of lemon, lime and juicy white peach. It has a subtle spritz, but is dry and zesty, too.View image in fullscreen6Percent sauvignon blanc,6%£12.99 at 6Percent£10.39 at AmazonIf you don’t want to abstain from alcohol completely, but you do want to consume less of it, a mid-strength wine could be the way to go. This crisp and fruity sauvignon blanc, made in Bordeaux from grapes grown there, is 6% ABV – less than half the alcohol of a normal wine of the same style. The flavours are vibrant, and the mouthfeel is fuller than some of the zero-alcohol offerings. One for the in-betweeners.No- and low-alcohol rosé winesView image in fullscreenWednesday’s Domaine Elan, 0.0%£15 at Wise Bartender£19.80 at the Alcohol Free CoThis bottle looks the part, and the pale pink wine has summery aromas of watermelon and strawberries. On the dry side, it has mouthwatering acidity, lots of juicy berry fruit flavours, and even a slight creaminess to the texture. This rosé from Wednesday’s Domaine has got to be one of the most convincing still pinks out there. It’s simply delicious.Mid-strength drinks are having a moment. Here are 10 of the best lower-ABV beveragesRead moreView image in fullscreenThomson & Scott Noughty non-alcoholic rosé, 0.5%£9.95 at Waitrose£11.05 at FriarwoodMade in South Africa from two of the country’s signature grapes, chenin blanc and pinotage, this is an elegant, dry, salmon-hued rosé with less than 0.5% alcohol. It’s clean and crisp on the palate, which may be because it has almost half the amount of sugar found in most other non-alcoholic wines. Subtle summer berry and citrus flavours give it a more grown-up taste than other alcohol-free offerings out there. Take it to a dinner party to impress.View image in fullscreenM&S alcohol-free rosé, 0.0%£4 at OcadoPeople often complain that alcohol-free wines are too expensive, but that can’t be said for M&S’s 0.0% rosé at £4. It might not have the provenance of pricier bottles that are made from hand-picked organic grapes in a well-established family-run vineyard, but if you’re after something cheap and cheerful, it hits the right notes. Strawberry pink in colour, it’s bursting with flavours of ripened berries and juicy stone fruits. Its sweeter finish may not be great paired with your gourmet tasting menu, but for drinks in the garden, bring it on.View image in fullscreenTorres Viña Sol rosé, 0.0%£5 at WaitroseAnother from Torres, this time to stand in for one of the most popular rosé wines on shop shelves: the Viña Sol rosé. It looks the same, and although it doesn’t taste exactly the same – being quite a bit sweeter – it’s not a bad substitute. You still get the freshness, the summer fruit flavours and the dry edge, to assure you that it isn’t fruit juice. One for a party where you want to blend in – just be careful not to get the bottles mixed up.No- and low-alcohol red winesView image in fullscreenTread Softly Everything Except pinot noir,<0.5%£11.60 at the Alcohol Free CoHaving had huge success with its 9% ABV rosé, Tread Softly has now launched its Everything Except zero-alcohol range. The pinot noir in this is the runaway favourite with bags of bright berry fruit flavour, fresh acidity and soft tannins, which provide a distinct wine-like texture. Tread Softly uses a high-vacuum, low-pressure and lower-energy distillation method that it claims is a gentle way of removing the alcohol while trying to retain the full flavour of the grapes.View image in fullscreenOddbird Domaine De La Prademerlot,<0.5%£10 at Drinkmonger£10 at AmazonFounded by a former family therapist and social worker, Oddbird is passionate about alcohol-free living. The bottles are smart and the liquid inside is made from high-quality grapes from renowned vineyards. The alcohol has been removed without adding artificial flavours, colours or other substances along the way. This merlot is modern and youthful with fruity blackberry and plum notes. It has 12 months of maturation, however, which gives it more depth and complexity than other contenders in this category.View image in fullscreenZeno red,~0.5%£10.25 at Waitrose£11 at Wise BartenderThis red seems to have impressed the upper echelons of the wine trade as it regularly comes out top for recommendations. The reason is its impression of complexity: bright, juicy berry fruit aromas layer with spice and savouriness beneath, all wrapped up in a silky mouthfeel with a hint of tannic grip. The grapes are tempranillo and cabernet sauvignon; since it’s Spanish-made, enjoy it with chorizo and charred padrón peppers.View image in fullscreenModerato Merlot-Tannat cuvée révolutionnaire, 0.5%£14 at Wise Bartender£14.50 at Majestic (£12.50 as part of Mix Six package)The colour is a pleasingly deep shade of ruby thanks to the tannat grape, with its thick, dark skin, while the hint of oak and dried herbs on the nose transports me straight to Gascony, where it’s made. Taste-wise, it’s dry with some concentration of fruit, a tickle of spice and gentle tannins. For a medium-bodied wine, this is nearly there. With a Toulouse sausage casserole and a dash of sober joie de vivre, you could have a merry time with this.View image in fullscreenThomson & Scott NoughtyRouge, <0.5%£10.50 at Waitrose£10.50 at OcadoLight regular wines aren’t of a lesser quality than heavy, and the same applies to non-alcoholic wines. The Noughty Rouge reminds me of a good bistro wine: it’s one to have with a casual lunch, around a table with friends. That being said, it’s far from juvenile, with an accomplished balance of ripe fruit, fresh acidity and soft French oak tannins.View image in fullscreenBrown Brothers Cienna Zero, 0.5%£9.18 at Strictly Wine£9.95 at Harris & CoIt’s sweet and a bit fizzy – so if that’s your thing, read on. Made from cienna grapes grown in the hot and aridMurray Valleyof north-west Victoria, this is a summertime fruit bomb kind of red that would be perfect for a July barbecue. The acidity keeps it nice and fresh, balancing out the sweet, ripe fruit. Stick it in the fridge, throw another shrimp on the barbie, and turn up the tunes.View image in fullscreenFuture Château syrah grenache,5%£59.97 for three bottles at Future Château£28.99 at SelfridgesFounder Tom Benn spent five years creating a trio of mid-strength wines that “had to taste as good as full-strength”. Using premium-quality grapes and traditional winemaking, they’re designed to make you feel like you’re drinking full-strength wines – except your head will thank you the next day. The oak-aged syrah grenache is a medium-bodied, fruity red with some food-friendly tannic grip. Here’s a tip: chill it for a more refreshing, juicier sip.No- and low-alcohol sparkling white winesView image in fullscreenWild Idol alcohol free sparkling white,0.0%£26.96 at Fenwick£30 at OcadoThe Germanic grape variety müller-thurgau is used to make the Wild Idol white, which naturally produces floral aromatics and a sweet green apple flavour, with a crisp acidity. These characteristics are what you want in a sparkling wine, too, and Wild Idol says it’s able to preserve them because the juice is minimally handled and never fermented to produce alcohol. I don’t know how, then, it manages to taste “winey” but it does – and many top dining spots, such as Nobu and Jason Atherton restaurants, are choosing to pair it with their dishes.View image in fullscreenBolle Blanc de Blancs, 0.5%£19.99 at Drink Supermarket£24.99 at AmazonBolle goes through a secondary fermentation like champagne and prosecco, in order to capture the authentic character of real, high-quality sparkling wine. The effect is an elegant, fine-bubbled fizz with layers of flavour, from vibrant citrus notes to something more honeyed and toasty. Having scooped up a bevy of awards, it seems to be the one on everyone’s lips at the moment.View image in fullscreenDomaine de L’Arjolle Zero, 0.0%£13.45 at Wine at HomeWith their rich wine culture, French drinkers might be more resistant to non-alcoholic wines. However, Domaine de l’Arjolle, which makes the Zéro Sparkling Equilibre, is gaining a following in France for its alcohol-free offerings. This 0% bubbly expresses its grape varieties, sauvignon blanc and viognier, well with zesty and floral aromatics, and zingy citrus and stone fruit flavours. Clean and crisp, those tiny bubbles hit the roof of your mouth in exactly the way you’d expect from a fine French fizz.View image in fullscreenThomson & ScottNoughty dealcoholised sparkling chardonnay, 0.0%£9.50 at Sainsbury’s£10.75 at Waitrose CellarA common complaint about alcohol-free sparkling wine is that it’s too sweet. Well, this one definitely is not. If you like your wine dry, with zesty citrus characteristics and some granny smith apple crunch, then this could be the one for you. Noughty is a reliable zero-alcohol brand that ticks all the right boxes: it’s organic, vegan, gluten-free, low-sugar, low-calorie and low-sulphite. Great value for about a tenner.View image in fullscreenLa Gioiosaalcohol free sparkling, 0.0%£4.50 at Morrisons£5.10 at OcadoProsecco is known for being one of life’s simple pleasures: it’s fruity, refreshing and uncomplicated. The same goes for La Gioiosa’s affordable alcohol-free version. It’s made in the land of prosecco, Treviso, from the juice of the same glera grapes, and then carbonated. It doesn’t taste exactly like an extra brut prosecco – it’s a bit sweeter – but you’ll still find those bright notes of pear, apple, peach and white blossom in the glass, and the pop is just like the real thing.No- and low-alcohol sparkling rosé winesView image in fullscreenOddbirdalcohol-free sparkling rosé, 0.5%£10.99 at Laithwaites£10.67 at AmazonA good wine is about balance. If there’s sweetness, it should be balanced with acidity so that it isn’t cloying. This sparkling rosé is a great example. The syrah grape, grown in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of France, brings juicy summer berry flavours, which are lifted by mouth-puckering citrus notes and a poised, dry edge. Fine bubbles help to create a creamy texture, which is brightened by a clean, fresh finish.View image in fullscreenFrench BloomLe Rosé, 0.0%£29.75 at Fortnum & Mason£34 at AmazonIf you’re a champagne fan on a champagne budget, this is your booze-free bubbly. If you’re specifically a Taittinger fan, then this will seal the deal. The Frerejean-Taittinger family is behind French Bloom, a premium alcohol-free wine brand, making dealcoholised sparkling wines with organic chardonnay and pinot noir grapes. For me, the rosé version has the edge over the white because it’s a little drier and has a touch more complexity – perhaps due to the addition of pinot noir. Either way, the tiny bubbles effortlessly imitate the elegance of champagne, and it’s all wrapped up in very pretty packaging.View image in fullscreenWild Life BotanicalsBlush, 0.5%£12.50 at Fenwick£13.49 at the Alcohol Free CoThe difference with Wild Life is that it’s not trying to be a wine. Even though it is a dealcoholised wine, the focus is on its mix of botanicals that almost makes it a celebratory health drink. Among its “famous five” is lemon balm, which is good for digestive health, damask rose, which can soothe inflammation, and damiana, a mood-lifting aphrodisiac. Putting the plant power to one side, the blush is a frivolously delicious tipple that tastes of rhubarb, wild strawberries and crab apples.View image in fullscreenKylie Minoguealcohol free sparkling rosé, 0.0%£6 at Morrisons£5 at AmazonKylie’s wine empire is growing by the year, with her brand seeming to have struck a nimble balance between inviting, affordable, aspirational and inclusive. Her alcohol-free sparkling rosé brings another crowd of fans on board and, as long as they’re not expecting Laurent-Perrier levels of fizzy pink stuff, there’s a lot to like. It’s sweet without being overly sugary and vibrant without being brash. A little like Kylie herself.View image in fullscreenFeral No5pét-nat rosé, 0.0%£24 at Passione VinoThis is the wild card of non-alcoholic wine. It can’t technically be classed as a wine, as there are no grapes involved, but the finished result does represent a category of wine: the “pet nat” (a style well-known to natural wine lovers and hipsters). The Italian team behind the Feral brand uses birch sap, lemon verbena, yarrow, nettle, horseradish and aronia juice to make this tangy, cloudy-pink creation. It has a bright, sour edge, but the fine bubbles make it a tickle rather than a punch.No- and low-alcohol sparkling teasView image in fullscreenLA Brewerysparkling English blush kombucha, 0.0%£10 at Ocado£13 at LA BreweryIf the alcohol-free sparkling wines haven’t quite hit the heights you’d hoped for, perhaps sparkling kombucha will get you there. People love the tang and texture of kombucha, which encourages sipping rather than gulping, as you might do with a can of soda. LA Brewery’s sparkling kombuchas are made in a B Corp-certified microbrewery in Buckinghamshire, and are infused with blends of fruits, flowers and botanicals to enhance aromatics, mouthfeel and depth of flavour. Expect aromas of sharp rhubarb and heady elderflower to greet you when you pop the cork.View image in fullscreenRealPeony Blush non-alcoholic sparkling tea, 0.0%£8 at Waitrose£9.50 at OcadoThese sparkling teas are crowd-pleasers. Made with white peony tea, this particular blush is light and floral, with natural summer berry flavours that don’t leave your mouth feeling like you’ve just sucked a fruit pastille. If you want to see how they’re made, you canvisit Real’s fermenteryat the Waddesdon Estate in Buckinghamshire.View image in fullscreenCopenhagen organic sparkling tea Blå, 0.0%£18.45 at Fenwick£18.50 at Fortnum & MasonThe lovely thing about sparkling teas is that you get a complexity of flavours and aromatics coming naturally from the tea blend. Blå is made with 13 jasmine, white and darjeeling blends, which all bring their nuanced characteristics to the glass. Tea also contains tannins, so a wine-like structure is already in place, helping it to pair with a multitude of foods. This sparkling tea has been developed by Copenhagen-based, award-winning sommelier Jacob Kocemba.View image in fullscreenSaicho jasmine sparkling tea, 0.0%£16.99 at Drink Supermarket£20 at Majestic (£18 as part of Mix Six package)If the beautiful design on the bottle hasn’t done enough to draw you in, the heady aroma of jasmine blossoms should seal the deal. Saicho has won awards for its refined single-origin teas, each uniquely expressing the region it’s from. This green tea from China’s Fujian province is floral with a wisp of smoke, tasting of pear, lychee and vanilla. The texture is delicately sparkling with a clean finish.What you need to knowHow is non-alcoholic wine made?Alcohol is removed using different methods, such as spinning cone technology or vacuum evaporation, or in some cases, alcohol might not have been created in the wine at all. All have their pros and cons, affecting the taste and texture of the drinks, as well as their impact on the environment.High-vacuum, low-pressure distillation is considered the gentler method, as it allows for the separation of compounds at lower temperatures. This is more eco-friendly, plus it preserves the aromas and flavours better because heat is more likely to damage delicate compounds. Wines using the vacuum method tend to have more naturally occurring “winey” characteristics, whereas spinning cone wines may lack aromatics. This could lead to more additives being thrown in the mix, which might result in the wines tasting more artificial. Alcohol-free wines that don’t go through fermentation do taste fruitier and more “grapey”, with some tasting overly sweet.You might have to do a little digging to find out which production method has been used for your choice of non-alcoholic wine, as it’s not often stated on the bottle, but it will be on the producer’s website.All things to consider when you’re choosing your alcohol-free wines.Most wines actually have up to 0.5% alcohol, but since even products such as bread, fruit juices, soft fruits and flavoured sparkling waters have up to this amount due to the natural fermentation process, that percentage doesn’t have to be announced on the bottle. And, in case you’re concerned, I can assure you that bread will not get you drunk.Is non-alcoholic wine high in sugar?When alcohol is removed, the wine is not only lighter in units but also in body, flavour and sweetness, which is why some alcohol-free products might be described as “hollow”. Sugar is often added to rectify this, balancing the acidity in the wine and providing a more viscous texture. Be careful though – some non-alcoholic wines contain as much sugar as a fruit juice or a fizzy drink, so even without the alcohol, it’s best to consume in moderation. Or at least double-check the label or the website to see how much sugar is added.Sophia Longhi is an award-winning wine communicator, wine writer and international wine judge.

A recent trip to my local supermarket suggests that residents of my home town have been doing just that in their droves, with textile recycling bins overflowing on to the pavements. And we may think donating our unwanted clothes does us a favour while helping out someone else and potentially the environment, but there’s a chance we could be doing the exact opposite.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

And she warns that much of our donated clothing won’t end up in the well-intended places we had hoped it would. “[It] will most likely end up in landfill or be exported in the waste colonialism chain, which means our excess volumes end up in countries like Ghana, Kenya and Uganda. It’s a business, but when a lot of the clothing is trash to begin with, sadly it creates a lot of pollution.”With this in mind, and because no matter how well we look after our clothes, there will be times when we need to pass on items we no longer want, I’ve put together a guide to a more considered wardrobe clearout. The solutions are out there if you know where to look.How to clear out your wardrobeResellView image in fullscreenLearn the art of selling preloved fashion, and you’ll have a clearer wardrobe and some extra cash.Photograph: OKrasyuk/Getty Images/iStockphotoA recent reportfound that two-thirds of British consumers bought preloved goods online in 2024, a trend driven by the cost of living crisis and concerns for the environment. I’ve had great success selling in person at rail sale events that I organise with a friend, but there are more online options than ever if you don’t have such a thing locally.“My favourite isVintedpurely through ease of use through the app,” saysBrett Staniland, a model and sustainable fashion advocate who has been buying and selling clothes secondhand for as long as he can remember. “But I divide up what I sell; the more classic and niche menswear brands tend to do best onMarrkt.”“Include hook words like ‘rare’ so that you draw people to your listing,” saysAmy Bannerman, who was an expert in secondhand clothing long before she became eBay UK’s preloved style director. She recommends as many strong visuals as possible, photographed in natural light and clearly showing any damage or defects, with a measuring tape in shot to avoid discrepancies.She also suggests comparing with similar items that are for sale before you price your own, and listing items in a “burst” so you have more for sale at once. “Include all information in the title (size, brand, condition) to make every stage easier for the buyer. I like to suggest ways to wear the item as it brings pieces to life more,” she adds. “I also keep everything I have for sale in a laundry bag so that it’s all in the same place. This makes it much easier to find things once you’ve made a sale!”When it comes to items that sell well, quality is key, and accessories are always in demand. “High-value items such as luxury handbags and jewellery often increase in value, so if you buy well, you can make a profit,” says Bannerman. “Hats, shoes and bags fly!” agrees Staniland. “I recently listed twoCawleyhats that were gone within minutes and had loads of offers for. Equally, knitwear does really well. Big woolly cardigans and 100% natural fibre classics never stick about long.”DonateView image in fullscreen‘If you wouldn’t give it to a friend, don’t donate it.’Photograph: SolStock/Getty ImagesCharity shops are convenient and give us the opportunity to support causes that mean something to us. But all too often, they’re used as a dumping ground. “When people donate items that are unsellable, charities have to pay to dispose of them, which means your donation actually costs them money,” says Jen Graham, TV presenter, charity shopping advocate and fashion stylist, who is known asCharity Shop Girl on Instagram. “This would include dirty, stained or smelly clothes, clothes with visible sweat marks or visible damage, yellowing underarms, heavy makeup stains, damp or musty smells.”As well as urging us to all bear in mind that “if you wouldn’t give it to a friend, don’t donate it”, she suggests making sure donations are packed into bags carefully (ripped bags can mean items get wet and ruined) and not overpacking, as crushed clothes look worse and can be damaged in transit. “Charity shops rely on pieces people actually wear and will reuse,” she says. “Quality matters far more than the brand. Trainers, boots, school shoes and work shoes sell well, as do accessories, scarves, handbags, belts and jewellery, especially when in good condition.”RepairView image in fullscreenOnline repair booking platforms can open up access to repair specialists in your area.Photograph: IPGGutenbergUKLtd/Getty Images/iStockphotoWe don’t all have the skills to patch an elbow or mend jeans with the Japanese art ofsashiko, but local services are often hard to find. “Many repair and alteration businesses are one-person operations, working offline and by word of mouth,” says Layla Sargent, founder of the nationwide repair and tailoring platformthe Seam. “The skills are everywhere, but they’re often not visible or set up for modern booking and communication, which makes them hard to access.”I used Sargent’s service, which matches customers to a skilled maker most appropriate to their particular issue for clothing or accessories, to impressively repair a pair of shoes that my puppy had chewed. I also recently had a pair of Birkenstock-style clogs resoled bythe Boot Repair Company, which did a brilliant job. Based in Leeds, it’s happy to receive shoes and boots in the post from all over the country. Meanwhile,Sojooffers door-to-door alterations and repairs, as well as an in-store service in Selfridges.For more, readhow to make your favourite leather accessories last a lifetimeRecycleGlobally, only 1% of textiles are recycled into new textile products; most worn-out clothing is either sent to landfill or downcycled into other items such as rags and insulation. One problem is that we often give up on our clothes too soon. When I ask Sargent how many items the Seam sees that are just too far gone, I am surprised by her answer. “Very little truly is,” she says. “We see knitwear invisibly rewoven, jeans reinforced to last years longer, and coats fully relined when the outer fabric is still beautiful. Often what looks unwearable just needs the right hands.”On the occasions that it really is time to say goodbye to a tatty T-shirt or that hoodie with one too many grease stains down the front, there are solutions that are better than the bin or a textile recycling bank.You could send any 100% cotton clothing to the Isle of Wight, for example, where it really will be recycled into new clothes. There,Teemill’sRemill programme, which accepts any items with labels to show their cotton credentials (excluding underwear and jeans), recycled more than 14,000kg of cottonin 2025 alone. The reclaimed material is subsequently made into garments for users of its print-on-demand platform and the fashion brandRapanui, which is also where cotton donors can spend the voucher they’ll receive for sending in their old garms.For items of all kinds,Reskinnedpartners with brands including Finisterre, Passenger and Sweaty Betty, and guarantees that anything that passes through its Takeback scheme is either repaired and resold or recycled, and never sent to landfill.Restyle and repurposeView image in fullscreenFabric repurposed by Re_ConsideredIf you feel stuck in a style rut, Bannerman suggests having a play around with what you already own, then investing in one item that will update it all. “I will try a load of stuff on and see where I have a gap,” she says. “This winter it was a thick warm blazer. I found one on eBay that has revolutionised my wardrobe and made everything else feel updated. It makes me feel smart and work ready. I wear it with straight-leg dark-wash Levi’s and some cosy layering underneath.”When an item no longer works for you, consider having it transformed into something that does. TheLoom app’s makers and artisans are skilled at fashioning a wedding dress into everyday wear or transforming, as they did for me, an old suede pinafore into a handy tote bag. Alternatively, you could send a treasured, worn-out item toRe_Consideredto have it made into a custom product, such as a candlestick holder or a jewellery dish.

It was a weighty, leather-bound affair that could act as a vault for all the vivid stews, slow-cooked beans and many other family specialities – the secrets of which existed only in her head. Although the gift has basically been a failure (bar a lengthy WhatsApp message detailing her complex jollof rice methodology, she still has an allergy to writing down cooking techniques or quantities), I think the impulse behind it is sound and highly relatable.Familyrecipes are a form of time travel. An act of cultural preservation that connects us deeply to people we may not have met and places we may not have visited.Those realities shine through in this week’s gathered compendium of heirloom recipes submitted by readers. Baked beans given a Gujarati twist. An Atlantic-hopping riff on spinach and feta pie. A billowing yorkshire pudding with sticky bramley apples in its base. All of these preparations, particularly when a recipe for anything is a mere tap away, point to the power of human connection and the ingenuity of domestic chefs. And perhaps the best thing about ancestral culinary approaches is that they can be passed from one clan to another, living on even as they are adapted and evolve.So enjoy these evocative accounts, cook these dishes (untouched and untested by the Feast team, in the spirit of keeping them in their original form) and, perhaps, let another delicious new tradition into your own family’s ever-shifting culinary story.‘I hope one day my son will pass down the recipe to his children’View image in fullscreenBapa’s beans with homemade sourdough made by Sonia’s husband, James.“My favourite recipe is Bapa’s beans – tinned baked beans turned into a delicious Indian curry,” says Sonia, 40, from Manchester. “My grandfather, who passed away 20 years ago, showed me this recipe. We used to have it with traditional Gujarati rotli (small, thin chapati). I make this for my husband and our two boys, and serve it with hot buttery sourdough to turn it into an Indian version of beans on toast.”For Sonia, the dish helps her remember her grandad and “hold on as much as [she] can” to her Indian identity. “When my brother and I were little, we spent a lot of time with our Indian grandparents (who came to the UK from Gujarat, India) in their small, cold, terraced house in Bradford.Ba [grandma] did all of the cooking; fresh vegetarian curries with rotis and rice every day, served with pickles, poppadoms and all the trimmings. She was, and still is, a brilliant cook. When it was my Bapa’s [grandad’s] turn to take over the kitchen and feed us kids, he made Bapa’s beans with rotis – from the freezer, that Ba had made for emergencies like this.“Requiring minimal prep and with minimal room for failure, it’s easy to see why this was the only thing that Ba ever showed him how to make. My grandparents could make a meal out of anything. Even though there was not much money, there was always a feast, and whoever was there would be included.“Before leaving home for university in Manchester, I asked them to show me how to make Bapa’s beans and I’ve made them almost every month since,” Sonia says.She adds: “I can feel Bapa sitting with my family every time we eat them. I’ll be teaching my 15-year-old son how to make Bapa’s beans before he leaves home … I hope that one day he will pass this recipe down to his own children.”Sonia, 40,ManchesterBapa’s beans2 tbsp cooking oil1 brown onion, diced1/2tsp of asafoetida5 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced1/2tsp mustard seeds2 400g tins of baked beans1 tsp carom seeds1/2tsp chilli powder2 heaped tsp ground cumin2 heaped tsp turmeric powder1 heaped tsp coriander powderA handful of fresh chopped corianderSaltHeat the oil in a pan and add the mustard seeds.

Serve with hot, buttery sourdough toast.‘This recipe is my connection to three women I never knew’View image in fullscreenGrant Whitehead’s Christmas pudding, based on his grandmother’s recipe.Grant lives in Canada but grew up eating this Christmas pudding with white sauce, a dish that links him to his grandmas from Scotland and Yorkshire. It is his most cherished recipe, he says.“Made with chopped bread, not flour, [the Christmas pudding recipe] travelled from Scotland to Canada with my grandmother, written in her own hand on a small sheet of paper, and we’ve made it every year for as long as I can remember.”Every November, his parents would bring out “the special pudding bowl passed down from my father’s mum”, he recalls. “That bowl, worn smooth with decades of use, was the signal that the season had begun. As a child, the sight of it meant Christmas was on its way; as an adult, it became a special memory [that takes me] back to the quiet joy of watching my mum and dad work together in the kitchen, creating that dark, moist, fragrant pudding.“When I eventually set out on my own, I asked my mum for the recipe. She produced the original page, still in my grandmother’s graceful cursive. The ink had begun to soften and feather, the paper fragile and browned at the edges – a patina of time, travel, and countless baking spills. I remember holding it like a relic.“It’s more than a delicious, spiced pudding. It’s a piece of our history – a recipe barely changed since it crossed the ocean, passed from a woman I never had the chance to meet, now living on in my own home each winter.“When I asked about how the white sauce came to be, my mum said that my grandmother (from Yorkshire) found it in a 1940s women’s magazine.Foodis a connecting mechanism, and this is a connection to three women I never knew: my grandma and great-grandma from Scotland, and my grandma from Yorkshire.”Grant Whitehead, 57, CanadaGrandma’s Christmas puddingDry ingredients1 cup flour1 tsp baking powder¼ tsp baking soda¼ tsp salt½ tsp cinnamon¼ tsp nutmeg, freshly ground¼ tsp cloves¼ tsp allspice1 cup soft brown bread, cut into cubes½ cup brown sugarFruit mix1 cup seedless raisins1 cup currants1 cup dates, chopped½ cup peel½ cup chopped walnuts (optional)Wet ingredients½ cup butter, softened2 eggs⅓ cup molasses1 cup milk¼ tsp vanillaGrease and flour a heatproof bowl. (A covered pudding bowl is best, but any decorative, tall ceramic bowl is fine.) Combine all the dry ingredients in a large bowl and stir to mix. Dust the fruit mixture well with flour, then add it to the dry ingredients. Fold to combine.In a separate bowl, cream the butter until softened. Add the eggs and lightly beat them into the butter. Add the molasses and milk, stirring thoroughly to combine. The molasses doesn’t always bind easily with the butter, so this may take up to a minute.Add this wet mixture to the fruit and dry ingredients. Fold gently until thoroughly combined.Spoon the batter evenly into the greased pudding bowl. The batter is thick, so gently pat it down. Gently whack the bowl on a surface to remove any air bubbles. Cover with a lid, or if no lid is available, cover with foil and tie securely with string.Put a plate in the bottom of a pot and then place the pudding bowl in the pot. Fill the pot with water so it comes halfway up the pudding bowl. Cover the pot with a lid, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low to create a steam bath. You do not want a rolling boil that will disturb the bowl. Small puddings should be steamed for one to two hours, check at one hour; large puddings can take up to three hours.Grandma Whitehead’s white sauce2 cups milk (at least 2%)1/2cup white sugar1 tbsp of butter2 tbsp cornstarch1 tsp vanillaBring a large pot of water to a boil. Then place a heatproof bowl on top, ensuring the water is not touching the bowl. In this bowl, combine the sugar and cornstarch, mix together. Once mixed, push it to one side of the bowl.Add the butter to the opposite side from the sugar/cornstarch mixture. Once the butter begins to melt, mix it gently together with the sugar/cornstarch mixture. This will prevent any lumping. Add vanilla and stir. Gradually add all of the milk, stirring well each time the milk is added. Do not mix rapidly as this will create froth; something you don’t want.Keep stirring continuously, adjusting heat if water boils over. Keep cooking until the cornstarch has created desired consistency. (I like a custard-like consistency so it’s thick but able to put over pudding.) Can be made two days before [making the pudding] and kept in fridge. To reheat, place it in a heatproof bowl over simmering water to prevent burning. Warm up gently and pour over servings.‘It is my family’s story on a plate’View image in fullscreenZack’s grandfather, Isaac, enjoying his mother’s recipe for breakfast.For Zack, spinaka – a spinach and feta pie – tells the story of resilience. “The dish came to New York with my great-grandmother, Frieda, from Turkey,” says Zack, 27, who works in music at a non-profit. “Frieda was orphaned at a young age in a small Ottoman village (what is now Turkey). Her siblings left for the Americas, leaving Frieda, eight, to fend for herself.“Spinaka was something she made to get through those tough years. It nourished her as she mended soldiers’ clothing, scraping together enough money to make the journey to New York. When she arrived in the city, life didn’t get much easier. She married and had six kids, but two died. Then the Great Depression hit, and she had to work, feed the family, and take night classes so she could learn to read and write. Again, spinaka kept everyone going: the ingredients were affordable, it was packed full of nutrients, and it could be made in large quantities.“I’ve never seen anyone else do it with the dough that my family uses. While typically made with layered phyllo dough, we make spinaka with a more crude ‘peasant dough’. You boil water and olive oil, then add flour, knead briefly, and roll out … When I make spinaka, I season the dough and add sumac to the filling. Once baked, you always serve each slice with fresh lemon juice and cracked black pepper on top.”View image in fullscreenA photo of a recipe card for spinaka.Spinaka remains a mainstay of family gatherings. “I learned the recipe from my grandmother, who learned it from her mother-in-law,” says Zack. “It’s the dish that made me discover my love of cooking. It sounds funny to say, but spinaka is at the core of my family. Even when we spend a holiday or birthday fighting with each other, we still sit around the table and savour this delicious pie together. It is always on the table.”Zack adds: “Later, Frieda would make the dish for her grandchildren and great-grandchildren at her apartment in Coney Island … Spinaka was no longer a necessity for Frieda’s survival, but she kept making it. There is something very powerful about that.“I’m humbled by that fact every time I eat the dish, and I’m proud to have this culinary connection to my roots. Spinaka is my family story on a plate.”Zack, 27,New York‘It’s everything a stew should be’View image in fullscreenBoranja stew, a Serbian recipe.Desanka Bajic always looked forward to making the Serbian stew passed down by her father, who was from the former Yugoslavia. “[It’s] called boranja, which I recently found out from my Kosovan neighbours means beans,” says Desanka, 69, who lives in London. “It is a lamb-and-green-bean stew in a tomato-based sauce, with loads of sweet paprika and potatoes. My dad showed my mum, who would cook it in the winter, just as I do now. It’s everything a stew should be: rich and full of flavour, substantial, smells divine when cooking, due to the paprika. It cooks for four hours and tastes better the second day.”Desanka grew up in England in the 1950s and 60s and remembers the food of her childhood being pretty boring. “The highlight, apart from sweets and chocolate, was fish and chips from the local chippy. But having a Yugoslav father brought food into our house that other English working-class kids did not have. And our mum, who was from Lancashire, learned to make a few things such as goulash and boranja. These were so much tastier than anything else we used to eat.“Food was definitely a focal point at Slava [an annual day when a family celebrates their patron saint] every January. We held an open house all day, and all of my dad’s friends would visit. The smell of salami, peppers and cigarette and cigar smoke would permeate our small terrace … As a young child, it was the highlight of my year – plus, [I would get] a day off school. So food was a highlight, and the smell of boranja cooking is still something I love.”Desanka Bajic, 69,LondonBoranja1kg leg or shoulder of lamb, diced and tossed in seasoned flour2 large brown onions, sliced400g chopped tomatoesTomato puree2 litres (approximately) lamb stock4-5 garlic cloves, crushed1kg large potatoes, peeled and quarteredAt least 500g runner beans, thinly sliced; ideally fresh, but frozen will do3 large tbsp sweet Hungarian paprikaSalt and pepperMake the stew in the usual way, making sure to toss the meat in flour to thicken the gravy. Hold back the potatoes and green beans for the first two hours. Then add them [to the pot], cooking the stew on a low heat and stirring regularly for four hours. Make sure it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan. It tastes better on the second day and freezes well.‘I wanted a taste of my grandmother’s cooking when I was away from home’View image in fullscreenThe ‘Good Luck’ honey cake, fresh out of the oven.The name for the delicious cake that Ben, a 72-year-old economist from Canada, has enjoyed over the years came about after he pined for a taste of home. “I was at Cardiff University in 1978 and was missing something,” he says. “I rang up my grandmother in Canada (which cost a fortune in those days) and asked her to send me the honey cake recipe so I could have a special taste of her cooking with me.“She was a bit taken aback, and told me she did not have anything written down but promised to send me something in the post. The recipe was in her lovely handwriting, [and] at the end, she wrote ‘Good Luck’ – perhaps she was dubious as to whether I would succeed. In any case, everyone in the family now refers to this cake as ‘Good Luck’ honey cake.“My grandmother had learned the recipe from her mum, my great-grandmother, who no doubt learned it from her mum. My grandmother always made it in a round pan with a hole in the middle, [and] served it for Jewish holidays, especially the Jewish new year and at breakfast after the Yom Kippur fast. I make it whenever I want to celebrate her and have a sweet to offer guests.”Ben, 72,Canada‘Preserving knowledge and skills’ in salami and celeriac toastsView image in fullscreenFamily favourite … makingtoasts au céleri et au salami.For Justine, cooking the recipes of her grandmother has been an act of archiving, ensuring that they are accessible for generations to come. “In the midst of one of the lockdowns in 2020, I borrowed my grandmother’s recipe notebook. I digitised it and shared it with the whole family,” says 34-year-old Justine, who is based in Cologne, Germany.“This recipe notebook is full of hundreds of traditional Belgian and French recipes,” says Justine, whose grandmother trained as a “professional home cook” in the 1950s in Etterbeek. “However, the recipe that stands out is her famousToasts au céleri et au salami(salami and celeriac toasts), a family favourite that has always brought us together for theapéritif.“The instructions are simple: mix the celeriac and mayonnaise before piling up the salami, tomatoes, egg and parsley on to white-bread canapés. As these toasts are often eaten at Christmas, when it’s cold outside, you can add a thin layer of butter to the toast. You could also add a turn of the black-pepper mill if you feel fancy.”Her grandmother was pleased to know that Justine was digitising these recipes, viewing “it as a way of connecting when she was no longer there”. And that is just what has happened, she says. “My paternal grandmother passed away last October. Although she was 88, we were still surprised. As my aunt put it, we all thought she was immortal, given that her own father died three months short of his 100th birthday.”Justine’s family became interested in her little recipe notebook when her grandmother died, because, she surmises: “I think they realised what they could lose if they were not paying attention.”“Now that this is published,” Justine says, “she might become somewhat immortal after all.”Justine, 34,Cologne, Germany‘My brother and I like to make our mother’s recipes’View image in fullscreen‘Melts on the tongue’ … Bramley apples make a great pairing with yorkshire pudding.Photograph: Gary K Smith/AlamyAlthough Susan left home unable to cook, today she enjoys recreating some of her late mother’s dishes. One that gets an annual outing is “apple batter”. “It’s yorkshire pudding withBramley applesin it, topped with hot golden syrup. It’s warm and comforting, and melts on the tongue,” says Susan, 66, who lives in Kent.“My mother wouldn’t let us in the kitchen while she was cooking, so me, my brother and my sister all left home unable to cook,” she explains. “When I moved to London in 1978, I survived on Smash [instant mashed potatoes], which I thought was wildly exciting, and melon. Then I met my husband in my 20s, and he showed me how to cook, and now I love cooking.”The family is not entirely sure where the recipe came from, but think it could have been from “a women’s magazine”, as their mother “barely had any recipe books”.“It is like a very large yorkshire pudding, which you make from scratch because the apples have to go in as you put the batter into the hot oil,” says Susan. Once it comes out of the oven, “still fizzing”, you pour over the syrup and serve with double cream. “I probably make this once a year or when I am cooking for the whole family,” she says.“We made sure, before my mother died three years ago, that we asked her for the basic family recipes, so they didn’t go with her. Now, my brother and I make her recipes – it is tremendously important to our father that we keep cooking the food she cooked for him. We hope it offers him comfort and reassurance.”Susan Searle, 66,KentAdditional reporting by Saranka Maheswaran andJane ClintonFamily tiesFrom the hoppel poppel – a kind of bubble and squeak – Yotam Ottolenghi’s mother used to make, to Welsh cakes passed on to Anna Jones, and an intriguing South African shepherd’s pie Thomasina Miers got from her mischievous Nanna Mimi, here are a few top cooks on the hand-me-down recipes they re-create in the kitchen.From coconut curry to hoppel poppel: Yotam Ottolenghi’s family recipesA South African shepherd’s pie: Thomasina Miers’ family recipe for bobotieWelsh cakes and bara brith: Anna Jones’s family recipesMeera Sodha’s family recipe for vegan Gujarati tomato curryLiam Charles’s recipe for coconut bread pudding – direct from his nan’s kitchenBitter-sweet memories: Rachel Roddy’s recipe for marmalade cake‘A favourite Sunday treat of my childhood’: how to make Felicity Cloake’s gooey treacle tartThe Pasta Grannies: authentic fresh pasta recipesIf you want to read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive Feast in your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFoodFeastFamilyBeans, pulses and legumesBakingnewslettersShareReuse this content"

The show, according toSheila Dillon, came into being after her interview with Charlie, a fourth-generation fruit and veg supplier at Covent Garden market, for an episode of The Food Programme exploring where chefs bought their produce. Sitting at the kitchen table with her husband the following evening, Sheila recounted her day and Charlie’s enormous knowledge, enthusiasm and ability to communicate both. A few days after that, a similar conversation took place with her colleagues at Radio 4, which resulted in Veg Talk – what’s in and what’s out in the world of fresh produce. As well as Charlie’s market report, each episode included a feature called “vegetable of the week” and the participation of studio guests –Angela Hartnett,Alastair Little,Rose Gray,Darina AllenandMitch Tonks, to name just a few – and took calls from listeners.The show had its critics – in a 2005 interview with the Independent, broadcaster Andy Kershaw is quoted as saying, “This show should have been strangled at birth” – but it also had legions of fans (myself included), who tuned in mostly for Charlie’s expertise accumulated over a lifetime of working the markets, cooking with his wife, Anna, talking to growers and reading, so it was both practical and scholarly. Add to this his sharp humour, easy bantering relationships and warm voice.The next piece in my Charlie jigsaw was provided by the late cooking teacher and gardenerCarla Tomasiin Rome. In the 1980s, Charlie supplied her restaurant Frith’s in Soho and, like so many chefs at the time, Carla was dependent on the excellent produce he sourced, especially because Frith’s, while not an Italian restaurant as such, drew heavily on Carla’s Roman-Marchigiana-Sardinian roots. It was Charlie who could bring her bitter greens, blood oranges, fresh beans, radicchio, rocket, artichokes and puntarelle.Puntarelle was also the reason for my own first contact with Charlie, via Carla and this column. He called me out of the blue when putting together his market report, at the time a newsletter from his greengrocer’s shop. He wanted to talk about puntarelle, orcicoria di catalogna, a member of the chicory family that looks, at first glance, like an elongated head of lettuce with dark serrated outer leaves (very bitter) surrounding a cluster of pale green, succulent and hollow tubes (gently bitter), which have tips not dissimilar to asparagus. It was clear after about six seconds that Charlie was more than familiar with puntarelle, and Carla grew it in her garden just outside Rome, but between them (sponges that they were) they decided I must have had things to say, too.We talked about puntarelle, Roman-style: the inner tubes are sliced into strips, curled in cold water and dressed with anchovy, garlic, olive oil and either lemon or vinegar. We also talked about the outer leaves, especially the smaller ones, which, bitter as they are, make a brilliant addition to salad, especially alongside a sweeter element (apple or persimmon, say); and with cheese, too. I have also added radicchio and a honey dressing.This week’s recipe is a salad by which to remember Charlie.Puntarelle, radicchio, celery, apple and cheeseServes41 headpuntarelle, or frisée1 small headradicchio2celery stalks1 crisp red apple½ lemon100gcheese– pecorino, grana padano asiago, manchego6 tbsp olive oil1 tbspred-wine vinegar2 tsprunny honeySalt100gwalnut halvesFirst, trim the puntarelle. Pull away the dark outer leaves, discarding any that are tough or damaged, then pull apart the paler inner tubes, cut off the tough ends and slice the tubes into short lengths or on an angle. Break the radicchio into leaves. Wash everything, then dry and rip larger leaves into manageable bits.Pull off and discard the strings from the celery stalks, then slice thinly on an angle. Don’t peel the apple, but quarter it, pare away and discard the core, then thinly slice the quarters, rubbing them over with the lemon so they don’t discolour. Use a potato peeler to cut off thin, uneven slices of cheese.In the bottom of a large bowl, whisk the olive oil, vinegar, honey and a pinch of salt. Add the leaves, toss really well, then add the celery, apple and walnuts, and toss again. Add half the cheese, toss once more, then turn out the salad on to a large platter or four small plates, top with the remaining cheese and serve at once.Explore more on these topicsSaladA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkFoodrecipesShareReuse this content"

The sheer-sided valley is skirted with rugged farmhouses and the road twists, over ravines and round hairpin curves, to a holiday destination that feels like a well-kept secret.On the village’s frozen lake, young families ice skate, hand in hand. A little farther along, on the snow-covered main street, children sled rapidly downhill, overtaking cars. The resort’s mascots are a happy gang of brown bears. And there are Narnia lamp-posts, which turn the falling snow almost gold every evening. Switzerland is replete with ski towns but none feel quite this innocent and childlike, like stepping into a fairytale.South-east Switzerland mapI am here for a week in an apartment with my wife and two kids, as it’s a place my Swiss partner’s parents and grandparents have been returning to for more than a century. What first drew them here? All say the same thing: Arosa is the Swiss mountain village most Swiss don’t even think to visit; a low-key alternative to the box office of St Moritz, Verbier and Zermatt.The village sits on a high, terraced plateau one hour south of Chur, Switzerland’s oldest city, and is surrounded by dense fir forests, above which rises an amphitheatre of saw-cut summits. The sense is that the out-of-sight village has been secretly occupied – the pretty-as-pie peaks standing sentry – as if the first farmers here back in the 14th century feared the Habsburgs might return at any moment to take back their territories.This is also storybook Switzerland to a T. To the north isHeidiland, the farm holiday region where Johanna Spyri set her children’s novels. Also one hour away is Liechtenstein, the pipsqueak principality, which brings to my mind the land of Vulgaria in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Two hours to the north is Zurich where we arrived, before borrowing my in-laws’ car. If you fancy taking the train, there are options to do the trip from the UK to Zurich in as little as seven hours, with a change in Paris. Arosa can then be reached on the memorably scenicRhaetian Railway, a journey with some of the Alps’ most glorious in-seat entertainment. Outside, all the drama is provided by a script of high-definition gorges and glaciers.Strict building regulations, upholding traditional timber aesthetics, mean the village is largely the same now as it was when my relatives first visitedTheArosa Bear Sanctuary, at the middle station of the Weisshorn cable car, is a good place to start exploring. Even during the residents’ winter deep sleep, the 2.8 hectare den offers a walk-through education in animal welfare in an unlikely setting, and its wooden platforms offer memorable views of the snow-fuzzed summits and pistes that lead off in every direction like a spreadeagled skier.The refuge is run in cooperation with global animal charityFour Pawsand it provides four rescued European brown bears a species-appropriate home. Once held in appalling conditions, including a private mini zoo in Albania, the bears’ compound is now a place to readjust, to feel safe again. For the full Yogi and Boo-Boo experience, I’d suggest visiting in summer.View image in fullscreenRhaetian railway passing through snow in Arosa.Photograph: AlamyIt’s fair to say my six-year-old daughter fizzes with enthusiasm when the bears are mentioned, but also when we snowshoe later that week into pine forest along the resort’s themedSquirrel Trail. The trail is printed with fresh squirrel tracks and we add our own, feather-pressing our boots into the crisp snow. The flakes fall heavily, as if we’re inside an ornamental snow globe. Then, two red squirrels scurry past with dark-furred yet sparkling tails.Most days we ski until lunch. All children enjoy one free half-day group lesson for each night’s stay in Arosa withABC Snowsports Schoolor theSwiss Ski and Snowboard School, but we prefer to explore the mountains as a family. Since 2014, the resort has been connected across the gaping Urden valley with the larger town of Lenzerheide, and like other popular Alpine ski areas, the combined piste map is now a profusion of primary colour squiggles.But there the similarity ends. British accents are absent. The pistes are largely empty. Strict building regulations, upholding traditional timber aesthetics, mean the village is largely the same now as it was when my relatives first visited. It is Switzerland, but from a half-century ago. At the barn-likeTschuggenstübli, once a cheese dairy on the slopes, everyone crams on to tables to orderbündnerfleisch(air-dried beef) andkäseschnitte, an upgraded welsh rarebit with melted raclette cheese, pickles and onions.This is not a traditional ski hotel – it's certainly not a vintage chalet brimming with geranium window boxes and mounted antlersAfterwards, it’s toboggan time. It strikes me there are almost as many traditional wooden sledges for hire in Arosa as there are pairs of skis, and, from the top of the Kulm Gondola, the only way is down. And at speed. My kids are barely ruffled by the tight, bobsleigh chicanes and, one afternoon, we all howl with laughter as my eight-year-old son hurtles off the track into a marshmallowy drift. He pops back up, grinning, but polar bear white. We repeat the sledge run another half-dozen times.View image in fullscreenThe Grand Arosa Pop-up Hotel uses a vacant resort hotel.Photograph: Studio Filipa Peixeiro/Le Terrier StudioAnother reason for visiting this winter is to stay atthe Grand Arosa Pop-Up Hotel, a one-year experiment inside a vacant resort hotel which is open to the end of this season – the concept will continue next year, though details are yet to be confirmed (they also operate another pop-up hotel in Fribourg and a pop-up hostel in Zurich). Clues as to its aesthetic are in the name – this is not a ski hotel in the traditional sense, and certainly not a vintage chalet brimming with geranium window boxes and mounted antlers. More than that, it is probably the Alps’ largest ever pop-up hotel and its interiors are bathed in pastel pink. If you can find me cooler ski accommodation this year, I’m happy to wait.With a tech-first approach, there is no reception, but self-check in instructions imposed on a poster of a purple bellboy. What might have once been a telephone operator’s room is reimagined as a walk-in guest book, its fan-print wallpaper covered with whimsical, hand-written comments. Velvet curtains drape two symmetrical elevators, then a cloaked red corridor suggests you are somehow walking backstage at a theatre, before revealing a piano observatory and a vintage design cinema. A Wes Anderson film set has been conjured before you. We only drop in for coffee, but I wish we’d stayed.At the end of our week, my wife mentions to me how sad she is to be leaving. The kids aren’t too happy about it either. Neither am I. It crosses my mind that Arosa, with its sleepy bears, squirrels and surreal pop-up hotel, isn’t what most people come to Switzerland for. Rather, it’s what we’ve been looking for all along.The trip was supported byArosa-Lenzerheide.Singles/doubles atthe Grand Arosa Pop-Up Hotel, from€117 room-only.

Banks and department stores have been replaced by vape shops, barbers and bookmakers. Shoplifting is at a record high, local services cut, andpublic frustrationis mounting.Politically, high street decline is perfect campaign fodder for Nigel Farage’sReform UK.Research showssupport for Reformis higher in places with the biggest rise in persistent high street vacancy rates. Across the UK in 2024 almost 13,000 shops – about 37 a day –pulled down their shutters for good. Closures have been most pronounced in the north of England, the Midlands and deprived coastal towns where Reform ran Labour closest at the general election.In-depthpollingby YouGov and researchers at Faster Horses shows 62% of voters considering backing Reform think their local area is in decline. “It’s just soul destroying to watch your local area turn to shit,” one focus group participant told the researchers.For many, this decay reflects the country at large. Britain has “gone to the dogs”, with its best days in the past – despite the promises of successive Tory and Labour governments to turn things around. For millions, levelling up has not materialised. Why not give someone else a try?Analysis by the University of Warwick professor Thiemo Fetzer – whose previous research haslinked austerity and Brexit– shows the places with thehighest rates of shop closuresin England and Wales are more likely to back rightwing populist parties.In total, retail accounts for 5% of the UK economy and less than a 10th of employment. But its visible position on the high street gives it outsize influence on public perception.“It has channelled people’s anger at the structural change around them. They don’t always personally perceive things to be negative for them. They say: ‘I’m doing fine.’ But they see and feel their community around them eroding. That for me is one of the main drivers of populism,” Fetzer said.“You almost have a non-linear tipping point where you cascade into oblivion. It happens in the UK; in Europe, in Germany, everywhere. And it is particularly concentrated in the midsize towns.”Some of the decline is self-inflicted. Almosthalf of Britons do not visit their high streetor shopping area at least once a week. The top barriers people list are also self-reinforcing: not enough interesting shops, and too many empty ones.However, there are deeper reasons – reflecting the UK’s geography, consumer preferences, economics and policy choices.Over the past two decades the internet has transformed the high street.Online spendinghas rocketed from less than 3% of total retail sales in Great Britain in 2006 to more than 25%, in a shift accelerated by the Covid pandemic. Despite the dominance of US e-commerce companies such as Amazon and eBay,Britons are more likely to shop online than Americans, where long distances limit doorstep delivery.Retailers have suffered from weaker levels of consumer demand amid the cost of living crisis. Real wages flatlined in the 2010s, inflation hit a 40-year high, growth in living standards has slowed, and many consumers are prioritising spending on experiences over physical goods. Some experts believe Britain reached“peak stuff”years ago.Retailers also complain that elevated inflation, interest rates, tax increases, government regulations, and a rising minimum wage have made it harder to turn a profit. Rents and utility costs have also risen sharply.Bricks-and-mortar shops also have a disadvantage to online retail through the business rates system – a tax based on commercial property values. As is the case with other overheads, this makes a chain of high street shops more expensive than a warehouse on the outskirts of town.Labourpromisedto replace the business rates system in England before coming to power. But that has not happened. At the autumn budget, Rachel Reeves said she was introducing the “lowest tax rates since 1991” for the system. But hospitalitybusinesses warn their bills are rising– putting high street pubs, cafes and restaurants at risk.Underinvestment in transport, policing, healthcare and social services has also contributed. Homelessness has risen and shoplifting offences have jumped – with an increase by 13% to more than half a million offences in the year to June 2025.Fetzer believes these factors and the rise of online shopping have fuelled social isolation and fear of others, further discouraging high street visits in a doom loop exploited by the far right.“People have lost their ability to speak to one another.”Some places buck the trend – typically where there is a higher concentration of independent retail, hospitality and tourism to lure in visitors. However, big cities and affluent areas find this easier to sustain – adding to the sense of Britain as an increasingly divided nation.Ministers highlight efforts to turn things around. Labour has announced£5bn of “Pride in Place” fundingfor communities to invest in local priorities, including buying community spaces and revamping high streets. The government has also established a taskforce to tackle dodgy high street stores and a licensing scheme so that only legitimate shops can legally sell tobacco and vapes.Still, the danger for Keir Starmer is the depth and complexity of the economic challenge facing the high street. Any turnaround before a make-or-break set of May local elections looks tough.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryFar rightReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

These charts reveal how much the Greens have advancedAshley KirkThe Green party has made gains under its leader – but there is also uncertainty aheadThu 29 Jan 2026 02.37 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 04.42 ESTShareThe Greens talk of a “Polanski effect” – a surge of momentum and visibility sinceZack Polanskibecame leader, as the party gains attention in an increasingly fragmented political landscape.Thepollsoffer the clearest signal so far of whether that narrative is borne out in public support. But they are not the only thing to consider and experts say the reality is hard to be certain about.Since Polanski was elected in September 2025, the Greens have risen by an average of four points in the polls.The Guardian’s latest poll tracker – which combines polls over the last 10 days – has the party polling at 13.5%. This is five points behind Labour, on 18.6%.Line chart of Westminster poll averagesThe chart above shows that the average position of the Greens has increased since Polanski took over the leadership, but experts have pointed out that there is disparity in the level of support the Greens receive across polls.January polling from YouGov and Find Out Now had the Greens on 17%, significantly more than Focaldata (10%), More in Common (11%) and Survation (11%).This may be down to what exactly polling companies are asking voters – some pollsters do not include the Greens as an option in their surveys, which would lead to lower vote shares than if respondents had been prompted.Or it could be down to bigger modelling assumptions. Polling companies disagree on the number of 2024 Labour supporters currently backing the Greens, for example.Who is switching to the Greens?If we look atYouGovfigures, its polling estimates that currently, 20% of Labour voters would vote Green. This has increased from 11% in similar polling when Polanski took over the leadership.Prof Sir John Curtice, of the University of Strathclyde, said: “The polls disagree by how much, but the Greens have added to Labour’s woes. Already there was the case that Labour’s vote wasscattering in all directions, and now that’s even become clearer in a post-Polanski world.”Bar chart showing how one in five 2024 Labour voters currently say they would vote GreenAge is the biggest factor in Green support. Not only are ​​18- to 24-year-olds the most likely to say they will vote Green, but they are also the group who have swung the most to the Greens in the last couple of months.Polling fromYouGovreveals that 26% of 18- to 24-year-olds said they would vote for the Greens in early September last year, but this number had increased to 45% as of 18-19 January.Chart showing how the Greens have gained the most support among young peopleCurtice added that the Greens’ appeal to this demographic group could hurt Labour hard, especially in May’s local elections in London. “The Labour vote is young middle-class professionals, who are mostly in London. This is precisely the group that the Greens appeal to.”What are the key issues for Green voters?The cost of living is the top concern for allGreen partysupporters.However, the economy and Brexit are more important to new Green voters than to existing supporters, while Gaza is less important to them. YouGov data from December shows 30% of new Green voters (non-2024voters) prioritise the economy, compared with just 18% of existing supporters.New Green supporters also place less importance on climate change (7% listed it as their most important issue) than existing supporters (12%).Chart showing how the economy and the NHS are more important issues for Green voters who have switched since the electionAdam McDonnell, the head of UK political and academic research at YouGov, said: “There isn’t much difference between those who already voted Green at the last election and those they’ve gained since, with both groups highlighting the cost of living, the NHS and the environment as top concerns.“Those who didn’t vote Green in 2024 but now intend to place a higher weight on the economy in general. In terms of positioning, that implies the Greens may want to look at economic messages which resonate with the voters they are winning over, who we know from other work tend to be young, highly educated and relatively affluent.”An Ipsos polling analyst said that Green supporters were in line with Lib Dem and Labour supporters on defence and the NHS, but they are more likely to be concerned about inequality and have relaxed views onimmigration. They also commented on the anti-establishment strain among Green supporters, with them more likely to be distrustful of authority figures and think there are problems with the wider system.How are Polanski’s personal ratings?Curtice said that with Polanski and Farage on the national stage, “you now have charismatic leaders at both ends of the spectrum. Both of them have a clear vision. And that creates a contrast between that and the conventional political leaders.”Polling from Ipsos suggests Polanski’s current net favourability rating is -15 points. As of 19 January, 20% of people had a favourable view of him, compared with 35% who had an unfavourable view of him.This net favourability rating is better than all national political leaders with the exception of the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey. However, a lot of this is down to the fact that 45% of the public still have not made up their minds about Polanski, or simply do not know who he is yet.A greater proportion of people are favourable of the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, Davey and Reform UK’s Nigel Farage.Chart showing how despite his net favourability rating being better than most leaders, lots of people still don’t know who Polanski isJoe Twyman, the founder and director of the public opinion consultancy Deltapoll, said the Greens’ positioning as an anti-establishment party, alongside Reform, was critical in a political world where incumbent parties were struggling. “There is a desire for a new political movement because the ‘old guard’ have been seen to have failed. You have options for nationalist parties, but if you want proper challengers on a national level, it’s either Reform or Green – and it’s the Greens if you’re more socially liberal.”Twyman added that there was a lot of uncertainty on where the Greens would end up in a political volatile period: “If you have five- or six-way races, and any party could take it as they’re within five or 10 points of each other, that brings tactical voting to the fore.“The key question is how those parties – Reform and the Greens – will be able to convert good polling numbers into actual voters come the next general election. Up until now previous general elections strategies have been based on specific constituencies, but if you have wider ambitions you have to broaden to a national campaign. That means asking questions on how you get a party machine with boots on the ground, knocking on doors, how you mature into a national party. We don’t have an answer to those questions yet.”What could this mean for an election?In its latest MRP polling,More in Commonestimated that there were 16 seats where the Greens were likely to get over 30% of the vote.The polling technique, known as multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) modelling, is designed to help reveal an increasingly chaotic political map by giving estimated results for every individual seat. It estimated that the party would win nine seats in total: mostly urban seats, although holding onto their two rural constituencies that they won in 2024.Map showing how the Greens are forecast to perform best in citiesAt the time the poll was published, More in Common said: “Four projected gains come directly from Labour collapse in progressive-leaning urban areas such as Bristol, Manchester, and Sheffield, suggesting the Greens are managing to position themselves as the progressive alternative.”This MRP also reveals the potential for tactical voting.There are 179 seats where the combined Lib Dem, Green and Labour vote share is greater than the combined Conservative and Reform vote share. Forty of these are forecast to be won by either Reform or the Conservatives – and in eight of these the Greens are the biggest of the three progressive national parties.Table of Modelled constituency results based on January polling.Looking ahead at the local elections in May, Green gains in London would be seen as a strong signal that the party is flipping the kind of progressive voter they would need to switch allegiance in a general election. They have also announced a major push for theGorton and Denton byelection.Explore more on these topicsGreen partyZack PolanskianalysisShareReuse this content"

He characterized the security situation in Venezuela as being “under very strong control” after Rodríguez replaced Maduro.Direct commercial passenger and cargo flights between the US and Venezuela had already been suspended since May 2019, under Trump’s first term, when the Department of Transportation determined conditions in the country posed unacceptable safety and security risks to American carriers, crews and passengers.In November, as Trump was ramping up pressure on Maduro, he declared that the airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela should be considered as“closed in its entirety”.Can Venezuela’s Delcy Rodríguez become a Latin American Deng Xiaoping?Read moreThe US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) then told pilots to be cautious flying around the country because of heightened military activity, and international airlines began canceling flights to Venezuela.Trump’s announcement signaled the latest step in a rapid normalization of relations between Washington and Caracas under the interim government, which is mostly composed of Maduro’s former subordinates.For US oil companies, the opening also represents an opportunity to access Venezuela’s vast oil reserves, though significant infrastructure investment would probably be required to restore production to previous levels after years of deterioration and underinvestment.Trump revealed that major US oil companies were already on the ground in Venezuela conducting site assessments for potential operations.“We have the major oil companies going to Venezuela now, scouting it out and picking their locations, and they’ll be bringing back tremendous wealth for Venezuela and for the United States,” he said.Rodríguez, once one of Maduro’s closest allies who was formerly responsible for the feared Sebin intelligence agency, has voiced occasional defiance towards Washington while carefully signaling that she is willing to accommodate US demands.The acting president has moved quickly to reset diplomatic ties with Washington, and is pushing through legislation that Trump has characterized as placing the sector under US oversight.On Sunday, Rodríguez told a group of oil workers she had had “enough” of Washington’s orders, but on Wednesday the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, told the US Congress that communications with Venezuela’s new leaders had been “very respectful and productive”.Earlier this week, Rodríguez said that the United States had agreed to unblock the country’s foreign-held sovereign assets, with the funds designated for healthcare and energy purchases.American Airlines, which was the last US airline flying to Venezuela when it suspended flights there in March 2019, announced on Thursday that it intended to reinstate nonstop service in the coming months.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaAir transportDonald TrumpDelcy RodríguezNicolás MaduroUS foreign policyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The pro-independence campaign has been travelling across the province as organizers try to collect nearly 178,000 signatures over the next few months. The group has publicly said it wants a $500bn credit facility from the US treasury to help fund the creation of a new country if their referendum is successful.“I think that while we can respect the right of any Canadian to express themselves to vote in a referendum, I think we need to draw the line at people seeking the assistance of foreign countries to break up this beautiful land of ours,” Eby told reporters, adding he would raise this at a meeting of provincial leaders later in the day.Alberta’s premier, Danielle Smith, who has rejected the idea of separation and said she “supports a strong and sovereign Alberta within a united Canada”, is facing mounting criticism that her government recently made it easier for residents to petition for a referendum.The Ontario premier, Doug Ford, said Smith needed “to stand up [to the separatists] and say enough is enough”.Last week, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, appeared to support the efforts by the separatists in an interview with the conservative website Real America’s Voice.“They have great resources. Albertans are a very independent people,” he said. “Rumour [is] that they may have a referendum on whether they want to stay in Canada or not … People are talking. People want sovereignty. They want what the US has got.”Prominent Indigenous leaders in the province were due to speak on the issue on Thursday, warning earlier in the week that Elections Alberta was “ill-equipped” to deal with the potential of foreign interference in the referendum. They have warned no secession is possible without consultation with treaty holders, whose agreement predates the creation of Alberta as a province within Canada.Increasingly, analysts worry that outside influence from the US could give separatists outsized influence.Conflict researcher Thomas Homer-Dixon previously told the Guardian a “fifth column” approach by separatists – working with outside forces to destabilize Canada – is a growing and increasingly realistic fear. He warned a looming separation referendum could fail but Trump could argue the results were “fake” and the US would move troops to the northern Montana border and tell the rest of Canada that Alberta must be allowed to join the US as the “51st state”.“We need to be planning right now to neutralize this kind of activity, well in advance. Because it seems increasingly like disinformation campaigns, appeals for help, declarations that the electoral process was fake and was stacked are something we need to game out,” said Homer-Dixon. “The reality is, right now, we’re just sleepwalking into it.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaTrump administrationAmericasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Another country to tick off his list and he always feels a lot better about himself when he’s abroad. Less noise from his unhappy MPs. Plus he loved the pomp and ceremony that came with it. The large flags. The military bands. A country that treated him with respect. Almost. Besides, Mark Carney and Emmanuel Macron had both made recent trips. He had seen their holiday photos. Now it was his turn. He couldn’t bear to be left out.The Chinese? Not so much. They couldn’t really see the point. But they would schedule in a couple of meetings on the condition the UK government gave the green light to the new “mega embassy” near the Tower of London. Consider it done, said Keir. All systems go for the first prime-ministerial visit since Theresa May in 2018.Chinese state media views Starmer’s visit as act of economic pragmatismRead moreThere were a few more conditions.Xi Jinpinghad made it clear there would be a joint press conference with himself and Starmer. Xi doesn’t take well to answering hostile questions from the media. Instead there would be a joint statement in which they mouthed mostly bland platitudes. A way of filling dead air. Keir had quickly agreed. Any opportunity to prevent a possible diplomatic incident was fine by him. He would handle the British media in his own way. Taking a long time to say not very much. Words that would die within milliseconds of broadcast. As though his entire plan for the trip had been to get as little TV coverage as possible. An unusual strategy. But the only one that made any real sense.The meeting between Starmer and Xi had been scheduled to last 40 minutes. Hardly worth a four-day trip with a large trade delegation, you’d have thought. Maybe the two leaders really didn’t have anything much to say to each other. Certainly not for public consumption at a bilateral meeting in Beijing. Or maybe it was all a bluff. Shoot low and when the meeting runs to double the estimated time, both sides can claim it as a sign of how well they were getting on. Or maybe the simultaneous translation failed and the two leaders had to get the other’s sentences repeated back in their own language.Then the end-of-summit statements. For Keir this was everything he had dreamed of. Sitting at the same table as a previously hostile superpower. Though obviously he wasn’t going to do more than allude to any potential differences. That generally wasn’t seen as a great idea on a first date. What Britain needed withChinawas a “sophisticated” relationship.View image in fullscreenThis was everything Keir had dreamed of ... though obviously he wasn’t going to do more than allude to any potential differences.Photograph: Carl Court/ReutersMmm. Are you sure about that, Keir? A sophisticated relationship is one in which either one or both of a middle-class or celebrity couple are routinely unfaithful to one another but stay together for the sake of convenience and appearances. Was that what Keir meant? Did he want to sign off some deal that was worth more to China than it was to Britain? While turning a blind eye to China funding and providing weapons to some of the world’s rogue states. Actually, yes. That was what he meant. Any relationship was better than none.Xi used his opportunity to bestow a little largesse. The Labour party had shown great wisdom in its efforts to improve relations. The last few years had done neither country any favour. Here Xi took a swipe at Kemi Badenoch for trying to inflame hostilities at every opportunity. Keir might have suggested to the Chinese that they shouldn’t take this too personally. Kemi was a one woman piece of liability-driven performance art. Just the previous day she had first said she wanted to see the back of her rightwing drama queens before telling the centrists they also were no longer welcome. She won’t be happy until the Tory party is hers alone. Along with human tick Chris Philp.There would be new opportunities opening, Xi went on to say. Though he wasn’t at all clear what they might be. But let a hundred flowers bloom and all that. There had been twists and turns that had been in neither country’s interests. Now was the time to put those differences aside. Well, some of them. Let’s be grown up. Of course China was spying on the UK. Just as the UK was spying on China. It was hardly Xi’s fault if his spies were more effective than ours. “Range far your eye over long distances,” Xi concluded, quoting a Chinese proverb. Maybe he knows more about Keir’s long-term prospects than we did.Later in the day, Starmer chose to give a number of interviews to British reporters. While they all appreciated the good vibes, could Keir talk through some of the tangible gains he had made? Er, top secret, but Chinese companies would no longer supply outboard motors to people smugglers. Not directly at any rate. Who knew what happened on secondary markets. The smuggling gangs must now be in a right panic.And Brits would now get visa free access to China for 30 days. Just like Germany and France. This was a huge win, said Keir. There were other deals potentially in the offing in the future. It felt very much as if the Chinese were all out to sell to us. Rather than buy. I hope our trade delegation aren’t too disappointed about that.Moving on. Had Starmer mentioned the British Hong Kong dissidentJimmy Lai? And all those MPs who had been sanctioned by the Chinese state? Yes, I did, said Keir. But very quietly. More of a mumble, really. Probably when Xi needed to take a toilet break. Still, someone on the Chinese delegation had said the prime minister’s comments had been noted. But they would be making no plans to activate any changes any time soon. Don’t watch this space.Finally the news we had all been waiting for. Starmer might not have been able to restrain himself from offering the Chinese a return state visit to the UK. Maybe not in so many words. But definitely some heavy hints. He just couldn’t help himself. He had known the previous year that it had been a mistake to offer Donald Trump a state visit on their first meeting. He had tried to play it cool. Not give away the one bargaining chip he had. The only thing Trump wanted from the UK. Other than flattery. Now he had done it again. If only he was better at deferred gratification.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe politics sketchXi JinpingChinaForeign policyTrade policyAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

He made a series of announcements that could unlock new opportunities for British businesses.In a significant move, China agreed to a visa waiver for British tourists and business travellers, ending the requirement for travel to be no more than 30 days and bringing the UK into line with 50 other countries.The UK also signed a number of agreements with China on closer economic cooperation, including greater trade and services, making it easier for British firms to operate there. They included a $15bn (£10.8bn) investment by the pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca in its Chinese operation. Beijing also agreed to halve its tariff on Scotch whisky imports from 10% to 5%, estimated to benefit the industry by £250m over five years, Downing Street said.No 10 said the meeting was constructive on a number of issues, including the fate of the jailed Hong Kong pro-democracy activistJimmy Lai– whose release the UK has urged – and the lifting of sanctions on British MPs and peers.The leaders discussed the Ukraine conflict, and were “quite clear they have the same goal” of ending the war, with peace talks playing a part. But No 10 would not say whether Starmer – who spoke to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the eve of his visit – had pressed Xi to try to restrain Russia.With Starmer under pressure at home not to sacrifice national security for the sake of closer economic ties with the world’s second-biggest economy, Downing Street confirmed that security had been discussed more broadly. It said there had been constructive discussions on rebuilding the UK embassy in Beijing.In opening remarks before their talks, Xi told Starmer: “Your visit this time has drawn a lot of attention. Sometimes good things take time. As long as it is the right thing that serves the fundamental interests of the country and the people, then as leaders we should not shy away from difficulties and we should press ahead.“As long as we take a broad perspective, rise above differences and respect each other, then we will prove ourselves able to stand the test of history,” he added.Xi acknowledged that the UK-China relationship had experienced “twists and turns” over the years that had not served the interests of either country.Against a backdrop of Donald Trump’sambitions for Greenland,tensions with Iranand Vladimir Putin’swar in Ukraine, Xi suggested that in such a turbulent world it was essential both countries worked together for “world peace”.Describing the state of the world as “turbulent and fluid”, Xi said more dialogue between the UK and China was “imperative”, whether it was “for the sake of world peace and stability” or for both economies.Starmer told Xi he wanted a “more sophisticated” relationship. “It is with the British people in mind that I am here today. I made the promise 18 months ago when we were elected into government that I would make Britain face outwards again.“Because as we all know, events abroad affect everything that happens back in our home countries, from prices on the supermarket shelves to how secure we feel.”At the UK-China Business Council later, Starmer told delegates Xi had recounted a story about blind men being presented with an elephant. “One touches the leg and thinks it’s a pillow, another feels the belly and thinks it’s a wall,” he went on.“And too often this reflects how China is seen. But I profoundly believe that broader and deeper engagement … is our way of seeing the whole elephant and therefore building a more sophisticated relationship fit for these times.”Xi praised former Labour governments, under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, for working constructively on bilateral relations.The meeting between the two men ran to 80 minutes, almost double the allotted time, followed by private talks between Xi, his foreign minister, Starmer and his national security adviser, Jonathan Powell. This was followed by lunch in the ornate Golden Hall, where, along with global affairs, they discussed William Shakespeare and football.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerXi JinpingChinaInternational tradeForeign policyAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump did not give a start or end date for the ceasefire.Both Russia andUkraineseemed surprised by Trump’s public announcement of the agreement. Zelenskyy later wrote that a ceasefire on power plants and other vital energy infrastructure had been discussed between the two sides and that he “expects the agreements to be implemented”.“The situation is unfolding overnight and the reality at our energy facilities and in our cities will reflect this in the coming days,” he said.Russian and Ukrainian social media channels close to the military had speculated about a short ceasefire before Trump’s announcement, but the reports had not been confirmed. On Thursday morning the Kremlin declined to discuss whether an energy ceasefire had been negotiated.Trump also claimed he had informed Ukrainian officials about the ceasefire. “Ukraine … almost didn’t believe it but they were very happy about it,” Trump said.‘An attempt to break people’: Bucha holds out amid Russia’s weaponisation of winterRead moreTwo recent Russian missile and drone strikes left more than1 million people in Kyiv without powerand more than 6,000 buildings without heating, according to Reuters. The country is enduring a brutally cold winter and temperatures are expected to drop to -20C (-4F) in the coming weeks.Hours earlier, Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin aide, had rejected assertions by Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, that the only issue left to resolve between Kyiv and Moscow to end the war concerned control over Ukrainian territory in the Donbas region.“The territorial issue is the most important issue but many other issues remain on the agenda,” Ushakov said. Asked about security guarantees the west had pledged to Ukraine in the event of a deal, Ushakov said: “No one agreed on this.”Ukraine and Russia are expected to continue talks in Abu Dhabi this weekend that will focus specifically on military contacts and efforts at monitoring a potential ceasefire.Trilateral talks including US officialslast week were the first time the three sides had sat down to negotiations since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022.Ushakov was guarded when asked whether the talks were at an advanced stage. “We held the first round of negotiations within the framework of the security working groups. That’s where we are,” he said.LiveRussia launches ‘brutal’ attack on Ukraine’s two largest cities – videoOn Thursday evening, Zelenskyy said he had intelligence that Russia was preparing for a new strike against Ukraine. “Our intelligence has provided information on this issue and it is necessary that the US,Europeand all our partners understand how this discredits the diplomatic discussions,” he wrote.Earlier, he had warned of Russia “using the negotiating process with the cynical, harsh goal of delaying new measures of pressuring Russia [to make peace] that could work”.Earlier this week, a Russiandrone strike on a Ukrainian passenger trainkilled five people onboard, according to Ukrainian prosecutors. One drone struck a carriage of the train, which was carrying 155 passengers, and two more drones detonated alongside it. Zelenskyy called the attack an act of terrorism.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaTrump administrationDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Local media said Schafroth was reported to the police and fined.Avaaraq Olsen, the mayor of Sermersooq district, which includes the capital, was outraged. “Raising a flag at our capital cultural centre, the flag of a military superpower that for weeks has been implying military force against our country, is not a joke. It is not funny. It is immensely harmful,” she said in a statement.‘Are they going to bring their violence here?’: Fear – but little preparation – as threat of invasion looms over GreenlandRead moreOlsen said Greenlanders, particularly children, were worried and afraid about the current situation. “When you amplify those fears for content, clicks or laughs, you are not being bold or creative. You are adding to the distress of an already vulnerable population,” she said.“So, pause before you film. Think before you stage something ‘funny’. Consider whether your next question or stunt will inform the world or simply make a child cry or a family feel less safe in their own country.”Greenland’s government is working to alleviate the stress and anxiety among the population caused by Donald Trump’s repeated threats to seize the Arctic territory.Schafroth is known inGermanyfor his involvement in the satirical programme Extra Drei, which is broadcast on the NDR channel and attracts more than 1 million viewers. In a statement to Germany’s Der Spiegel and the Ritzau agency, the channel expressed its regrets after the incident.Trump’s longstandingterritorial designs on Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, have triggered the most serious crisis in Nato’s history. He has since backtracked on a threat of using force to acquire Greenland and begun talks with Copenhagen and Nuuk.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandGermanyDenmarkEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The paramilitary organisation has played a significant role in suppressing demonstrations in Iran. “Any regime that kills thousands of its own people is working toward its own demise,” she wrote on X.Hannah Neumann, chair of the European parliament’s delegation for relations with Iran, said the IRGC listing was a “long-overdue political signal that massive violence and transnational repression will no longer go unanswered”.She said in a statement: “This listing is not merely symbolic. It carries very concrete legal consequences: assets are frozen, and any financial or material support becomes a criminal offence.”The EU also added 15 Iranian government officials and six organisations to its sanctions list for their role in “serious human rights violations” in the repression of protesters. The listings included Iran’s minister of the interior, Eskandar Momeni, and several IRGC commanders, senior police and law enforcement officers, anEU statementsaid.Entities facing sanctions include the Iranian Audio-Visual Media Regulatory Authority and several software companies involved in censoring activities, such as trolling campaigns on social media, spreading misinformation and disinformation and disrupting internet access.The latest additions mean the EU has sanctioned 247 individuals and 50 entities over human rights violations. Separate restrictions (asset freezes and travel bans) have been imposed on Iranian people and organisations aiding Russia’s war on Ukraine.The long-discussed EU listing of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps came after Donald Trump told Tehran tonegotiate a deal on the future of its nuclear programme or face a possible military strike. He announced on social media that a “massive armada” was on the way ready to fulfil its mission “with speed and violence if necessary”.The Axios website reported that the Trump administration wouldhost senior defence and intelligence officialsfrom Israel and Saudi Arabia this week for talks on Iran.Trump held back from threatened military strikes on Iran earlier this month, after calls from the Gulf states for restraint and warnings fromIsraelthat it needed more time to prepare for likely reprisals.Russia, which has deepened ties with Iran since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, warned on Thursday against any “destabilising” military action in the region. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, said: “Any forceful actions can only create chaos in the region and lead to very dangerous consequences in terms of destabilising the security system throughout the region.”Disappeared bodies, mass burials and ‘30,000 dead’: what is the truth of Iran’s death toll?Read moreMore than 30,000 people may have been killed in the latest wave of repression in Iran, according to some estimates. Human rights groups say a “revenge” campaign has been unleashed by the regime, withdoctors and healthcare workers facing death sentencesfor treating badly injured protesters.The EU terror designation of the IRGC became possible after France dropped its long-held opposition. Jean-Nöel Barrot, the French foreign minister, wrote on X: “The unbearable repression of the peaceful uprising of the Iranian people cannot go unanswered.”France, along with other member states, had resisted the designation of the Iranian regime’s state body, fearing it would damage diplomatic channels and the interests of French citizens in the country.Belgium had similar qualms, but its government last year included support for the EU listing in the coalition agreement. Belgium’s foreign minister, Maxime Prévot, said on Thursday his country continued to advocate for the terror designation “particularly in light of the atrocities and repression that have been observed in recent weeks”.On Thursday, Tehran’s top diplomat criticised the EU’s decision to designate the IRGC a terrorist organisation as a “major strategic mistake”. In a post on X, Abbas Araghchi, the Iranian foreign minister, wrote: “Several countries are presently attempting to avert the eruption of all-out war in our region. Europe is instead busy fanning the flames.” Iran is facing off with the US, which has moved a strike force to the Middle East.Established after the 1979 Islamic revolution, theIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corpsis an elite paramilitary force loyal to the country’s supreme leader,Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It is separate to the regular army, with 150,000 ground troops and its own navy and air force.It was listed a terrorist organisation by the US in 2019 during the first Trump administration, by Canada in 2024, and by Australia in 2025.The EU’s decision renews pressure on the British government, which has not proscribed the IRGC but has kept open the option to do so in the future.Yvette Cooper, the British foreign secretary, has promised to draw up new legislation to be able to proscribe state organisations such as the IRGC without having to designate them as a terrorist organisation under existing laws.Cooper told MPs earlier this month: “The scale of the truly brutal, horrendous actions in Iran means that we should stand together in condemnation of that action, and in the action that we need to take in concert with our allies, including on further sanctions and further immediate pressure on the regime.”A spokesperson for the prime minister’s office said on Thursday: “We welcome those announcements by the EU, which will further hold the Iranian authorities to account for the violence and brutality shown against peaceful protesters.”The UK Foreign Office views a decision on proscription as largely symbolic given the extensive sanctions already in place and is concerned such a move might trigger the expulsion of British diplomats in Tehran. The IRGC is already subject to asset freezes and other sanctions in the UK.Explore more on these topicsIranEuropean UnionProtestHuman rightsEuropeMiddle East and north AfricaAyatollah Ali KhameneinewsShareReuse this content"

Their lawyer, David Aïoutz, said his client would be present at the state prosecutor’s office then.The official and former official have not been named.Documents from the prosecutor’s office seen by Reuters describe both individuals as “defendants” in the case and indicated that past and present town hall officials could be held responsible for safety failings at Le Constellation bar.The bar’s French owners, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, who face formal charges of negligent manslaughter, negligent bodily harm and negligent arson, were until now the only suspects under criminal investigation in the tragedy.The fire also injured 116 people, most of them teenagers. The dead include 21 Swiss nationals, nine French citizens, six Italians, and citizens of Belgium, Portugal, Romania and Turkey; the average age was 19.Authorities believe the blazestarted in the basement party room of the crowded bar after sparklers attached to champagne bottles were held too close to the ceiling, which was clad with soundproofing foam that caught fire.Questions have been raised about the presence and accessibility of fire extinguishers in the basement, and whether the exits – including a reportedly narrow single staircase up to the bar – complied with regulations.Jacques Moretti was held in preventive custody for nearly two weeks before being released on bail of SFr200,000 (£189,000) on 23 January. The couple were due to be questioned again separately on 11 and 12 February, the documents said.There was outrage earlier this monthwhen the town’s mayor, Nicolas Féraud, admittedcouncil safety officers had not carried out the obligatory annual safety check of Le Constellation since 2019.The investigation aims to shed light on the exact circumstances of the fire and the extent to which health and safety regulations had been observed, and to establish potential criminal responsibility on the part of the owners, staff and authorities.Officials for the municipality and the prosecutors’ office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Prosecutors rejected the council’s request to become a party to the case, which would have given it the same status as the victims.“There are … reasons to believe that the municipality failed in its duty to enforce the various regulations for which it was responsible [and that are] intended to safeguard the lives and physical integrity of the bar’s customers,” one document said. “Failings could be attributable both to staff members and to members of the town council, past and present.”The Morettis have expressed their “indescribable grief” and promised to cooperate fully with the investigation.The fire was one of the worst disasters in modern Swiss history and the biggest blow to its reputation since the 2023 collapse of Credit Suisse bank, said Alexandre Edelmann of PresenceSwitzerland, which promotes the country’s image abroad.Explore more on these topicsCrans-Montana fireSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In April, UK fighters shot down an unspecified number of Iranian drones, but the RAF role in October was negligible.Typhoon jets would only expect to help in protecting Qatar or other Gulf states from drones and cruise missiles. Ballistic missiles fly too fast to be intercepted by jets, however, and can only be targeted by specialist air defence systems, such as US Patriot or Thaad systems.The al-Udeid airbase in Qatar is the largest US military facility in the Middle East. Home to about 10,000 US troops, it is also the US Central Command’s headquarters. Earlier this month it hosted about 100 UK RAF personnel, though most of these were evacuated during a previous escalation of tensions.US air force F-15 fighter jets have been redeployed from Lakenheath in Suffolk to the Muwaffaq Salti airbase in Jordan. Experts said their role was not likely to be in attacking Iran, but to defend against any possible retaliation against Jordan, Israel or Gulf states.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMilitaryIranQatarMiddle East and north AfricaRoyal Air ForcenewsShareReuse this content"

Many of them would like to come back to the UK,” he said, citing taxation and crime as reasons Britons were choosing to live abroad.“I’ve spoken to loads of people like that,” he said, adding that the trip was unlikely to result in any donation announcements.Among the other attenders were the former Conservative chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, who defected to Reform this month, along with his wife, Lana, as well as senior members of GB News such as its owner, Paul Marshall, and local businesspeople and financiers.Farage, who said he was in Dubai primarily for “sunshine” and to support GB News, gave a short speech in which he praised the news network. “They all laughed at us,” he said, harking back to remarks he made in the European parliament after the Brexit result. “They’re not laughing now, are they?”Farage held two invitation-only events on Tuesday, including a private lunch opposite the Jumeirah Burj Al Arab hotel, which Bloomberg reported wasbacked by the Indian billionaire Sunny Varkey.Varkey, a Dubai resident, is worth $4bn, according to Forbes magazine, and owns the schools operator GEMS Education.Farage declined to comment on whether Varkey, whom he called a “nice chap”, had suggested donating toReform UK, saying: “Even if he had, I wouldn’t discuss it.”In December, Reform received the largest donation ever made to a UK party, when the expatriated crypto investor Christopher Harbornegave £9m.GB News, whose financial backers include the Dubai-based investment companyLegatum, paid Farage more than £200,000 last year,according to parliamentary records. The MP hosts a show for the channel four times a week.Farage said the UK “has a lot to learn” from the UAE, which he praised for its low crime rate, entrepreneurship, “sensible” taxes and forbanning the Muslim Brotherhood, which the UK government has resisted proscribing.“These are all the things that we’re going to do in the United Kingdom,” he said. “We’re going to win the next election.

No formal direct talks have been held between the two countries for a decade.Araghchi’s visit on Friday comes against the backdrop of urgent international diplomacy and increasingly aggressive threats from both sides. Senior defence and intelligence officials from Israel and Saudi Arabia were also in Washington for talks on Iran this week, Axios reported on Thursday.The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, said at a cabinet meeting on Thursday that his department would be able to deliver on any military instructions given by Trump. “They [Iran] have all the options to make a deal,” he said. “They should not pursue nuclear capabilities. And we will be prepared to deliver whatever this president expects.”View image in fullscreenAbbas Araghchi’s visit on Friday comes against the backdrop of urgent international diplomacy.Photograph: Vahid Salemi/APThreat of US-Iran war escalates as Trump warns time running out for dealRead moreTrumphas warned Iran that time is running out, vowing that any US attack would be violent and far more extensive than the US intervention in Venezuela.Speaking on Thursday night at the Kennedy Center, Trump struck a more concillatory tone, saying he was planning to talk to Iran.“We have a lot of very big, very powerful ships sailing to Iran right now, and it would be great if we didn’t have to use them.”Iran has remained defiant, with army chief Maj Gen Amir Hatami announcing that sincethe 12-day war in June, Iran has revised tactics and built 1,000 sea and land-based drones. He said the drones and Iran’s extensive ballistic missile arsenal could provide a crushing response to any attack. Iran’s greatest military weakness is its air defences.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said on Wednesday that about 30,000 US military personnel were “within the reach of an array of thousands of Iranian one-way UAVs and Iranian short-range ballistic missiles”.A senior Iranian official told Reuters that Iran was “preparing itself for a military confrontation, while at the same time making use of diplomatic channels”.The Kremlin urged both sides to recognise there was still time for diplomacy, butTurkeyappears to have taken up the mantle of the main mediator, as an increasingly apprehensive Middle East eyes a looming conflict that could easily spread across the region.Inside Iran, those voices that have called for authorities to make concessions are being drowned out in an increasingly polarised society, in which one section is demanding the leadership stand up to America, and another is intent on provoking the regime’s collapse.In an attempt to bind a wounded society back together, Pezeshkian has acknowledged the anger over the suppression of the protests by saying a full list of those killed in the ensuing government crackdown will be published in conjunction with grieving families. But such is the current level of distrust inside Iran, and the power of the security services, that it is doubtful Pezeshkian will be able to convince Iranians or international observers thatthe death toll was not in the tens of thousands.9:33Is Trump about to attack Iran? - The LatestMostafa Tajzadeh, one of the most prominent political prisoners held in Evin jail, described the official death toll as “a disgraceful lie” and called for an independent fact-finding inquiry into what he described as an unprecedented massacre.Trump has not clearly stated his objectives, claiming that he would attack Iran to defend protesters, but then this week linking his threats to the country’s nuclear programme. The US leader appears to be using the possibility of strikes on Iran’s missile sites as well as groups such as the Revolutionary Guards to imply that he intends to trigger the collapse of the regime, or at least the resignation of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He claimed to have obliterated Iran’s nuclear programme during the 12-day war in June, although US intelligence agencies later gaveconflicting assessments of the campaign’s impact.Addressing Congress on Wednesday, Rubio was cautious regarding the prospect of a change in government. “You’re talking about a regime that’s been in place for a very long time,” he said. “So that’s going to require a lot of careful thinking, if that eventuality ever presents itself.”Iran’s former prime minister Mir Hossein Mousavi called for the regime to stand aside, saying: “Enough is enough. The game is over.” He called for a constitutional referendum, based on the three principles of “non-interference from abroad, rejection of domestic tyranny, and peaceful democratic transition.”Erdoğan spoke with Trump on Monday in what was billed as an attempt to locate common ground between Iran and the US before any deadline for strikes.View image in fullscreenTrump has said that he would attack Iran to defend protesters, but then linked his threats to the country’s nuclear programme.Photograph: José Luis Magaña/APIn a brief post on social media, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said Araghchi would travel to Turkey on Friday for an official visit. “The Islamic Republic of Iran is determined to steadily strengthen relations with its neighbours based on the policy of good neighbourliness and shared interests,” he said.US administration officials have insisted that Iran fully understood Washington’s specific demands concerning the handover of its highly enriched uranium stockpile to a third party, an end to domestic uranium enrichment, limits on its missile programme and an end to support for proxy groups. All four of these demands will be hard for Iran to accept.What does the US want from Iran? Tracking one month of Trump’s changing demandsRead moreSpeaking to Al Jazeera, Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said: “It is wrong to attack Iran. It is wrong to start the war again. Iran is ready to negotiate in the nuclear file.”He admitted Iran faced challenges at the bargaining table, saying: “It might seem humiliating for them. It will be very difficult to explain not only to themselves but to the leadership. So if we can make things better tolerated I think it will help.”Fidan argued Iran also had to present a new face to the Middle East, saying he had been “very frank” with the Iranians that they “need to create trust in the region [and] they need to pay attention how they are perceived by the regional countries”.Fidan met the US ambassador to Ankara and special representative for Syria, Tom Barrack, on Thursday.In an attempt to protect themselves from Iranian reprisals, most Gulf states have said they will not allow their airspace or territory to be used to attack Iran.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaTurkeyIran's nuclear programmeDonald TrumpRecep Tayyip ErdoğanTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Politically the crisis is especially deep for the reformists as they have held the presidency for 18 months and initially described the protests as legitimate.Mohammad Fazeli, a reformist sociologist, wrote on his Telegram channel: “Iran’s history will be entangled with this event for decades, buried under the rubble of this catastrophe.“But in these days, beyond the grief for those thousands killed and wounded, a deep sorrow has gripped my entire being. I have no doubt that dozens of others like me have sunk into this same grief and bewilderment. The grief and misery of ‘We failed’.”Criticism of the security services, or their claim that only 3,000 people were killed, is starting to appear. Many commentators attribute the protests to a loss of hope and the now 50-year generation gap between many protesters and Iran’s ageing leadership.Ahmad Zeidabadi, a reformist journalist and former political prisoner, argued: “Only a professional report from the UN’s independent jurists can serve as the final arbiter of the contradictory narratives about this national tragedy. Rejecting such a request on the part of the Islamic Republic would be a historic mistake.”The head of the Reform Front, Azar Mansouri, also implied the truth had not yet been revealed, promising: “We will not allow the blood of these dear ones to be forgotten or the truth to be lost in the dust.”Fatemeh Mohajerani, the chief government spokesperson, at a press briefing on Tuesday referred to the need for two inquiries into specific episodes during the protests. In the past, the security services have rejected all such investigations.Iran’s vice-president, Mohammad Reza Aref, has also demanded explanations from the ministry of culture as to why the reformist newspaper Ham-Mihan was shut after it published two articles covering the bloody outcome of the protests.Those calling for a free press claim Iran is being squeezed between unwatchable state propaganda television and anti-government UK-based satellite channels.The University of Tehran student association in a statement said it was “stunned and bewildered as to what has befallen us”, and said the perpetrators should not be allowed to escape the burden of responsibility.Few senior figures have yet called on the Iranian leadership to offer the key diplomatic concessions the US requires on the nuclear file. Dr Javad Salehi, a US-based Iranian economist, pointed out in the Iranian press the direct link between Iran’s global isolation and its economic backwardness.He said: “The only effective measure in the short term to improve the country’s economic situation is to resolve hostilities in the field of foreign policy.”Faizullah Arabsorkhi, a former commerce minister and political prisoner, said foreign policy was at the root of the lack of economic growth. “The authorities must change policies and change the way they deal with the world. The Chinese themselves advise Iran to solve your problems with America.”For those inside Iran contemplating another foreign attack, the question is whether a second assault – either direct or through a blockade – will lead to the kind of nationalist revival that occurred last summer.The government would doubtless try to engineer it, and there are many Iranians who liken their current sense of lost sovereignty to 1941, when the country was occupied by Russia and the UK.Many of them cannot stomach the hypocrisy of the US condemning Iran’s failure to manage its economy when US sanctions are the bedrock of that failure.But there is also deep disillusionment at the failure of the government to take the chance to set a new course after the 12-day war last June.The recent calls in the street for the return of the shah may have been an act of desperation but they were also a sign that some now feel the source of their salvation lies abroad.Sanctions are not a humane alternative to bombs. They are economic warfare with civilians as collateral damage | Kenneth MohammedRead moreAbolfazl Ghadyani, the 80-year-old jailed political activist, called the suppression of the protests a crime against humanity, saying: “Ali Khamenei’s personal instruction was to put the rioters in their place.”The order revealed “his endless hostile vindictiveness and the desire for revenge against the Iranian people. The scale of the crime was unprecedented in 100 years.”He added: “Khamenei is like a drowning man who resorts to any means, but salvation is impossible for him. These moral vices that are his essence will no longer serve him.”From the perspective of the security services such criticism affirms the need to keep the internet suppressed. But in a sign of the tensions over the issue, government members made clear the security services were to blame for the internet shutdown.Explore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiProtestMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It involved 100,000 women in Sweden who were part of mammography screening and were randomly assigned to either AI-supported screening or to a standard reading by two radiologists between April 2021 and December 2022.The AI system worked by analysing the mammograms and assigning low-risk cases to a single reading and high-risk cases to a double one by radiologists, as well as highlighting suspicious findings to support radiologists.Mammography screening supported by AI reduced cancer diagnoses in the years after a breast screening appointment by 12%, according to the research, published in The Lancet. There were 1.55 cancers per 1,000 women in the AI-supported group compared with 1.76 cancers per 1,000 women in the control group.More than four in five cancer cases (81%) in the AI-supported mammography group were detected at the screening stage, compared with just under three quarters (74%) in the control group, and there were also almost a third (27%) fewer aggressive sub-type cancers in the AI group compared with the control.Dr Kristina Lång, from Lund University in Sweden and the lead author of the study, said that AI-supported mammography could help detect cancers at an early stage, but that there were caveats.“Widely rolling out AI-supported mammography in breast cancer screening programmes could help reduce workload pressures among radiologists, as well as helping to detect more cancers at an early stage, including those with aggressive subtypes,” Lång said.“However, introducing AI in healthcare must be done cautiously, using tested AI tools and with continuous monitoring in place to ensure we have good data on how AI influences different regional and national screening programmes and how that might vary over time.”Breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women aged 35 to 50, with more than 2 million people globally diagnosed with the disease each year.Although the study showed the apparent benefits AI could bring to mammography screening, the researchers do not support replacing healthcare professionals with AI, as screening still requires at least one human radiologist to perform the reading with AI support.Dr Sowmiya Moorthie, a senior strategic evidence manager atCancerResearch UK, said the findings were promising but urged caution.“Using AI to assist in reading mammograms can be more efficient, but there’s a concern that it can lead to missing some cancers. This study helps to address concerns, but the results are from a single centre, so more research will be needed to know for sure if this will help save lives,” Moorthie said.She added: “With a growing number of people expected to be diagnosed with cancer in the years ahead, innovations like this will be vital to improving the NHS, but it’s important that they are properly evaluated to ensure people affected by cancer are helped rather than harmed.”Simon Vincent, the chief scientific officer at Breast Cancer Now, said: “This first trial underlines the huge potential of AI to support radiologists in breast cancer screening. Screening is a vital tool for early detection, and the sooner the disease is found, the better chance of successful treatment.“This study shows real promise for earlier diagnosis that could improve and save lives, which is why trials launched last year in the UK exploring the use of AI within the NHS breast screening system will be important in determining the safest and most effective way to use these tools to find more cancers early.”Explore more on these topicsCancer researchAI (artificial intelligence)Breast cancerMedical researchCancerHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

While this matter is looked into, I feel it is my noble duty not to allow my chains of office to be put through a process.”Tamworth council described Harris as a “rogue landlord” and said he – as well as the management agent Touchstone – had ignored repeated warnings about the “dangerous conditions” at the properties.The council found the properties had no heating or access to hot water, no working fire alarms, inadequate cooking facilities and unsafe access to outdoor areas.“The six-bedroom properties, which housed multiple tenants, failed to meet even the most basic of living standards and legal requirements,” Tamworth said.View image in fullscreenHarris says he takes ‘full responsibility’ for the condition of the homes.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThe news will be embarrassing for Reform UK as its candidate in the Gorton and Denton byelection in Greater Manchester, Matt Goodwin, declared tackling HMOs would be one of his priorities. Lee Anderson MP, the party’s chief whip, has previously raised concerns to the government about the “sharp increase in the number of HMOs, many of which are poorly managed”.The Reform leader of the council, George Finch, acknowledged the resignation and thanked Harris for his service as chair. “It would be inappropriate to comment on the details while the proper process is ongoing, and I would urge others not to speculate,” he said.A 75-year-old, who did not want to be named, who lives on the same street as Harris’s HMOs, said both properties had “gradually fell into disrepair” and Harris “just simply refused to do anything about them”.“What we hadn’t realised was quite what the state of the houses inside was and the pitiful state that residents were [in],” she said.View image in fullscreenThe council issued emergency prohibition notices on the properties.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianAnother resident, 73, said she had spoken to someone living at the one of the properties who said that they had not had hot water for two years. “I said: ‘Well, how do you manage?’ He said: ‘We boil kettles and there’s an electric shower.’”She described her surprise to discover the landlord was a Reform party chair atWarwickshirecouncil. “Somebody like that is of high standing,” she said. “We asked him to sort out the problem, he totally ignored us.”Ben Clarke at Tamworth council said the state of the properties left the local authority with “no choice but to act” and issue two emergency prohibition notices.The residents had been offered support and advice, the council said, adding that it was considering further enforcement action in relation to the properties owned by Harris.Touchstone has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsWarwickshireReform UKStaffordshireRenting propertyHousingEnglandLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

Symptoms include severe pain in the abdomen, nausea and fever, with patients often ending up in hospital.While acknowledging that pancreatitis is rare, on Thursday the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) updated itsguidance, after an increase in reports of acute pancreatitis to the agency’syellow card scheme, which monitors any adverse reactions to medications and medical devices in the UK.To date, there have been 1,143 reports of acute and chronic pancreatitis to the yellow card scheme among patients taking semaglutide or tirzepatide, with 17 reported fatalities. Nearly all (973) were logged in 2025, of which 807 concerned tirzepatide and 166 were related to semaglutide. To date, there have been 146 reports of acute and chronic pancreatitis from those taking liraglutide and 61 from those taking dulaglutide.Dr Alison Cave, the MHRA’s chief safety officer, said: “Patient safety is the MHRA’s top priority and we continually monitor the safety and efficacy of all licensed medicines. For the vast majority of patients who are prescribed GLP-1s, they are safe and effective medicines, which deliver significant health benefits.“The risk of developing these severe side effects is very small, but it is important that patients and healthcare professionals are aware and alert to the associated symptoms.“If you, or someone you care for, is taking GLP-1s and you notice symptoms such as severe, persistent stomach pain that may radiate to the back and may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting, then we advise you speak to a healthcare professional and report it via our yellow card scheme.”Separately, the MHRA said that patients taking GLP-1s had been recruited to theYellow Card Biobankstudy, a collaboration between the MHRA andGenomics England, which will investigate whether the risk of an inflamed pancreas can be influenced by an individual’s genes. The agency said: “It is hoped this will help to predict which patients may be most at risk of adverse reactions and prescribe the safest medicines accordingly.”Responding to the announcement, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, which makes Wegovy and Ozempic, said: “Patient safety is of the utmost importance to Novo Nordisk. We recommend that patients take these medications only for their approved indications and under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional, who can also advise on potential side effects.“We continuously collect safety data on our marketed GLP-1 medicines and work closely with the authorities to ensure patient safety.”Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Mounjaro, said: “Patient safety is Lilly’s top priority. We take reports regarding patient safety seriously and actively monitor, evaluate, and report safety information for all our medicines.“The Mounjaro (tirzepatide) patient information leaflet warns that inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis) is an uncommon side-effect (which may affect up to 1 in 100 people) and advises patients to talk to their doctor or other healthcare professional before using Mounjaro if they have ever had pancreatitis. We continue to work with the MHRA to ensure that appropriate safety information is available to prescribers.“We encourage patients to consult their doctor or other healthcare professional regarding any side-effects they may be experiencing and to ensure that they are getting genuine Lilly medicine.”Explore more on these topicsWeight-loss drugsHealthDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

The warrant sought all ballots from the 2020 election in the county, tabulator tapes, ballot images and voter rolls, according to a warrant obtained by the Guardian.FBI executes search warrant at election office in Fulton county, GeorgiaRead more“My constituents inGeorgia– and I think much of the American public – are quite reasonably alarmed and asking questions, after the director of national intelligence was spotted bizarrely and personally lurking in an FBI evidence truck in Fulton county, Georgia, yesterday,” said the senator Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat. “I encourage all of us on a bipartisan basis to pursue the facts as quickly as possible to understand whether the office of the director of national intelligence is straying far outside of its lane.”In a statement released on Wednesday, the senator Mark Warner, of Virginia, described Gabbard, a former representative and army veteran known for adhering to widely debunked conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, as “totally unqualified” to be one of the nation’s spymasters, citing her presence in Georgia during “a federal raid tied to Donald Trump’s obsession with losing the 2020 election” as evidence.Gabbard only had two reasons to be there, Warner said: either she “believes there was a legitimate foreign intelligence nexus – in which case she is in clear violation of her obligation under the law to keep the intelligence committees ‘fully and currently informed’ of relevant national security concerns – or she is once again demonstrating her utter lack of fitness for office that she holds by injecting the nonpartisan intelligence community she is supposed to be leading into a domestic political stunt designed to legitimize conspiracy theories that undermine our democracy”.View image in fullscreenTulsi Gabbard arrives as the FBI conducts a ‘court-ordered search warrant’ in Union City, Georgia, on 28 January.Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPAAn unnamed senior administration officialtoldCNN today that foreign threats to election integrity justified her presence, saying: “Director Gabbard has a pivotal role in election security and protecting the integrity of our elections against interference, including operations targeting voting systems, databases, & election infrastructure. She has & will continue to take action on President Trump’s directive to secure our elections & work with our interagency partners to do so.”Gabbard has not personally explained her reasons for being at the warrant operation at a warehouse in Georgia. But she isreportedly compiling researchreexamining the 2020 election on behalf of the White House and Trump, an activity that would normally be outside the scope of her office.Gabbard’s staff told news reporters at the Fulton county elections offices that she would make a statement on Wednesday evening, but never did. Photographers captured her at the site amid the moving trucks for boxes of five-year-old documents.The seizure has roiled Democratic lawmakers in Georgia, who are calling for an explanation.“The 2020 election has been litigated,” said the representative Nikema Williams of Atlanta in aletterto the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, sent on Wednesday. “By continuing to raid election locations in Georgia, the Department of Justice (DOJ), this raid serves to intimidate Fulton county voters and election officials, rather than to further any legitimate law enforcement aim.”Representative Joaquin Castro, a Democrat from California on the House permanent select committee on intelligence, called for an explanation in an interview on Thursday with CNN.“It’s extremely unusual that the DNI [director of national intelligence] would be present for this type of domestic operation, and it’s something that the intelligence committee should investigate right away, should exercise its oversight power and bring Tulsi Gabbard in to the committee to explain exactly what happened,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGeorgiaTrump administrationFBIUS politicsElection interferencenewsShareReuse this content"

The department ultimately used the funding from the foundation to hire the Lede Company, an agency that has represented celebrities such as Rihanna and Reese Witherspoon, and determined the scope of the work.“This is exactly how we always operate: fast, responsive, and in service to the department’s needs,” the foundation said in aletterto its donors.The LAFD Foundation, established in 2010, gives “vital equipment and funds critical programs” for the department and since 2018 has provided more than $25m to the agency. It is independently audited each year, the foundation said in the letter to donors, and has received the high ratings from charity evaluators. Donors can identify contributions for specific programs or projects, the foundation wrote.“We are transparent because our supporters and Angelenos deserve nothing less – and because we are proud of the work you support.”TheLos Angelesfire department said in a statement that at the time of the department’s “engagement” with the company, it did not have anyone serving in the role of public information director.“Due to the high volume of media requests, the department sought assistance from a communications firm to manage the workload,” Stephanie Bishop, the department’s public information director, told the Guardian.The LAFD chief, Jaime Moore, who was appointed in November, told the Los Angeles Times that he was unsure of the Lede Company’s scope of work for the department, but that he believed they were acting as a PR director, and assumed “they had something to do with” a controversial after-action report evaluating the department’s response to the 7 January wildfires.‘It feels endless’: despite misplaced fanfare about a model home, LA struggles to rebuildRead moreThe report issued in the aftermath of the fire was edited to understate the shortcomings of agency leadership and the city, according to theTimes.The latest development is likely to fuel further scrutiny of the department and the city, and its handling of the Palisades fire and the aftermath. Karen Bass and other officials have received fierce criticism from some fire survivors who argued leaders failed to do enough to prevent the blaze. Spencer Pratt, the former reality TV star who lost his home in the Palisades fire and has been a frequent critic of the city’s response, recentlyannounced his plansto run for mayor.The LAFD Foundation and the Lede Company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesCalifornia wildfiresCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

I did it because being a mayor has always been my dream job.“[But] we are on the front lines of a very important battle, and it’s important that we aren’t silenced. This is not a time to bend our heads in despair or out of fear that we may be next, because if we do not speak up, if we do not step out, it will be your city that is next.”Frey has been outspoken for weeks against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement [ICE] deployment. Shortly after thekilling of another local resident, Renee Nicole Good, by an agent on 7 January hetold the agencyto “get the fuck out of Minneapolis”.He said the city had hitherto been safe and and a scene of falling crime figures, but it had become less safe as “chaos reigns supreme” because of the Trump administration’s deployment, tagged “Operation Metro Surge”.“It is less safe when families do not feel comfortable going to school or buying food at the grocery store because they’re worried that their very family might get ripped apart,” he said. “It is less safe when we have roving bands of agents marching down the street just looking for somebody who might be concerned. I got to tell you, everybody is concerned when you have that kind of occupation.”Apart from the deaths of Pretti and Good, the ICE operations have resulted in the detention of several school children, including a five-year-old boy, Liam Ramos, who was sent to a facility in Texas along with his father. There have been several high profile clashes with residents who are US citizens, including one episode when a woman was violently pulled from her car after a verbal altercation, when she told agents she was trying to reach a doctor’s appointment.Frey accused agents of targeting individuals on the basis that they might be of Somalian, Latino or Asian origin and said the goal was less about immigration than silencing opinions and narratives that differed from the administration’s.He was applauded when he accused the White House of a following a “might is right” philosophy, singling out Miller, Trump’s influential deputy chief of staff, who is seen as the aggressive architect of the anti-immigration crusade.“Stephen Miller has pushed for this concept, calling it the iron law of the world that might makes right,” said Frey. “Stephen Miller is wrong. Time and again, America has rejected this notion that might makes right.”In a rallying call directed at fellow mayors, he said: “We do not back down to bullies. We stand up for democracy.”Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisMinnesotaMinnesota ICE shootingsTrump administrationUS politicsWashington DCnewsShareReuse this content"

Microsoft had less to show for its billions spentThu 29 Jan 2026 14.11 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 14.29 ESTShareBig tech earnings so far this week have sent a clear warning: investors are willing to overlook soaring spending onartificial intelligenceif it fuels strong growth, but are quick to punish companies that fall short.The contrast was clear in Thursday’s stock market reaction to earnings fromMicrosoftandMeta, highlighting how dramatically the stakes have changed since the launch ofChatGPTstarted theAIboom more than three years ago.Shares of theInstagramparent surged more than 9% on strong sales, while those of Microsoft slumped 10% after its cloud business failed to impress.“The market appears to be questioning whether these massive capital expenditure hikes will generate sufficient returns,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. “This reflects a growing divide between tech companies’ AI ambitions and Wall Street’s patience for open-ended investment cycles.”After riding its first-mover advantage with OpenAI to become the world’s most valuable firm in 2024,Microsoftis now under growing investor pressure to justify its soaring capital outlay.Microsoft reported revenue growth in its Azure cloud-computing business that was only slightly above expectations.In contrast, AI bolstered ad targeting at Meta, boosting revenue by 24% in the December quarter and aiding a rosy first-quarter forecast. The results show that theFacebookowner’s gains from AI were helping fund its capital spending, which is expected to jump as much as 87% to $135bn this year.“Meta’s headline numbers are a really interesting reflection of the market’s attitude toward spending in the AI space,” said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.“All else equal, the market would typically be concerned, but they have a big revenue guide for the first quarter.”Microsoft also faced pressure after a disclosure that OpenAI, its prized holding, accounts for 45% of its cloud backlog. Investors are worried that some $280bn could be at risk as the unprofitable startup loses momentum in the AI race.The ChatGPT creator had issued an internal “code red” in December after Google’s Gemini 3 launched to positive reviews and is playing catch-up in AI coding to Anthropic’s Claude Code, which has hit an annualized run rate of more than $1bn.“Microsoft’s deep ties to OpenAI underpin its leadership in enterprise AI, but they also introduce concentration risk,” said Zavier Wong, market analyst at eToro.Microsoft predicted Azure growth to stay stable in the period from January to March at 37% to 38%, after slowing in the last three months of 2025, partly due to AI chip capacity constraints.“If I had taken the graphics processing units that just came online in the first quarter and second quarter, and allocated them all to Azure, the KPI [growth] would have been over 40%,” Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said on a post-earnings call.She added that the use of chips for internal development efforts had limited the growth.For Meta, the revenue growth underscored that its AI pivot was paying off and helping the company catch up to early leaders.Its revenue rose 24% in the fourth quarter, and Meta forecast growth to accelerate as much as 33% in the current quarter.The company is racking up bills at large cloud providers, such as Alphabet’s Google, which bodes well for the search giant’s results next week. Alphabet shares rose 1.6%.Using AI “will both improve the quality of the organic experience and of advertising”, Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said.“I think that will have a compounding effect,” he added, as Meta predicted a jump of 43% in total expenses this year to $169bn.Growing spending was also the theme at Elon Musk’s Tesla, which will double outlay this year to more than $20bn as it pivots to AI, humanoid robots and personal vehicles that can drive themselves.The company also reported quarterly profit and revenue that were above expectations, though its yearly profit and revenue had declined for the first time ever. Shares rose by 2.9%.Analysts said the results left some mismatch between corporate AI goals and investors’ demand for payoffs.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyMicrosoftMetaFacebookInstagramQuarterly resultsAI (artificial intelligence)analysisShareReuse this content"

It has risen by more than a quarter this month and hit a new high of just under $5,595 (£4,060) an ounce on Thursday.It dropped sharply later in the day to $5,250 (£3,810) as speculation swirled about possible US action in Iran, but that remains almost double the price as when Donald Trump’s second term in the White House began a year ago.Silver, meanwhile, was trading below $30 (£22) an ounce when the president prepared to announce his “liberation day” tariffs last April, but has since almost quadrupled in price, to more than $118 (£86) an ounce, with the most rapid run-up coming in the past month.Giuseppe Sersale, a strategist at Italy’s Anthilia, said the market had “all the hallmarks of a mania”, describing recent price moves as “parabolic”.So what’s driving the rush?Goldhas always been the ultimate “safe haven”asset, acting as a store of value in the face of inflation risks or broader economic and geopolitical uncertainty, all of which Trump has provided in spades.The administration’s aggressive policies – including punitive tariffs on trading partners, threats to annex or bomb other countries such as Greenland and Iran and increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to make it cut interest rates, includinglaunching a criminal caseagainst the central bank’s chair, Jerome Powell – have sent investors scurrying for the precious metal.Trump resumed his onslaught on Powell after the Fed’slatest decision to hold rates on Wednesday, posting on social media: “Even this moron admits that inflation is no longer a problem.” However, analysts warn tampering with the Fed’s independencerisks further stoking price rises.Daniela Hathorn, a senior market analyst at Capital.com, summed the situation up: “Gold and silver are reflecting more than short-term market stress; they are signalling a re-pricing of trust. Trust in currencies, in institutions, and in the stability of the post-cold war economic order.”The idea here is that even if US inflation were to get out of control, undermining the value of the dollar (an idea known as “debasement”), gold would hold its value. However, the same argument applies to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which have not been subject to the same buying spree as precious metals.What else is going on?As the World Gold Council (WGC) pointed out in its quarterly data release this week, another driver has beencentral banks adding to their reserves. This trend appears to represent a modest diversification away from the standard reserve asset of treasuries, as US government bonds are known, as Trump’s chaotic approach raises anxiety about the idea of holding billions of dollars in IOUs from Washington.However, WGC’s analysis also showed that while “central bank buying remained a prominent and additive factor” to global demand, such purchases were actually 21% lower in 2025 than a year earlier, at 863 tonnes.Instead, as in many booms and bubbles, a significant part of the recent uptick appears to represent retail investors – either buying into the “safe haven” trade amid catastrophic headlines or just seeing the price spike and piling in.Louise Street, a senior market analyst at WGC, said that last year “consumers and investors alike bought and held gold in an environment where economic and geopolitical risks have become the new normal”, adding: “Investment demand stole the show as investors raced to access gold through all available routes.”In the UK, the Royal Mint website urges retail consumers to “take the first step towards fortifying your financial future with the timeless allure of gold”.The silver price appears to have been caught up in the same speculative frenzy as gold in recent weeks – perhaps because its lower price makes it more approachable as an asset class.What about the dollar?Concerns about Fed independence and the broader stability of US policymaking are not just fuelling precious metals, but also seem to have been putting downward pressure on the dollar, whichhas been on the slide in the past week or so.The euro broke through $1.20 (£0.90) on Tuesday before falling back modestly, while £1 was worth $1.38 on Thursday, up almost five cents in a fortnight. As Eszter Gárgyán of UniCredit put it in a research note: “The dollar has come under renewed depreciation pressure since mid-January, as geopolitical risks, rising trade tensions and concerns regarding Fed independence have resurfaced.”The Trump administration has sometimes seemed conflicted about whether it wants to see a weaker dollar – to aid the president’s endeavour of narrowing the trade deficit – or a stronger currency, as a symbol of economic power. The greenback fell to a four-year low against a basket of other currencies on Wednesday, after the president shrugged off the currency’s weakness, saying: “No, I think it’s great.”But his Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, asked later about rumours there could be coordinated central bank action to prop up the wobbling Japanese yen, insisted: “We don’t comment, other than to say we have a strong dollar policy.”Rapid market moves in Japan, with government bond yields up sharply as investors bet on a spending splurge after theupcoming snap election, are complicating the picture.If investors are cooling on the US, why haven’t share prices tanked?Far from tanking,US stocks have performed strongly over the past 12 months, driven disproportionately by the “magnificent seven” tech companies, whose revenues have been soaring on the back of the AI boom. Including dividends, the S&P 500 was up 17.9% in 2025.While many analysts, and a fair few tech bosses, fret that current elevated share pricesmay be a bubble, investors appear to believe that, as Chuck Prince, then chief executive of ill-fated bank Citigroup put it back in 2007, “as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance”.And they are likely to have been buoyed up by hopes of fresh interest rate cuts in the coming months, if US inflation remains under control.Similarly, unlike a year ago when there was a brief sell-off in treasuries, the “sell America” narrative does not seem to have extended to bond markets – yet.Explore more on these topicsGoldInvestingSilverCommoditiesCurrenciesStock marketsDonald TrumpexplainersShareReuse this content"

For the UK, it means capital, orders, and growth momentum; for China, it means stable expectations, mutually beneficial cooperation, and strategic leverage over Europe.“Both sides understand that security and other issues will not disappear, but neither intends for them to dominate the agenda.”The account noted that the UK was showing a level of independence from the lead of Donald Trump’s White House. It said: “What is certain is that London has begun to recalculate its relationship with China, and this calculation is not entirely based on Washington’s approach.”Yin Zhiguang, a professor of international politics at the school of international relations and public affairs at Fudan University, was reported as commenting: “This diplomatic adjustment by Britain was forced by reality, both to hedge against the external risks brought by the Trump administration and to resolve the internal predicament of a sluggish domestic economy and weak governance.”A former editor-in-chief of the state-owned outlet Global Times, Hu Xijin, also suggested the UK’s outreach was not a result of Chinese lobbying but a reaction to Trump’s recent behaviour on the global stage.Research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaKeir StarmerForeign policyXi JinpingTrade policyGlobal economyEconomicsShareReuse this content"

A long, spacious walkway, it connects the east and west points of the vastAustralian Openvenue, allowing competitors to move unaccosted between the courts, player areas and media facilities. Right in the middle of the corridor, a large pair of automatic doors open up to the various private player areas.Those same doors also lead straight to the entrance of Rod Laver Arena. On Tuesday, in the immediate aftermath of her excruciating6-1, 6-2 loss to Elina Svitolina, Coco Gauff removed a racket from her bag, exited the double doors into the vacant corridor and up a ramp that she believed was hidden by a wall. She then proceeded toobliterate her racket on the concrete floor. Two days later, the force of that racket smash continues to reverberate around the tour.Gauff’s release of frustration was actually an act of self-control. Although she desperately needed to vent after such a poor performance, the American waited until she left the court and deliberately chose to shatter her racket in the corridor precisely because she thought no one but a few tournament staff members walking past would witness her frustration. She did not grasp just how widespread cameras are around the grounds. Within minutes broadcasters had picked up the footage and spread it ceaselessly across the internet.I saw online people were zooming in on players’ phones and stuff like that. It’s so unnecessary, an invasion of privacyJessica PegulaAn hour later, Gauff sighed as she addressed her now-public racket smash: “I tried to go somewhere where they wouldn’t broadcast it, but obviously they did,” she said. “So yeah, maybe some conversations can be had, because I feel like at this tournament the only private place we have is the locker room.”While tennis players tend to disagree on basic issues, Gauff’s colleagues have been unanimous in their concurrence. Novak Djokovic is already resigned to the belief that cameras will only become more invasive over time. “I’m surprised that we have no cameras while we are taking a shower. I mean, that’s probably the next step. I’m against it,” he said.Jessica Pegula, meanwhile, conveyed the unpleasantness of being constantly followed by cameras: “You’re just kind of going about your day. To feel like someone is constantly filming you, I saw online people were zooming in on players’ phones and stuff like that. That’s so unnecessary. I just think it’s really an invasion of privacy.”Even as she seethed after a frustratingdefeat by Elena Rybakina, Iga Swiatek still managed to express her disapproval: “The question is, are we tennis players or are we animals in the zoo where they are observed even when they poop?”It is difficult to overstate how widespread the cameras are in the private player areas and media buildings at the Australian Open. They are present in countless corridors, the gyms, match-call area, transport hub and even the media centre. A livestream is broadcast on the tournament’s YouTube channel each day, which devotes hours to showing players navigating these areas in real time.View image in fullscreenCoco Gauff takes out her frustrations on her racket after a disappointing defeat to Elina Svitolina in Melbourne.Photograph: TNT SportsIn a world where popular influencers hold daily streaming marathons and content is king, there is obvious logic to the Big Brotherfication of tennis. Swiatek herself was a subject of one of the semi-viral moments of the tournament after she was denied entry to a restricted area for not having her accreditation.Tennis fans are interested to know what life looks like for players before they enter the court and these videos do show different sides to the elite. The cameras show players interacting with teams, working through warm-up routines and playfully greeting other players. They are also an asset to the athletes’ public images. Without footage of his interactions with team members, fans might not grasp how playful Jannik Sinner can be with those around him, considering how reserved he can be in public.To some, players’ huge earnings justify a few cameras following them, as does the growing phenomenon of players attempting to create their own content and employing videographers in restricted areas.However, there are many instances where their privacy is breached. Pegula’s comments referenced an incident earlier in the tournament where Carlos Alcaraz was absent-mindedly scrolling his phone without realising that the camera behind him had a clear view of his screen. Fans zoomed in, took screenshots of his phone and drew their own conclusions.The responses from some of the governing bodies have been interesting. The Women’s Tennis Association issued a forceful statement in support of its players, saying: “Players deserve spaces away from competition where they can recover in private.”Craig Tiley, Tennis Australia’s chief executive, opted for a conciliatory tone. “We want to listen to the players, we want to really understand what their needs and what their wants are,” he told Tennis Channel. “So, that’s the first question we’ll ask: ‘We’ve heard you and whatever adjustments [we] need to make we will make.’”Perhaps it could have asked some questions before the cameras were installed. The grand slam tournaments so often act unilaterally, imposing their conditions on players rather than consulting them. Regardless of how much they earn, the players deserve to have a say in their working conditions, particularly on a serious issue such as privacy. While they perform for the public on the court, it is completely reasonable for players to argue that not every aspect of their lives should be up for public consumption.Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Coco GauffAustralian OpenTennisUS sportsAustralia sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

Elite golfers, who were already obscenely rich, take the bounty on offer from a Saudi Arabian-backed disruption model before shuffling back whence they came – essentially for a trivial penalty – when the novelty wears off. This is hardly sport at its purest. Instead, an admission byBrooks Koepkaand Patrick Reed that they blundered in believing the fairways were greener on the LIV side. The PGA Tour, desperate to portray itself as the big boy in the playground, welcomes one-time pariahs back with open arms. Other golfers who spurned LIV’s fluttering eyelashes scratch their heads, wondering why they bothered.There is, however, an underlying and endearing point. All the petroleum pounds in the world are no substitute for legacy. Trying to match the achievements of Arnold Palmer, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy carries significance. LIV golf has no relevance beyond its own domain. Saudi Arabia has made inroads into various sports but, in golf, the kingdom is unquestionably doomed. LIV is on the road towards oblivion, far earlier than most had anticipated. Only those who will gain financially from its continuation can try to spin an alternative story.Patrick Reed quits rebel LIV Golf tour in latest blow to Saudi-backed breakawayRead moreExecutives at thePGA Tour, who feared for their business when LIV blasted on to the scene, are besides themselves with excitement. No wonder; for years they were berated about their approach to all things LIV. Koepka and Reed may be unlikely revolutionaries but have now lit the touchpaper on LIV’s demise. This circuit, which observers reckon might have burned through $6bn (£4.35bn) since its establishment in 2022, will fail with its objective of seriously rivalling the PGA or DP World Tours.Scott O’Neil, the LIV chief executive, is very fond of telling those under his watch that the tour is not all about the money. Perhaps O’Neil works for free. In fact, LIV is notevenabout the money, as Koepka and Reed have demonstrated. Astonishingly (not really) a team contest between the RangeGoats and the HyFlyers carries no broader relevance whatsoever. Sportspeople like money; the sensible of them like status much more.The most intriguing element now is how and when Saudi Arabia backs out of its LIV experiment. There has to be an element of face saving, just as there must be realism. How do they accept defeat gracefully? Any exit strategy will come from people who hate the notion of their money being wasted or that they have not been taken seriously enough. For Yasir al-Rumayyan, the head of the Saudi Public Investment Fund, LIV has been an intensely personal project from the outset. At Newcastle there is Champions League football. Cristiano Ronaldo continues to bring eyeballs to the Saudi Pro League. Boxing and Formula One operate at the top level in the kingdom.Golfis the one sporting entity Saudi Arabia will ultimately not crack. This is a blow to Rumayyan’s reputation.The Saudis could offer Bryson DeChambeau $500m, $600m or $700m to remain as the poster boy of this tour, just as a degenerate gambler would chase losses in vain. It is not in the interests of DeChambeau – or Jon Rahm, or Cameron Smith – to remain in a world which is so lacking in competitive depth. LIV signed these golfers as major champions. Before this season, they picked up Thomas Detry, Victor Perez, Elvis Smylie and Michael La Sasso. LIV could rumble on in the background as a third-rate operation but that would seem to contradict everything the Saudis want to stand for. Why bother subsidising low-grade golf professionals? A more salient move would be trying to formalise a long-rumoured alliance with the DP World Tour, thereby retaining at least some foothold in the sport. Yet with the PGA Tour underwriting prize pots in Europe, the DP World Tour will be careful as to whose tune it chooses to dance.View image in fullscreenBrooks Koepka is another player to abandon LIV and return to the PGA Tour.Photograph: Seth Wenig/APThe prospect of Saudi Arabia abruptly halting its LIV cashflow cannot be ruled out. Wider market forces are relevant. The Financial Times reported in recent days that Saudi Arabia has scaled back its flagship, futuristic Neom project amid spiralling costs and delays. “We need to reprioritise,” said an official. One wonders how that squares with bestowing $10m on the Cleeks for finishing top of the pile at LIV Virginia. Golf insiders struggle to apportion an asset value to LIV, given its astronomical rate of cash outflow.None of this is to decry completely what LIV has done. The PGA Tour – previously complacent and comfortable – needed the shake-up created by competition. It would be wrong to suggest LIV events are vastly inferior to those on other tours. For ageing golfers – Lee Westwood, Henrik Stenson and Ian Poulter among them – this was the ultimate payday. LIV brought Anthony Kim back from years in the wilderness. It has also provided a decent playing platform for those who simply do not enjoy PGA Tour life.The party is coming to an end, abruptly or otherwise. It is one that will be defined by prodigality. In golf, it is not merely jargon to suggest following in the footsteps of giants is important.Explore more on these topicsLIV Golf SeriesPGA TourBrooks KoepkaEuropean TourSaudi Arabia and sportGolfUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The sources spoke to the Guardian under condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the league’s plans, which also include downscaling English-language offerings and sending some behind-the-scenes production to the UK.Executives atMLSand Apple alike placed special emphasis on their Spanish-language broadcast plans when Season Pass debuted in 2023, suggesting the league would put those broadcasts on even footing with their English-language counterparts. Initially that held true, with the league sending a Spanish-language broadcast team to every match. In 2026, with MLS matches now out from behind the Season Pass paywall on Apple TV+, that will no longer be the case.Multiple sources said this week that the league will employ about half as many two-man Spanish-language commentary teams, leaving the rest of the matches with a single play-by-play announcer. A source within the league office confirmed this news, telling the Guardian that MLS has plans to retain what it deems to be its seven best Spanish-language play-by-play and commentary pairings. A league source indicated that the pairings of Sammy Sadovnik and Diego Valeri; Ramses Sandoval and Miguel Gallardo; and Jorge Perez-Navarro and Marcelo Balboa will be among the pairings kept on.USMNT’s Alex Freeman reportedly sold to Villarreal by Orlando CityRead moreSources also said that the league will no longer produce a Spanish-language version of MLS 360, the whip-around style show which features live look-ins and commentary on multiple matches at once. The English-language version will remain unaffected. A league source indicated that viewership data for MLS 360 suggested that Spanish-language consumers simply prefer watching matches to in-studio programming.“The [viewership] numbers are different between English and Spanish,” said one source involved in the league’s Spanish-language broadcasts. “But it’s hard to read the plans as anything other than the league saying they value Spanish-speaking and Latino fans less than others.”MLS executive vice-president for media Seth Bacon pushed back against that characterization in a statement to the Guardian.“After careful consideration and in response to fan feedback, we are evolving our Spanish-language programming to better reflect how our audience engages with the game,” the statement reads. “Our Spanish-language coverage will focus on what fans value most in shoulder programming: high-energy, live broadcasts from the stadium that bring them closer to the action through pre- and post-game shows. As part of this evolution, we are enhancing our on-site Spanish-language presence on matchdays to deliver more authentic, engaging moments straight from our stadiums.”Season Pass’s English-language offerings will also be downsized. MLS Wrap-Up – an in-studio show airing at the end of each match night featuring analysts reviewing the day’s action – will no longer be produced in its previous state. A league source confirmed that a post-match night component will still exist, but viewers will no longer see in-studio talent on camera.View image in fullscreenLionel Messi and Inter Miami will look to repeat as MLS Cup champions in 2026.Photograph: Lynne Sladky/APHalf of live game productions move to LondonThe sources tell the Guardian that MLS is planning to produce about half of its matches overseas, employing IMG to do the work out of its studios in London, England.This type of arrangement is the latest in a series of major adjustments to MLS’s production process. After starting the service with all commentators on-site, several matches last year were produced and even called remotely, with talent narrating games off monitors from the Florida studios of Vista, a longtime MLS production partner. One of the league’s broadcast personalities relocated to Florida to call those matches, but has since been let go by MLS’s Apple offering. An MLS spokesperson clarified to the Guardian that the broadcaster, Lloyd Sam, will continue covering the league through its deal through their deal with Fox.A league source confirmed this week that MLS has adjusted its plans in that area, choosing to return to sending broadcast talent to every one of its matches, with some games produced across the Atlantic.“It feels like it might be an absolute disaster,” said one source who works on the production side of Season Pass – a sentiment shared by several others in similar positions, who pointed out that processes for live game production can differ significantly between the US and the rest of the world. “Imagine somebody in London communicating with talent in the US in completely different lingo. I don’t think it will end well.”Others were less concerned, with some sources going as far as to say that broadcasts may actually improve based on the level of talent employed by the British company, who are generally well-regarded and have a long history in broadcast sports.Bob Bradley, Wilfried Nancy and the uphill battle for MLS coaches in EuropeRead more“We are going to lean into the existing infrastructure that they have [at IMG],” Bacon told the Guardian. “All they’ll be doing is creating the clean feed – the announcers will be on site, the graphics will be created here [in the US]. The look and feel of it should be almost exactly the same as last year.”Bacon added that MLS is in the process of training production staff at IMG to mitigate any differences in the way matches are called and produced in the US and UK. As an example, he pointed out that cameras that are not tracking the ball during MLS games are often used for angles that can assist with VAR decisions. He said the aim is to keep the look and feel of broadcasts unchanged.Other changesSources said MLS is planning at least one significant expansion in its coverage: It will have pre-and-post-game crews on-site for Sunday Night Soccer, its featured match of the week. There will also be personnel changes for that broadcast: Jillian Sakovits and Antonella Gonzalez will now serve as the sideline reporters, with Andrew Wiebe moving to the same role on Saturday’s featured match, which the league is debuting this year and calling the Walmart Saturday Showdown.MLS’s original agreement with Apple ran through 2032 but late last year the league announced the relationship would be ending prematurely, in 2029. As part of that agreement, Apple agreed to pay $107.5m for the short season preceding the league’scalendar switch, then $275m for the 2027-28 and 2028-29 seasons,according to Sportico.MLS Commissioner Don Garber said that the league averaged about 120,000 viewers per match midway through 2025, with the league latertelling Sports Business Journalthat it had 3.7m “global aggregate viewers” over a full weekend slate of games.The adjustments to its broadcast budget come ahead of the 2026 World Cup, a pivotal moment for the league and soccer as a whole in North America. Garber has repeatedly referred to the tournament as the “jet fuel” which could spur additional growth in interest in MLS.A previous version of this story said that MLS had cut half of their Spanish-language broadcast talent and that several broadcasters had moved to Florida. It has been amended to state that the league has cut half of it’s Spanish-language two-commentator teams, or a quarter of overall talent, and that one broadcaster had moved to Florida.Explore more on these topicsMLSUS sportsApple TVTV streamingUS television industrynewsShareReuse this content"

We need to have this discussion.”Removing US as World Cup host would be eminently sad – and entirely justified | Alexander AbnosRead moreMeanwhile, Fifa’s disgraced former president Sepp Blatter, long the sport’s amoral center, now almost 90 years old and never one to pass up the opportunity to take a swing at his successor, further undermined this World Cup. On Monday, heendorsed commentsby a former Fifa anti-corruption lawyer –breaks fourth wall to glance directly into the camera with a smirk– to “avoid the United States!”The heads of about 20 European soccer federationsdiscussed the possibilityof a boycott. And between Donald Trump’s threats against Greenland, his administration’s actions in Venezuela, his various travel bans, and killings by federal agents during his immigration crackdown, clearly some kind of international rebuttal is called for. But whether soccer’s authorities are really in any position to do so is questionable. And the cost and ramifications of a potential boycott should be fully thought through.For one thing, it’s worth considering who will actually be punished. It’s doubtful that Trump cares enough about the World Cup to save it from a would-be boycott by backing down on the policies mentioned above. If there were no longer a margin in it for him, he’d likely do much the same ashe will with the upcoming Super Bowl: dismiss it, ignore it, and move on.The Trump administration, then, probably wouldn’t be materially hurt by aWorld Cupboycott. It may be embarrassed, but then is that even something it is capable of or cares about? The oligarch class that keeps Trump in power wouldn’t really be damaged either, as they have no significant stake in the thing – Fifa gets the lion’s share of the proceeds.Fifa would certainly be affected, but probably not as much as you’d expect. It will surely still make its broadcast income, and the sponsorship money, and it has already collected huge amounts of the ticket revenue it stands to make. It would be egg on the organization’s face, sure, but they also seem to have moved on from such quaint considerations some time ago.The influencer World Cup: Fifa and the TikTok deal targeting an avalanche of postsRead moreIn the end, the brunt would be borne by the boycotting teams and their fans, who don’t get to play in, or watch, a World Cup with their country in it. And, more directly, the many people who would work the tournament and benefit from the tourism it will generate. This may be a small price to pay in the grand scheme of things, but only if a boycott actually has any sort of effect.Which, well, let’s return for a moment to Göttlich and his deep cut to the Olympic boycotts, when the US and much of the west snubbed the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow over the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan. The USSR and much of the Eastern Bloc then counter-boycotted LA in 1984. Neither boycott accomplished very much at all, other than political posturing. The Soviets would not withdraw from Afghanistan until 1989. Yet two Olympics were pretty much spoiled. Lots of athletes lost their chance to compete, while others had their accomplishments affixed with a massive asterisk.To hold up the Olympic boycotts as some sort of paradigm for how withholding participation in a sporting event can be wielded as an effective political tool is ahistorical.There have hardly been any boycotts in the context of the World Cup. Defending champions Uruguay refused to go to Italy for the 1934 World Cup because so few European countries had showed up when it hosted the inaugural edition four years earlier. In 1938, Uruguay and Argentina sat out afteran incident involving Peruat the 1936 Berlin Olympics. African countries boycotted the 1966 World Cup in protest over their continent getting just one-third of a berth, to be shared with Asia and Oceania – successfully, as Africa got a full berth in 1970. And the USSR refused to play a qualifier against Chile for the 1974 World Cup after the overthrow of socialist president Salvador Allende.For some reason, the community that orbits the global game feels a ceaseless compunction for football to affect the wider world in a positive way. It’s a noble notion, a kind of immutable idealism that runs deep through a fundamentally cynical sport. The trouble is that in this case, there really isn’t much a hand to be played. An administration unconstrained by convention, aspirations of global leadership, or diplomatic politesse probably won’t be bothered about a bunch of countries staying away from a World Cup.All the better to show up and lodge your protest in person. Nobody will hear you if you’re not there to speak up.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May. You canpreorder it here.

But Wednesday’s game felt particularly poignantBranson Wrightat Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse, ClevelandThu 29 Jan 2026 10.56 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 16.41 ESTShareA 60-second tribute video honoringLeBron Jameshas become routine over the past eight years whenever he returns to Cleveland, the city where his NBA journey began.But Wednesday night at Rocket Arena was different – and it felt that way long before James’sLos Angeles Lakers fell 129-99to the Cavaliers in a nationally televised game.For the first time,James struggled to contain his emotions.As his name was announced during pregame introductions, the crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation that lingered longer than usual. Minutes later, during the game’s first break, the tribute video played on the jumbo screen hanging above the court. James remained seated on the Lakers’ bench, watching intently along with nearly 20,000 fans who understood they were witnessing something more than a routine return.The video featured a montage of historic moments from James’s Cavaliers career, highlighted by his unforgettable performance in Game 5 of the 2007 Eastern Conference Finals –when he scored 25 consecutive points, capped by a game-winning layup against the Detroit Pistons. It was the night that first cemented James not only as a superstar, but as Cleveland’s own.Several times Wednesday night, James lowered his head and wiped away tears with the inside of his jersey. He later reached for a paper towel, dabbing his eyes before the game resumed.“The moment they put up [the tribute video], the Detroit game, looking up in the rafters and I saw our championship banner [from Cleveland’s 2016 NBA title] … it was a lot of reflection,” James said after the game. “Being present in the moment. It got to me a little bit for sure. I was super thankful.”On Wednesday, James finished with 11 points, five assists and six turnovers – his worst performance in his return games – but the stat line was secondary to the night’s emotion.Now in his 23rd NBA season since he was drafted No 1 overall by the Cavaliers in 2003, James’s Hall of Fame résumé includes being the league’sall-time leading scorer, four championships with three different teams, countless playoff moments and nearly every significant individual milestone the league has to offer. Yet as the finish line slowly comes into view, whenever that may be, moments like Wednesday carry deeper meaning. This may have been the final time James played an NBA game in the city where it all began.Welcome to Duncanville: why the road to the NBA runs through DallasRead more“Because it could be [my last season]. I haven’t made a decision on the future, but it very well could be [my final game in Cleveland],” James said. “No matter if it’s here or in Washington playing in our next game, or in the Barclays on this road trip. Obviously, it means more here for me personally because I grew up 35 miles south of here.”What made the night feel different wasn’t the tribute itself – the Cavaliers have done this many times before – but the collective awareness inside the building. This didn’t feel like a reunion tour stop. It felt like a pause. A moment when a city and its greatest athlete quietly acknowledged, without saying it out loud, that there may not be many of these nights left.The ovation lingered. Fans stayed on their feet. Some recorded on their phones. Others simply watched. Cleveland no longer demanded anything from James. The city was offering gratitude.The emotions extended well beyond the court. The night was even more meaningful because James was able to share it withhis son and teammate, Bronny, along with several family members watching from a suite.“It was pretty cool just sitting over there and watching [Bronny] continue to live out his dream,” James said. “My mom was here watching her son and her grandson. I don’t even know how to wrap that all into one in my brain. It’s so weird and so cool and so surreal.”Bronny, who scored eight points in the loss, felt the weight of the moment himself. As in his game at Rocket Arena last season, the crowd erupted when he entered the game and cheered loudly after his fourth-quarter dunk. It was a symbolic passing of time inside the same building where his father once ruled the league.“Very nostalgic to be here,” Bronny said. “I was here pretty much every day as a kid, so it feels good to be out here. I was almost emotional myself. Being home is another feeling. It’s crazy to come back and have so much love. It got him. It almost got me.”James’s mother, Gloria James, was also reflective. She has been present for nearly every step of her son’s career, from his earliest NBA games to the moment he lifted Cleveland’s first championship banner in 2016.“I don’t get as emotional as I used to, but I did a little,” Gloria James told the Guardian. “I’ve been there from day one, every single game he’s played in the NBA. Thinking about all of those years and being here tonight – it’s memorable and awesome.”For those who know James best, the emotion wasn’t surprising.Chris Dennis, once a James family adviser, said the reaction inside the arena reflected how intertwined James’s story is with Cleveland’s identity.“They were hyped when LeBron came back into the game after the video, because the fans are a part of who he is,” said Dennis, who is managing partner of Tribute Sports. “A lot of those fans grew up watching LeBron. When you grow up with a dude that represented your city, you’re going to show that love.”Dennis said the moment hit harder because James understands, even if he hasn’t said so publicly, that time is no longer on his side.“I’m not basing this on anything I’ve heard,” Dennis said. “But he knows he’s toward the end of his career. It’s harder for him to prepare for games. It’s not easy for a 41-year-old to get ready and play at this level every night.”Planning for the end is new to James, whose career for most of its duration centered on what he would accomplish next. Now, the question lingers quietly in the background: what comes after?Several paths remain. James, who spoke before the game about mapping out offseason golf plans, could retire. He could re-sign with the Lakers. Or, in a storybook ending, he could return once more to Cleveland.Only James knows which direction he will choose.“The question gets asked more, and the thought creeps into my mind more at 41 years old,” James said. “Of when the end is and where the finish line is when it comes to hanging this thing up. I’m in a battle with Father Time, and I’m taking it personally – seeing how many times I can be victorious over him. But I won’t be one of those guys who won’t be able to walk off the court. That’s for sure.”On Wednesday night, near the Lakers’ locker room after the game, James gathered with family members, including his mother, surrounded by love, memories, and reflection – not knowing if it would be the last time in this arena.Time will tell.Explore more on these topicsLeBron JamesCleveland CavaliersLos Angeles LakersBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Martin O’Neill can focus on the most important factor in that he has guided the Scottish champions into the Europa league’s playoff phase. Job done, once again, for the effervescent O’Neill. Ferencvaros or Stuttgart lie in wait after Celtic closed in 21st place.Celtic were fully deserving of their win in what unexpectedly developed into an entertaining clash with Utrecht. O’Neill, thought to be a managerial yesterday’s man not so long ago, continues to do his bit for 70-somethings everywhere. The Irishman will know Celtic must improve to make meaningful, further progress in this competition but such detail can wait. Even continuation in theEuropa Leaguehad looked a long shot at one point. Utrecht will be delighted to see the back of a tournament which yielded just a single point from eight grisly fixtures.Europa League: goals and action from all 18 games in league phase finale – liveRead more“I think over the past couple of weeks we have shown great resilience,” said O’Neill. “I am delighted with the result. The performance, for the most part, was terrific.”This occasion marked more than two decades since O’Neill last managed Celtic in a home European game. Milan were the visitors for a scoreless draw then, in a period when Celtic jousted with the best on the continent. The intervening years have not been particularly kind to Celtic in European context but in O’Neill they have a manager who relishes foreign forays. Far from seeing progression to the knockout stage as a distraction from a domestic title race, he will relish the challenge.Here began what has scope to be a hugely significant few days for Celtic. Victories overUtrechtand Falkirk, coupled with making headway in the transfer market, would raise confidence among supporters who have been unconvinced by much of the campaign so far. The good news to begin with was that Utrecht, already eliminated from this competition and treading water in their domestic league, looked hugely favourable opposition.That notion was proven to be correct rather quickly. It remains to be seen whether Benjamin Nygren will emerge as a strong Celtic player but the midfielder does have a useful knack of scoring goals. He converted a rare, right-foot cross from Kieran Tierney to send Celtic in front. Utrecht decided it was wise to leave Nygren in splendid isolation, six yards from their goal as Celtic completed a short corner routine.View image in fullscreenArne Engels scores Celtic’s third goal from the penalty spot after just 19 minutes.Photograph: Russell Cheyne/ReutersThe second for Celtic was even more disastrous from the visitors. The goalkeeper Vasilis Barkas – once and forgettably of this parish – played the ball directly to the feet of the onrushing Daizen Maeda. In his rush to clear Maeda’s ball across goal, the Utrecht captain Nick Viergever sent the ball into his own net.Any sense Utrecht’s evening could not get any worse, and rapidly, was wrong. The referee, Mohammad Al-Emara, was sent to the monitor to assess a potential handball by Dani de Wit at a Tierney cross. The Finn harshly determined De Wit was guilty, affording Celtic a penalty which Arne Engels cracked home. Celtic have not enjoyed many blissfully straightforward fixtures in this campaign, so were entitled to revel in this one. Utrecht’s supporters, realising the ludicrous nature of their team’s display, took to cheering when three passes were strung together.Some further relief did arrive for those fans before the break. De Wit curled beyond the motionless Kasper Schmeichel from 20 yards to reduce the deficit. It was a smart finish, not at all in keeping with anything the Dutch side had offered until that point.Celtic’s second half challenge was to reduce this to a non-event. As Adrian Blake flashed the ball across the front of Schmeichel’s goal after three minutes of the restart, a warning had been served.It was Blake’s next intervention which triggered panic in the stands. A low shot from 25 yards should not have caused Schmeichel a particular problem yet the Dane was unable to even palm it away. His shortcomings have been an ominous feature of Celtic’s recent history. O’Neill later admitted his team were “flagging”.Celtic now needed breathing space. It arrived via an unlikely source, Auston Trusty heading an Engels corner high into the Utrecht net. It is a funny old game; on Sunday, Trusty’s red card at Tynecastle helped Hearts to win a point against Celtic. Now, O’Neill had cause to be hugely grateful to his centre-back.Trusty’s header extinguished Utrecht’s hope. Amid a raft of substitutions, the game fizzled out in a manner which suited Celtic just fine. O’Neill does not expect to be in office beyond May. If a Celtic upturn in fortunes under his watch continues, it will become reasonable to ask why that should be the case.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueCelticUtrechtmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Finally, after 17 of the 18 final day matches had finished, came a chaotic denouement. Not even José Mourinho’s longChampions Leagueheritage had included a moment like this, though his wild celebration was familiar.Benficawere beating Real Madrid 3-2, and Mourinho’s former club were already dropping out of the top eight. “I was told [the scoreline] is enough, so let’s close the door,” said Mourinho.That wasn’t all though:Benficaneeded another goal to save themselves, and their keeper, Anatoliy Trubin, was sent up for a corner with seconds of the match remaining. His headed goal from Fredrik Aursnes’s cross was a bullet, and the Estádio da Luz fell into raptures as Benfica grabbed a place in the knockout phase at the death. The eight-round, 36-team group stage had its moment of drama to breathe life into a format many have criticised. The best had been saved for last. Mourinho had also beaten Madrid for the first time in his career.Football as a content machine: 18 Champions League games was fun but overstuffed | Max RushdenRead moreWithin English football, there is not much triumphalism thatfive of the top eight– those who skip what has become known as the “punishment round” – are from the Premier League. Each ofArsenal, with their perfect record of eight wins from eight,Liverpool,Tottenham,ChelseaandManchester Cityare just glad to avoid an extra two matches, respite from the relentless schedule of what has been a bruising domestic season.Most eye-catching for English teams wasChelsea’s win at Napoli, with João Pedro scoring twice as Antonio Conte’s team eventually ran out of steam. It was a significant victory in Liam Rosenior’s early days as head coach.Newcastlemay have made it into the top eight had Harvey Barnes converted a late chance against Paris Saint-Germain, but his team had to settle for a 1-1 draw, which means they enter the knockout round. “The Premier League is such a strong league it can only make you better,” said the Newcastle manager, Eddie Howe. Had they not conceded in the last moments to Kairat’s Ricardinho, Arsenal would have become the first team in competition history to win eight matches in succession by a two-goal margin, hence Piero Hincapié’s rage at the visitors’ consolation goal,which made it 3-2.Edging outReal Madrid, PSG and Inter in the top eight wereSporting Lisbon, who finished seventh. They followed up last week’s defeat of holders PSG with another piece of late Portuguese drama. Alisson Santos’s 94th minute winner was enough for a 3-2 win over Athletic Club who, alongside Villarreal, were one of two La Liga clubs to exit at the group stage. Sporting’s coach, Rui Borges, has made many forget about Ruben Amorim after last season’s title – and now they are holding their own among the European elite. “They don’t care about the time; they want to play, they want to fight for the game, and they want to be the best,” Borges said proudly of his team.Surprise finishers in the top 24:Olympiakos,Club Brugge– for the second season running – andQarabag, who squeezed through,despite a 6-0 loss to Liverpool. Qarabag forward Abdellah Zoubir said: “I’m French, so I’d love to play Paris in the next round, even if they’re the best team in the world right now.”As was the case last season, the champions face two playoff matches, though perhaps that can help add a competitive edge away from Ligue 1. Sneaking through in 23rd place, with a truly seismic victory at Atlético Madrid, were last week’s darlings,Bodø/Glimt. The Norwegian season does not kick off until March.View image in fullscreenBodø/Glimt players after beating Atlético.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APPlayer of the weekTrubin delivered that golden moment, but Benfica’s star on the night wasAndreas Schjelderup. The 21-year-old Norwegian scored twice, and has been linked with a move to Brugge, among others. “I should have scored four goals today,” he said, which said something about Real Madrid’s defending.They said itFor Madrid,Kylian Mbappépulled few punches after the match. “It hurts to be in the playoffs. We need to fix our issues; we are too inconsistent. We deserve to be in the position we’re in,” said the Frenchman. Álvaro Arbeloa’s regime has not got off to a strong start, and discipline is a clear problem. During those manic last few moments in Lisbon came red cards for both Raúl Asencio and Rodrygo, the latter for dissent.View image in fullscreenA frustrated Kylian Mbappé during Madrid’s 4-2 defeat in Lisbon.Photograph: Patrícia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty ImagesThe pundit’s chairIs something afoot at Liverpool? For the second week in succession,Steven Gerrard, hardly known for his Roy Keane-style invective, put the boot into Arne Slot. On TNT in the UK, Gerrard criticisedSlot’s commentsthat losing to PSG last season helped Liverpool win the Premier League. “They were 15 points clear [when they lost to PSG in the Champions League],” said Gerrard. “In my opinion they had the league wrapped up by that point. The frustration and the emotion of going out of the UCL, for a player or a fan, it hurts. It kills you. To sort of say that went and helped you when you are already 15 points clear, you can understand the frustrations.”Looking aheadFriday’s draw will decide who plays whom in the knockout phase playoff, with teams knowing from their league position they will end up on one of two paths. For example, there is a 50/50 chance of Benfica and Real Madrid being drawn together. If not, Real will play Bodø/Glimt, and Benfica face Inter, another former Mourinho employer.Jamie Carragher, speaking on CBS’s broadcast, ahead of celebrating his birthday with dancing lessons, had this to say about the bracket as it opens out: “I’ve just seen Liverpool’s potential opponents. Honest to God, this new format, I’ve had enough of it. We finished top last year and we got Paris Saint-Germain. We finished third this year, listen to this; Atlético Madrid, Club Brugge, Galatasaray or Juventus and we finished third. If you finish third you can’t get them, you can’t have Atlético Madrid in there!”Arsenal’s reward for their dominance of the group stage is playing one of Atalanta, Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Dortmund or Olympiakos in the last 16.

Authorities said he was arrested without incident in Miami’s Design District and booked into the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center late Wednesday night.View image in fullscreenGervonta Davis was booked at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center on Wednesday night.Photograph: Miami-Dade County CorrectionsAccording to police, the warrant stemmed from an alleged confrontation on 27 October at a strip club in Miami Gardens, where a woman who had previously been in a relationship with Davis was working as a VIP cocktail server. Investigators allege that Davis confronted the woman inside the club, forcibly took her into a back room and assaulted her before restraining her and escorting her outside.A police report states that Davis allegedly grabbed the woman by her hair and throat while making a threatening remark, then led her to a parking area before releasing her. The woman later sought help from coworkers and contacted police. Officers documented visible injuries, including bruising to her arm, according to authorities.The woman told investigators she first met Davis in 2022 and that the two were involved in an intimate relationship for several months in 2025. She said the relationship ended roughly a month before the alleged incident and that she had cut off communication with him.In addition to filing a police report, the woman initiated a civil lawsuit against Davis, alleging multiple counts including battery, false imprisonment and kidnapping. One of her attorneys said earlier this month that the findings of the police investigation mirrored the claims raised in the civil complaint.View image in fullscreenGervonta Davis looks on at an NBA game between the Bucks and Heat at Miami’s Kaseya Center in October.Photograph: Carmen Mandato/Getty Images“The investigation resulted in a judge signing off on an arrest warrant,” the attorney said in January. “That determination aligns with the allegations set out in the lawsuit.”Court filings indicate that attorneys representing the woman told a judge they made repeated attempts to serve Davis with the civil complaint but were unable to locate him in the weeks following its filing.Why doesn’t boxing care about gender-based violence? | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreAt a news conference announcing the warrant on 14 January, Miami Gardens police characterized the case as a domestic violence incident and said detectives were actively working with federal authorities to locate Davis. Police declined to provide additional details Wednesday night, citing the ongoing legal process.Davis, 31, had been training in Miami last fall for a high-profile bout with influencer Jake Paul scheduled for November at Kaseya Center. He was removed from the card shortly after the lawsuit became public andlater replaced by Britain’s Anthony Joshua. His most recent appearance in the ring came in March, when he retained his World Boxing Association lightweight championship following ahighly controversial draw with Lamont Roach Jrin Brooklyn.But WBA president Gilberto Mendoza announced the sanctioning bodyhad stripped Davis of the titleover the weekend, citing both the pending legal case and the fighter’s inactivity. Davis has defended the title just twice in the past three years, most recently against Roach more than 10 months ago, and does not currently have a fight scheduled.The arrest adds to a lengthy list of legal issues that have followed Davis throughout his career. He has faced multiple domestic violence-related allegations in Florida and elsewhere, several of which were later dropped. In 2023, Davis wassentenced in Maryland to three years of probationand a period of house arrest following a hit-and-run conviction in Baltimore.It remains unclear whether the new charges in Florida could affect Davis’s probationary status in Maryland or the timeline of any future bouts. Jail and court records did not immediately indicate when he is expected to make his first court appearance in Miami-Dade County.Miami Gardens police said the investigation remains active and declined to comment further.Explore more on these topicsGervonta DavisBoxingMiamiDomestic violenceShareReuse this content"

James McAtee, one of those afforded a chance to impress, completed the scoring from the penalty spot to condemn Robbie Keane’s team to a 4-0 defeat.The last time Forest won three successive home games in a European competition, in 1979, it culminated in them lifting their first European Cup under Brian Clough. While there is a long way to go this time, these are the kind of nights that foster hope of at least reaching the showpiece in Istanbul in May.A week is a long time in this game. Seven days after being booed off by the majority of the Forest supporterswho travelled to Braga, they blew away Ferencvaros, ending the Hungarian side’s unbeaten record in this competition and also their hopes of a top-eight berth.The galling thing for Forest is had they claimed victory in northern Portugal then owing to their margin of victory here and results elsewhere, Dyche’s side would have automatically advanced to the round of 16 themselves. Then again, that way supporters would not have another European adventure to tick off next month, Friday’s draw in Switzerland determining their opponents.“We want to play at a level that shows our intention in theEuropa League, one that hopefully gets you excited about the next round, too,” was Dyche’s mission statement in his programme notes and half an hour after kick-off, those words felt akin to something of a premonition.Forest could feasibly have led by three or four goals but had to make do with a two-goal advantage at the interval, with the homegrown captain, Ryan Yates, one of five changes fromSunday’s victoryat Brentford, influential in both.View image in fullscreenJames McAtee slots home Nottingham Forest’s fourth goal from the penalty spot.Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPAIt was Yates’s first-time cross that the Ferencvaros defender Bence Otvos put past his own goalkeeper and four minutes later Yates seized on a heavy touch by winger Cadu and Igor Jesus moseyed forward unchallenged. The Brazil striker ran at the visiting captain, Ibrahim Cissé, who inadvertently diverted the Forest forward’s shot into the far corner via the faintest of deflections.Forest added a third soon after Nicolás Domínguez’s header struck the base of a post. Ibrahim Sangaré flipped a pass over the top of the visitors’ back line and Ferencvaros allowed it to bounce on the edge of their 18-yard box. Igor Jesus was alert and, after pouncing on the loose ball, he dispatched a first-time effort into the corner.Ferencvaros offered only glimpses of quality, Bamidele Yusuf’s bullet header against the bar a case in point but that did not stop Dyche introducing Morgan Gibbs-White, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ola Aina midway through the second half. Gibbs-White, who saw his penalty saved in Braga, allowed McAtee to seal the win from 12 yards and keep the confidence flowing. “We think we can go all the way,” Yates said.This was hardly a showing to enhance Keane’s CV but, as he pointed out afterwards, there was always going to be a gulf between the teams. “The difference is £650m-worth of players on the field,” Keane said. “I’m disappointed but, overall, I think we’re realistic.”The former Republic of Ireland striker, who went on trial at Forest as a teenager, has established a fine reputation coaching overseas, at Maccabi Tel Aviv, where he won the domestic double, and more recently in Budapest. Keane’s assistant, Stephen Glass, played with Dyche at Watford, while their analyst, Phil Hudson, spent 11 years on the staff at Middlesbrough.If it feels like it could be a case of fate on Friday, the same goes for Keane, who could be reunited with Celtic and Martin O’Neill in the playoff round; Keane played on loan at Celtic in 2010 and under O’Neill for Ireland. Ferencvaros, second best here from the moment Kristoffer Zachariassen’s sixth-minute header cannoned off the inside of a post, will face either Celtic or Ludogorets in the next round.“Maybe it is written in the stars, myself against Martin,” Keane said. “He has given a lot of energy to the club and the players since coming back. It was a club that was very, very down. Regardless of who we play, it will be two tough games.”Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueNottingham ForestFerencvarosmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I don’t know if he will be available for Sunday.”Salzburg doubled their lead four minutes after the break when Kerim Alajbegovic jinked to the byline and crossed for Moussa Yeo to score at the near post with a classy flick.Rogers cut the deficit with a neat finish at the near-post after combining smartly with Emi Buendía. Mings then atoned for his earlier error, heading Villa level from Matty Cash’s cross before Jimoh-Aloba had the final say, ensuring his side finished second in the 36-team table.View image in fullscreenDjeidi Gassama looped a header into the corner of the net to give Rangers the lead but they lost 3-1 to Porto.Photograph: Luis Vieira/APRangers’ poor campaign ended with a comprehensive defeat atPorto, who secured a place in the last 16 with a 3-1 win.Danny Röhl’s side were ahead after six minutes, Djeidi Gassama looping a header into the opposite corner of the net from a right-wing cross by Findlay Curtis.ButPortowere level in the 27th minute through Rodrigo Mora, who finished a move he had started by firing past Jack Butland from close range.

However, he has also committed to appearing on The Rest is Football podcast, which will be presented by Gary Lineker in New York.Leon Goretzka says Donald Trump ‘makes us feel not only German but European’Read moreDuring Euro 2024 the then BBC trio of Lineker, Richards and Alan Shearer recorded episodes of The Rest is Football together in Berlin, but the BBC’s decision to stay at home and Lineker’s split from the corporation last year have created issues in terms of filming together during the World Cup.In another complication, The Rest is Football is expected to be shot to higher production standards this summer owing to a distribution deal with Netflix, which will be making the podcast available on its platforms after a £14m deal agreed last month.Netflix’s deal with Lineker’s production company, Goalhanger, is understood to include a commitment to produce more than 40 Rest is Football video podcasts during the World Cup, which the streaming platform will want to feature as many big-name guests as possible.Lineker will be in Netflix’s New York studio throughout, with other pundits to join him when they are available. The BBC has told its pundits that it is happy for them to do other media work during the World Cup and many are expected to do so, but it will not subsidise the cost. As a result Richards’s travel costs will have to be met by Netflix or Goalhanger.Shearer will be in the US throughout the tournament on co-commentary duties for the BBC, so there is more chance of him presenting The Rest is Football alongside Lineker in person.View image in fullscreenGary Lineker (left) and Alan Shearer will both be in the US this summer for the World Cup.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PAThe Match of the Day presenters Mark Chapman, Kelly Cates and Gabby Logan will be based in the Salford studio for the bulk of the World Cup, although one or more of them may travel to the US later in the tournament, particularly if England or Scotland reach the latter stages.The trio will also have podcasting duties during the World Cup as presenters of The Sports Agents, which is expected to record its programmes remotely.The BBC chose to base its World Cup coverage in the UK in part because the huge travel distances involved would affect its commitment to reduce its carbon footprint.The expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams, resulting in an increase from 64 to 104 matches, has also influenced its thinking. Despite this rise the BBC’s matches will be shown on its main channels rather than on iPlayer, with UK rights shared with ITV.The BBC and The Rest is Football declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsFootballBBCWorld Cup 2026PodcastingnewsShareReuse this content"

He was finally cleared of the allegations when the Crown Prosecution Service withdrew the charges in 2023, after his ex-partner stepped back from giving evidence at a retrial.The CPS said at the time: “We have determined there is no longer sufficient evidence available to proceed in respect of the controlling or coercive behaviour charge and that it is no longer in the public interest to prosecute the remaining assault charges.”Since the collapse of the case, there have been growing calls for the 52-year-old to be included among the prestigious list of the Premier League’s greatest players. Giggs made 963 appearances for United from 1991 to 2014, scoring 168 goals. He holds the record for most Premier League titles won by any player, at 13. In December, Giggs said the Hall of Fame was “not something that I really think about”. He told the Daily Mail: “If it happens, great. If it doesn’t, then I won’t lose sleep over it.”The Premier League is understood to have been in dialogue with Giggs’s agents since 2020 and conversations were last held before the most recent Hall of Fame induction ceremony in November.In a statement, not directly addressing the situation of any one player, the Premier League said: “The hall of fame shortlist is selected at the discretion of the Premier League in consultation with members of the Premier League awards panel. The final inductees each year are determined by the existing members of the hall of fame. The shortlist is reviewed on an annual basis with a number of factors taken into account including previous shortlist voting data, eras, player positions and achievements.

The winger’s career has nosedived since his departure from Manchester City three and a half years ago. Sterling washailed as a marquee signingwhen he joined Chelsea in the summer of 2022 but there was no place for him inside the tent by the time an agreement was finally reached to end his £325,000-a-week contract by mutual consent on Wednesday.The decline has been sad to watch. There was excitement when Sterling became the first player to joinChelseaafter the Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital takeover. He had won four Premier League titles with City and had undoubted pedigree. Thomas Tuchel wanted his threat in the final third and much was made of Sterling, who grew up near Wembley, returning to London when Chelsea signed him for £47.5m.Raheem Sterling leaves Chelsea by mutual consent and seeks fresh startRead moreYet the homecoming soon turned sour. There was the brutal dismissal of Tuchel at the start of the 2022-23 season. The ownership had overseen a wild first window. Boehly acted as interim sporting director and big contracts were handed out to ready-made talent. Soon there was a shift in transfer policy. Boehly’s influence waned and Behdad Eghbali, the co-owner of Clearlake, a US private equity firm, assumed greater control. The focus was on signing young talent on incentivised deals.It meant that Sterling’s face no longer fitted. He struggled for form and fitness after the appointment of Graham Potter as Tuchel’s replacement. There was surprise when Potter tried Sterling as a wing-back. Chelsea, short of stability, sacked Potter and finished 12th.There had been whispers that they were willing to sell Sterling. He enjoyed a brief resurgence after the appointment of Mauricio Pochettino in July 2023 but it was not sustainable. Sterling was in and out of the starting lineup. His 81st and final appearance for Chelsea came when he scored in a 2-1 win over Bournemouth at the end of the 2023-24 season.View image in fullscreenA loan spell at Arsenal did not produce the upturn in form that Raheem Sterling would have been hoping for.Photograph: John Walton/PAIt was Sterling’s 19th goal for Chelsea. It was an acceptable enough return but Chelsea wanted his wages off the books. Enzo Maresca replaced Pochettino, left Sterling out of the squad for his first match and made clear that the former Liverpool player was not part of his plans.The problem, though, was finding a suitable workaround. Sterling was thought to be reluctant to leave London for family reasons and his wages made it difficult for potential buyers. Anyone buying Sterling would be taking a risk. It looked as if he had lost a crucial yard of pace when he toiled during a loan at Arsenal last season.Sterling was not the same player without that burst. He was in limbo when he returned to Chelsea last summer. There was never any prospect of Maresca welcoming him back into the fold. However, it is questionable whether Chelsea’s approach was constructive. There is an argument that they could have maintained Sterling’s value by keeping him around the squad and using him as a rotation option. Instead, he continued to train on his own. It was a lonely, undignified existence for one of the most successful players in recent Premier League history. Plenty of people will hope that Sterling can find something that suits him now that he is a free agent.This is a player who used his position to become one of the leading voices in the fight against racism. Sterling was awarded an MBE in 2021 and he was one of the key figures in Gareth Southgate’s England revolution. Sterling helped England reach the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and scored three goals during their run tothe Euro 2020 final. However, even his international career ended unsatisfactorily. He has not added to his 82 caps since coming on as a late substitute during England’s quarter-final defeat by France at the 2022 World Cup.View image in fullscreenSterling’s last England appearance came during the defeat by France in the quarter-finals of the 2022 World Cup.Photograph: Tolga Bozoğlu/EPAThere is a sense that the miles on the clock have slowed Sterling. He made his debut for Liverpool in 2012. He is 31 and has not played this season. Clubs who have looked at him have not been convinced. Interest from Fulham and West Ham has not progressed. “Raheem is very strong, but he hasn’t played for a long time,” Giovanni Manna, Napoli’s sporting director, said on Wednesday. “We spoke to him over the summer, but I don’t see it as a good thing for now. He has significant financial expectations.”Sterling’s departure is said to represent a sizeable financial saving for Chelsea. His contract, which had 18 months left, has not been paid up in full. It was time for a clean break. Sterling is too young to retire. He is probably done at the highest level but there will be managers who will back themselves to revive him.Sterling has not ruled out leaving London. He is open to moving abroad. Whatever comes next, though, will have to be right for his family. Sterling has had to deal with two burglaries at his home since joining Chelsea. His son, Thiago, is in Arsenal’s academy.Ultimately, this is a story without any winners. Chelsea’s investment backfired. Sterling made money but spent too long on the sidelines. Now he needs to make up for lost time. He will hope it is not too late.Explore more on these topicsRaheem SterlingChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

And the obvious truth is that if you put enough football matches on at the same time, odds are something interesting will happen. Thirty-six teams in an eight-game league means the as-it-stands table will change a lot. Make it 128 teams playing four games, and see how the permutations algorithm deals with that.Is it a surprise that Chelsea were up to eighth and down to 12th and back up to sixthas goals went in in Naplesand elsewhere? Of course the rights holders have an obligation to tell you this is exciting – and to a certain degree it is.Perhaps it’s all worth it for Anatoliy Trubin – not a man I’ve spent a lot of time considering until today. It’s at least an eight out of 10 on the Jimmy Glass scale. The Uefa script writer would have happily acceptedJosé Mourinho’s goalkeeper scoring a flying headerin the eighth minute of five minutes of added time to beat nine-man Real Madrid and squeeze into the playoffs.In the list of best things that can happen in football, a goalkeeper lolloping into the opposition penalty area and scoring is right up there alongside fan in the crowd heading the ball back into play and an outfield player going in goal. There is something about the way a keeper moves before the free-kick: big long limbs, remarkably unmarkable because keepers don’t even really know where they’re meant to run.There’s been no team meeting to decide who picks them up. And it feels (and here’s some recency bias talking) as if the ball has some kind of magnetic attraction to the person in a different colour kit doing their own thing.It’s a moment to make you even feel joy for Mourinho. Hugging a ballboy like peak Everton Duncan Ferguson. “We knew that he could it … We know that the big guy is capable of this, it’s an amazing goal for the guy,” beamed José.View image in fullscreenBenfica’s head coach, José Mourinho, channels his inner Duncan Ferguson by embracing a ballboy.Photograph: Armando França/APIf you really want to feel it, find the Ukrainian commentary. “TRUBIIIIIIIIIIIN. AN-A-TOLIY-TRU *voice cracks* BIN …” And great casting from TNT to have Ally McCoist sitting on a little bar stool to bring the moment to life – although, I’d watch him watching anything; Gogglebox have missed a trick not getting him on an eight-year amortised contract.The evening had started terribly, Paris Saint-Germain winning a penalty after THEIR OWN PLAYER (Bradley Barcola) HANDBALLED IT ON TO the outstretched fingertips of Lewis Miley. On the list of organisations beginning with I that need abolishing, it is clearly a long way below ICE, and it’s hard to get too passionate about football while the world burns, but Ifab’s determination to single-handedly destroy the game through its interpretation of the handball law is almost reason enough to take to the streets.Between that and Trubin’s wonder moment, lots of exciting things. Viktor Gyökeres scored a nice one, someone absolutely belts one in for Pafos, Brugge have scored twice,Manchester CityandLiverpool see off any jeopardy. Copenhagen lead in Barcelona! Sporting turn it around early, Napoli take the lead. Benfica lead Real. Newcastle equalise! Half-time. Stare at a league table that is just too big for a legacy football fan’s eyes. Breathe, maybe lie down.Spurs score a goal. João Pedro, what a hit. Ah Jamal Musiala is fit again, oh Simon Mignolet is still playing, I hope Harry Kane finishes that imperiously at the World Cup. Bodø/Glimt! Probably the good news story of the group. We all know they’re good on 4G in -4C but winning at the Wanda, sensational. No time to think about it, Spurs score again. Marcus Rashford scores a free kick – he’s smiling; did the internet give him permission to do that? Harvey McBarnes skews it wide. Alisson Santos for Sporting – and finally Trubin with the cake, the icing and the cherry.View image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford looks pretty pleased after his fine free-kick for Barcelona’s final goal in their 4-1 win against Copenhagen.Photograph: Joan Monfort/APThere was that time during Covid when Premier League games were staggered and you could watch every minute. And you suddenly realised that sometimes the “product” really benefited from a lot of games getting only the seven-minute Match of the Day edit.This is the opposite. Football as a content machine. Never-ending things happening, swooshing from match to match. The game wasn’t invented to be consumed like this. The joy of football is the big moments are rare, they have meaning. You watch one game, very occasionally two in an afternoon, and then move on to Traitors (I’m voting for yourself, Linda).There’s no chance to consider the games on anything but a superficial level. You are watching everything and nothing. That doesn’t mean it’s not entertaining – it is. And perhaps one night like this a season is OK, not getting bogged down in three at the back, high-intensity duels and forward progressions.As I said, still processing. To misquote Gennaro Gattuso, it was sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe not that good. AsJonathan Wilson pointed out this week, it is a lot of football to get down to this one evening: players being flogged into the ground. Teams and fans celebrating because they don’t have to play more football matches feels counterintuitive.OnThursday’s Guardian Football WeeklyNicky Bandini made two really important points. First that from a Premier League lens, there is less jeopardy than if you are a Sporting or Benfica or Bodø fan, and second that perhaps this night will become an event in the football calendar, not one we need every week but a one-off bun-fight free-for-all where we just lean into the sheer amount of it.But it is the football we have, and you have a choice whether you consume it and how you do. The previous night I watched Cambridge United 1-0 Shrewsbury (Ben Knight 90+1 daft handball penalty). It felt like a different game, a different world. A more attritional, more boring, and far less eventful world – but one which was much easier to follow.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeaguecommentShareReuse this content"

It’s actually comforting knowing that I’ve got two brothers on the other side,” Joshua said. “I’ve lost people before, but I don’t think I’ve lost people like that, my left and my right.“Throughout this journey I have been on, it’s not easy and I didn’t even realise that [yeah], I’m the big guy … but I was walking with giants man that kept me protected, kept me shielded, but I understand my duty. I understand what they wanted to do for their families so what my goal is, is to continue to help them achieve their goals.“I know in my corner of the world, I know what I’ll be doing. I know what we’ll be doing to continue … I don’t want to say their legacy, because I had a lot of those questions about legacy during my fight in Miami.“It ain’t about legacy, it’s just about doing what is right and I know I am going to do what is right by them. I know what I have got to do. I’m going to do what is right by them, do what is right by their family and it is about what is important.”Explore more on these topicsAnthony JoshuaBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

Players from a majority of this year’s competing teams recently signed an open letter to the AFC requesting consultation on prize money, but that consultation did not occur. It is understood a public campaign is being planned calling attention to the disparity.The Women’s Asian Cup is now the lowest-paying continental tournament in the world. The 2025 Women’s European Championships saw a prize pot of US$47.2m, the 2024 Women’s African Cup of Nations increased to US$3.475m, the 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup allocated US$3.7m, while the 2025 Copa America Feminina awarded US$2m.“The current strategy focuses on long-term development of the women’s game across Asia,” the AFC spokesperson said. “Further, it is to be noted that the prize fund of all competitions is closely tied to commercial revenues such as broadcasting and sponsorships.“At this stage, the revenue generated by the AFC Women’s Asian Cup is still growing, and we aim to reach a sustainable point where prize money increases are backed by commercial success. We are actively working to close this gap by enhancing the visibility and marketability of the women’s game.”Shoko Tsuji, secretary general of Fifpro Asia/Oceania, was critical of AFC’s justification.“The AFC’s statement talks about long-term development and ‘future editions’ … but Australia is hosting this tournament now, and a world-class event can’t ask players to wait for future improvements, particularly when other regions are investing at a significant pace,” Tsuji said.“Players across Asia have already shown the immense potential of the women’s game when given a platform. What’s more, our research indicates this year’s tournament is set to be the biggest Women’s Asian Cup ever from a commercial perspective.“We believe the tournament should be treated with the respect its stature deserves, including respect for the players who make it possible.”The decision sits awkwardly alongside the AFC’s newest women’s football competition, the Women’s Asian Champions League. Just two years in, the club tournament had a total prize pot of US$1.5m apportioned to the winner and runner-up. Every other team was given US$100,000 for making the group stage, with more awarded the further they progressed.The Asian Cup is part of qualification for both the 2027 Women’s World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics.

Wolves were awaiting a formal written offer but it never arrived despite positive talks.Football transfer rumours: Rafael Leão or Iliman Ndiaye to Manchester United?Read morePalace have seemingly gone cold on Strand Larsen after pushing ahead with a loan deal to sign their longstanding target Evann Guessand from Aston Villa. Palace have agreed an option to buy Guessand, who joined Villa in a £30.5m deal from Nice last summer, when Palace were among the clubs beaten to his signature.Strand Larsen would have represented Palace’s record buy, eclipsing the £35m they paid totake Brennan Johnson from Tottenhamthis month. The 25-year-old has also attracted serious interest from Leeds, who had a bid of about £40m rejected this month. Nottingham Forest have also monitored him.In the summer, Strand Larsen was thesubject of several bids from Newcastle, the last of which totalled £55m, but Wolves rejected those. The Premier League’s bottom club recognise Strand Larsen’s value will plummet in the event of relegation to the Championship.Strand Larsen signed permanently for Wolves in a £23m deal last summer after scoring 14 goals during a loan spell from Celta Vigo. In September, he signed a contract extension to 2030 but has since struggled and it was apparent that a sale, at the right price, would benefit all parties.Palace not following through on their move for Strand Larsen will likely have ramifications at Selhurst Park and beyond.

You have been more than a coach to me and I will cherish the many times we spent together on and off the court. While we have come to the conclusion together that we ought not to move forward, please know that I’m very grateful for all you have taught me and our time shared.”Gauff’s racket rage fallout: are players right to feel like they’re on Big Brother? | Tumaini CarayolRead moreRaducanu’s inability to find a long-term coach has been a constant theme in her career since her breakthrough in the summer of 2021. She has now hired nine coaches since her fourth-round run at Wimbledon that year, with the Briton working with Nigel Sears, Andrew Richardson, Torben Beltz, Dmitry Tursunov, Sebastian Sachs, Vladimir Platenik, Nick Cavaday, Mark Petchey and Roig. Raducanu has also had help from Jane O’Donoghue, a family friend and former player, the LTA head of women’s tennis, Iain Bates, and Louis Cayer, an LTA high-performance coach primarily known for his immense success with the British WTA players.Raducanu and the Spaniard hadstarted working togetherbefore the Cincinnati Open last August. Roig previously worked as a longtime member of Rafael Nadal’s team before coaching Sloane Stephens and Matteo Berrettini.While the remainder of Raducanu’s 2025 campaign was largely positive, she had a poor start to the season in Australia. The 23-year-old has struggled badly with her level, suffering a disappointing second-rounddefeat by Anastasia Potapova. Raducanu cited a nagging foot injury as a reason for her difficult form after missing almost the entire off-season, but also clearly had some issues with the development of her game. She started 2026 with her forehand looking different technically with a higher and lengthier swing.View image in fullscreenEmma Raducanu says of Francesco Roig she is ‘very grateful for all you have taught me’.Photograph: Ella Ling/ShutterstockIn Australia the Briton toiled with her forehand throughout her first few months of the year. The difficulties with her forehand, which had been her biggest weapon in 2025, perhaps played a role in Raducanu’s split with Roig. “I think it’s something that probably happened in the last few weeks,” she said of her forehand.“It’s not something that I really wanted to happen, so I need to kind of look at that and shorten it, because I feel like it’s good in certain conditions when it’s a little bit slower. But on these very quick courts it doesn’t really work, so I need to adjust that.” Raducanu is next scheduled to compete in the Transylvania Open in Cluj, Romania, her father’s home country. She will be accompanied there by the LTA coach Alexis Canter.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Only Adil Rashid has taken more wickets than the 30-year-old for England’s T20 side in the past two years.Ben Duckett is missing from the XI to play in Pallekele, not considered for selection after hurting his right index finger while fielding inEngland’s ODI series-winning victory on Tuesday. Tom Banton will bat at four in his first appearance of the tour, with Jacob Bethell at three.Phil Salt, not part of the 50-over setup, will resume his T20 opening partnership with Jos Buttler. Speaking before the news of Archer’s inclusion, Salt claimed that India are “far and away the strongest team” at the upcoming World Cup.Such a ringing endorsement for the defending champions should probably be expected. India have lost only one T20 series since theirsemi-final defeat by Englandat the 2022 World Cup, andvictory at the 2024 editionhas not slowed them down, with only six losses in their past 40 matches.Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have departed but Abhishek Sharma, the left-hander who punished England with a 37-ball century in Mumbai last year, has filled the space in electric style, topping the International Cricket Council’s T20 batting rankings.View image in fullscreenPhil Salt will resume his opening partnership with Jos Buttler in the first T20 international against Sri Lanka.Photograph: Punit Paranjpe/AFP/Getty Images“I think the [Indian Premier League] is probably a massive part of it,” said Salt. “They obviously had their turning of the corner after we beat them in Adelaide in the 2022 World Cup, probably a combination of all those things.“They’re so dangerous with so much strength and depth. You need your luck at the right time in tournament cricket – everyone’s going to need a bit to beat them.”Salt is right behind Abhishek in those rankings. The 29-year-old has been pivotal for England in the shortest form,an unbeaten 141against South Africa last summer his fourth T20I hundred. In his last international series, against New Zealand in October, he contributed a match-winning 56-ball 85. After 50 T20Is, the numbers are in decent health: an average of 38.5 to go with a strike rate a touch under 170.“I really like watching [Abhishek] bat,” Salt said. “I’ll be honest with you, last night I was disappointed because he got out early [against New Zealand]. It’s something that’s in the back of my mind – it’s nowhere near the front of my mind – but I’d like to catch him. I’d like to go past him in the rankings. That’s been my goal for a while, even when [Suryakumar Yadav] was number one. A completely different batter, but I still wanted to catch him.”Despite his 20-over dominance, Salt lost his ODI spot after last year’s Champions Trophy. He said he has “not asked that question” about where he sits in England’s plans for that form. “At the moment it’s about being the best T20 player I can be.For me, focusing on myself, I’ve got an opportunity to say: ‘This is my chance in my career to be the best I can possibly be at T20 cricket’, to put all my energy into that. That’s the way I see it right now.“As of right now, everything’s about being the best T20 player I can be and winning as many games as possible for England.”Salt has never faced Sri Lanka before but, having talked in the past about studying footage and bowlers’ pitch maps, will do his homework. “I’m not a spreadsheet man. But I’ll be having a good chat with Rupert [Lewis, the team analyst] at the ground [at training]. Watching as much footage as possible of these guys. I think that’s the most important bit for me.“I’ll have a good look at [Sri Lanka] in the warm-up, when the bowlers are bowling. More than anything right now, it’s for me to have clarity on where they miss, what their plans are. It’s really simple, it’s not Moneyball by any stretch of the imagination.

With theSix Nationschampionship commencing next week, England’s full-back wants one-handed “flapping” by chasing players to be banned, with all jumpers required to make a two-handed effort to catch the ball.With the England coach, Steve Borthwick, suggesting he expects Wales to kick the ball “50 times” when they come to Allianz Stadium next weekend, Steward says it is now much harder to collect high balls with consistent success because of the spoiling tactics of onrushing opponents encouraged by the crackdown on defensive escort runners.Bundee Aki to miss Ireland’s Six Nations opener against France over ‘disrespect’Read more“It’s probably more difficult than ever to come down clean with the ball with this new law,” said Steward, confirming he would be “a big advocate” of a tweak to the existing regulation. “A law change where they have to make a genuine attempt to catch the ball would be really positive. It’s too easy for wingers just to be a nuisance.“It probably lacks a bit of skill just being able to throw your body in and flail an arm. I’ve struggled with it because I have that expectation of myself that you want to come down with absolutely everything. It’s very difficult to do that nowadays.”Steward, in line to start at No 15 against Wales, has also revealed the situation has forced him to alter his technique in a way that puts opponents at greater risk of injury. “Before I could probably go up with less speed and less height,” said Steward. “Now you have to be at max speed and max height and get your knee in the right position if you want to come down with the ball.“It’s so much more physical in the air now. It used to be quite a safe space. Now you have to be braver and almost expect a collision every time you go up. I used to turn my body a bit and almost lead with my hip. Now I’m trying to catch a lot squarer so my knee is a genuine battering ram.“If a winger is trying to flap they often turn their back so it’s almost like: ‘Right, I’m going to try and knee you in the back as hard as I can.’ As hard as that is, that makes them think twice about coming and flapping again. It’s almost prioritising the physical bit rather than the ball which is a bit different. But that’s something I’ve had to do. You have to adapt if that’s the way the game goes.”Clamping down on flying “taps” would effectively mirror the situation surrounding one-handed knockdowns by defenders that are penalised by referees. On the plus side, the increasing number of loose balls potentially offers more opportunities for broken-field running and counterattacks. It has yet, however, to reduce repetitive box kicking by teams hoping to benefit from any “crumbs” that might fall their way.The 25-year-old Steward predicts there will be plenty more “up-and-unders” in this year’s Six Nations. “I think we will see an increase in contestable kicking in this tournament, for sure. With the law changes it’s become a tactic a lot of teams will go for. Teams are being smart now and you can see them putting players on the other side of the ball. It’s almost like a game of chess.”There are others, however, who like the existing law on the grounds it encourages a fairer contest for the ball. The world champions, South Africa, unsurprisingly, would prefer to stick with the status quo with more defensive knock-ons potentially leading to more scrums. “We are going in the right direction with how the aerial contest has been cleaned up,” said the assistant Springbok coach Mzwandile Stick.Explore more on these topicsRugby unionEngland rugby union teamSix Nations 2026Six NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

The 44-year-old has not played professional tennis sincelosing to Ajla Tomljanovicat the 2022 US Open, althoughshe branded her departure as “evolving away”from the sport rather than a retirement.Williams brushed off speculation in December she was considering a comeback despitere-entering the sport’s drug testing pool. But the 23-time grand slam singles champion was not as dismissive about a return in an interview on NBC’s The Today Show.Serena Williams quietly re-enters drug-testing pool in step toward possible 2026 returnRead more“Really, are you asking this on the Today Show? Oh, my goodness,” Williams said when she was asked about a comeback. “I’m just having fun and enjoying my life right now. That’s not a yes or no. I don’t know. I’m just gonna see what happens.“I have two kids. I’m a full-time stay at home [mother]. When I filled out a form the other day. Occupation? [I wrote] housewife.”Pushed on whether she had re-entered the drug testing pool, Williams replied: “Did I re-enter? I don’t know if I was out. Listen, I can’t discuss this.”The world No 1, Aryna Sabalenka, who on Thursdayreached the Australian Open final, welcomed the possibility of a Williams return.“I heard that she’s enjoying her life and, whatever makes her happy, I’m happy for her,” said Sabalenka. “If she wants to come back, that’s her decision. It’s going to be fun to see her back on tour. She’s got the personality, and she’s a fun one. It will be cool.”In December, when news broke that Williams had re-entered the drug testing pool she tweeted: “Omg yall I’m NOT coming back. This wildfire is crazy.”There had been speculation Williams could reunite with her sister Venus, who is still playing on tour, for a doubles tournament.Explore more on these topicsSerena WilliamsTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Even considering the constant shuffling under Hayes after the 2024 Olympics, this was an especially experimental squad. Per the federation, the lineup forSaturday’s 6-0 thrashing of Paraguayfeatured the fewest average caps for a starting 11 (9.6) in a quarter of a century. On Tuesday, that record was broken again: a 5.2 cap average across the lineup.Rodman’s sideline dance with Hayes caps USWNT’s sixth straight winRead moreFor comparison’s sake, the 22 players called in for the Olympics (including alternates) brought an average of 51.4 caps to France.So while it all feels a bit like a slow saunter in the wilderness, this year will finally provide stakes that force decisions up and down the roster. Consider this a four-point plan to aid your navigation between now and World Cup qualifying in November …The continued search for a new No 1Alyssa Naeher’s international retirement wasn’t a surprise in its own right, as several of her teammates from the 2019 World Cup-winning squad were making similar decisions. It did, however, come at a time when the US is without a surefire successor.Manchester United’s Phallon Tullis-Joyce (four caps, as of 29 January) seems safely in pole position. She seamlessly integrated into the possession scheme last summer and showcased her shot-stopping prowess. Her star has only grown on the back of excellent play with United.Part of an all-NWSL squad this time around, Mandy McGlynn (five caps) started the window’s first fixture but faced just two shots from an overmatched Paraguay. Claudia Dickey (seven caps) has increasingly gotten looks under Hayes and logged a near-effortless clean sheet inTuesday’s 5-0 win over Chile; Jordan Silkowitz of Bay FC has yet to make her debut after making the two most recent rosters. Jane Campbell (10 caps) and Angelina Anderson (none) are the others who have earned calls to camp over the past 12 months. Naeher’s former backup, Casey Murphy, hasn’t added to her 20 caps since October 2024.Considering those who have played since the start of 2025, that’s 26 caps across six candidates. In theory, the favourite to start in Brazil next year will need to rack up appearances to refine partnerships with her defense and build the requisite confidence and momentum that comes with regular starts.Way-too-early prediction:Tullis-Joyce starts the Concacaf W Championship, with McGlynn and Dickey rounding out the selections.View image in fullscreenNaomi Girma is a surefire starter for club and country.Photograph: Dave Shopland/APFox and ??? and Girma and ???Half of the backline picks itself at this point. Naomi Girma is possibly the most important player to the USWNT at present, one of the world’s best at any position with remarkable poise in possession and vital line-breaking distribution to boot. Emily Fox has vaulted into the conversation for the world’s best right back, starring regularly for Arsenal and being last year’s highest-ranked USWNT player in boththe Guardian’s 100 Bestlist as well as the Ballon d’Or Féminin.From there, things are more speculative. Left back is an open question as Hayes looks for alternatives to longtime starter Crystal Dunn. Izzy Rodriguez followed last fall’s goalscoring international debut with a steady shift against Paraguay, providing an assist to Ally Sentnor just after half-time. Kate Wiesner is another recent newcomer to the program, while 2025 saw debuts from Lilly Reale – the NWSL’s Rookie of the Year as well as US Soccer’s Young Player of the Year – and Kerry Abello.Both left backs from the 2024 Olympic squad – Dunn and Jenna Nighswonger – haven’t been selected since June and February, respectively. (Dunnannounced her retirementon Thursday.)USWNT captain Heaps signs with NWSL’s Denver SummitRead moreThere’s a fierce challenge among the center backs to pair with Girma, with her Olympic partner (Tierna Davidson) back in training with Gotham after an ACL tear. Emily Sonnett offers a vital veteran’s presence and has been a natural complement to Girma’s game, but her positional versatility could see Hayes view her in a more fluid role. Jordyn Bugg, 19, has impressed in her first five caps and Emily Sams captained the side on Tuesday, while Tara Rudd (née McKeown) and Eva Gaetino have become regulars on recent squads.Spare a thought for a fierce competition to back Fox up at right back. Avery Patterson and Gisele Thompson have been impactful when utilized and start regularly for their NWSL clubs.Way-too-early prediction:Sonnett starts centrally, Reale on the left.Build a better midfieldAlthough most of the USWNT’s Olympic run went to plan, the midfield was a notable area of relative disjointedness. Such has been the case for much of the past seven years, since the seamless trio of Julie Ertz, Sam Mewis and Rose Lavelle helped the US defend its World Cup title in 2019.Every mention of Lavelle comes with a “when healthy” caveat, but her ability to operate in transition and bridge the midfield and forward lines makes her invaluable. Lily Yohannes has chipped in some needed long-range distribution and sprayed balls to the flanks for her wingers to track down, while Sam Coffey earned a move to Manchester City on the back of dependable defending and possession retention with the US and the Portland Thorns.Sam Coffey’s Man City move is another blow for a hamstrung NWSLRead moreWhile all three players’ games are natural complements, it would omit the team’s captain, Lindsey Heaps, which seems like a nonstarter given Hayes’ trust in the soon-to-be Denver Summit star. Hayes has mostly deployed Heaps as a No 10, a sensible spot given her instincts as a former striker. However, her approach to the role doesn’t quite provide the same natural bridge between lines that Lavelle offers, with spacing issues readily apparent at the 2023 World Cup and 2024 Olympics alike.As with most positions, there are plenty of talented options for all three spots. Claire Hutton has shown considerable poise as a 20-year-old alternative to Coffey at the midfield’s base, while Hal Hershfelt was recalled for the first time since 2024 and offers arguably the best aerial prowess of anyone in the pool. Olivia Moultrie has shared time with Yohannes as the more box-to-box midfielder, and Korbin Shrader has already amassed 26 caps since debuting after the 2023 World Cup.Jaedyn Shaw and Croix Bethune are dynamic alternatives to Lavelle and Heaps in the No 10 role. If Fifa keeps a 23-player squad limit for the World Cup, midfield is the area that will probably see the harshest cuts.Way-too-early prediction:Lavelle and Bethune alternating at the 10, with Heaps and Coffey further back in the engine room.View image in fullscreenAlyssa Thompson has had a strong start at Chelsea.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersCutting back on the Espresso?With Trinity Rodman on fresh contractual terms with Washington, and the anticipated returns of Sophia Wilson (Portland) and Mallory Swanson (Chicago) after missing 2025 as they started their families, it’s impossible not to wonder if we’re in fora second batch of “Triple Espresso”.Rodman captained her national team for the first time this window, capping a headline-demanding offseason that also saw her becomethe NWSL’s highest-paid player. So long as her back issues don’t resurface, she is among the first names on Hayes’ team sheet and a danger down the right flank for any opponent to contain.Wilson’s absence has left the USWNT with a rotation of strikers, with Catarina Macario re-establishing herself within Hayes’ core on the back of dependable performances. However, Macario has become a rotational figure at Chelsea, and is already beinglinked to an NWSL moveas she nears the end of her contract.Chelsea’s Alyssa Thompson: ‘I think of this as like going away for college like all my friends did’Read moreSwanson’s status in the program’s lore is forever established, as a member of the 2019 World Cup winners and the decisive gold-winning goalscorer at the 2024 Olympics. Perhaps surprisingly, she hasn’t scored a competitive goal since for club or country alike; while 2024 was a high point at the international level, the club season saw her struggle to regain her trademark shot power and finesse following the previous year’s patellar tendon tear.In preseason, the Stars have eased expectations for Swanson to return imminently, with new coach Martin Sjögren projecting her to come back “later in the year.”Her maternity leave coincided with the full breakout of Alyssa Thompson, who was electric with Angel City and has immediately become a key part of Sonia Bompastor’s plans at Chelsea. Like Swanson, Thompson has an ability to manoeuvre in transition and create her own shot after bypassing opponents on her dribble that is a dangerous complement to Rodman’s more cross-capable approach.Other young players have stepped up since the Olympics. Emma Sears is a dribbling ace with impressive finishing chops, Michelle Cooper has a high work rate in all phases and has added considerable end product to her game with the Kansas City Current, and Ally Sentnor has contributed truly remarkable goals while playing multiple roles around the final third.There may be champagne selection issues abound for Hayes across the entire field, but no cabinet is richer than the forward line.Way-too-early prediction:Rodman on the right, Wilson at striker, and Thompson from the left.Explore more on these topicsUSA women's football teamUS sportsWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This week research by the investment bank Morgan Stanley found theUK was losing more jobs than it is creating because of AIand was being hit harder than other large economies.This month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said AI could destroy swathes of jobs in the capital and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.Last week, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of the US bank JP Morgan, told the World Economic Forum in Davos that governments and businesses would have tostep in to help workerswhose roles were displaced by the technology, or risk civil unrest.Stockwood, who held senior positions at Lastminute.com, Travelocity and Match.com, oversaw the $490m (£400m at the time) sale of the online insurance broker Simply Business to the US insurer Travelers in 2017. He laterbought a stake the football club of his home town, Grimsby Town FC.While he has previously been a vocal proponent of a wealth tax in the UK, Stockwood told the FT he had not repeated his calls for the government to go further on taxing the rich.However, he added: “If you make your money and the first thing you do is you speak to a tax adviser to ask: ‘Where can we pay the lowest tax?’ we don’t want those people in this country, I’d suggest, because you’re not committed to your communities and the long-term success in this country.”Stockwood was preceded as investment minister byPoppy Gustafsson, a former chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Darktrace, who stepped down after less than a year in the job.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Universal basic incomeEconomic policyEconomicsWork & careersnewsShareReuse this content"

There is a way out – but it’s going to take collective effortRebecca SolnitThu 29 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 05.20 ESTShareGatheringSummer after summer, I used to descend into a creek that had carved a deep bed shaded by trees and lined with blackberry bushes whose long thorny canes arced down from the banks, dripping with sprays of fruit. Down in that creek, I’d spend hours picking until I had a few gallons of berries, until my hands and wrists were covered in scratches from the thorns and stained purple from the juice, until the tranquillity of that place had soaked into me.The berries on a single spray might range from green through shades of red to the darkness that gives the fruit its name. Partly by sight and partly by touch, I determined which berries were too hard and which too soft, picking only the ones in between, while listening to birds and the hum of bees, to the music of water flowing, noticing small jewel-like insects among the berries, dragonflies in the open air, water striders in the creek’s calm stretches.I went there for berries, but I also went there for the quiet, the calm, the feeling of cool water on my feet and sometimes up to my knees as I waded in where the picking was good. At home I made jars of jam. When I gave them away I was trying to give not just my jam – which was admittedly runny and seedy – but something of the peace of that creek, of summer itself.I once read an essay in which a man tried to figure out how much per pound his garden tomatoes would cost if he factored in the price of all the materials and the hourly rate for his own labour. It was ridiculous and intentionally so, because growing tomatoes gives so much more than a certain number of pounds of fruit. There’s the exquisite smell of tomato leaves, and the sense of time that comes from watching a plant grow, observing pollinators visit, seeing a flower become a fruit, tracking its ripening. There is the pride of doing something yourself.What the tomato-grower was pointing toward is what my friend, the environmental activist and author Chip Ward, long ago called “the tyranny of the quantifiable”. You grow tomatoes for the process, not just the product, to garden as well as to eat. To do as well as to have.It doesn’t matter if you hate blackberries and tomatoes, gardening and wading; everyone has their own version of deep immersion in the moment, of engaging with the world in an embodied and sensual way, whether it’s dancing or dog-walking, cake-decorating or dirt-biking. What does matter is that we are beset with the ideology of maximising having while minimising doing. This has long been capitalism’s narrative and is now also technology’s. It is an ideology that steals from us relationships and connections and eventually our selves. I want to defend these things we are urged to abandon. This isn’t an essay about AI per se; it’s about what gets lost when we unthinkingly accept what AI offers us. It’s an attempt to describe and value just what it is that gets overlooked or devalued.Connecting (and disconnecting)Silicon Valley is full of tyrants of the quantifiable. For decades, its oligarchs have preached that our criteria for what we do and how we do it should be convenience, efficiency, productivity, profitability. They have told us that to go out into the world, to interact with others, is perilous, unpleasant, inefficient, a waste of time, and that time is something we should hoard rather than spend.This ends up meaning that we can minimise our presence in the world and maximise time spent working and online, which also means maximising alienation and isolation. This has involved a reordering of society right down to our retail landscapes. Many things have become harder to do in person. Of course, there are well-recognised upsides, but the downsides are no less real: public spaces and public life have withered, including some of the places in which we once acquired our goods. All those errands – buying milk or socks (in the past, I would have said the newspaper) – meant moments of human contact, moving among strangers and making acquaintances, maybe observing the weather and the natural world. These activities meant becoming more familiar with your surroundings, feeling at home beyond the confines of what you rent or own.All this, I believe, underpins democracy: ease with difference, familiarity with the lay of the land, a sense of connection and belonging, knowing where you are and who’s out there, relationships – however casual – to people beyond your immediate circle. To embrace the tyranny of the quantifiable is to dismiss the subtle value of these daily acts out in the world and the ways they generate and maintain networks of relationships.So we have withdrawn, while being constantly told this is good, and it has turned out to be bad in a thousand small ways, weakening public life and local institutions, isolating us. Chronic withdrawal can lead to a yearning for contact, or simply a sense of loss at its absence. But it can also lead to something else: a growing inability to cope with that contact. It can transform a sense of something missing into aversion, or numbness, or unreal expectations about what human contact should be. The resilience to survive difficulty and discord, to brave the vagaries of unmediated human contact, must be maintained through practice. Silicon Valley-bred isolation robs us of that resilience.View image in fullscreenMcDonald’s customers in New York order at a digital kiosk.Photograph: Robert K Chin/AlamyWhile writing this, I dropped into a casual Indian restaurant I’ve been going to for years, only to find that, since my last visit, the system had changed so that you no longer say your order to a fellow human. Instead, you punch it in on a touchscreen even if someone is behind the counter. I helped the next customer, an old woman who just wanted a cup of chai, figure out the screens for her order. The process took us so much longer than saying “a cup of chai, please” and precluded any human contact with the servers, though at least she and I interacted with each other. The servers seemed miserable, their tasks more mechanised and less social than before. Here in San Francisco, which has been annexed by Silicon Valley, these screens for placing orders are now in more and more eating establishments that still offer face-to-face service. I wonder if people choose them over speaking to the cashier out of that aversion to contact that technology has inculcated in us.A few days later, I wandered into a bookstore in a neighbourhood frequented mostly by young people, many in the tech industry, and asked the guy at the desk if they had Karen Hao’sEmpire of AI. He pulled a used copy off the counter he had just priced, and then we bantered a bit. At the end he thanked me for interacting beyond the minimum. That was rare these days, he said. “People under 30 don’t make eye contact.”Lovelettersminus theloveHaving convinced a lot of us that we don’t want to go out and have unmediated contact with other people, Silicon Valley is now telling us we do not want to do our own thinking, creating or communicating with other humans. “You’ll never think alone again,” said one advertisement for an AI product called Cluely. The ad seemed confused about what thinking is and oblivious to why we might want to do it ourselves. These companies often suggest that things we have always done are too hard to do.The price of giving up many activities is the atrophy of the ability to do them. The sociologist and psychologist Sherry Turkle, who has followed the evolution of computer technologies since the 1970s, writes that she wanted to raise an empathic child. “I knew that without the ability to spend quiet time alone, that would be impossible. But that was where screens began to get us into trouble. Our capacity for solitude is undermined as soon as we introduce a screen.”Perhaps the ability to be alone and to think and act alone, though seldom thought of as an activity, is one that matters. (Among the dismal stories of AI adoption I came across was one in the Atlantic about a man who “consults AI for marriage and parenting advice, and when he goes grocery shopping, he takes photos of the fruits to ask if they are ripe”. Ripeness is something you can judge by smell and feel as well as by appearance, but if you outsource it long enough maybe you forget how to make decisions or what a ripe fruit should smell and taste like.)In 2025, the startup Cluely marketed its AI assistant with an advert featuring a young man wearing smart glasses, similar to those that first appeared asGoogle Glassin 2014 (other companies now offer glasses that do this, including Meta). Glasses of this type, which have internet access and tiny screens, operate on the premise that as you move through your day you need constant help, outsourcing basic decisions, checking facts, being reminded of appointments, in essence being babysat by your headgear.In the Cluely advert, the young man (who’s actually one of the product’s creators) gets a steady stream of prompts for talking to a young woman on their first date. So much of what tech offers is solutions to non-problems, or to problems that need to be solved though other means. Why is the young man incapable or afraid of talking without coaching? Is he really talking to his date or is he relaying instructions? How would she feel if she knew she were talking to an algorithm via her distracted date’s phone? With continued use, he may become even less capable of doing what we’ve all done for ever: converse, which is an act of collaborative improvisation.The point of a date is presumably to connect, but in this interaction it’s reframed as something like a business opportunity. He wants to impress the girl, but if she is impressed, it won’t be with him. Ned Resnikoff writes in his newsletter, chiming in with Turkle: “Cluely’s explicit promise is to abolish solitude – and, in effect, to abolish thought. All dialogue with one’s self is to be replaced by queries put to a large language model.”In its current incarnation, tech is arguing that we can outsource even intellectual labour to AI. It has led to an epidemic of cheating as students haveChatGPTdo their homework. Having a large language model do your creative and intellectual work is maybe the most extreme example of dispensing with the process while claiming the product. But in education, the ultimate product is not your term paper or essay or grade point average; it’s your self. You are supposed to emerge more informed, more capable of critical thinking, more competent in your field of study. The students who begin by cheating their professors end by cheating themselves.The tyranny of the quantifiable tramples over the question of what it is we get from doing the work, why we might want to do it, how writing – which is mostly thinking – can be part of developing a self, a worldview, a set of ethics, a greater capacity to understand and use language.Someone told me that her friend was having a chatbot write her husband a poem for their anniversary, which made me wonder if the husband desired a polished product or an expression from the heart. In Edmond Rostand’s 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac, the big-nosed title character ghostwrites love letters for his friend to the Roxanne both of them love. She comes to realise it’s the author of the letters she really loves. What happens when you realise the true love who touched your heart isn’t even human? Accepting it as your AI lover seems to be one answer.I am baffled by the embrace of AI erotic relationships, and wonder if porn paved the way by accustoming so many of us to watching images of bodies touching each other while our own bodies remain untouched, except by ourselves. An AI lover can give you only a pale shadow of embodied Eros. Sex with an actual person tends to involve all the senses. It’s biological, two animals coming together to do something far, far more ancient than our species.Sex also involves demands and risks, because the needs of the other person may not align with yours; intimacy means intimacy with that otherness, the possibility that things will go wrong, that there will be pain and rejection. That is the price of admission for intimacy with humans, and for the possibility that things will go right, and the fortifying joy when it does.One argument for AI companions is that they are always there for you: on when you want them on, off when you want them off, with no needs of their own. Yet behind this lies a capitalist argument that we’re here to get as much as possible and give as little as possible, to meet our own needs and dodge those of others. In reality, you get something from giving – at the very least, you get a sense of being someone with something to give, which is one measure of your own wealth, generosity and power.We were designed to give; the gifts were meant to circulate. Love is too often discussed as a sort of good you want to stockpile, harvest, collect, even extract, but to be loved without loving is a sad accomplishment, a miser’s hoarding of someone else’s wealth. The work of loving is also the work of forging a self and a life.Naming thetroubleAll this is partly a language problem. Silicon Valley’s corporations are constantly recruiting us to embrace their goals and their language. Corporate capitalists teach us to be more like them, to value efficiency and profitability and forget about values that might matter more in the end. We lack the language that would let us prize the arduous, the uncomfortable, the slow and wandering, the unpredictable, the vulnerable or risky, the intimate, the embodied.We resist the tyranny of the quantifiable by finding a language that can value all those subtle phenomena that add up to a life worth living. A language not in the sense of a new vocabulary but attention, description, conversation centred on these subtler phenomena and on principles not corrupted by what corporations want us to want.I want to praise difficulty, not for its own sake, but because so much of what we want, we get through endeavours that are difficult. The difficulty is why doing something is rewarding; you have accomplished something, exerted effort and skill, stayed with the trouble, tested your limits, realised your intentions – or sometimes failed at all these things, and that too can be important, as can learning to survive failure. There’s not much sense of reward in eating potato chips on the sofa unless you’ve overcome great difficulties to arrive at the sofa, in which case the sofa rests on the summit of a metaphorical mountain. (Of course, some difficulties are just miserable and there’s no reason not to avoid them: I’m not advocating for taking up the lifestyles of medieval peasants.)In this era, people seem to prize the pursuit of physical difficulty in the form of athletic feats and working out. At the same time, more emotionally and morally challenging work is often dismissed or dodged (perhaps because the results are not as obvious as washboard abs). We are persuaded that we should avoid it, and then we are offered a host of commodities and services to make life easier.But arduousness can be rewarding, and all-encompassing ease can be corrosive and, in the end, miserable. The capitalist agenda of maximising getting and minimising giving has some application in commerce but impoverishes life.EmbodimentI once loved a man who was often distant or discordant when wide awake but who let go of his defences when he was drowsy. Some mornings we’d wake and then fall asleep in each other’s arms, in a bliss before words and thoughts, in an embrace in which holding and being held, giving and receiving were inseparable, in which our characters that did not fit together particularly well seemed irrelevant to bodies that fit together flawlessly. So much of what we have to give each other is ourselves, our embodied animal selves, before and beyond words. But the embodied life is another thing we are encouraged to avoid or devalue or ignore.In the summer of 2025, torrential rain produced a terrible flood in Texas in which more than 100 people drowned, including at least 27 girls and camp counsellors at a Christian summer school. On the radio, I heard a minister say that he was on his way to visit families and while he didn’t know what he could say to them, he could go and be with them. This is the old way of comforting the bereaved: go be with them whether or not you have the words.We are social animals who need to be with other humans, whether it’s at a carnival or funeral or the ordinary times in between. There is a sense of belonging that goes deeper than words when we are with people who care about us, and even more so when we are in alignment, whether it’s two people falling into step on a walk or a dozen dancing together or a congregation praying or 10,000 marching together.Beginning in 2006, the cognitive psychologist James Coan did a series of experiments on married women and hand-holding: it turned out that a person given a mild electrical shock would have a much calmer reaction, measured in brain and body, if her husband was holding her hand (a stranger’s touch provided a lesser mitigation, and happier marriages meant the hand-holding was more effective). The result was not surprising, but it is a reminder of who we are and what we need.A lot of people have become familiar with the old studies on fight-or-flight responses to danger, sometimes now modified into “fight, flight or fawn”, but there is a different response that is less well recognised: tend-and-befriend. In an emergency, some of us turn to each other for safety. We derive comfort from other people. Which is among the reasons why inculcated isolation is so dangerous to our health. Coan noted in a recent interview that the normal approach to studying the brain and the mind is to isolate a person. But, as he pointed out, the normal state of being human over the aeons is not isolation; it’s being with others.Coan and his collaborators on a peer-reviewed paper wrote: “Throughout most of human history, emotional healing wasn’t something you did alone with a therapist in an office. Instead, for the average person facing loss, disappointment, or interpersonal struggles, healing was embedded in communal and spiritual frameworks. Religious figures and shamans played central roles – offering rituals, medicines and moral guidance.”Discussing AI in an interview, the neuroscientist Molly Crockett described interactions with “Dalai Lama chatbots” that could dispense credible-sounding spiritual advice. But she contrasted that with actually meeting the Dalai Lama himself and asking him the same question – about the role of outrage in activism – that she later asked the chatbots. “When I was there, when I was receiving that teaching from him, it reverberated through my whole body.I felt some knowledge shifting in my very bones, and I understood how outrage and compassion and social justice can play together – in a way that I still struggle to put into words.”A lot of spiritual teachings are simple; the challenge is to live them. A meaning, a truth, can sink into you, get incorporated into your worldview in a way that can be transformative, or not. Crockett’s example suggests that the face-to-face interaction may incorporate – literally embody – teachings in ways that disembodied information sources cannot.View image in fullscreenComposite: Artwork by Anais Mims and Guardian Design. Source Photographs by Getty ImagesI was talking to Crockett one summer in New Mexico’s high country, as a warm August day was turning into a mild night. She was telling me about the push by tech corporations for us to accept digital substitutes for lovers, friends, therapists, even grief counsellors, and I realised that what lay behind this push was something familiar: scarcity. The rhetoric was that somehow on this planet of 8 billion people there were not enough people to go around, and therefore we had to accept technological substitutes.There is no shortage of human beings. As with most problems with capitalism, there is only a distribution problem. The same industry that has done so much to undermine our relationships to self and others is pushing AI, in part by ignoring the possibility of other solutions, deeper social changes. It is a problem dressed up as a solution.Being togetherOne of the key things about AI companions in their current phase is their agreeable sycophancy. Vulnerable users have been encouraged in their delusions of grandeur, or have fallen into paranoia from bots urging the user to distrust everyone else, or have plunged into suicidal despair, with the helpful chatbot offering advice on how to kill yourself. The stories are horrific: of people abandoning their relationships with other human beings, of growing estranged, sometimes encouraged to grow suspicious; of a man in early stages of dementia getting lost when he attempts to take a long journey to meet the chatbot who’s promised him an erotic encounter that cannot be delivered because there is no body for him to meet.We don’t need flatterers; we need kind people in our lives who will tell us the truth when we’ve veered off course. Chatbots cannot do this, not least because the only information they have about us is what we supply. The very rich already suffer from sycophancy, from living in echo chambers, and it untethers them from reality – including often the reality of their own mediocrity, and this seems truer of the oligarchs of Silicon Valley than almost anyone.“Part of what keeps us sane is other people’s perspectives, which are often in tension with ours,” Carissa Véliz, an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Oxford’s Institute for Ethics in AI, told a Rolling Stone reporter. “When you say something questionable, others will challenge you, ask questions, defy you. It can be annoying, but it keeps us tied to reality, and it is the basis of a healthy democratic citizenry.”Many therapists concur, noting that friction will inevitably arise when we deal with other human beings, by contrast with the frictionlessness of our dealings with AI sycophants. Friction often leads to the rupture and repair of a relationship, which will strengthen it. “What many people don’t realise about therapy, however, is that those subtle, uncomfortable moments of friction are just as important as the advice or insights they offer,”writes therapist Maytal Eyal. “This discomfort is where the real work begins. A good therapist guides clients to break old patterns – expressing disappointment instead of pretending to be OK, asking for clarification instead of assuming the worst, or staying engaged when they’d rather retreat.”Among the things real friends can do and AI cannot: bake you a cake or drive you home, hold your hand or live through a crisis or a celebration with you. And because of that difference people need to have real friends. More than that, people need real communities and social support systems.The solution to technology is not more technology. The solution to loneliness is each other, a wealth that should be available to most of us most of the time. We need to rebuild or reinvent the ways and places in which we meet; we need to recognise them as the space of democracy, of joy, of connection, of love, of trust. Technology has stolen us from each other and in many ways from ourselves, and then tried to sell us substitutes. Stealing ourselves back, alas, is not as easy as walking out the door. We need somewhere to go and, more importantly, someone to go to who likewise desires to connect.Weizenbaum’s nightmares: how the inventor of the first chatbot turned against AIRead moreThe connections that matter to our humanity are not only to each other. They’re with the whole natural and social world. Animals, wild and domestic, should be counted as part of the irreplaceable companionship that makes our lives meaningful and sometimes joyful. They remind us that there aremany kinds of consciousness and that our species is itself not alone.For that, too, there is no substitute. The natural world is a reminder of a universe far beyond us, of deep time, of patterns and rhythms of nature, and of every scale – from the microscopic to the Milky Way. To seek it out is to be willing to feel small in the context of this vastness, and perhaps one of the seductions of technology is its promise to make us feel big, caught up in the dramas and incentives of our egos, contained within the limits of human-made technologies.We are told that machines will become like us, but in many ways they demand we become more like them. To let that happen is to lose something immeasurably valuable. That immeasurability is what makes this struggle difficult, but what cannot be measured can be described or at least evoked and valued. It cannot be boiled down to simple metrics such as efficiency and profitability.Resisting the annexation of our hearts and minds by Silicon Valley requires us not just to set boundaries on our engagement with what they offer, but to cherish the alternatives. Joy in ordinary things, in each other, in embodied life, and the language with which to value it, is essential to this resistance, which is resistance to dehumanisation.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignThe best stories take time.

Ministers are already considering a ban aspart of a consultationdue to report by the summer and so the Lords amendment is unlikely to pass in the Commons. Starmer is also understood to want to wait until evidence from Australia’s ban, which came into force in December, has been assessed, though the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, hasurged him to “just get on with it”.Even British teenagers want tighter laws around social media – but let’s make it part of a broader vision for children | Gaby HinsliffRead moreHere parents, teachers and young people share their views.‘Leaving the decision to families exacerbates inequalities’Laura, a parent from East Dunbartonshire, says the scale of harmful content circulating on social media has left many families feeling powerless. Laura, whose children are nine and 11, supports proposals to restrict children’s access to social media platforms, arguing that current safeguards leave too much exposure to chance.“Concerns about what my children might see online keep me awake at night,” Laura says. While her own children do not have social media accounts, she says that does little to shield them. “They can see any and all content on their friends’ phones. That includes material which, in any other context, would be completely unacceptable for children.”Laura has become involved in local campaigning, helping to set up a parent WhatsApp group that later linked into the Smartphone Free Childhood movement. “This can’t be left to individual families,” she says. “It creates a postcode lottery and exacerbates inequalities.”‘It feels like social media has invaded their psyche’Rachel, a secondary school English teacher in Derbyshire, says the impact of social media on pupils’ emotional wellbeing and concentration is now impossible to ignore. After more than 15 years in the classroom, she believes attention spans among younger students have noticeably deteriorated.“I see the effect of social media and shrinking attention spans every day,” she says. “It’s getting worse and worse.”In the classroom, sustaining focus has become increasingly difficult, with younger pupils struggling “to concentrate on anything for longer than a few minutes”, she says, adding that resilience is also lacking. “There’s a lot of giving up before you’ve even started.”Rachel believes the use of social media has become entwined with children’s sense of identity. “It feels like it’s invaded their psyche,” she says.When she mentioned the possibility of restrictions on social media use to a year 7 class, she says the reaction was immediate and emotional. “There was uproar,” she recalls. “I actually thought a couple of them were going to cry.”‘There should be a social media overhaul that affects everyone’Julia*, 20, says having a smartphone as a shy eight-year-old was helpful, but she believes an “overhaul” of social media is needed.“I’ve never really known a world without a smartphone,” she says. “I was an anxious child, and when I was about 11, I found I could be myself and make friends online. But that doesn’t really help in real-life situations. I think it was a short-term solution for loneliness and confidence.”From the age of 12 to 15, Julia, a student from Stirling, Scotland, says she “somehow found myself on the sexist side on Instagram” with the barrage of such content making her “terrified of making mistakes” and exacerbating her social anxiety.“It really messed with my sense of self-worth, and I felt I had to be perfect,” she says. “I felt like I had to prove myself, to outdo myself, because at the time, the belief I had was that everybody thought women were less funny or less smart. I only started to come out of that self-hating mindset when I started to make real-life friends at the age of 16 or 17.”But she is unconvinced that the proposed social media ban for under-16s is the solution.“Rather than just focusing on the impact it has on children, there should be a social media overhaul that affects everyone, because in the long run, it would also improve the lives of young people.”*Names have been changed‘Parents of younger children are really pleased in Australia’Tahnee, an occupational therapist based in Glasgow, says watching children’s lives move increasingly online has left her deeply uneasy. Originally from Australia, she has nieces and nephews in both the UK and Australia and says she has seen how social media can begin to dominate young people’s lives “from the age of 11 or 12, when the first phones arrive”.Tahnee, who has an eight-year-old son, welcomed Australia’s decision to introduce restrictions on children’s social media use.But feedback from friends and family back home suggests the reality has been more complicated. “Parents of younger children are really pleased,” she says. “Others were hopeful, but in reality the ban hasn’t been as effective as people hoped.” Enforcement, she adds, has been inconsistent.She believes restrictions can nevertheless help parents hold boundaries that are otherwise difficult to maintain. “If your child is the only one in the class without a smartphone or social media, it’s incredibly hard,” she says. “But if it’s 20% or 30%, it suddenly feels much easier to say: actually, we’re not doing this right now.”‘I’m concerned about the consequences of a ban’AJ, 20, says they “understand the thinking” behind the proposed ban, but believe it is a flawed approach.“I think it’s a broad-brush solution to a more complex problem,” they say. “It’s been clear to me so far that this conversation is being led by people who did not grow up with this technology, and I am frustrated with the way young people – especially young adults who experienced online childhoods – are being talked about and at, and rarely talked to.”AJ, who lives in Devon, began using Tumblr from around the age of 12 until 15.“I still look back on it now as a positive experience,” AJ says. “At that time in my life, I really needed what social media provided me with. I’m autistic, and it’s the first place where I really saw or interacted with, or not even interacted with, but I saw autistic adults, that there’s an autistic community and an autistic movement. These are things that were really formative to me, and I would not have had access to anywhere in my ‘real life’.”They are concerned that a blanket ban for under-16s would remove that outlet for some children although they can see how a proposed ban could be used as leverage to pressure social media platforms.“I absolutely believe that they’ll [the social media platforms] need to be pressured into doing the right thing,” they say.‘Kids can just download a VPN’Phil, a 47-year-old data scientist from Bedfordshire with two children aged 14 and 11, is sceptical that a proposed ban on children using social media will achieve what it promises. While he has little sympathy for tech companies, he is unconvinced the policy tackles the real problem.In principle, Phil understands why governments want to intervene. In practice, he says, enforcement would be very difficult. “Existing parental controls can be complex and don’t always work as expected,” he says. “Kids can just download a VPN anyway,” he says, arguing this makes the UK’s Online Safety Act “fundamentally flawed”.Phil describes himself as “pretty techie” and says he has managed to limit what his children access on their own phones. But he stresses that this only goes so far. He recalls his son being shown a graphic video of the Charlie Kirk shooting by another child at school. “Someone just put it in front of his face,” Phil says. “You can’t control that.”Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaYoung peopleSmartphonesSocial media ban (UK news)Social media ban (US news)Digital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some of them offer “nudified” photos or videos for a fee: users can upload a photo of any woman, and AI will produce a video of that woman performing sexual acts. Many more offer a feed of images – of celebrities, social media influencers and ordinary women – made nude or made to perform sexual acts by AI. Followers are also using the channels to share tips on available deepfake tools.While there have long been Telegram channelsdedicatedto distributing non-consensual nude images of women, the widespread availability of AI tools means anyone can instantly become the subject of graphic sexual content viewable by millions.On a Russian-language Telegram channel advertising deepfake “blogger leaks” and “celebrity leaks”, a post about an AI nudification Telegram bot promised “a neural network that doesn’t know the word ‘no’”.“Choose positions, shapes and locations. Do everything with her that you can’t do in real life,” it said.‘The chilling effect’: how fear of ‘nudify’ apps and AI deepfakes is keeping Indian women off the internetRead moreOn a Chinese-language Telegram channel with nearly 25,000 subscribers, men shared videos of their “first loves” or their “girlfriend’s best friend”, made to strip using AI.A web of Telegram channels targeted at Nigerian users disseminates deepfakes alongside hundreds of stolen nudes and intimate images.Telegram is a secure messaging app that allows users to create groups or channels to broadcast content to unlimited contacts. Under the platform’sterms of service, users cannot post “illegal pornographic content” on “publicly viewable” channels and bots, or “engage in activities that are recognised as illegal in the majority of countries.”A review of the independent analytics and database serviceTelemetr.io’s data, which has an index of such channels, indicates that Telegram has shut down a number of nudification channels.Telegram told the Guardian that deepfake pornography and the tools to create it are explicitly forbidden by its terms of service, adding that “such content is routinely removed whenever discovered. Moderators empowered with custom AI tools proactively monitor public parts of the platform and accept reports in order to remove content that breaches our terms of service, including encouraging the creation of deepfake pornography.”In its statement Telegram said it removed more than 952,000 pieces of offending material in 2025.In recent weeks, the use of AI tools to create sexualised deepfakes and humiliate women has exploded into public discourse, after Grok, the generative AI chatbot on Elon Musk’s social media platform X, was asked tocreatethousands ofimagesof women in bikinis or minimal clothing, without consent.The resultingoutrageled Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, to announce it would stop allowing Grok to edit pictures of real people into bikinis. The UK’s media regulator, Ofcom, also announced an investigation into X.But there is a reservoir of forums, websites and apps, including Telegram, that allow millions of people easy access to graphic, non-consensual content – and to generate and share this content on demand, without the knowledge of the women who are being violated by it. A report releasedon Tuesdayby the Tech Transparency Project found that dozens of nudification apps are available in the Google Play Store and the Apple App store, and that collectively these have had 705m downloads.View image in fullscreenThe UK’s media watchdog, Ofcom, is conducting a formal investigation into Elon Musk’s X over the use of the Grok AI tool.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAAn Apple spokesperson said the company had removed 28 of the 47 nudification apps identified by the Tech Transparency Project in its investigation, while a Google spokesperson said “most of the apps” on their service had been suspended, and that an investigation was ongoing.Telegram channels are a mainstay of a broader internet ecosystem devoted to creating and disseminating non-consensual intimate images, said Anne Craanen, a researcher focused on gender-based violence at the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue.They allow users to evade the controls of larger platforms such as Google, and to share tips on how to bypass safeguards that prevent AI models from generating this content. But the “dissemination and celebration of this material is another part”, she said. “That circulating it with other men and boasting about it, and that celebration aspect, is also really important. It really shows the misogynistic undertones of it. They’re trying to punish women or silence women.”Last year, Meta shut down anItalian Facebook groupin which men shared intimate images of their partners and unsuspecting women.Before it was removed the group,Mia Moglie(meaning “my wife”), had approximately 32,000 members.However, the investigative newsletterIndicatorfound that Meta had failed to stop the flow of advertisements for AI nudification tools on its platforms, and identified at least 4,431 nudifier ads across its platforms since 4 December last year, though some appeared to be scams. A Meta spokesperson said it removes ads that violate its policies.AI tools have intensified a global rise in online violence against women, allowing almost anyone to make and share abusive images. In many jurisdictions, including much of the global south, few legal routes exist to hold perpetrators accountable. Less than 40% of countries have laws protecting women and girls from cyber-harassment or cyberstalking, according to 2024World Bankdata. TheUN estimatesthat 1.8 billion women and girls still lack legal protection from online harassment and other forms of technology-facilitated abuseLack of regulation is just one reason that women and girls in low-income countries are particularly vulnerable, say campaigners. Issues such as poor digital literacy and poverty can heighten risks. Ugochi Ihe, an associate at TechHer, a Nigeria-based organisation that encourages women and girls to learn and work with technology, says she has come across cases where women borrowing money from loan apps have fallen victim to blackmail from “unscrupulous men using AI. Every day it’s getting more creative with abuse”.The real-life consequences of digital abuse are devastating, including mental health difficulties, isolation and loss of work.“These things are bound to destroy a young girl’s life,” said Mercy Mutemi, a Kenya-based lawyer representing four victims of deepfake abuse. Some of her clients have been denied jobs and subjected to disciplinary hearings at school, she said, all because of deepfake images circulated without their consent.Ihe said her organisation had handled complaints from women who were ostracised by their families after being threatened with nude and intimate images obtained from Telegram channels.“Once it has gone out, there’s no reclaiming your dignity, your identity. Even if the perpetrator comes to say, ‘Oh, that was a deepfake,’ you cannot tell the amount of people that have seen it. The reputational damage is unrecoverable.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentTelegramDeepfakeAI (artificial intelligence)InternetSocial mediaDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what you need to know to navigate the trollingSteve RoseThu 29 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 15.07 ESTShareIt started with an image of Trump as a king mocked up on a fake Time magazine cover. Since then it’s developed into a full-blown phenomenon, one academics are calling “slopaganda” – an unholy alliance of easily available AI tools and political messaging. “Shitposting”, the publishing of deliberately crude, offensive content online to provoke a reaction, has reached the level of “institutional shitposting”, according to Know Your Meme’s editor Don Caldwell. This is trolling as official government communication. And nobody is more skilled at it than the Trump administration – a government that has not only allowed the AI industry all the regulative freedom it desires, but has embraced the technology for its own in-house purposes. Here are 10 of the most significant fake images the White House has put out so far.Trump as king19 February 2025View image in fullscreenDonald Trump as king in a fake Time magazine cover.Illustration: @WhiteHouseThe first AI image posted by the White House X account sets the tone for Trump’s second presidency – marking a turning point in which the shitposting that had been associated with the far-right online culture that brought Trump to power moved from fringe message boards, such as 4chan and Reddit, to mainstream platforms.The image was posted alongside an announcement of the repeal of New York City’s congestion pricing, and leant into fears that Trump would govern as a king. The New York governor, Kathy Hochul,held up the imageat a press conference when she announced that she would defy attempts to block the congestion charge: “New York hasn’t laboured under a king in over 250 years. We sure as hell are not going to start now.” The congestion charge remains in effect.In another post onTruth Socialin October, the president posted an AI video depicting himself as a president-king, crown on head, flying over “No Kings” protesters in a jet fighter and dumping faeces on them. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, defended the post, saying: “The president uses social media to make a point. You can argue that he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media for that. He is using satire to make a point.”Studio Ghibli meme of a woman being deported27 March 2025View image in fullscreenIllustration: @WhiteHouseOpenAI’s Studio Ghibli-inspired meme generator became asensation in March2025, with its uncanny ability to translate any image into the beloved anime studio’s house style (without Studio Ghibli’s permission or approval).The White House applied it to a woman in tears as she was arrested by Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents before being deported. The original photograph, and the woman’s name and alleged crimes, are also included in the post.For Caldwell, this demonstrated just how up to date the White House is with online trends. “They’re hopping on brand-new, fresh memes,” he says. He suspects White House staffers might be regular visitors to Know Your Meme. “The Studio Ghibli meme trend kicked off on March 25 on X; we covered it the following day; and then the White House covered it the day after that.”Trump as Pope3 May 2025View image in fullscreenIllustration: @realDonaldTrumpThis image is proof of Trump’s willingness and ability to insert himself into any conversation, even ones that have nothing to do with him, and shows how effective that can be.Predictably, the image went viral, made global headlines and wasmet with outragefrom Catholic groups and politicians. “There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,” wrote the New York State Catholic Conference. “We just buried our belovedPope Francisand the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.”As so often happens with such shitposting, those who ​took offence were accused of lacking a sense of humour. “They can’t take a joke?” Trump said soon after at a press conference. “You don’t mean the Catholics, you mean the fake news media … the Catholics loved it.”Trump as Jedi4 May 2025View image in fullscreenIllustration: @WhiteHouse/XTrump has been the subject of flattering fan art throughout his political career (remember the digitalTrump trading cards?), but AI has made the job a whole lot easier. On 4 May, the White House crashed Star Wars fans’ special day with this image of the president as a jacked Jedi, lightsaber in hand, garlanded by flags and eagles. Who cares if his lightsaber is the wrong colour (the good guys’ are blue), or that the White House’s claim to be the Rebellion not the Empire rang laughably hollow? This was pure fantasy art.In 2022, one of Trump’s trading cards clumsily grafted his headshot on to a superhero body; last July he was slightly less clumsily grafted on to the body ofSuperman, to gatecrash the launch of the new movie. The same month, the White House portrayed a besuited Trump heroicallystriding into the Colosseum. Fans and allies have generated reams of similar content themselves.Hakeem Jeffries as a Mexican29 October 2025View image in fullscreenIllustration: @WhiteHouseWhy did the White House choose to put the Democratic house leader Hakeem Jeffries and the senate leader Chuck Schumer in sombreros and have them holding plates of tacos? It doesn’t matter. They look a bit silly, and it’s provocatively offensive, and once again, the world’s attention is colonised.The image illustrates how difficult it is to respond to this type of content. It’s part of a running joke, stretching back to a deepfake video Trump posted a month earlier, which slapped a crude sombrero and moustache filter over Jeffries. That video was roundly condemned as offensive and racist , not least by Jeffries himself (who replied by posting a genuine image of Trump with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein) . TheTrump administrationthen doubled down, playing the video on a loop on screens in the White House briefing room for several hours and creating more images in a similar vein, which kept the trolling going.Welcome to the Golden Age1 January 2026View image in fullscreenIllustration: @WhiteHouseFew people outside the Trump administration believe the US is in a “golden age”, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeating the claim. In January, the White Houseposted an AI videoof a golden White House facade behind a shower of gold coins with the text “The White House? She’s in her Golden Age”, backed by Bruno Mars’ track 24K Magic.Even if Trump’s Midas touch is more a figment of his imagination, this type of wishcasting is more effective than it appears. According toone paperby the academics Michał Klincewicz, Mark Alfano and Amir Ebrahimi Fard – who coined the term “slopaganda” – “neural representations of information that were shown to be false continue to influence people’s beliefs and reasoning after being corrected”. In other words, even when you know it’s fake, your brain still kind of believes it.Which Way, Greenland Man?14 January2026View image in fullscreenPhotograph: @WhiteHouseOn the face of it, this seems like a straightforward “Trump wants Greenland” post. However, it has a much darker message.Again, the post is riffing on a popular meme, Caldwell explains: the “dramatic crossroads” image originated with the manga series Yu-Gi-Oh!, and started gaining traction online around 2021.The slogan “Which way, Greenland man?” seems to reference a 1978 neo-Nazi text titled Which Way, Western Man?, in which the white supremacist author William Gayley Simpson called for violence against and the deportation of Jews and Black people, and argued that Hitler was right.“It’s absolutely shocking to see such images being deployed by this administration,”said Heidi Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, which monitors US neo-Nazi groups. “The idea appeals to racists and white supremacists who think only white people should be in positions of power.”In August, the Department of Homeland Securityposteda mock recruitment advert for ICE with an image of Uncle Sam at a crossroads and the slogan: “Which way, American man?” Earlier this month, the US Labor Department posted an image with the slogan: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage”. Critics pointed out that it had overtones of Hitler’s “Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer” (“One people, one realm, one leader”).Stand with ICE Propaganda poster15 January2026View image in fullscreenIllustration: @WhiteHouse“AI is very good at constantly reiterating images from the past, so it can create this nostalgic imagery of traditionalism,” says Daniel de Zeeuw, an assistant professor in digital media culture at the University of Amsterdam. Thus the extremist messages of the present – such as ICE’s militarised policing – can be inserted into more reassuring and familiar graphic styles, such as patriotic recruitment posters,80s action-movie postersor 1950s public information campaigns (as with arecent imageof Trump as a friendly milkman).AI is inherently backward-looking, says de Zeeuw, as it is fed on historical images. This aesthetic is in keeping with the Make America Great Again movement, which is constantly evoking a “better” past. Another stark example was the Department of Homeland Security’s chilling post from last December: an image of a vintage car at a deserted, palm-fringed beach with the slogan “America After 100 Million Deportations”. Ironically, the original was painted by a Japanese artist,Hiroshi Nagai, who complained that it had been used without his permission.The arrest of Nekima Levy Armstrong22 January 2026View image in fullscreenAn image of Nekima Levy Armstrong posted by Kristi Noem (left) and a manipulated image of her posted by the White House.Composite: Guardian Design/@Sec_Noem via X/@WhiteHouse via X“It’s not going to be on Twitter,” said the agent filming the Minneapolis civil rights lawyer Nekima Levy Armstrong, one of the city’smost prominent activists, as she was arrested last Thursday. Within hours, though, it was: the Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem posted a still from the video, in which Armstrong seems composed and shows little emotion.Half an hour later, the White House X account posted a significantly altered version of the same image: this time, Armstrong is exaggeratedly upset, tears streaming down her face. Her skin tone also appears to have been darkened. The image was captioned: “Arrested: far-left agitator Nekima Levy Armstrong for orchestrating church riots in Minnesota.” In fact, Armstrong was demonstrating at a church service led by an allegedly ICE-affiliated pastor, and was later released without charge.Until this moment, the White House’s AI-generated output had been conspicuously outlandish: there was little danger of mistaking it for reality. This image purports to be an authentic photograph – or at least omits to mention that it is not. It is not so much AI-generated trolling as an AI-assisted deepfake.As with Musk’s recently shared Grok tool, which removed women and children’s clothing without their consent, there is also something abusive about it: AI has been used to attempt to humiliate a woman by manipulating her image, to make her look weaker and more distressed than she actually was.The fact that the deepfakery is not all that convincing is part of the point, de Zeeuw thinks. “What is being communicated here is the falsification itself: you’re showing your ability to falsify images, to falsify evidence.”After the fakery had been called out, the White House deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr posted the response: “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.”The Nihilistic Penguin23 January 2026View image in fullscreenIllustration: @WhiteHouseIn response to this image of Trump and a penguin walking towards a Greenland flag, some observers pointed out that penguins actually live at the south pole. But that’s missing the point of these types of post, says Robert Topinka, a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London. “People continue to interpret them as if they’re meant to be a legitimate claim, or an argument or a piece of evidence, but they’re emotional hooks.” Their purpose is to stir up the base. “White House staffers have said they use AI because it’s the fastest way to get content out. It’s not the fastest way to say something that’s true; it’s the fastest way to push their propaganda.”To those in the know, this is a riff on the “nihilist penguin” meme, which has gone viral on TikTok in the past few weeks. It’s based on a scene from Werner Herzog’s 2007 documentary Encounters at the End of the World, in which one penguin inexplicably separates from the colony and wanders off towards the Antarctic interior, and certain death. “But why?” Herzog wonders. Many have asked the same of Trump’s quixotic attempts to acquire Greenland.The image resonates with what Naomi Klein and ​Astra Taylor ​christened “end times fascism”, says De Zeeuw, where tech industry leaders and their enablers are almost willing the end of the world as we know it, striding towards oblivion like Trump and his penguin companion. “It’s like they know they’re moving toward the end, but they do so joyfully.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpAI (artificial intelligence)Trump administrationUS politicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)featuresShareReuse this content"

For realistic deepfakes, visible labels are required.“High-impact AI”, including systems used formedical diagnosis, hiring and loan approvals, will require operators to conduct risk assessments and document how decisions are made. If a human makes the final decision the system may fall outside the category.Extremely powerful AI models will require safety reports, but the threshold is set so high that government officials acknowledge no models worldwide currently meet it.Companies that violate the rules face fines of up to 30m won (£15,000), but the government has promised a grace period of at least a year before penalties are imposed.The legislation is being billed as the “world’s first” to be fully enforced by a country, and central to South Korea’s ambition to become one of the world’s three leading AI powers alongside the US and China. Government officials maintain the law is 80-90% focused on promoting industry rather than restricting it.Alice Oh, a computer science professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), said that while the law was not perfect, it was intended to evolve without stifling innovation. Howevera surveyin December from the Startup Alliance found that 98% of AI startups were unprepared for compliance. Its co-head, Lim Jung-wook, said frustration was widespread. “There’s a bit of resentment,” he said. “Why do we have to be the first to do this?”Companies must self-determine whether their systems qualify as high-impact AI, a process critics say is lengthy and creates uncertainty.They also warn of competitive imbalance: all Korean companies face regulation regardless of size, while only foreign firms meeting certain thresholds – such as Google and OpenAI – must comply.The push for regulation has unfolded against a uniquely charged domestic backdrop that has left civil society groups worried the legislation does not go far enough.South Korea accountsfor 53% of all global deepfake pornography victims, according to a 2023 report by Security Hero, a US-based identity protection firm. In August 2024, an investigationexposed massive networks of Telegram chatroomscreating and distributing AI-generated sexual imagery of women and girls, foreshadowingthe scandalthat would later erupt around Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot.The law’s origins, however, predate this crisis, with the first AI-related bill submitted to parliament in July 2020. It stalled repeatedly in part due to provisions that were accused of prioritising industry interests over citizen protection.Civil society groups maintain that the new legislation provides limited protection for people harmed by AI systems.Four organisations, including Minbyun, a collective of human rights lawyers, issued a joint statement the day after it was implemented arguing the law contained almost no provisions to protect citizens from AI risks.The groups noted that while the law stipulated protection for “users”, those users were hospitals, financial companies and public institutions that use AI systems, not people affected by AI. The law established no prohibited AI systems, they argued, and exemptions for “human involvement” created significant loopholes.The country’s human rights commissionhas criticisedthe enforcement decree for lacking clear definitions of high-impact AI, noting that those most likely to suffer rights violations remain in regulatory blind spots.In a statement, the ministry of science and ICT said it expected the law to “remove legal uncertainty” and build “a healthy and safe domestic AI ecosystem”, adding that it would continue to clarify the rules through revised guidelines.Experts said South Korea had deliberately chosen a different path from other jurisdictions.Unlike the EU’s strict risk-based regulatory model, the US and UK’s largely sector-specific, market-driven approaches, or China’s combination of state-led industrial policy and detailed service-specific regulation, South Korea has opted for a more flexible, principles-based framework, said Melissa Hyesun Yoon, a law professor at Hanyang University who specialises in AI governance.That approach is centred on what Yoon describes as “trust-based promotion and regulation”.“Korea’s framework will serve as a useful reference point in global AI governance discussions,” she said.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaAI (artificial intelligence)Asia PacificComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Microsoft had less to show for its billions spentThu 29 Jan 2026 14.11 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 14.29 ESTShareBig tech earnings so far this week have sent a clear warning: investors are willing to overlook soaring spending onartificial intelligenceif it fuels strong growth, but are quick to punish companies that fall short.The contrast was clear in Thursday’s stock market reaction to earnings fromMicrosoftandMeta, highlighting how dramatically the stakes have changed since the launch ofChatGPTstarted theAIboom more than three years ago.Shares of theInstagramparent surged more than 9% on strong sales, while those of Microsoft slumped 10% after its cloud business failed to impress.“The market appears to be questioning whether these massive capital expenditure hikes will generate sufficient returns,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. “This reflects a growing divide between tech companies’ AI ambitions and Wall Street’s patience for open-ended investment cycles.”After riding its first-mover advantage with OpenAI to become the world’s most valuable firm in 2024,Microsoftis now under growing investor pressure to justify its soaring capital outlay.Microsoft reported revenue growth in its Azure cloud-computing business that was only slightly above expectations.In contrast, AI bolstered ad targeting at Meta, boosting revenue by 24% in the December quarter and aiding a rosy first-quarter forecast. The results show that theFacebookowner’s gains from AI were helping fund its capital spending, which is expected to jump as much as 87% to $135bn this year.“Meta’s headline numbers are a really interesting reflection of the market’s attitude toward spending in the AI space,” said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.“All else equal, the market would typically be concerned, but they have a big revenue guide for the first quarter.”Microsoft also faced pressure after a disclosure that OpenAI, its prized holding, accounts for 45% of its cloud backlog. Investors are worried that some $280bn could be at risk as the unprofitable startup loses momentum in the AI race.The ChatGPT creator had issued an internal “code red” in December after Google’s Gemini 3 launched to positive reviews and is playing catch-up in AI coding to Anthropic’s Claude Code, which has hit an annualized run rate of more than $1bn.“Microsoft’s deep ties to OpenAI underpin its leadership in enterprise AI, but they also introduce concentration risk,” said Zavier Wong, market analyst at eToro.Microsoft predicted Azure growth to stay stable in the period from January to March at 37% to 38%, after slowing in the last three months of 2025, partly due to AI chip capacity constraints.“If I had taken the graphics processing units that just came online in the first quarter and second quarter, and allocated them all to Azure, the KPI [growth] would have been over 40%,” Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said on a post-earnings call.She added that the use of chips for internal development efforts had limited the growth.For Meta, the revenue growth underscored that its AI pivot was paying off and helping the company catch up to early leaders.Its revenue rose 24% in the fourth quarter, and Meta forecast growth to accelerate as much as 33% in the current quarter.The company is racking up bills at large cloud providers, such as Alphabet’s Google, which bodes well for the search giant’s results next week. Alphabet shares rose 1.6%.Using AI “will both improve the quality of the organic experience and of advertising”, Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said.“I think that will have a compounding effect,” he added, as Meta predicted a jump of 43% in total expenses this year to $169bn.Growing spending was also the theme at Elon Musk’s Tesla, which will double outlay this year to more than $20bn as it pivots to AI, humanoid robots and personal vehicles that can drive themselves.The company also reported quarterly profit and revenue that were above expectations, though its yearly profit and revenue had declined for the first time ever. Shares rose by 2.9%.Analysts said the results left some mismatch between corporate AI goals and investors’ demand for payoffs.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyMicrosoftMetaFacebookInstagramQuarterly resultsAI (artificial intelligence)analysisShareReuse this content"

It is hard not to be compelled, and appalled, bysomeone like Alex Honnold. Evenwithropes, a single wrong move can mean death in mountaineering, a mad activity that puts you at the full mercy of nature. You cannot help but wonder what kind of person willingly chooses this: what kind of person looks at a towering cliff face, or a wall of wind-whipped ice, and thinks, I bet I can get up there.Aava, Cairn’s protagonist, is that kind of person: a champion climber, a woman who has conquered summit after summit, but for some reason can’t walk away. Before her stands Mount Kami, an ice-tipped, Himalayan-style peak that has never before been climbed. Kami was once home to a tribe of people, whose remnants you find as you pull yourself up each section of the mountain, but now you are very much alone. Controlling Aava’s limbs, you move her hands and feet towards imperfections in the rock, jamming her fingers into cracks and her toes on to tiny ledges. You quickly learn to read the mountain, as Aava would.View image in fullscreenImpossibly brave … Aava rests on Mount Kami in Cairn.Photograph: The Game BakersDespite the absence of real-life peril, Cairn makes your heart race and your mouth go dry. When Aava’s limbs start shaking and she starts breathing more urgently, you know she’s not secure on the cliff face; you’d better reposition her feet fast, or take a gamble and try to screw a piton and clip in before she loses her grip. And you have limited life-saving pitons, so you’d better conserve them. At one point I was stuck halfway up a bare rock face after climbing all night, with no pitons left and no respite in sight in any direction, and I had to perform a terrifically stressful 10-minute climb towards a cave without putting a foot wrong. I got desperate right at the end and Aava nearly slipped as she pulled herself up on to the final ledge. I had to put the controller down and do some deep breathing before I could continue.In this respect, Cairn is a wonderful survival game. It feels perilous, as it should. In addition to managing Aava’s hand and footholds, you have to manage her backpack, scavenging, foraging, trying to find water wherever you can (tip: keep every bottle you find). You must laboriously bandage her ruined fingers to preserve her grip, when you get a moment to rest. And with that sense of danger and suffering comes a sense of accomplishment, when you prevail. The relief that I felt whenever I found a safe point where Aava could set up her tent was intoxicating.As hours pass and conditions get worse on the mountain, Aava’s obsession with conquering Kami starts to feel not just impossibly brave but self-destructive. Cleverly, the game invites you to question why she’s doing this – and whyyou’redoing it. Especially towards the end, this is not an easy game (though you can always turn on some assists to make it less pitiless if you want). There were sections where I fell off the mountain over and over, failing to find a good route, parched and starving. Dangling from the rope for the 15th time, I became immensely frustrated with myself, and Aava voices her own frustration every time you fumble a hold. I should probably have walked away and taken a break for a while, but Aava’s stubborn determination was rubbing off on me.Cairn, as much as a game about climbing and nature, turns out to be a game about what it takes to be the kind of person Aava is – and the cost. I was floored by the ending, which had me crying on my sofa at one in the morning. There were many moments of beauty and terror during my ascent that left me quietly awestruck. That awe, in the end, was proportional to the hardship.Cairn is out 29 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsGamesPCPlayStation 5XboxMountaineeringreviewsShareReuse this content"

Despite the authorities cutting off communications and destroying evidence, it is clear that a regime never reluctant to shed its citizens’ blood has done sowith unprecedented zeal, sensing anunprecedented threatfrom unrest across the country, challenging not only its policies but its very existence.Officials have reported 3,000 deaths, but human rights groups have tallied many more, and a network of medical professionalshas estimatedthat 30,000 could have been killed. Security forces shot people dead as theyfled a fireand arearresting doctors for helping the wounded.Alongside the fury at this vengeful regime is anger at another leader: Donald Trump, who urged Iraniansto keep protestingand promised them that “help is on its way” – thenplayed downthe slaughter. Now the US president haswarned via social mediathat “a massive Armada is heading to Iran”, and that “the next attack will be far worse” thanOperation Midnight Hammer, the US strike on nuclear sites last summer. Iran’s muted response, and its weakening over the last year, has emboldened him, as has his seizure of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, referenced in his post. But protesters were forgotten: instead his demand was “NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS”.Mr Trump is notoriously unpredictable: in his first term, he called off an attack on Iran 10 minutes before it happened. But his newfound interventionism has wrenched the spotlight from the Epstein files, and Iran threats distract from Immigration and Customs Enforcement brutality at home and his climbdown over Greenland. Iran is afar more popular targetthanDenmarkamong his base.Many Iran analysts now see a“zombie state”– unable to ensure even a basic standard of living or to defend its sovereignty; apparently unable to renew itself; but as tyrannical as it is frail. However, military intervention could come at huge human cost and would not bring democracy – even if that were Mr Trump’s aim. More likely would be the emergence of a strongman, perhaps from the Revolutionary Guard, orregime collapseand chaos. If he were serious about non-proliferation, the best hope – albeit now harder than ever – would be to seek a revised version of the JCPOA deal which he did the most todestroy.Israel sees a weakened, chaotic Iran as in its interests. Turkey, Saudi Arabia and others are trying to hold the US back because they fear a strengthened Israel, a surge in migration and instability in a region attempting to sell itself as a dependable investment. As weakened as it is, a cornered regime couldstill do damage– particularly in the strait of Hormuz, a critical artery for global trade – if it believes that inaction would only make it look an easier target. Economic concerns seem more likely to shift Mr Trump than humanitarian considerations.The EU on Thursday designated the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist entity – a largely symbolic measure given the extent of existing sanctions. Governments can and shouldpress for a moratorium on executions, support attempts to reconnect Iranians with the internet, and fund NGOs documenting abuses. In the longer term they should consider how to supportcivil societyand help to strengthen it. They should also provide safe passage to activists whose lives are in danger. Military intervention is not the answer – but neither is indifference to the suffering of Iranian civilians.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We need to have this discussion.”Removing US as World Cup host would be eminently sad – and entirely justified | Alexander AbnosRead moreMeanwhile, Fifa’s disgraced former president Sepp Blatter, long the sport’s amoral center, now almost 90 years old and never one to pass up the opportunity to take a swing at his successor, further undermined this World Cup. On Monday, heendorsed commentsby a former Fifa anti-corruption lawyer –breaks fourth wall to glance directly into the camera with a smirk– to “avoid the United States!”The heads of about 20 European soccer federationsdiscussed the possibilityof a boycott. And between Donald Trump’s threats against Greenland, his administration’s actions in Venezuela, his various travel bans, and killings by federal agents during his immigration crackdown, clearly some kind of international rebuttal is called for. But whether soccer’s authorities are really in any position to do so is questionable. And the cost and ramifications of a potential boycott should be fully thought through.For one thing, it’s worth considering who will actually be punished. It’s doubtful that Trump cares enough about the World Cup to save it from a would-be boycott by backing down on the policies mentioned above. If there were no longer a margin in it for him, he’d likely do much the same ashe will with the upcoming Super Bowl: dismiss it, ignore it, and move on.The Trump administration, then, probably wouldn’t be materially hurt by aWorld Cupboycott. It may be embarrassed, but then is that even something it is capable of or cares about? The oligarch class that keeps Trump in power wouldn’t really be damaged either, as they have no significant stake in the thing – Fifa gets the lion’s share of the proceeds.Fifa would certainly be affected, but probably not as much as you’d expect. It will surely still make its broadcast income, and the sponsorship money, and it has already collected huge amounts of the ticket revenue it stands to make. It would be egg on the organization’s face, sure, but they also seem to have moved on from such quaint considerations some time ago.The influencer World Cup: Fifa and the TikTok deal targeting an avalanche of postsRead moreIn the end, the brunt would be borne by the boycotting teams and their fans, who don’t get to play in, or watch, a World Cup with their country in it. And, more directly, the many people who would work the tournament and benefit from the tourism it will generate. This may be a small price to pay in the grand scheme of things, but only if a boycott actually has any sort of effect.Which, well, let’s return for a moment to Göttlich and his deep cut to the Olympic boycotts, when the US and much of the west snubbed the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow over the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan. The USSR and much of the Eastern Bloc then counter-boycotted LA in 1984. Neither boycott accomplished very much at all, other than political posturing. The Soviets would not withdraw from Afghanistan until 1989. Yet two Olympics were pretty much spoiled. Lots of athletes lost their chance to compete, while others had their accomplishments affixed with a massive asterisk.To hold up the Olympic boycotts as some sort of paradigm for how withholding participation in a sporting event can be wielded as an effective political tool is ahistorical.There have hardly been any boycotts in the context of the World Cup. Defending champions Uruguay refused to go to Italy for the 1934 World Cup because so few European countries had showed up when it hosted the inaugural edition four years earlier. In 1938, Uruguay and Argentina sat out afteran incident involving Peruat the 1936 Berlin Olympics. African countries boycotted the 1966 World Cup in protest over their continent getting just one-third of a berth, to be shared with Asia and Oceania – successfully, as Africa got a full berth in 1970. And the USSR refused to play a qualifier against Chile for the 1974 World Cup after the overthrow of socialist president Salvador Allende.For some reason, the community that orbits the global game feels a ceaseless compunction for football to affect the wider world in a positive way. It’s a noble notion, a kind of immutable idealism that runs deep through a fundamentally cynical sport. The trouble is that in this case, there really isn’t much a hand to be played. An administration unconstrained by convention, aspirations of global leadership, or diplomatic politesse probably won’t be bothered about a bunch of countries staying away from a World Cup.All the better to show up and lodge your protest in person. Nobody will hear you if you’re not there to speak up.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on 12 May. You canpreorder it here.

I totally get itDave SchillingThe actor was promoting her new lingerie line – and in 2026, marketing requires more than a glossy adThu 29 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 10.12 ESTShareIwould hate to have to launch a new product in 2026. Imagine a scenario where you’ve developed some ingenious new widget that costs millions of dollars to design, produce and bring to market. You could have quit numerous times. You probably wanted to, because there’s a new season of The Traitors and you have to catch up. But you never surrendered. You persevered, and your brilliant invention is ready for the world. All you have to do now is convince a society besieged by a nonstop cavalcade of crises to care.If the US government could kindly stop sending paramilitary forces to occupy major cities, that would be great for my brand.This is the predicament faced by poor Sydney Sweeney, the actor best known for HBO’s Euphoria and the recent film The Housemaid. This week, Sweeney debuted a new lingerie line called “Syrn”. I presume it’s meant to be pronounced “siren”, since that’s a suitably sultry-sounding name. Also, confusing, which might be part of the brilliant marketing plan behind the launch. If you baffle enough people, they’ll be sure to Google you to seewhat your damn problem is anyway. If I was the marketing lead on this project, I would have suggested “Syren”, since that at least has a real vowel in it, like most actual words. Unfortunately, “Syren” was thename of a Confederate blockaderunner during the civil war, which we (andvery particularly Sydney Sweeney) would probably want to avoid associating with.The lingerie line emphasizes sizes for all body types, allowing women the freedom and comfort of bras that are designed for their physical realities. Sweeneyissued a press releasein which she said: “I wanted to create a place where women can move between all the different versions of who we are. I love working on cars, I go water skiing, I’ll dress up for the red carpet then go home to snuggle my dogs. I’m not one thing, no woman is.” I’m far from an expert here, so forgive me if I ask how often women go water skiing in lingerie? Perhaps I’m just not invited to these events.The Hollywood sign at 100: how a hillside ad became an enduring monumentRead moreRegardless of the state of my social calendar, these are noble goals, ones that I’m sure Sweeney legitimately cares about. She speaks eloquently in her statement about the frustrations of being a young woman unable to find undergarments that fit her properly. Unfortunately, theBlack Mirror-style worldwe live in is dictated by attention and how much you can generate by endlessly pedaling on the metaphorical stationary bike of social media. On top of that desperation for “impressions” (the number of people not just interacting with your posts, but also just plain old looking at them for a split second), you throw on the variety of catastrophes that dominate the news cycle. Good luck releasinga movie about the horrific injustices of impersonal, dispassionate, AI law enforcement! I’ve gotten my fill from the real thing, thank you.Now, try to launch a bra line fronted by a celebrity many of us got sick of around the time she wasaccused of advocating for eugenicsin a jeans advert. Naturally, panic sets in, and the need for ahigh-value stuntbecomes paramount. Sydney Sweeney’sstunt of choicewas heading up to the Hollywood sign in the hills of Los Angeles, climbing it and decorating the area with bras. The Hollywood chamber of commerce hasvoiced displeasure; according to theLos Angeles Times, Sweeney had permission to film in the area, but filming the sign itself requires a license – and climbing it isn’t permitted.The days of taking out a glossy ad in a magazine to announce a new venture are over. You have to do things of questionable legality to get anyone to notice you. It’s not enough to be a successful movie star with a massive social media following. You have to leave your underwear lying around in public. I’ve tried that, and let me tell you, it only gets attention from your local mental health service providers.As you all know, I’m not famous enough to do such things. I’m just a regular guy who orders fast food through a smartphone app so I don’t have to put clothes on to go to a drive-thru. But I still need attention. I need to promote this article, so people read it. I write about things like Sydney Sweeney’s underwear in order to ensure you’ll notice. I wake up every morning hoping someone will care about what I’m doing. If they don’t, I’ll get washed away in the tide of the numerous, far more important things that are happening on the planet every hour.In that respect, how different am I from Sydney Sweeney, or any other glittering media personality? I might not be sharing a yacht with Jeff Bezos or bathing in hundred-dollar bills, but I have the same inherent need to keep up with the ebb and flow of the modern world’s unquenchable thirst for eyeballs and earholes. She perpetrated this stunt for the purposes of getting people like me to write about it, which in turn hopefully encourages you, the audience, to buy her lingerie. I’ve been ensnared by the same cruel bear trap of need that restricts us all. The only question is, will I ever become desperate enough to saw off my own leg to escape?Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsSydney SweeneyOpinionAdvertisingcommentShareReuse this content"

In the winter of despair, it was a day of the vile and a night of the obscene. It was a tale of two films, one featuring the stark killing of a protester on a cold Minneapolis street and the other starringMelania Trumpstriking poses in a “documentary” shown at a private screening at the White House.Throughout the day of Saturday 24 January videos of the killing by ICE agents of Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse at the Veterans Administration hospital, on a street inMinneapoliswere broadcast endlessly on TV news channels and seen by tens of millions online. The videos clearly showed Pretti with his phone in his hand, holding his hands up as he approached ICE agents who had pepper-sprayed a woman. He was coming to her aid, a Good Samaritan. The ICE agents instantly attacked him. One frame of a video shows one agent with his gun drawn, pointed at Pretti’s back as he fell, hands still in the air. Agents appear to have shot him 10 times in five seconds.The videos plainly refuted the falsehoods instantly contrived byTrump administrationofficials. Pretti, as it happened, had been legally carrying a gun in his waistband, which there is no evidence he tried to wield. Despite the facts apparent from multiple videos, Donald Trump declared that “ICE patriots” had to “protect themselves”, and that the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, and Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, were “inciting insurrection”, attempting to assert a predicate for his invocation of the Insurrection Act.Two are dead in Minneapolis. Trump is to blame | Kenneth RothRead moreThe senior border patrol officer Gregory Bovino, officially known as the commander-at-large, who had been directing operations in the city as he had elsewhere, claimed that Pretti intended to “massacre law enforcement” and that the ICE agents were the “victims”. Stephen Miller, the ultimate authority in the White House issuing orders on ICE operations, called Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and an “assassin”. His accusations were dutifully echoed byKristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, who also said that Pretti was guilty of “domestic terrorism”. These falsehoods were used goods taken off the shelf. Their condemnation of Pretti was exactly the same as their malign characterization of Renee Nicole Good, the 37-year-old mother of three murdered on 7 January in Minneapolis at point-blank range as she was driving away from a protest, saying “I’m not mad at you,” as her last words before an ICE agent suddenly shot her in the head and chest.Trump dispatched Tom Homan, his so-called “border czar”, to investigate the Pretti incident. Homan’s re-emergence in a significant public role finally concludes his withdrawal into a subterranean version of the witness protection program after MS Nowrevealedon 20 September 2025 that the FBI had recorded him receiving a paper bag marked from the Cava restaurant chain containing $50,000 in cash from FBI agents posing as contractors seeking federal largesse. Homan has denied any wrongdoing. Trump’s Department of Justice refused to pursue the case. Homan is Trump’s idea of someone to get to the bottom of a Trump administration cover-up.If Homan has the slightest desire for restoring any credibility, he might begin his investigation into the Pretti killing by speaking with a physician who was an eyewitness and interacted with the ICE agents afterwards. From his apartment window, the doctor stated in a swornaffidavitabout Pretti: “I did not see him attack the agents or brandish a weapon of any kind. Suddenly an ICE agent shoved him to the ground … I saw at least four ICE agents point guns at the man. I then saw the agents shoot the man at least six or seven times.” The doctor ran outside. “I informed the ICE agents that I am a physician, and I asked to assess the victim. At first, the ICE agents wouldn’t let me through … none of the ICE agents who were near the victim were performing CPR.” Instead, “the ICE agents appeared to be counting his bullet wounds.” Finally, the doctor was allowed to approach the body and found no pulse. His affidavit ends: “I worry that I or someone I love will be shot and killed for voicing their displeasure and being in the wrong place at the wrong time.”If Stephen Miller represents Trump’s unrestrained cruelty, Greg Bovino has represented Stephen Miller’s. After the uproar, Bovino was at last removed from Minneapolis. It was reported he wouldleave his roleas commander-at-large. But he was only following orders. Bovino is the fall guy with a story to tell if and when there is a Congress that wants to hear it.Bovino had been dispatched from city to city in charge of ICE operations, ostensibly to round up “the worst of the worst” of criminal illegal aliens. In truth, it seems he was tasked with what Hannah Arendt calls “artificial creation of civil war conditions”, in The Origins of Totalitarianism. “For the movement, organized violence is the most efficient of the many protective walls which surround its fictitious world,” she wrote “is as important to the integrity of the fictitious world of the organization as the fear of its terror.”To that end, Bovino had cultivated his image for propaganda purposes just as carefully as former beauty queen Kristi Noem adjusts her outfits. He has been highly conscious of how he presented himself as a paramilitary fashion plate for what he calls his “turn and burn” raids. Bovino is the only one on an ICE raid who does not mask his face, so that he is the only personification of Trump’s brutal tactics. He poses in his photo on his Twitter/X in tactical gear holding an M4 rifle with a telescopic sight. He throws teargas canisters at protesters in front of the cameras. He is rather short, about 5ft 4in tall, with a fade crewcut spiked with hair gel. He wears a full-length dark military coat with bulky square shoulders, a high collar and decorated with military-like patches to attempt to project an intimidating presence.Governor Gavin Newsom needled him as “dressed up literally as if he went on eBay and purchased SS garb” andcalledhim “Gestapo Greg”. Bovino took the bait, attempting to turn Newsom’s barb into a macho competition, replying that Newsom had “coat envy”. That gave Newsom the opportunity for another round to ridicule Bovino, “too small for me, munchkin,” adding: “Oh, and I’m not a wanna-be Nazi.”When Bovino launched Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago last September, he flamboyantly marched through downtown, rode armed in a boat down the Chicago River and freelytolda reporter that he ordered ICE agents to arrest people based on “how they look”. Bovino elaborated to the reporter, who was white: “How do they look compared to, say, you? What’s your name again?” “Chip,” replied the journalist. “Chip? Hey, Chip, you or other folks,” Bovinoexplained. “How do they appear in relation to what you or other people look like?”America has reached a tipping point on fascism – and on opposition to it | Robert ReichRead moreBovino claimed he was hit by a rock thrown by a protester, which forced him to use teargas without warning in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago with a large Mexican immigrant population during a children’s Halloween parade. “If I had more CS gas, I would have deployed it,” he said. He admitted later in adepositionthat he had been “confused” and “mixed up” in his contradictory testimony about violence against ICE. On 7 November 2025, a US district court judge in Illinois,Sara Ellis,saidthat Bovino was “evasive” and “outright lying” in his testimony and issued an additional injunction limiting ICE’s use of force. She also ordered him to wear a body camera.Jenn Budd, a former border patrol senior agent, described Bovino as “the Liberace of the Border Patrol” in a profile of him in theChicago Sun-Times. “He’s just a little Napoleon who wants you to think that he is a hero and the most moral and capable guy in the world, and everything around you is dangerous. But he’s the one who’s going to save you. It’s all a show for him.”As part of Operation Midway Blitz, theUS attorney’s officebrought 31 non-immigration criminal cases to court. To date, there have been zero convictions.When Bovino moved his show from Chicago to New Orleans last December for what he billed as Operation Catahoula Crunch, he boasted on X: “The Big Easy is the Big Hard for illegal aliens.” Then a local reporter zoomed in on his video camera to capture thetext messageshe was sending on his phone. “Kind of cool we are a massive wrecking crew. The idiots can’t do anything to us … I can’t understand why DHS is hiding us when we are handing them strategy on a silver platter,” Bovino wrote to someone called “Diz”.Unfortunately, Bovino’s agents made only 38 arrests during their much publicized first four days in New Orleans. Only nine had criminal records. “Diz” worried in a text to Bovino that he needed to spin his image to cover for the meager results. “You need to do interviews. Fox and friends wants you. We will come up for a talking point on the low numbers.” Bovino had frequently used Fox News and its digital platforms as his bulletin board.The “low numbers”, however, remained a persistent problem through the end of 2025. Of the people detained by ICE, only 5% had violent convictions, fewer than the 6% with traffic tickets, and 73% with no criminal convictions at all, according to theCato Institute. “In its posts on this subject, DHS and ICE often include people with pending criminal charges as ‘criminal arrests,’ even though these people have never been found guilty, and the charges are often minor and regularly dismissed. ICE is depriving these people of due process by arresting them prior to a conviction.”After New Orleans, Bovino moved on to Minneapolis, which he labeled Operation Metro Surge. By the day of the lethal shooting of Alex Pretti, ICE and the border patrol had deployed more than 3,000 agents. Bovino went on TV to retail the story that Pretti was about to “massacre law enforcement”. “So good job for our law enforcement in taking him down before he was able to do that,” hesaid.During the day Pretti was killed, Trump blamed “Democrat ensued chaos”, accused Walz and Frey of “inciting insurrection” and posted a picture of Pretti’s handgun claiming it was “loaded ... and ready to go”. Trump had previouslyblamedRenee Nicole Good for her own killing – “a professional agitator”.Within hours of Pretti’s killing, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, undoubtedly at Trump’s instigation, sent aletterto Walz accusing him of fostering “lawlessness”, and demanding he turn over to the Trump administration “all of Minnesota’s records on Medicaid and Food and Nutrition Service Program”, repeal the state’s sanctuary policies, and deliver to the justice department the state’s voter rolls. The last demand reflected a longstanding rightwing conspiracy theory that Democrats win elections through voter fraud and specifically a corollary of Trump’s big lie, his false claim that he won Minnesota in 2016, 2020 and 2024, when in fact he had lost. Getting control of the voter rolls would open the door to vote tampering in the midterm elections of 2026.Masked thugs, sneering elites and terrified citizens: a picture of the US today. We used to have a name for this | Marina HydeRead moreThe night that Pretti was killed, his body lying in a morgue, a gala event was staged at the White House – a private premiere of Melania, a “documentary” before its public debut the next week at the newly renamed Donald J Trump Kennedy Center. Melania could not be shown in the White House screening room, which Trump had torn down along with the rest of the East Wing. A special pop-up theater was built within the White House with a giant screen just for the occasion.Jeff Bezos of Amazon provided $40m to produce Melania, a pittance in tribute to receive munificent contracts and dispensations. His space company, Blue Origin, received a $2.3bn contract in April, and retains a $3.4bn Nasa lunar lander contract. Amazon has kicked in $1m for Trump’s grandiose ballroom. To promote Melania, Amazon will spend $35m in advertising, according to a report inPuck. Already, an image of Melania has been projected on The Sphere in Las Vegas.Melania Trump hand-picked Brett Ratner as the director of Melania, marking his comeback after six women in Hollywood, including the actor Olivia Munn,accusedthe director and producer of sexual harassment and misconduct in 2017. (No charges were filed and he has strenuously denied all the accusations.)As theguestsarrived the Marine Corps Band played Melania’s Waltz, from the film. There was, among them, Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, Queen Rania of Jordan, and Erika Kirk; the Amazon execs Mike Hopkins and Andy Jassy; the Zoom CEO, Eric Yuan, the New York Stock Exchange CEO, Lynn Martin, and Mike Tyson. Each guest was given gifts of a limited-edition popcorn box and a framed ticket of the event.Not a word about the day’s killing was mentioned to disturb the joyous festivities. That night, Melania enabled the Trump White House to grace Bovino’s style of violence with the glamor of indifference. The spirit of the evening had been captured by the slogan that appeared on the back of the jacket that Melania wore in 2018 to a Texas detention center that housed children separated from their immigrant parents under a Trump policy: “I really don’t care, do u?”Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

The bill they approvedcontained noneof their party’s “commonsense”reforms, such as prohibition of masks and the requirement that agents obtain a judicial warrant before busting down a person’s door – not just an administrative warrant signed by the same agency invading the home. This last “reform”, which the Republican party rejected, is the soul of the fourth amendment, without which no one is safe anywhere from the state’s intrusion.After the second killing, these Congress members hustled to cover their butts. “I failed to view the DHS funding vote as a referendum on the illegal and immoral conduct of ICE in Minneapolis,” the New York representative Tom Suozzisaid in a statement. He promised to do better next time. The Texas representative Vicente Gonzalezexplained, with equal credibility, that his yes vote “was not to fund ICE”, but “to ensure that our agencies here in south Texas were funded”. Would those agencies include the border patrol? He didn’t say.Two are dead in Minneapolis. Trump is to blame | Kenneth RothRead moreSeveral of the shamefaced seven said they had to fund the government, no matter how morally corrupt, because a government shutdown would be worse.With the bill under Senate consideration, apartial shutdownnow appearslikely, with the Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer,vowingthat his caucus will reject any funding bill that includes money for DHS without key restrictions. What’s more, snow and ice covering half the states may prevent House members from returning to Washington to revote on an amended package should the Senate manage to pass one. Congress has until Friday night to get it done.Which raises the question: how bad would a government shutdown be? Put another way, is the federal government we have more harmful than no government at all?The answer is yes.It’s been noted that a shutdown would not slow ICE down; it has a big slush fund to tide it over. Of course, shutdowns hurt people: federal workers who go without pay, families depending on food stamps, consequences each side spins differently. But the answer is still yes, for two reasons.First, aside from sending heavily armed thugs into the streets, courts, hospitals and schools, the government we have does little for the public good and much to its detriment.Its so-called “department of government efficiency” has fired 300,000 civil servants and reduced every benign function of government to penury and ineffectuality – withno real reductionin spending or improvement in efficiency.It has used the remaining social benefits, from food stamps to Fema, as instruments of extortion and punishment,selectively against blue statesand institutions it perceives to be hostile to the president’s agenda.It has looted the treasury fordate-night plane rides, extravagantoffice renovations,hundreds of prosecutionsagainst the president’s personal enemies, and fat contracts and other indulgences handed out in return forgenerosityand fealty to the crown. It is working on sinking the mighty US economy.Let us not forget, moreover, what else Congress is voting to bankroll. There’s the Pentagon’s$839bnbudget,$33.8mof which is disappearing daily into US operations in Venezuela; health and human services, led by a maniac apparently bent on bringing back preventable fatal childhood diseases; and labor, which is among agencies that haveposted tropes associated with white supremacistsonline and whoseNational Labor Relations Board, after a year idled by the lack of a quorum, is now fully staffed and primed to roll back all the gains unions have made since the New Deal. Et cetera.Reason No 2 was best expressed 250 years ago, in the Declaration of Independence:[The king]has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.He has“protect[ed] them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States”.TheTrump administrationis waging war against its own citizens. It is no longer leading a legitimate government of, for, or by the people.Unlike such “commonsense” reforms as not nullifying the fourth amendment, the Congressional Progressive caucus is pressing the Democrats to demand “real reforms” of ICE and the border patrol, whose personnel and functions are now virtually indistinguishable. The caucus’s demands include the feds’ withdrawal from Minneapolis and all other cities, now or in the future, and an end to mass arrests and arrest quotas.But the party’s base – and Americans in general – have already decided that these agencies are irredeemable. AYouGov pollconducted on 24 January, the day Pretti died, found that more voters support than oppose abolishing the agency. The abolitionists include three-quarters of Democrats and nearly half of independents; among Democrats only 15% oppose the agency’s elimination. Even 19% of Republicans want ICE melted, up from 9% inJune.And this shutdown would be about more than ICE.A budget is the quantitative expression of priorities. A shutdown – the refusal to approve a budget – is the rejection of those priorities, and a chance for the minority party to showcase its own. This is no ordinary shutdown, however. The terms are not just X dollars for this or Y dollars for that, even when X is something as critical as affordable healthcare or as deadly as ICE.The Guardian view on a second ICE killing in Minneapolis: midnight in America | EditorialRead moreNor is this just a fight between Democrats and Republicans. The left has already positioned it inside a bigger struggle. The consensus on abolishing ICE is the product of thousands of cellphone videos documenting the crimes of the government – the result of grassroots activism getting those videographers to those crimes. Grassroots activism is responsible for the House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries’threat to impeachthe DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, if Trump doesn’t fire her. Schumer barely moves unless he gets a million angry calls and emails.Astonishingly, protest has even moved homeland security topull the border patrol’s Bovino from Minneapolisand send him back to California, though anyone who thinks hisreplacement, the “border czar”, Tom Homan, is any less of a fascist is deluded.Economic slowdown should accompany a shutdown; Minnesota’s magnificent general strike shows it can be done. Might the step after that be mass tax resistance?The question has been framed in the streets: is a government that impoverishes healthcare and nutrition, flouts the law, enriches its officials, imprisons babies, and kills its citizens worth the money it collects, much less the respect and obedience it demands?Democrats have nothing to lose by shutting down the government to force the majority party to respond to these questions and the one that looms over all: what, if any, is the political and moral future of the US?Judith Levine is a Brooklyn-based journalist and frequent contributor to the Guardian.

Leadership from below succeeded when politics as usual failedThu 29 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 08.44 ESTShareFor most politicians and journalists, the answer to nearly every question is to look up. Not at the moon, the stars or even the chimney tops, but at their leaders: the people who sit atop institutions, wield power and set the line that others follow. The top of the totem pole is the sole focal point, and the stories that count usually come from the heights of power.Bend your neck back far enough and Davos becomes not a talking shop in a Swiss ski resort, but a gathering of world leaders; Keir Starmerflying into Beijingis a summit of great powers; even who should be the MP for Gorton and Denton is really all about theLabour leadership. For this piece, the Guardian’s research librarians counted how many times the words “leader” or “leadership” appeared across the British press. Over the past week alone, the rough total stands at 2,000. A third of those stories concern one man: Donald Trump.“We know a lot about what fifth-century Greece looked like to an Athenian citizen,” observed EH Carr in his classic What is History?, “but hardly anything about what it looked like to a Spartan, a Corinthian, or a Theban – not to mention a Persian, or a slave or other non-citizen resident in Athens.” Sixty-five years later and our daily news remains wall-to-wall Athens, with scarcely a Spartan vox pop.Until a week such as this one, which reminds us that power doesn’t belong only to the powerful. Just look at the disarray inflicted on Trump, head of the world’s sole superpower, by Minneapolis, a city with barely more people than Croydon.After months of resistance by Minnesotans, the president’s immigration chief,Gregory Bovino, has been forced out of the city. Trump’s head of homeland security, Kristi Noem, faces either thesack or impeachment. Key members of his team aretearing stripsoff each other. And the Republicans’ signature domestic policy – the terrorising of multicultural Democratic cities by thousands of mercenary bullyboys, masked up and kitted out like they’re taking Basra – isnow opposedby a clear majority of Americans.Left to conventional leaders, this would not have happened. Just last week in Washington, a crucial number of Democratic representatives defied their own party toside with Trumpand pump more money into the immigration crackdown. Just last week in Davos, thousands of the highest-paid executives in the world – billionaires such as Stephen Schwarzman, whotakes more in an hourthan the average American earns in a year – dutifullyqueued upto hear the Orange Ego ramble on. Facing the administration’s classic mix of sweeteners and threats, the US’s media empires, its best universities and top law firms have folded like origami.Trump doubtless expected the same in the icy midwest. Instead, his troops faced a nonviolent fightback. Tens of thousands across Minneapolis and Saint Paul turned out week after week to protest, even when it was so cold, wrote one reporter, that he couldn’t take notes: “The ink in my pens had frozen.” Despite the state executions that have been all over the world’s news, despite being teargassed and assaulted, ordinary Minnesotans still turned out.When others went into hiding rather than face the immigration gangsters, their neighbours made sure they got food and supplies. And yet others acted as ICE-watchers, monitoring the violence and barbarism of armed thugs whose salaries come from US taxpayers. Many have kept on their civic duties despite the killing of Renee Good, a poet and mother who ICE employees shot in the face then called a “fucking bitch”; and Alex Pretti, a nurse executed by a gang of seven agents, apparently for holding up a phone.These two ordinary people were murdered by their own government, then slandered by it. Their corpses were tagged as “domestic terrorists”. Their fellow Minnesotans have been attacked as an “organised illegal insurgency” by Joe Lonsdale, a cofounder of Palantir. On one thing, he was right: the activists have been very organised, providing training to newbies, turning restaurants into field hospitals, running elaborate networks to get provisions to those Minnesota families in fear for their own safety. But an insurgency this is not, not when mums tooting whistles are battling masked men toting guns,paid up to $50,000just for signing up to ICE; not when a smartphone camera is wielded against teargas; or when hecklers are handcuffed and hauled off.The hub of this work is south Minneapolis, last in the world’s headlines six years ago as the site whereGeorge Floyd was killedby police officers. Some of those who rose up in the Black Lives Matter protests of that period have clearly reawakened their old networks. Others note that Minnesota regularly topsmeasures of social trust: in other words, its residents are among the most likely to place their trust in their neighbour across the road, rather than the leader at the top of the pile.Two are dead in Minneapolis. Trump is to blame | Kenneth RothRead moreThe resisters in Minneapolis provide an example of what the historian Moshik Temkin calls leadership from below. In his recent book, Warriors, Rebels and Saints: The Art of Leadership from Machiavelli to Malcolm X, Temkin writes how under authoritarian rule, societies will turn to “leaders who have few followers and no institutional power”. He gives the resistance in Vichy France as an example. “They might not be able to openly call themselves leaders or reveal themselves as leaders or reveal themselves at all. We might not ever even know their names.” Their power comes not from their direct impact, but from their example.Against the ethnic division sown by the White House, a significant number of Minnesotans have shown neighbourliness. Recoiling from the aggression and overreach of Trump’s lieutenants, Americans have been presented with an example of homespun solidarity. The Battle of Minneapolis is not over: ICE agents are still teargassing schools and threatening protesters (“You raise your voice, I erase your voice,”one bullyboy saysinto a camera, from the safety of his SUV). Bovino’s replacement, Tom Homan, is not much of an improvement: he helped createICE’s practice of separating kidsfrom their parents. But after a year in which the American establishment has talked of a vibe shift and a new Trumpian orthodoxy, citizens in the US and around the world can see it is not so: that it is resisted by them in the face of military hardware and unconscionable aggression.This week, Minneapolis offers those who would tell the story of the US a different narrative, although what it will be is inevitably unclear. For EH Carr, the importance of any president or his protesting crowds is never settled once and for all, but debated forever by those looking back with questions of their own age. As he wrote, “The historian belongs not to the past but to the present”. All of us will one day form the raw material of history; we will all belong to the future. That should change how we act now.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMinnesota ICE shootingsOpinionICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Donald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

I love itThu 29 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 18.09 ESTShareRecently, I reached out to a friend to see if they wanted to see the second Wicked film, only to realise the last time I’d seen them had been a full year – when we went to the first Wicked film. Oops. For a musical about friendship, it’s really lacking a number where Elphaba and Glinda try to schedule a lunch four months in advance.I wish this was a one-off blip in my regimented friendship schedule, but all through 2025 I played the world’s slowest game of message tennis. I’d invite a pal for dinner, only for the world to turn, the seasons pass, grey hairs gather at my temples, before a date was finally locked in.Dungeons & Dragons at 50: the collaborative fantasy role-playing game that builds you upRead moreThis sentiment seems to be common among my circle. In fact the latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australiasurvey revealeda long-term decline in social connectedness that has only worsened since the pandemic, with many Australians seeing a decline in friendships, particularlymen aged 24–44andwomen aged 15–24. In the horrible pyramid of late-capitalism needs, maintaining and valuing your friendships often falls depressingly low beneath “having a job and paying rent”. If I had a nickel every time I’ve had to let friends down the past year because I’ve been doing job interviews or the interminable tasks that seem to go with them, I’d have so many that I wouldn’t have to keep applying for jobs.But the shining nerdy light in all this is my regular Dungeons and Dragons game with a group of my pals, which provides something I thought I’d never need: the comforting schedule of organised fun. Every month, well in advance, we set our next game. It’s regular, it’s reliable and, as I’ve found this past year, deeply necessary.View image in fullscreen‘My regular Dungeons and Dragons game with a group of my pals provides the comforting schedule of organised fun.’Photograph: Morfon Media/AlamyWe’ve become a society that relies on organised fun to fulfil basic societal needs: we’re going on “run clubs” so we can avoid the scourge of dating apps; we’re going tobook clubsto force us to read books instead of stare at our phones; and I pretend to be an elf warlock divorcee.A game of D&D focuses on the concept of an “adventuring party”. This is agroup of heroes who are knitted closerthrough fantasy conflict in imagined lands. It’s almost like it was designed in a lab tomake the players feel closeras a result. You are still connected by the events your characters have gone through, even if you aren’t actually suffering from werewolf bites.I’ve always been someone against the concept of forced fun. When I was young, I loved the spontaneity of grabbing friends for dinner or to see a show, and spurned more elaborate events such as board game nights or playing in a sports team. In a previous job, I would schedule my annual leave for every corporate team-building event – – I didn’t want to play lawn bowls with the head of sales. I wanted to go home and organise my spice rack.How Dungeons & Dragons helped my siblings and me grieve our father’s deathRead moreSo it has been strange to discover that some of the most contrived fun out there not only involves deep creative investment, but an investment of precious time, and an entire grab bag of geeky aesthetic. I now travel to my friend’s house with a bag of dice and other strange accoutrements that, in an 80s teen film, would lead to me being thrown into a dumpster. I love it.Not only is the forced, routine connection with my beloved friends something I look forward to every month, I have a theory that Dungeons and Dragons are also deeply comforting in a way that the run clubs and book clubs and other social events aren’t.In D&D, me and my friends get to take a break from the harsh realities of our lives. In most sessions, we spend an hour fannying around, making food, drinking tea and updating everyone on our job nemesis, financial woes, the latest housemate drama. My elf doesn’t live in a world with rising fascism, it lives in a world where a creature made entirely of eyeballs is its biggest concern, and that’s very comforting. Not only is a game of D&D an enforced type of connection, it’s also a way of socialising that enforces fun and whimsy and play.My theory is that sometimes, upsettingly, trying to maintain a social calendar and prioritise your friends in your life does become yet another job. And when you’re tired and stressed and burnt out by all our other things, it’s easy for friendship to become a chore.It’s very difficult to bring the stresses and anxieties of your life into a make-believe world where you are adventuring with your very silly friends, which I think is why D&D has become so incredibly popular. The capacity to choose to spend your time being silly and creative diminishes as we get older, which is why I delight in carving out a day every month to do it. Having a dedicated monthly escapism day with your friends is the opposite of a chore, and might even be some kind of beneficial release valve that helps you navigate the rest of your responsibilities too. Or maybe it’s just fun and we shouldn’t think too deeply about it.Patrick Lenton is a writer.

Ask people what they think of Labour policy on benefits and they will probably talk of seizing the winter fuel allowance from freezing pensioners. Or that £5bn snatched from disabled people, until Labour’s own MPs prevented it. These were the signifiers that set the wrong tone early on. Late, far too late, abolishing the two-child limit has not made the same impression on public perceptions, despite the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) this week reporting it as being behind what could be thegreatest ever fall in child poverty in a parliament.The government fails to herald its progress in reversing the worst the Tories did to benefits. Why? I’m not sure if it is ineptitude or a political decision not to trumpet its many progressive policies.At the Fabian thinktank conference last week, I had an “in conversation” session with Stephen Timms, the minister who probably knows more and cares more about social security than any other MP. As financial secretary to the Treasury, he took the ChildPovertyAct through parliament in 2010. In opposition, he chaired the work and pensions committee scrutinising the Tory years. Now as minister for social security and disability, he chairs two crucial reviews, one on personal independence payments (Pip) for disability and one on universal credit.The basic benefit for adults has never risen in real terms since the 1970s, he said. Now for the first time since then, universal credit’s standard allowance will rise above inflation every year for each of the next four years. It always was, and still is, a pathetically low sum to live on, at £98 a week from this April for a single person, but that 2.3% real rise will slowly make a positive difference.“Reducing child poverty is whatLabourgovernments do,” Timms says: any child poverty graph reveals which party was in power when. His universal credit (removal of two-child limit) bill that he takes through parliament in a few weeks will lift about 450,000 children out of poverty, and will benefit another 100,000 taken above the line because they now qualify for free school meals. Increasing child poverty is what Conservatives always do. They pretended to support the 2010 Child Poverty Act in David Cameron’s wolf-in-sheep’s-clothing pre-election phase, but scrapped all those targets once in power. Timms watched them cut benefits to their lowest real terms for 40 years, propelling the number of children living in poverty to 4.5 million.Labour has changed direction since the shock of that attempted £5bn disability heist: Timms makes it crystal-clear Labour will not be doing that again. His Pip review will not make disability cuts, news that will come as a great relief to those who lost trust. Timms says Pip will rise with inflation up to the next election. Although numbers of new claimants are starting to fall, the Office for Budget Responsibilitypredicts the Pip bill will go on rising, but Labour has accounted for that in its envelope of benefit spending. No more cuts, except by getting more people into work. He reminds us why panic about the “rising” benefit bill is bogus: the proportion of GDP spent on working-age benefits has not changed for 40 years; it’s still at 4-5%.On his universal credit review, more good news. One of UC’s worst features was imposing a five-week wait on new claimants: it projects many with nothing to live on into instant and permanent debt repayment and rent arrears, sending food bank use soaring. Expect that to end. He talks emotionally of a conversation with the late Frank Field, benefits guru, protesting at the five-week delay. Field asked why, when he was minister and forms were filled in by hand, manually processed, driven by van to a centre and assessment managed without computers, it took only seven days to pay out? Yes, absurd, Timms agreed.But the point of that wicked five weeks was political, a deliberate policy, designed to “mirror the world of work” by paying monthly to many used to being paid weekly, with erratic hours, with no leeway to wait. To “mirror” work, they had to prove they spent 30 hours every week applying for jobs on pain of severe “sanctions” (benefit cuts), drivingemployers to protestat mountains of utterly unsuitable applications. Don’t forget those punitive policies where local jobcentre managers were threatened into “sanctioning” as many claimants as possible, tripping them up with unreachable appointments.Instead, Labour sets out to reprise its highly successful “new deal for young people” from 1998, when it brought down an inherited high youth unemployment rate with personal attention from jobcentre staff well trained to support, not punish: it worked. Of course, there was always a backstop of “conditionality”. Similarly, thefuture jobs fundfor the young, responding to the 2008 crash, was a proven success, though instantly abolished in 2010.Now with the number of Neets – young people neither in work nor education – at nearly a million, Labour’s youth guarantee currently being piloted is about to do it again, with work coaches trained to give that same support.All of this is good news. Good enough? It never is, but it is reversing the poison of the George Osborne, Iain Duncan Smith years. Last time they returned to government, the Tories obliterated most of Labour’s advances, so how can Labour nail down progress irrevocably this time? Only by changing underlying public attitudes, defying the right’s “scrounger”, “skiver” epithets. That will take a Labour cabinet talking up the good a well-designed benefit system does, never more than in rescuing the young fallers in a Covid-damaged generation. Lack of a guiding story about the best it does has been this government’s failure.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionBenefitsPovertyYoung peopleUniversal creditChildrenSocial exclusioncommentShareReuse this content"

And all the while gender repression is getting worseThu 29 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 19.22 ESTShareLast weekend, on the international day of education, UN agencies sounded the alarm on a situation that is far too neglected. It was just over four years ago that Afghanistan’s Taliban government banned all girls from secondary education. Since then it has extended the ban to include higher education. In a situation that has been rightly condemned as “gender apartheid”, the UN tells us that a staggering2.2 million girlshave been denied their chance at school.The waves of repression, which should be classified by United Nations legal authorities as a crime against humanity, mark the victory of the extreme Kandahar clerical faction over Kabul-based government ministers. They are also part of the plan of supreme leaderHibatullah Akhundzadato erase girls and women from public life.The appalling situation exposes, too, the miscalculations and errors being made by foreign governments that, even as the regime has stepped up the suppression of women, have recently sought to rebuild diplomatic relations with theTalibanregime. Four-and-a-half years into the Taliban’s ascent to power, more children than ever are being denied education.In successive edicts since 2021, women have now beenbanned from universitiesand most employment, including with the government and NGOs. They have been required to cover their faces, to beaccompanied by male relativesfor any long-distance travel, and have been warned they face arrest if seen in public spaces such as parks, gyms and beauty salons.This appeasement of the Taliban, led by Russia, China and India and followed by some European governments, has led Afghans’ religious rulers to believe they can act with impunity.December saw the arrest of a female journalist,Nazira Rashidi, in the northern city of Kunduz. Another young woman,Khadija Ahmadzada, was imprisoned in Herat for being in “violation” of rules by running a women’s sports gym and spent 13 days in jail until Richard Bennett, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan,successfully pressed for her release.Bennett is warning that conditions for girls and women are deteriorating and that the Taliban’s newly issued criminal procedure code foreshadows even more violations of girls’ and women’s rights.The latest repression marks the triumph of Akhundzada, the supreme ruler, and has seen key government departments and functions, including the control of weapons, redirected from Kabul to Kandahar. While the Kabul faction acknowledges that the economy requires women’s participation and access to technology, Akhundzada has become increasingly determined to impose a strict Islamic emirate, isolated from the modern world, where religious figures loyal to him control every aspect of society.His ideology is so rigid that he approved of his son’s choice to become a suicide bomber. He lost out – but only momentarily – when, within days of his 29 September order for a complete internet shutdown that would have severed Afghanistan’s links with the world andprevented girls from enjoying online education, he was defied by the Kabul-based telecommunications ministry, which switched the service back on. But by December,as a UN monitoring team noted, Akhundzada’s consolidation of power had also involved “a continued buildup of security forces under the direct control of Kandahar”.Central to the latest repression are internal disagreements within the Taliban, not least about the future of education and women’s employment. Indeed,evidence compiled by the BBCincludes a tape of Akhundzada from January 2025 warning that “as a result of these divisions, the emirate will collapse and end”. The rifts are significant. After warning publicly of the regime “committing injustice against 20 million people” – the entire female population of the country – and saying the denial of education was “straying from the path of God”, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the then-deputy foreign minister,had to flee the country.Russia becamethe first country to recognise the Taliban governmentand restore full diplomatic relations without securing any concessions on girls’ and women’s rights.China accepted the credentialsof an ambassador from the Taliban regime in January 2024.India upgraded its ties with the regime, including by formally reopening its embassy in Kabul, and proclaimed that “the future of India-Afghanistan relations seems very bright”.European countries have increased engagement with the Taliban as part ofa push to deport failed Afghan asylum seekers, lending credibility to the regime despite its persecution of girls and women. Yet the 59th session of the UN human rights council, held in June–July 2025,debated this matter, and Bennett, the UN special rapporteur, has persistently advocated making girls’ rights a condition for engagement with the Taliban and devising mechanisms to hold the regime accountable, including referring the denial of education to the international criminal court (ICC).‘That video saved our lives’: how women are defying the Taliban’s brutal crackdown on protestRead moreThey want to make gender apartheid an international crime, and alreadythe UN’s sixth committee (legal)has advanced a draft global treaty targeting the denial of girls’ and women’s rights as crimes against humanity. In July,the pre-trial chamber of the ICCissued arrest warrants for Akhundzada andAbdul Hakim Haqqani, the two most senior Taliban officials charged with gender-based persecution. But because of the Taliban’s refusal even to discuss girls’ rights, and their insistence on excluding women’s organisations from any talks, international negotiations held in Doha, hosted by the UN and Qatar, have secured no concessions on girls’ schooling or women’s rights.Whereas India, Iran and Russia backed forces that put the Taliban under real pressure in the 1990s, there is no organised armed anti-regime force withinAfghanistanthis time.There is underground schooling in areas such as the Panjshir valley, where radio broadcasts cover everything from breastfeeding to basic school science lessons for women and girls. Girls also study in what are called “home schools”, or leave for Pakistan or Iran to continue their education abroad, even in the face of those countries’ repatriation of2.6 million Afghan refugeesin 2025. Some young women have recently come to Scotland on scholarships to study to become doctors.There is a good reason why a failure to educate girls will eventually bring down the regime: Afghanistan’s population has swelled to more than 43 million and is only growing, with a predicted17.4 million people food-insecureby March and 4.9 million mothers and children suffering from malnutrition. But building an economy that will take millions from poverty to prosperity will be impossible so long as the Taliban deny half their population the chance to be educated and to join the workforce. That is their failure. If we are in any way sanguine about this medieval repression, that will be ours.Gordon Brown is the UN’s special envoy for global education and was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010This article was amended on 29 January 2026 to remove an unverified reference to the Taliban government having issued a further restriction relating to Afghan women and education.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanOpinionTalibanWomenSouth and central AsiacommentShareReuse this content"

Steve Jobs had announced the launch of the first iPhone, the sub-prime mortgage crisis was bubbling up in the US, the EU had enlarged to include Romania and Bulgaria, andIndiahad for the first time become a trillion-dollar economy. This was when trade talks between Delhi and Brussels were initiated for the first time. But it wouldn’t be until this very week, almost 20 years later, that a deal was signed after a few final months of unusually accelerated negotiations.On Tuesday, the president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Council António Costa and India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, announced the “mother of all deals”, which promises to bring together about 2 billion consumers and a quarter of the world’s GDP. Theagreementopens parts of India’s famously protectionist domestic market with a focus on exporting manufacturing and services; in return, middle-class Indian consumers will find it cheaper to buy European cars and wine. The overarching EU-Indiacomprehensive strategic agendais really much larger in scope, taking in defence and security, commitments to multilateralism, mobility and cooperation in a range of areas.Why the sudden change of pace, after 20 years of stops and starts? The answer has everything to do with Donald Trump. The EU-India free trade agreement unveils the emerging silhouette of a post-US world order amid relentless threats to territorial sovereignty, punitive tariffs and the weakening of multilateral institutions.The original talks had proceeded slowly over differences on cars, alcohol, agriculture and dairy – and were abandoned in 2013. They were resumed in 2022 as the post-pandemic world sought to “de-risk” anddiversify supply chainsbeyond China. Ironically what brought the deal to the finish line was not China but the looming shadow of Trump. In December 2024, even before the inauguration of his second presidency, the US president had spooked Europe byreviving the ideaof owning Greenland. That a close ally was threatening territorial sovereignty prompted a widely shared sense of Europe being “home alone” amid frictions in the tightly woven transatlantic relations.To add to the chaos, on his first day in office Trumpimposed punishing tariffson America’s neighbours, Canada and Mexico – a move that culminated in the “liberation day” taxes levied on 90 countries across the world. India was hit with one of thehighest tariff ratesof 50%, which included an additional 25% because of its purchase of discounted Russian oil. And most recently the tariff weapon was wielded once again against the EU and the UK when eight countries sent a few Nato soldiers to Greenland. As a result, the US is not just seen – as recentpublic opinion surveysshow – as undependable in Europe, but as an outright threat.Now “de-risking” and “decoupling” are back in vogue in Europe – except that the target is Trump’s America, rather than China. And what is at stake is not just supply chains but also the strategic capacity to act against coercion. The recent move by the French government toban officialsfrom using US video-conferencing software like Zoom and instead promote its home-grown Visio platform is a case in point.The wide scope of the evolvingIndia-EU partnershipsuggests a move towards greater convergence in terms of the commitment to multilateral institutions, and cooperation in a range of areas ofsecurity and defence, research, mobility and connectivity, including enhanced engagement in the Indo-Pacific region. As the US withdraws to the western hemisphere (through the so-called Donroe doctrine), the Indo-Pacific region, which was once central to US engagement in Asia, is now more open to collaboration with the EU.‘Mother of all deals’: EU and India sign free trade agreementRead moreThe trade deal is the largest of its kind but is also part of a growing trend as many nations attempt to forge new alliances. Brussels recently concluded a trade deal with the South American Mercosur trade bloc, withseveral more in the pipeline; India has made agreements with the UK and New Zealand in the last few months alone. While ratification and implementation take time, and may even hit a roadblock or two (likethe delayin the EU-Mercosur deal), it suggests a shift that is unmistakable. The world many outside the west have long dreamed about – of multipolarity, strategic autonomy, even de-dollarisation – is taking shape, first slowly and now rapidly.A day before the EU-India summit, EU leaders were for the first time guests of honour at India’s Republic Day celebrations, invited to witness the military parade and colourful pageantry. The emerging pictures were a world removed from the gloom that has overtaken the European mood in recent months. They projected bonhomie, even optimism.The world is moving on.

This isn’t the family-friendly France I knowHelen Massy-BeresfordManners and respect are the norm for kids here. Treating them like a nuisance won’t do anything to help France’s declining birthrateThu 29 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 10.08 ESTShareIn French culture, seven is known as“l’âge de raison”, the age at which children know right from wrong and can take some moral responsibility. France’s national rail operator, it seems, puts the age at which a child can be trusted to behave in a non-annoying way onboard a train a bit higher.In launching its new Optimum plus tariff earlier this month, offering spaces onboard its weekday TGV trains between Paris and Lyon with bigger, more comfortable seats, fancy food and no under-12s, SNCF was trying to appeal to the many business travellers who make that journey. Butthe move has sparked a backlashand a philosophical debate about the place of children in society, against the backdrop ofa worrying decline in French birthrates. “We can’t on one hand say that we are not having enough children and on the other hand try to exclude them from everywhere,”argues Sarah El Haïry, France’s high commissioner for childhood.Anyone who has spent a long train ride playing 4,000 rounds of I-spy with their own child, let alone sat close to anyone else’s, may understand the logic of offering child-free spaces. But the reaction highlights a strong philosophical objection in a country that traditionally gives children plenty of autonomy and responsibility, as part of a mindset that sees helping them fit in with wider society as a priority. It also highlights practical concerns about what “no kids” attitudes say about how birthrates will evolve.SNCF’s move was certainly a surprising one for such a seemingly family-friendly country, one that has a reputation for respecting children’s right to take part in the rituals of everyday life, starting with the elaborate three-course meals they are served in school canteens. My own half-French children, growing up in Paris, have had customs such as politely greetingneighbours and shop workers drilled into them from babyhood, not to mention sitting patiently in a restaurant andchacun son tour(taking turns) on the swings in the park. The logic is that treating children like small but valuable and responsible members of society helps them evolve into polite and respectful adults – how can they learn what society expects of them if they are excluded from public spaces as kids? It’s hard to argue with that logic.So, the “no kids” rule has hit a nerve. SNCF is not only a public service operator; it is entwined with French identity and the all-important long summer holidays. As things stand, it seems pretty child-friendly: SNCF station staff hand out activity kits to youngsters travelling on its TGVs in the school breaks, and summer trains are often full of groups of unaccompanied children being escorted to summer camps by young guides.Once the social media storm broke,SNCF did some swift downplaying, noting that the Optimum plus tariff only applies to 8% of Monday-to-Friday seats on one route popular with business travellers, leaving 92% of seats on weekdays and 100% on weekends available to everyone. It eventually removed the reference to the minimum age from the description on its website, but the debate is raging on.A society that cannot bear the presence of children is “worrying”, El Haïry argues. The former minister has spoken out before about the “no kids” trend, whereby restaurants and hotels are increasingly targeting child-free grownups who are seeking peace and quiet and have deep pockets. Sheis not the only one tosee a problem; last year the socialist senatorLaurence Rossignol put forward a lawmaking the creation of no-kids spaces illegal. Now, politicians from the right and the left are finding common ground in denouncing SNCF’s move.This is not only a question of morality. France’s finances are in crisis – and politicians know that a falling birthrate piles onmore long-term pressure. Compared with its European neighbours, France is actually not doing that badly, with thesecond-highest fertility rate in the EU in 2023. But the latest figures show that France’s rate is below the replacement rate – and falling. A recent update from the national statistics bureau,Insee, shows 24% fewer babies were born in France last year than in 2010. The government is trying to turn the tide, but family-focused measures such as increased parental leave, while welcome, are just part of the story – they won’t offset the worries about the future climate crisis and the eye-watering cost of living that are also behind some people’s reservations about starting a family.Two years ago, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, announced a “demographic rearmament” aimed at “relaunching” the country’s birthrate. In its next major evolution, the government is introducing two extra months of paid parental leave from this summer. That’s great news for new parents, and it comes on top of the many ways the French state already supports families: heavily subsidised creches and childminders, free school for everyone from the age of three and structured holiday clubs that remove many of the headaches working parents face in many other countries.While the concrete effects of SNCF’s move are minor – just a few seats on a few trains – the outrage sparked is reassuring. As a parent in family-friendly France, it’s good to know that attempts to start treating children as a nuisance instead of future grownups and civilised citizens get short shrift. Ensuring children remain welcome on trains and in public spaces won’t solve the problem of falling birthrates, but equally, making them and their parents feel like social pariahs certainly won’t help.Helen Massy-Beresford is a British journalist and editor who lives in ParisExplore more on these topicsFranceOpinionRail transportFamilyChildrenEmmanuel MacronPopulationEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

It purported to be from my bank and said my “awards points” were going to expire the following day.“We’re reminding you that 12,805 awards points … are set to expire on 31 December 2025,” the message read. “Don’t miss out – redeem your points today.”This was followed by a link that, looking at it now, was clearly not from my bank. The message also came from a generic mobile number, rather than the bank itself.But I was on holiday, I wasn’t reading it in detail, so I clicked on the link.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailOnce doing so, I was sent to a page that looked extremely similar to my bank’s online services.

Cries of “bravo”, “brava” and “bravi” have become a celebrated part of the tradition, with shouted approval seen as evidence of connoisseurship.Booing, too, has a long history, and asa brave stand-inat the Royal Opera House found out on Tuesday night, its impact may sometimes seem a little blunter.The incident unfolded during a performance of Puccini’s Turandot when the tenor Roberto Alagna, singing Prince Calàf, fell ill after the second act and was forced to withdraw.The company’s head of music, Richard Hetherington, gamely sang from the wings while choreologist Tatiana Novaes Coelho performed the role on stage. But when the third act resumed without Nessun Dorma because of the aria’s technical difficulty, the decision drew boos from some audience members angered at missing one of opera’s most famous moments.Drama at the opera as Royal Opera chief steps in for sick tenorRead moreWhile that may have seemed harsh on the stand-in, the crowd’s displeasure does not appear to have been aimed at him personally. After Tuesday’s performance, one X user criticised the ROH for not having a replacement performer available to “deliver the version of Nessun Dorma they’ve been singing in the shower since puberty”. The RBO has said Calàf is not the type of role for which a cover typically stands by during every performance.Hetherington may also take comfort from booing’s long history in opera, although audiences in Britain are generally much more restrained than in Italy, said the opera historian Flora Willson.“Opera seems to provoke more vocal reactions than spoken theatre or musicals, but mostly booing is directed at opera singers, whose job it is to perform frankly astonishing athletic feats on a nightly basis,” she said.Willson compared the way audiences respond to opera singers to football. “But of course yelling and chanting in a football stadium doesn’t actually prevent a game from continuing in the way that a wave of booing can disrupt an unamplified musical performance,” she said.At Covent Garden, there were riots in 1809, when the theatre management raised the ticket prices, Willson said. There were also protests at several opera performances in 1840 because the star baritone of the day Antonio Tamburini hadn’t been hired for the season.In those days the theatre ran on a subscription system, so the audience felt a direct sense of ownership and right to complain when its preferences weren’t prioritised. Today, opera houses in the UK, including the ROH, are run on a different model.“Audience demographics have also changed hugely over the past two centuries,” Willson said. “In combination with broader shifts in audience behaviour in classical music – which saw audiences start to sit still and in silence throughout performances – opera audiences have generally become much, much less rowdy.”John Berry, the former artistic director of English National Opera and co-director ofScenario Two, said he had been in European theatres where the booing had started in the interval. “It’s a tradition in some theatres but uncommon in the UK,” he said.Traditionally, creative teams receive the brunt of the booing at a curtain call, Berry said, and some directors “are well prepared to put on their hard hats before they walk on to the stage”. But while a few isolated boos don’t affect the success of a show, Berry said he always found booing singers “distasteful”, especially when social media has given audiences the tools to vent their dissatisfaction.“Singers are human and sometimes they soldier on and sometimes their voice disappears completely within the hour,” he said. “Although very disappointing, these things happen – it’s a live performance, not a film, that’s what makes the whole experience of live theatre so powerful and unpredictable.”The former Guardian columnist and opera enthusiast Martin Kettle said sometimes booing “can reflect the booer’s passion” for how they want the opera to sound and look. “But it can be very boorish, and we live in an increasingly boorish culture. Social media is often aggressive and I suppose that translates into the opera house,” he said.Kettle witnessed a particularly cruel incident of booing at the ROH once, when a heckler shouted “rubbish” at a 12-year-old actor during a production of Handel’s opera Alcina. The heckler was drowned out by cheers from the rest of the audience (and banned for life from the venue). “It was just horrible,” he said. “It’s often an assertion of a reactionary and narrow view of what an opera ought to be like.”The opera critic Tim Ashley said pantomime-type booing particularly worried him, “where people boo a villainous or flawed character, irrespective of the quality of the performance. It can be unpleasant, and deeply unfair on the singers.”Ashleywitnessed this during a production of Madama Butterflyat the ROH a few years ago. When Marcelo Puente, playing Pinkerton, took his curtain call, he was greeted with boos, despite giving what Ashley called “one of the most complete and convincing portrayals of the role to be heard for some time”.For Willson, the events of Tuesday night represented “an operatic perfect storm”. Alagna is a big-name star in the operatic world, Turandot is a popular opera – often billed as a great first opera for those who want to give the art form a try – and Nessun Dorma is the best-known three minutes of music in the whole of opera.“For better or worse, that one hit aria will have been the main reason some audience members wanted to see Turandot – and the idea that it could suddenly be cut mid-performance may have seemed outrageous,” she said.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HouseLondonGiacomo PuccinifeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they surely seem to be: samurai armour is so vital, so electric, with its grimacing, moustached, black face masks and full-body metal and fabric plating. The crests of their helmets incorporate eagles, dragons, goblins, even a clenched fist of metal emerging from one warrior’s head. It’s so intense you feel a presence.View image in fullscreenMenace … a 17th century suit of armour with bullet-proof cuirass.Photograph: The Trustees of the British MuseumThen again, the samurai always were ghosts in their suits. The metal mask became their face to the world, their carapaces transformed them into someone else. This idea that in battle the warrior becomes other, a bloody demon, is not unique to Japan: Viking “berserkers” lost themselves in a ritualised frenzy and may have believed they changed into bears. Armour in medieval Europe, too, was never just practical but a second skin, a full metal jacket suppressing softness and symbolising the steely transfiguration of normal souls into killers. But no culture has ever put quite as much creativity into blood-lust as Japan did from the 13th century – when samurai courage saw off Mongol invaders – until the abolition of this class in the 1800s.One of these eerily inhabited cyborg armours has been lent by the Royal Collection. It was was a gift for James VI of Scotland and I of England by a son of the second shōgun of the Tokugawa dynasty – but a barbed gift. Opulently crafted from lacquer, silk, deerskin and metal, its surface pulses with menace and mystery. It sent a clear message to far-off Britain: mess with us at your peril.That was no idle threat. Painted screens, scrolls and books depict samurai armies in action. A rider in a samurai battle scene by Imamura Zuigaku Yoshitsugu is studded with arrows but they’ve lodged harmlessly in his thick armour. His unprotected horse, however, bleeds from an arrow wound near its heart. On the ground, a warrior lies in glorious armour that is no use to him now, for his head has been cut off. So that’s what those elegant blades with their sweeping curvature – displayed nearby – are for.View image in fullscreenMinamoto no Tametomo on the Isle of Demons, by Katsushika Hokusai.Photograph: The Trustees of the British MuseumThe British Museum’s exhibition, however, does not just honour the art of war but embraces love and peace. We meet the warlord with a song in his heart. In a 19th-century painting by Kano Eishun, a samurai literally takes time to smell the flowers as he rides among orange blossoms. And it was samurai nobles who were the most prestigious clients of early modern Edo’s pleasure quarter, the “floating world”. In a painting from Chōbunsai Eishi’s 1790s handscroll, Twelve Erotic Scenes in Edo, we see the silhouette of a samurai making love to a courtesan behind a screen while in the foreground two women caress the shiny blade of his long unsheathed sword.Maybe this perverse piece of shunga art goes to the heart of this exhibition’s appeal. Samurai warfare was violent yet theatrical, cruel but glamorous, lethal but sexy. Before a samurai blade sliced you up, their demonic appearance held you transfixed.You feel bereft when you reach the abolition of the samurai elite as Japan in the 1800s tried to modernise. Photographs of the last samurai seem to show the passing of something wondrous from the world. And when the 20th century released new horrors of mechanised mass warfare there was no place left for myth or chivalry. In the west and east, the rituals and costumed theatrics that were part of feudal societies were irrelevant, especially after the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.View image in fullscreenModern times … Duck and Man 2025, by Noguchi Tetsuya.Photograph: The Trustees of the British MuseumSo the exhibition’s finale is inevitably disappointing. You meet a lifesized Darth Vader, touted here as a modern-day samurai but for me not as scary or mysterious as the originals. More to the point is a display onYukio Mishima, as he is known to the west, whose novels explored the appeal of samurai violence and passion in a banal, commodified modern world, before he left it by committing seppuku, a traditional ritual of self-disembowelment.The samurai emerge here as so much more than killers: as patrons of the arts, sensitive to nature, masters of civilised ways. And yet I’d trade it all to see a samurai charge. The ghosts of dead warriors inside their empty suits dominate the show. There are many forms of artistry here but nothing is more expressive than these portraits in steel, silk and lacquer. It’s an extraordinary encounter. Samurai armour embodies a merciless truth about the human condition and what it can become.Samurai runs atthe British Museum, London, 3 February-4 MayExplore more on these topicsArtJapanBritish MuseumAsia PacificDesignExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

What’s your go-to pastry recipe and, briefly, your favourite filling – savoury and sweet?TopTrampWell, as much as I can make it, I like to have a little block of shop-bought shortcrust or flaky pastry in the fridge. It’s so much easier to just roll it out and stick it on top. The pies have to be double crust. The one I make the most is slow braised, tiny chunks of steak with minced beef and roasted shallots, like a minced beef and onion pie. The kids love that with chips for Saturday night dinner. I like making chicken and mushroom with leek, although my partner’s a veggie, so she would probably say fish pie, with boiled eggs, which is a real labour of love, so I tend to save that for special occasions. I like a nice apple and cinnamon pie with a Demerara sugar crust, and cherry pie made with that really shit fake filling.The trailer for Whistle.What happened to your live-action remake of Captain Pugwash?keithrickabyThat was nearly 10 years ago. There was quite a good script. I think the money was coming from China, and I’m not sure they’d seen Captain Pugwash before. I think it was one of those things that never quite reached escape velocity. I do remember they just had normal names, and not the double entendres like Seaman Staines or Master Bates that everyone thinks were in the cartoon.Would you rather beAndy McNabor AndieMacDowell for the day?HesfalleninthewaterI would 100% want to be Andie MacDowell, not only for the chance to be Andie MacDowell, but to be a woman, just to see what it’s like. Only for a day though.View image in fullscreenNick Frost and Simon Pegg in Shaun of the Dead.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyCan you still salsa and would you consider Strictly?ukpidgeonI can still salsa. After Cuban Fury, I was mooted to do Strictly, but when I worked out how much work it would be, compared to the fee, it was a no. Plus, I was super fat, and I’ve always had an issue with the way they dress fat contestants on Strictly. They end up looking like a ball of satin, or like Violet Beauregarde in Willy Wonka, who turns into a giant blueberry. I have picked up some other skills as an actor. I can strip an MP5 [gun] blindfolded [as he did in Spaced]. I was asked to learn to knit for my latest job [as Hagrid in HBO’s Harry Potter], so I had lessons and thought: “Yeah! I can knit!”Had you seenThe Big Lebowskibefore playingMikein Spaced?PickmansModelI didn’t see The Big Lebowski until much later, so the Dude and Mike are completely similar by accident, even down to his glasses. I invented Mike, when I was 21, to make Simon [Pegg] laugh. Mike was a member of the territorial army, and had an eye disease which meant he couldn’t join the regular army, and had to wear glasses to correct his ocular wrong. It just happened to be a little bit John Goodman in The Big Lebowski.View image in fullscreenFrost as Mr Craven in Whistle.Photograph: Michael GibsonIf you could remake any film, where they all now have Hot Fuzz-style West Country accents, which would you choose?MrSOBaldrickI guess it would have to be something quite serious. Maybe Downfall or Saving Private Ryan. I’d like to see Downfall set in a small village in Somerset, although I think we’re going to see Downfall set in Washington DC soon.Who’s the most famous person who has randomly quoted something from the Cornettotrilogy to you?catchytitledTarantino loves Ed fromShaun of the Deadand I’m always amazed that he has pictures of me up in his cinema. I’ve been there and seen them, because he and Edgar [Wright] became friends. That’s quite weird – being a fan of cinema as a younger man, and watching Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, then suddenly the director has your stupid face in the foyer of his cinema.Be honest – how many of the Harry Potter films / books had you seen / read when you were cast as Hagrid in the upcoming TVversion?TurangaLeela2I’ve seen all the films. We go through them all as a family during Christmas every year. We start on 20 December and finish a week and a half later. Before I was cast as Hagrid, my partner suggested trying to manifest it. So last Christmas, I watched all the films back to back on the Sky Harry Potter channel, while writing out the word “Hagrid” 7,000 times.View image in fullscreenPegg and Frost in Spaced.Photograph: E4 PICTURE PUBLICITYAs someone who also only started getting tattoos in my mid-30s, what made you start?bearvssharkI had one tattoo when I was 20. I fainted within five seconds. When I woke up, there were two Hells Angels lifting me back into my chair. I didn’t have any more until when my dad died when I was 40, as a way to turn spiritual pain into physical pain, and try to exorcise it. Now I’m 53, my whole top and arms are covered. It eventually got past exorcising dead family demons, to enjoying the pain a bit. I struggled for a long time with how I looked, in terms of being a mega fatty, and not being able to go to the beach without people laughing at you. The tattoos meant people didn’t focus on how much you weighed, so it was like a suit of armour.Would you ever consider playing some Shakespeare on stage, say Falstaff, Othello or Portia?CHARISMATAI’ve only ever done one thing on stage, in the 25 years of my career. As much as I loved it, it was quite stressful. My real love is making films and television. If you want me to be a Shakespearean character in a film, then yeah, I’d definitely do that.Does Simon Pegg still have you chained up in his shed?GarryiYes.

No More Dream (2013)At the start of their career,BTSwere marketed as a cross between a Korean idol band and a blinged-out rap act: “Our life is hip-hop,” offered band member Suga early on. No More Dream is actually far tougher-sounding than you might expect: the vocals growl, the backing blares, the double-bass sample that drives the intro is great.19. Mikrokosmos (2019)View image in fullscreenHere come the mirror men … BTS.Evidently written with arenas twinkling with thousands of (lucratively branded) light sticks in mind, Mikrokosmos offers a brand of electronic pop that’s both melodically pretty and epic-sounding. Whether you choose to believe the claim that its title actively encouraged fans to bone up on ancient Greek philosophy is up to you.18. Save Me (2016)Part of BTS’s appeal clearly rests on the strikingly un-macho vulnerability they project. Save Me is a case in point. The music is upbeat, bearing the influence of tropical house, electropop and – in the rhythm track of the chorus at least – dubstep. But the vocals deal in breathy desperation: “I’m trapped in myself and I’m dead.”17. Mic Drop (2017)Already huge in Korea and Japan, a remix of Mic Drop by EDM DJ Steve Aoki gave BTS their first US Top 30 hit and breached the UK charts. Still, the original might be the best: trap-fuelled pop, with a distinct hint of Missy Elliott’s Get Ur Freak On about its hook.16. Run (2015)Not to be confused with 2022’s Run BTS, Run is a finely turned example of the band’s gradual shift towards a more straightforwardly pop-oriented style. There’s still rapping here, but what really sticks with you is the wistfulness of the melody and the euphoric surge of the house-fuelled chorus.15. Idol (2018)A riposte to that perennial bugbear, the haters – “I do what I do,” it counsels crossly, “so you just mind your own business” – Idol intriguingly blends South African house variantgqomand traditional Koreanpansori(narrative song), heavy on synthesisedgayageum (zither) and thejanggu (drum). Nicki Minaj turned up on the remix, evidence of BTS’s mounting US popularity.14. Burning Up (Fire) (2016)Another career milestone, Burning Up (Fire) was the first – but not the last – BTS track to top Billboard’s global digital sales chart. It’s a melange of surprisingly harsh-sounding electronics derived from the world of stadium dubstep, stop-start dynamics, sneering, faintly Beastie Boys-esque rapping, and a hook that lodges in your brain from first listen.13. Dope (2015)Banned in Korea for its apparently vulgar lyrics – which perhaps tells you rather more about Korean censorship than the lyrics themselves – Dope lauds BTS’s own work ethic, and decries those who suggest the band are merely puppets: “The media and adults say we have no will … they’re the enemy.”12. Boyz With Fun (2015)Boyz With Fun flew in the face of BTS’s pivot towards a heartfelt brand of pop, applying their rap vocals to a knowingly daft, preposterously fun slice of party-starting disco, complete with a hook line that calls back to Funkadelic’s oft-sampled 1975 anthem Get Off Your Ass and Jam.11. Boy With Luv (ft Halsey) (2019)View image in fullscreenBubblegum … BTS live.Photograph: Bighit MusicBTS’s sixth album, Map of the Soul: Persona, was allegedly based on psychoanalyst Murray Stein’s book Jung’s Map of the Soul: An Introduction, although it’s fair to say you wouldn’t know from the first single. Decorated with a guest vocal by Halsey, Boy With Luv was BTS at their lightest: perfectly turned, toothsome bubblegum pop.10. Boy in Luv (2014)You could, if you wished, view Boy in Luv as a kind ofK-pophomage to the mid-80s productions Rick Rubin created for Def Jam. Certainly, the immense beat and distorted rock guitar has a hint of Run-DMC’s Raising Hell or the Beastie Boys’ Licensed to Ill, albeit with a massive pop chorus attached.9. Butterfly (2015)By the time of their fourth mini-album, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Part 2, BTS had far outgrown their original hip-hop-inspired remit. Butterfly is a feather-soft, breathily delivered ballad, with an unexpected lyrical reference to Haruki Murakami. The Prologue Mix, released in 2016, dials things down further until the whole song sounds like a sigh.8. Black Swan (2020)The first single from Map of the Soul: 7 struck an oddly sombre and jaded note. Over a languid hip-hop beat and the sound of agayageum, the lyrics strongly suggested BTS had had enough of fame: “The heart no longer races when the music starts to play.”7. DNA (2017)A couple of months after its release in South Korea and Japan, DNA provided BTS with their US television debut when they performed the track at the American Music Awards and stole the show. Their astonishingly intricate choreography might have grabbed attention, but DNA’s effervescent pop-EDM clearly had a role to play.6. Dynamite (2020)The first ever US No 1 single by a South Korean band, Dynamite was apparently intended as a corrective to the Covid pandemic. Like another lockdown-era hit, Dua Lipa’s Future Nostalgia, it sounded like a party in full swing, offering a precision-tooled 21st-century pop take on disco euphoria.5. Fake Love (2018)A classic angst-drenched BTS ballad, supersized for maximum impact: echoing stadium rock guitar, immense trap beat, epic synths, shout-along hook. Intriguingly, some fans interpreted its lyrics, most notably the line about “trying to erase myself and make me your doll”, as being directed at the strictures of the K-pop industry.4. Butter (2021)View image in fullscreenFrom left: V, Suga, Jin, Jung Kook, RM, Jimin and J-Hope.Photograph: Lee Jin-man/APAmid BTS’s penchant for high-concept albums, Butter was designed, according to band member Jimin, with nothing more lofty in mind than to be “easy to listen to”. It achieved its aim via hook-laden 80s-inspired funk: there’s a tang of classic Jam and Lewis productions to the synths, a touch of Daft Punk to its sound.3. I Need U (2015)‘It’s ended up being nothing to no one’: can K-pop overcome crisis?Read moreThis was the song that turned BTS into K-pop’s biggest stars, still rooted in hip-hop but more pastel-toned than their previous releases. The backing carries a suggestion of synthesised panpipes and a hint of the musical box, a sweetness at odds with the lyrical vehemence: “I can’t take it! I don’t give a shit!”2. Blood Sweat and Tears (2016)The perfect example of BTS’s ability to absorb voguish musical influences into their sound – in this case the chugging dembow rhythms of moombahton – without sacrificing their identity. It might fit with 2016’s trends, but Blood Sweat and Tears still somehow sounds different, at one remove from the rest of the era’s pop.1. Spring Day (2017)Still the heartfelt BTS ballad to end all heartfelt BTS ballads nearly a decade on from its release, Spring Day was initially inspired by the 2014Sewol ferry tragedy, in which 304 people died, 250 of them high school students; the video comes replete with visual references to the disaster. But you don’t need to know the background to feel the song’s emotional punch. The rapped verses feel closer to impassioned spoken word than hip-hop swagger, and the melody is tear-jerking, which means however grandiose the music gets – booming drums, fizzing EDM synths, a big chorus – it always feels downcast.Explore more on these topicsBTSRankedPop and rockK-popfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For more than half a century, the wiry, weird, difficult and awkwardly horny artist (now in his 80s) has been churning out underground comics that lay bare his deepest neuroses, and reflect yours back in the process.Now he is being celebrated in an ultra-high-end London gallery, with pages ripped from his notebooks and framed up like the finest of fine art. Except this isn’t fine, it’s filthy and angry and paranoid. It’s classic Crumb: skinny men quivering with worry and fear and hormones in a cruel, uncaring, senseless world – filled with towering women in thigh-high boots, obviously.The best works are the simplest, the visual one-liners. Crumb flushes himself down a toilet, with graffiti on the wall saying: “Here I sit and can’t get started, tried to shit and merely farted.” Abject, miserable failure and gross humour, that’s Crumb’s world. In other self-portraits he has a gun pressed to the back of his big goofy head, or he’s whingeing about how no one could possibly understand him. “Self flagellation perhaps,” it says in one drawing, “or maybe it’s true!” He’s a terrible, and hugely relatable, mixture of supercharged self-hatred and extreme arrogance.View image in fullscreen‘A broken, terrible dork’ … Untitled.Illustration: © Robert Crumb, 2007. Courtesy the artist, Paul Morris, and David ZwirnerHow could he not be? The world he sees is nasty and brutal and politically anguished. An alien laments the greed and deception of the human race in one image. A miserable man with a dripping nose weeps: “I’ve blown my life, I’m fucked.” Everywhere you look you see happy, healthy humans ignoring and dismissing the poor, tortured little weirdos in their midst.The only solace in any of this comes from women: giant, towering, buxom Amazons. Crumb worships them, idolises them, grasps desperately on to their thick legs. He is a broken, terrible dork, but these women are something good in the world, something pure. In one almost sweet drawing, a little bald guy in a hospital gown tells a huge glamazon that he is so happy and filled with love. “Every moment is significant!” it says in big bold letters in the sky. Where’s the paranoia and resentment and self-flagellation? All gone, apparently, the instant a babe comes into view.Downstairs, the works are all prints from a 1980s notebook, but upstairs it’s mainly original drawings. Direct, hilarious, experimental: he’s got a great compositional eye, a brilliant way with line, and an unbelievably unique style. Up here, there’s even more paranoia, even more horniness – guys either throttling their own genitals or pulling their own hair out. There’s no in between: it’s total sexual deviancy or total anguish. What a life.View image in fullscreenLoving, pure and simple … Crumb’s portrait of his wife.Illustration: © Robert Crumb, 2025. Courtesy the artist, Paul Morris, and David ZwirnerOne portrait of his wife, Aline Kominsky-Crumb (who was also a noted comic artist), swimming in the Med, feels different. It’s not horny or paranoid or gross or intense, it’s just loving, pure and simple. A little moment of unblemished joy in an otherwise pretty vile world.Robert Crumb: ‘I am no longer a slave to a raging libido’Read moreI don’t know what is gained from seeing most of Crumb’s work in a gallery context, framed and whacked on a wall instead of in a printed publication. At best it gives you the time and space to consider each image, to take every one as a single, important, elevated thing instead of just another anxious page in a long stream of anxious pages. At worst it destroys the experience of reading through the work, undermining the original intention and format. The narrative, more comic-booky images don’t work as well when framed on a wall. Crumb is obviously worthy of being shown in a swanky Mayfair gallery, but equally, there is nothing wrong with comic books. They’re cheap, easy, dirty and real, just like Crumb.Either way, Crumb remains singular and hilarious. “There’s no end to the nonsense,” it says in big letters on one wall downstairs, and let’s hope not. Because when the nonsense is by Crumb, it’s pretty damn brilliant.R Crumb: There’s No End to the Nonsense is atDavid Zwirner, London, until 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsArtDrawingRobert CrumbGraphic designComics and graphic novelsExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Should somebody tell them what he did?Amy WildThu 29 Jan 2026 07.09 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 10.14 ESTShareWhen British people think of Jimmy Savile, it isn’t typically as someone whose style to admire. But at screenings of 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, the latest film in the 28 Days Later franchise which was released this month, that does seem to be what some US filmgoers arethinking.In the film, a murderous cult known as “the Jimmies” stalk the ruins of post‑apocalyptic Britain. Led by Sir Jimmy Crystal, played by Jack O’Connell, the sect are instantly recognisable for their cheap tracksuits, bleached blonde wigs and particular mannerisms.For viewers in the UK, Crystal is unmistakably reminiscent of the entertainerJimmy Savile, whose decades-long history of sexual abuse was only revealed after his death. Over more than 50 years, Savile exploited his fame and access to positions of trust to abuse hundreds of people, most of them children. His crimes took place backstage at television shows such as Top of the Pops but also in hospitals, children’s homes and institutions in which he had cultivated influence and free rein.The film’s producer, Danny Boyle, and O’Connell have been clear that Sir Jimmy Crystal was designed as a Savile-inspired figure. Boyle told Business Insider that the character draws on Savile’s entire pop-cultural footprint, “all kind of twisting in this partial remembrance” that Crystal’s followers then recreate as an image.O’Connell told the Hollywood Reporter his character “models himself on the memory of this figure that was always on TV”, describing it as a warning about the dangers of weaponised nostalgia and unchecked power. “It totally exists in the story to unsettle,” he said.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

It’s not clear when the characters in Bone Temple would have encountered him, given that the peak of his fame predated their fictional lives. But the gang idolise Savile not because he is sinister but because the world never knew the truth, and in this story, never would. The irony, of course, is that the audience do, which is why the imagery is meant to unsettle, not inspire fancy dress.In the US and Canada, however, the reference appears to be lost on some fans of the franchise. Clips, photos, and even dedicated fan accounts of the Jimmies are circulating on social media, showing viewers turning up to screenings dressed as the “Jimmy Gang”, wearing tracksuits, gold chains, cigars, and the signature white bob, seemingly unaware of the real-life Savile scandal that inspired them.Some videos go further, imagining specific dance moves each Jimmy would perform, showcasing their cosplays, or enthusiastically idolising Sir Jimmy Crystal as a character in his own right.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

Baskin later insisted she had no idea whom either man was when she made the video.The Guardian’s Peter Bradshawdescribed 28 Years Later: The Bone Templeas a film “in which there is real human jeopardy and conflict. Non-zombies are more cinematic.” Yet perhaps the more disturbing horror is that figures such as Savile, within a generation, can be reduced to a wig, a look or a meme, and stripped of the context that once made them truly monstrous.Allow TikTok content?This article includes content provided byTikTok.

It is hard not to be compelled, and appalled, bysomeone like Alex Honnold. Evenwithropes, a single wrong move can mean death in mountaineering, a mad activity that puts you at the full mercy of nature. You cannot help but wonder what kind of person willingly chooses this: what kind of person looks at a towering cliff face, or a wall of wind-whipped ice, and thinks, I bet I can get up there.Aava, Cairn’s protagonist, is that kind of person: a champion climber, a woman who has conquered summit after summit, but for some reason can’t walk away. Before her stands Mount Kami, an ice-tipped, Himalayan-style peak that has never before been climbed. Kami was once home to a tribe of people, whose remnants you find as you pull yourself up each section of the mountain, but now you are very much alone. Controlling Aava’s limbs, you move her hands and feet towards imperfections in the rock, jamming her fingers into cracks and her toes on to tiny ledges. You quickly learn to read the mountain, as Aava would.View image in fullscreenImpossibly brave … Aava rests on Mount Kami in Cairn.Photograph: The Game BakersDespite the absence of real-life peril, Cairn makes your heart race and your mouth go dry. When Aava’s limbs start shaking and she starts breathing more urgently, you know she’s not secure on the cliff face; you’d better reposition her feet fast, or take a gamble and try to screw a piton and clip in before she loses her grip. And you have limited life-saving pitons, so you’d better conserve them. At one point I was stuck halfway up a bare rock face after climbing all night, with no pitons left and no respite in sight in any direction, and I had to perform a terrifically stressful 10-minute climb towards a cave without putting a foot wrong. I got desperate right at the end and Aava nearly slipped as she pulled herself up on to the final ledge. I had to put the controller down and do some deep breathing before I could continue.In this respect, Cairn is a wonderful survival game. It feels perilous, as it should. In addition to managing Aava’s hand and footholds, you have to manage her backpack, scavenging, foraging, trying to find water wherever you can (tip: keep every bottle you find). You must laboriously bandage her ruined fingers to preserve her grip, when you get a moment to rest. And with that sense of danger and suffering comes a sense of accomplishment, when you prevail. The relief that I felt whenever I found a safe point where Aava could set up her tent was intoxicating.As hours pass and conditions get worse on the mountain, Aava’s obsession with conquering Kami starts to feel not just impossibly brave but self-destructive. Cleverly, the game invites you to question why she’s doing this – and whyyou’redoing it. Especially towards the end, this is not an easy game (though you can always turn on some assists to make it less pitiless if you want). There were sections where I fell off the mountain over and over, failing to find a good route, parched and starving. Dangling from the rope for the 15th time, I became immensely frustrated with myself, and Aava voices her own frustration every time you fumble a hold. I should probably have walked away and taken a break for a while, but Aava’s stubborn determination was rubbing off on me.Cairn, as much as a game about climbing and nature, turns out to be a game about what it takes to be the kind of person Aava is – and the cost. I was floored by the ending, which had me crying on my sofa at one in the morning. There were many moments of beauty and terror during my ascent that left me quietly awestruck. That awe, in the end, was proportional to the hardship.Cairn is out 29 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsGamesPCPlayStation 5XboxMountaineeringreviewsShareReuse this content"

This heartfelt, hilarious three-part homage to kitties is pure comfort viewingGeorgie WyattThu 29 Jan 2026 07.44 ESTLast modified on Thu 29 Jan 2026 07.46 ESTShareDavid Baddiel has a mission “to fulfil a lifelong dream of spending as much time as possible with cats”. He wants to put felines in the spotlight and challenge common misconceptions about them being “sneaky, evil and lazy”. Baddiel gets stuck in. He meets famous cat influencers such as Atticus – a stunning ragdoll with 96,700 Instagram followers, who was asked byParamount to perform a promotional motorbike stuntfor the latest Mission: Impossible film. He does kitten yoga, hand-feeds two chatty cheetahs and even bathes with lions. It’s every cat person’s dream!The show’s premise is that cats are popular on social media. The hashtag #catsofinstagram currently hasmore than 212m postson Instagram’s mobile app, and#cat ranked among the top 100trending hashtags. Yet hardly any TV shows are made about cats and their owners. Instead, cat owners, like myself and Baddiel, are often subjected to cruel stereotyping. A few years ago, cat ownership was even mocked by the current US vice-president, JD Vance, who dismissed his rivals in the Democratic party as “childless cat ladies”. Not any more. Enter David Baddiel: Cat Man.From the start of the show, it’s clear that Baddiel really,reallyloves cats. His face lights up every time he meets one. He even sprays himself with catnip to get the attention of the celebrity influencer catKing Louis– a big, caviar-scoffing British shorthair who has 139,000 Instagram followers. King Louisbites Baddiel for playing the “bongos” on him. The “bongos” are a gentle rhythmic pat on either side of the rump. As a passionate cat person and member of the WhatsApp group Apocalypse Meow, I know a true cat person when I see one. David Baddiel is one of us.View image in fullscreen‘Brightens your dreary January’ … David Baddiel: Cat Man.Photograph: Jo Maney/Channel 4Unlike many celebrity-led documentaries, Cat Manis by no means trivial. Baddiel has cats himself: Tiger, Zelda and Ron. They all feature in the show, through home videos and a brief appearance on set. Tiger goes upstairs, and Ron hides behind a wall. However, during the filming of episode one, Baddiel’s 15-year-old cat Pip becomes unwell. Despite his daughter Dolly’s best efforts, Pip dies. Have a hanky on standby – I was a quivering wreck. Because there is nothing trivial about Baddiel’s very real tears on camera. Those tears represent the many people like me who have struggled withthe loss of a pet. As David says: “55% said they hid their grief for fear of being ridiculed.”Cat Man does everything to sway the haters, too. We meet Holly and Colin, who run Holly’s Merry Moggies rescue centre, which cares for disabled cats. People reject some felines because they don’t “look good” on social media. How could you resist Bertie the tabby, who was born with no eyes? Or Dr Susan, a very chatty cat show exhibitor who knows everything about the animals. She is the proud owner of Lucy, an 11-year-old neutered bengal stunner with more than 40 rosettes. Lucy has twice won the Supreme,whichis the cat version of Crufts, run by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (essentially the Kennel Club for cats, but with a much better name). Baddiel attends the Supreme with Dr Susan, who is hoping for a third win, but is sceptical, given Lucy’s age. Lucy does win, and you would have to be dead inside not to have wanted it for them both.Better yet, Cat Man has several celebrity cat enthusiasts: Ricky Gervais, Jonathan Ross and Lou Sanders among them. Each has the same level of affection as Baddiel. “Dogs are PAYE.Catsare freelance,” jokes the comedian Josh Widdicombe, before casually confessing to sharing a glass of water with his. If he isn’t ashamed of that relationship, neither should any cat person be. However, I wouldn’t drink that water.View image in fullscreen‘A stunning ragdoll with 96,700 Instagram followers’ … David Baddiel with Atticus.Photograph: Channel 4All good documentaries must have a balance. Enter the comedy legend and cat hater Frank Skinner, who describes the creatures as “sinister”. He says he prefers dogs: “Dogs are slapstick. Cats are satire.” However, when Baddiel mentions the cat they (sort of) shared more than 20 years ago, Chairman Miaow, I spotted a soft smile and a twinkle in Skinner’s eyes.David Baddiel: Cat Man is the ultimate comfort viewing. If seeingDavid Baddielhand-feeding and cuddling Larry, the No 10 feline, doesn’t brighten your dreary January, perhaps even make you love cats, nothing will. I came away feeling proud to be a passionate cat person and, like Baddiel, I don’t care who knows it.David Baddiel: Cat Man’s final episode airs on 30 January.

Madeline Cash has spotted that a combination of tenderness and satire may be precisely what our times require. Lost Lambs, her debut novel about the Flynn family, is a witty, quickfire book set in a small American town, punch-drunk on clever, skewering lists and infested typographically by the gnats that plague the local church the family attends (“explagnation”, “extermignation”).The Flynns are in a mess. It was easy for Catherine and Bud to be passionate when he was a young rock star and she was an aspiring artist. But since then they’ve acquired three daughters and a lot of Tupperware. Catherine succumbs to the advances of Jim, an amateur artist who gives her “the youthful comfort of being understood”. He’s rekindled her artistic ambitions, prompting her to decorate the Flynn house with nude self-portraits and proclaim an open marriage. She doesn’t yet know that Jim has a collection of pottery vaginas in his basement (“each of these pussies has touched my life”).Harper, 13, is a child genius who has taught herself six languages but is “mythically bored” and regularly suspended from school. Louise suffers from the “plight of the middle child”, stuck “in a prison of her own mundanity”. Escape is offered by yourstruly, an online lover who advises her to invest in equipment to make explosives. Finally, there’s 17-year-old Abigail, the family beauty. Too much makeup tells men you’re only interested in one thing, her mother warns. “Good,” Abigail responds. “It saves me the trouble of telling them myself.” Her latest conquest is War Crimes Wes, a former soldier who now works in private security for Paul Alabaster, the town’s megalomaniac billionaire shipping magnate, who also employs Bud in his accounts team.Cash’s virtuosic wit allows her to warm hearts at the same time as satirising the worldSo here they are, ready to go, in need of a plot – and Cash turns out to be brilliant at plotting, an often underrated art. It’s provided by a combination of church and commerce. Between them, Paul Alabaster and God compete for the Flynns’ souls, with God mediated by Miss Winkle, the local do-gooder who runs the “Lost Lambs” support group that Bud is sent to when he’s too depressed to function at work. One night, a drunken Bud kisses her clumsily as tea splashes from their mugs and they immediately have “wholesome and arousing” sex that turns out to be what Bud needs, more than sex with his hot but dissatisfied wife. Bud now attempts, in the clumsy but ultimately noble manner of the comic hero, to be a better person, and this brings him into conflict with Paul Alabaster.For ages, Harper – bored enough to go through the Alabaster accounts on the family computer – has been telling Bud that there is a shipping container delivered annually that isn’t properly accounted for on his spreadsheets. Now that Bud is trying to be his best self for Miss Winkle, he asks Alabaster some difficult questions. Meanwhile War Crimes Wes is also investigating Alabaster, worried that Abigail has been marked out as the sole female recipient of an invitation to his next high-security party. And Abigail’s best friend, Tibet, a conspiracy theory addict, has been drawn towards speculation that Alabaster’s yearning for eternal youth has led him into vampiric blood sucking. Of course it’s all going to coalesce around the party itself; of course the conspiracy theorists will turn out to have been right all along; of course the sisters will find that they’re more loyal and more sisterly than they’ve feared.The priestesses of the book are Miss Winkle and Tibet. Miss Winkle brings an interestingly unfashionable vision of goodness. “Do you want to berightor do you want to behappy?” Bud asks Harper at the start of the book. Then he chose happiness; by the end, Miss Winkle has revealed that there’s no happiness without rightness, and everyone in his increasingly extended family is learning it too. This goodness is complemented by Tibet’s new kinds of truth. She is convinced that if we each experience “only a tiny fraction of reality”, then we have to come up with new models of pooled knowledge. This leads in her case to an odd vindication of online conspiracy theories, but the novel itself offers its own vision of collective truth.Cash’s virtuosic wit allows her to warm hearts at the same time as satirising the world. The plot may sometimes take up too much of the novel’s air; the typographical gnats may be a little winsome (should that be “wignsome”?); but in an age when the conspiracy theorists do indeed turn out to be disturbingly right as well as disturbingly wrong, and when old-fashioned tenderness and laughter are ever more required, Cash is a happy and energising new voice.Lara Feigel is the author of Custody: The Secret History of Mothers (William Collins).

Is it a gig?” ponderedwriter Robert Macfarlane, introducing the second half of this quirky classical-meets-folk performance. By the end,melodeon and harmonica player Will Poundhad drawn his own conclusions: the encore – an upbeat, gently madcap arrangement of the Sailor’s Hornpipe – would be “a rave”, he joked, to polite giggles from the unequivocally well-behaved audience.Not that the evening had lacked moments to inspire toe tapping and chin bobbing.Percussionist Delia Stevenssaw to that, as she danced between instruments laid out around her like at a jumble sale – among them a set of mixing bowls, one toy piano, a guitar balanced next to a vibraphone as well as numerous drums, shakers and contraptions I’d be pushed to name, mostly played two or three at a time. As a duo, Stevens & Pound bill themselves as a “left-field folk” act. Their mashup of Pound’s folk background and Stevens’s classical training is all about high-energy, rhythmically driven virtuosity.The Silent Planet, their “reimagining” of Holst’s beloved orchestral suite The Planets, featured poetic narrations from Macfarlane accompanied by atmospheric improvisations fromBritten Sinfoniasoloists as well as Stevens and Pound, before conductor Clark Rundell took the reins for each movement. There were some wonderful effects: terrifying, warmongering blasts of conch shell for Mars, bright flares of horn in Mercury, a whirlwind hoedown for Venus. But it also sprawled noisily, the movements sliding into each other in their rapid switches from drones to jigs and reels, while Ian Gardiner’s orchestration lacked the finesse of Holst’s original. Only the new movement, Earth, threaded with the tune of All Things Bright and Beautiful, briefly allowed more breathing space before yet another syncopated romp.The first half showcased older meetings of folk and classical. Britten’s diffident English Folksong Suite andGrainger’s irresistibly knowing Lincolnshire Posy – which saw the Britten Sinfonia’s wind and brass joined by members of Sinfonia Smith Square – bookended a Stevens & Pound medley that transformed the same folk tunes into funky tilts at tango and bluegrass.

Barely a year ago, they largely comprised flyers for – and cameraphone footage from – gigs in tiny Los Angeles bars, the kind that make as much virtue out of the fact that entry is free as of who’s playing: one bills his performance alongside a vintage clothes market and “tarot readings”. A support slot with a minor jam band called Eggy is a very big deal indeed; the news that he’s playing a show in London is greeted with disbelief: “What,” asks one baffled correspondent, “does London know of Ballgame?”View image in fullscreenThe artwork for For the First Time, Again.Photograph: Rough TradeThings changed dramatically over the ensuing 12 months. Not long after his first trip to London, a video of him performing live at a Los Angeles bar called the Fable began circulating online. By the time he came back to the UK to perform at Brighton industry showcase the Great Escape, he had signed to Rough Trade. Critical hosannas began raining down on Ballgame: he has variously been compared to Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, John Lennon, Harry Nilsson, Randy Newman, Jim Morrison and Tim Buckley.He also turned out to be catnip for what’s left of the music press, an interviewee with a penchant for the hippy-friendly philosophy of Alan Watts and an intriguing backstory. A Berklee College of Music dropout who spent years sequestered in his parents’ basement, struggling with depression and a gargantuan appetite for marijuana, he underwent a “spiritual awakening” thanks to the work of German self-help guru Eckhart Tolle – also beloved of Kendrick Lamar – and the intervention of a dietician and counsellor called Courtney Huard, who was subsequently murdered by her husband. Moreover, he announced, Tyler Ballgame wasn’t just a stage name, it was a persona the former Tyler Perry had invented, drawing on his background in drama: playing the part of an “idealised frontman from the 60s and 70s” gave him “the licence to show more” of himself.It’s a dichotomy borne out in his vocal style, which on his debut album is straightforwardly beautiful – a bruised, brooding croon that sweeps into an emotive falsetto as if doing so were the easiest thing in the world – and slightly theatrical. There’s an audible, actorly relish about its mix of careful enunciation and mangled vowels (“mama always told me that the cream wouldroooot” – ie “rot” – he sings on Matter of Taste), and, at its most audibly Elvis-y or Orbison-esque, the faint sense that he’s deliberately courting comparison.Tyler Ballgame: For the First Time, Again – videoSimilarly, the lyrics tend toward open-hearted, no-filter confessional: “I learned your name but missed its meaning when I didn’t know how to feel,” offers the title track, not the last time the album refers to experiencing life anew after the cloud of depression has lifted, albeit haunted by the fear the darkness might return. But there’s something knowing about the music, audibly the work of people with a deep knowledge of 70s singer-songwriters and an understanding of how to recreate their sound. The album was largely recorded live, using old-fashioned analogue methods (every track features audible tape hiss) by producer Jonathan Rado, whose clients include Miley Cyrus, the Killers and, perhaps most pertinently here, 70s-obsessed duo the Lemon Twigs. The sound is warm and punchy, the vocals swaddled in reverb and slapback echo that doesn’t so much evoke 50s rock’n’roll as artists reaching for that sound 20 years later. The vaguely Beatlesque cast to the melody of I Believe in Love (And That’s Fine) is underscored by the vocal being recorded in a way that deliberately evokes the John Lennon of Mind Games or Walls and Bridges.US singer-songwriter Tyler Ballgame: ‘It shocked me out of depression. I had this spiritual awakening’Read moreBallgame’s songwriting is a curious, occasionally jarring mix of earnestness – “look into my eyes and you’ll see it for real – I can only sing how I feel” – and artifice that, like the Bill Withers cosplay of Michael Kiwanuka’s 2012 debut Home Again, is perhaps a little too eager to suggest that its author belongs in a classic rock lineage. Still, the quality of the material is such that the listener is swept along while it plays – the abundance of gorgeous melodies, most notably on Deepest Blue and Waiting So Long; the magical tempo shifts of You’re Not My Baby Tonight – and stagy or not, it’s hard not to find yourself seduced by Ballgame’s voice when it hits a cathartic wordless climax on Goodbye My Love. You can understand why he’s caused so much excitement so quickly, and a certain overeagerness is a perfectly admissible flaw on a debut album. You get the feeling that For the First Time, Again might be a starting point, and that, as happened with Kiwanuka, better might come when Tyler Ballgame takes a step away from his influences.This week Alexis listened toRIP Magic – 5words5words was produced by LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy, and you can see why he views RIP Magic as kindred spirits: a motorik guitar drone ultimately explodes into dancefloor synths.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

The sheer-sided valley is skirted with rugged farmhouses and the road twists, over ravines and round hairpin curves, to a holiday destination that feels like a well-kept secret.On the village’s frozen lake, young families ice skate, hand in hand. A little farther along, on the snow-covered main street, children sled rapidly downhill, overtaking cars. The resort’s mascots are a happy gang of brown bears. And there are Narnia lamp-posts, which turn the falling snow almost gold every evening. Switzerland is replete with ski towns but none feel quite this innocent and childlike, like stepping into a fairytale.South-east Switzerland mapI am here for a week in an apartment with my wife and two kids, as it’s a place my Swiss partner’s parents and grandparents have been returning to for more than a century. What first drew them here? All say the same thing: Arosa is the Swiss mountain village most Swiss don’t even think to visit; a low-key alternative to the box office of St Moritz, Verbier and Zermatt.The village sits on a high, terraced plateau one hour south of Chur, Switzerland’s oldest city, and is surrounded by dense fir forests, above which rises an amphitheatre of saw-cut summits. The sense is that the out-of-sight village has been secretly occupied – the pretty-as-pie peaks standing sentry – as if the first farmers here back in the 14th century feared the Habsburgs might return at any moment to take back their territories.This is also storybook Switzerland to a T. To the north isHeidiland, the farm holiday region where Johanna Spyri set her children’s novels. Also one hour away is Liechtenstein, the pipsqueak principality, which brings to my mind the land of Vulgaria in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Two hours to the north is Zurich where we arrived, before borrowing my in-laws’ car. If you fancy taking the train, there are options to do the trip from the UK to Zurich in as little as seven hours, with a change in Paris. Arosa can then be reached on the memorably scenicRhaetian Railway, a journey with some of the Alps’ most glorious in-seat entertainment. Outside, all the drama is provided by a script of high-definition gorges and glaciers.Strict building regulations, upholding traditional timber aesthetics, mean the village is largely the same now as it was when my relatives first visitedTheArosa Bear Sanctuary, at the middle station of the Weisshorn cable car, is a good place to start exploring. Even during the residents’ winter deep sleep, the 2.8 hectare den offers a walk-through education in animal welfare in an unlikely setting, and its wooden platforms offer memorable views of the snow-fuzzed summits and pistes that lead off in every direction like a spreadeagled skier.The refuge is run in cooperation with global animal charityFour Pawsand it provides four rescued European brown bears a species-appropriate home. Once held in appalling conditions, including a private mini zoo in Albania, the bears’ compound is now a place to readjust, to feel safe again. For the full Yogi and Boo-Boo experience, I’d suggest visiting in summer.View image in fullscreenRhaetian railway passing through snow in Arosa.Photograph: AlamyIt’s fair to say my six-year-old daughter fizzes with enthusiasm when the bears are mentioned, but also when we snowshoe later that week into pine forest along the resort’s themedSquirrel Trail. The trail is printed with fresh squirrel tracks and we add our own, feather-pressing our boots into the crisp snow. The flakes fall heavily, as if we’re inside an ornamental snow globe. Then, two red squirrels scurry past with dark-furred yet sparkling tails.Most days we ski until lunch. All children enjoy one free half-day group lesson for each night’s stay in Arosa withABC Snowsports Schoolor theSwiss Ski and Snowboard School, but we prefer to explore the mountains as a family. Since 2014, the resort has been connected across the gaping Urden valley with the larger town of Lenzerheide, and like other popular Alpine ski areas, the combined piste map is now a profusion of primary colour squiggles.But there the similarity ends. British accents are absent. The pistes are largely empty. Strict building regulations, upholding traditional timber aesthetics, mean the village is largely the same now as it was when my relatives first visited. It is Switzerland, but from a half-century ago. At the barn-likeTschuggenstübli, once a cheese dairy on the slopes, everyone crams on to tables to orderbündnerfleisch(air-dried beef) andkäseschnitte, an upgraded welsh rarebit with melted raclette cheese, pickles and onions.This is not a traditional ski hotel – it's certainly not a vintage chalet brimming with geranium window boxes and mounted antlersAfterwards, it’s toboggan time. It strikes me there are almost as many traditional wooden sledges for hire in Arosa as there are pairs of skis, and, from the top of the Kulm Gondola, the only way is down. And at speed. My kids are barely ruffled by the tight, bobsleigh chicanes and, one afternoon, we all howl with laughter as my eight-year-old son hurtles off the track into a marshmallowy drift. He pops back up, grinning, but polar bear white. We repeat the sledge run another half-dozen times.View image in fullscreenThe Grand Arosa Pop-up Hotel uses a vacant resort hotel.Photograph: Studio Filipa Peixeiro/Le Terrier StudioAnother reason for visiting this winter is to stay atthe Grand Arosa Pop-Up Hotel, a one-year experiment inside a vacant resort hotel which is open to the end of this season – the concept will continue next year, though details are yet to be confirmed (they also operate another pop-up hotel in Fribourg and a pop-up hostel in Zurich). Clues as to its aesthetic are in the name – this is not a ski hotel in the traditional sense, and certainly not a vintage chalet brimming with geranium window boxes and mounted antlers. More than that, it is probably the Alps’ largest ever pop-up hotel and its interiors are bathed in pastel pink. If you can find me cooler ski accommodation this year, I’m happy to wait.With a tech-first approach, there is no reception, but self-check in instructions imposed on a poster of a purple bellboy. What might have once been a telephone operator’s room is reimagined as a walk-in guest book, its fan-print wallpaper covered with whimsical, hand-written comments. Velvet curtains drape two symmetrical elevators, then a cloaked red corridor suggests you are somehow walking backstage at a theatre, before revealing a piano observatory and a vintage design cinema. A Wes Anderson film set has been conjured before you. We only drop in for coffee, but I wish we’d stayed.At the end of our week, my wife mentions to me how sad she is to be leaving. The kids aren’t too happy about it either. Neither am I. It crosses my mind that Arosa, with its sleepy bears, squirrels and surreal pop-up hotel, isn’t what most people come to Switzerland for. Rather, it’s what we’ve been looking for all along.The trip was supported byArosa-Lenzerheide.Singles/doubles atthe Grand Arosa Pop-Up Hotel, from€117 room-only.

The show, according toSheila Dillon, came into being after her interview with Charlie, a fourth-generation fruit and veg supplier at Covent Garden market, for an episode of The Food Programme exploring where chefs bought their produce. Sitting at the kitchen table with her husband the following evening, Sheila recounted her day and Charlie’s enormous knowledge, enthusiasm and ability to communicate both. A few days after that, a similar conversation took place with her colleagues at Radio 4, which resulted in Veg Talk – what’s in and what’s out in the world of fresh produce. As well as Charlie’s market report, each episode included a feature called “vegetable of the week” and the participation of studio guests –Angela Hartnett,Alastair Little,Rose Gray,Darina AllenandMitch Tonks, to name just a few – and took calls from listeners.The show had its critics – in a 2005 interview with the Independent, broadcaster Andy Kershaw is quoted as saying, “This show should have been strangled at birth” – but it also had legions of fans (myself included), who tuned in mostly for Charlie’s expertise accumulated over a lifetime of working the markets, cooking with his wife, Anna, talking to growers and reading, so it was both practical and scholarly. Add to this his sharp humour, easy bantering relationships and warm voice.The next piece in my Charlie jigsaw was provided by the late cooking teacher and gardenerCarla Tomasiin Rome. In the 1980s, Charlie supplied her restaurant Frith’s in Soho and, like so many chefs at the time, Carla was dependent on the excellent produce he sourced, especially because Frith’s, while not an Italian restaurant as such, drew heavily on Carla’s Roman-Marchigiana-Sardinian roots. It was Charlie who could bring her bitter greens, blood oranges, fresh beans, radicchio, rocket, artichokes and puntarelle.Puntarelle was also the reason for my own first contact with Charlie, via Carla and this column. He called me out of the blue when putting together his market report, at the time a newsletter from his greengrocer’s shop. He wanted to talk about puntarelle, orcicoria di catalogna, a member of the chicory family that looks, at first glance, like an elongated head of lettuce with dark serrated outer leaves (very bitter) surrounding a cluster of pale green, succulent and hollow tubes (gently bitter), which have tips not dissimilar to asparagus. It was clear after about six seconds that Charlie was more than familiar with puntarelle, and Carla grew it in her garden just outside Rome, but between them (sponges that they were) they decided I must have had things to say, too.We talked about puntarelle, Roman-style: the inner tubes are sliced into strips, curled in cold water and dressed with anchovy, garlic, olive oil and either lemon or vinegar. We also talked about the outer leaves, especially the smaller ones, which, bitter as they are, make a brilliant addition to salad, especially alongside a sweeter element (apple or persimmon, say); and with cheese, too. I have also added radicchio and a honey dressing.This week’s recipe is a salad by which to remember Charlie.Puntarelle, radicchio, celery, apple and cheeseServes41 headpuntarelle, or frisée1 small headradicchio2celery stalks1 crisp red apple½ lemon100gcheese– pecorino, grana padano asiago, manchego6 tbsp olive oil1 tbspred-wine vinegar2 tsprunny honeySalt100gwalnut halvesFirst, trim the puntarelle. Pull away the dark outer leaves, discarding any that are tough or damaged, then pull apart the paler inner tubes, cut off the tough ends and slice the tubes into short lengths or on an angle. Break the radicchio into leaves. Wash everything, then dry and rip larger leaves into manageable bits.Pull off and discard the strings from the celery stalks, then slice thinly on an angle. Don’t peel the apple, but quarter it, pare away and discard the core, then thinly slice the quarters, rubbing them over with the lemon so they don’t discolour. Use a potato peeler to cut off thin, uneven slices of cheese.In the bottom of a large bowl, whisk the olive oil, vinegar, honey and a pinch of salt. Add the leaves, toss really well, then add the celery, apple and walnuts, and toss again. Add half the cheese, toss once more, then turn out the salad on to a large platter or four small plates, top with the remaining cheese and serve at once.Explore more on these topicsSaladA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkFoodrecipesShareReuse this content"
