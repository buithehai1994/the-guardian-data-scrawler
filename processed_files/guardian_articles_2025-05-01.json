This year the runes will be harder to read because so many of the councils that are up are Conservative councils in Conservative areas. Few of the big cities are up, although some university cities and towns will be voting.In contrast, the results will probably be read as judgment on the performance of the new Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch. The last time these council seats were contested, in most cases, was in 2021, when the Conservatives under Boris Johnson were riding high in the polls on “the vaccine boost”, and before the partygate scandal started to dent their popularity.A poll last month, with a big sample size, suggested thatthe Tories would have fewer councillors elected on 1 May than Reform. Nigel Farage’s party won two council seats in 2021, and neither of those are up this year.Neither of the two incumbent Labour combined authority mayors, in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough and in West of England, is standing again. This year’s election in the two seats will be a first-past-the-post election; in 2021 supplementary vote was used."

It would mark the first permission of its kind since Trump paused all Ukraine-related military aid shortly after taking office.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Thursday evening that the signing of the long-discussed minerals deal – on much better terms for Ukraine than had previously been expected – was a result of the meeting he held with Trumpon the sidelines of the pope’s funeralon Saturday.“Now we have the first result of the Vatican meeting, which makes it really historic. We are waiting for other results of the meeting,” he said, in his nightly video address.Zelenskyy hailed the deal as “truly equal”, saying it created “an opportunity for quite significant investment in Ukraine”.A senior aide saidKyivhoped that weapons deliveries would resume swiftly. “There is no direct link where it’s written that ‘you will receive these particular weapons’, but it opens the possibility for parallel talks on the purchase of weapons,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, an aide to Zelenskyy, during an interview in Kyiv. “The American side is now open to these discussions,” he added.Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, signed the agreement in Washington on Wednesday, along with the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Senior US officials told reporters that they expected Ukraine’s parliament to ratify the deal within a week. The agreement will see a joint fund set up by the two countries, to be financed from new licenses to exploit deposits of critical minerals, oil and gas.0:57White House lauds 'historic' US-Ukraine minerals deal – videoAfter several weeks when Trump appeared to be soft onRussiaand harsh towards Ukraine, authorities in Kyiv hope the dynamic may be changing. Zelenskyy said on Thursday the minerals agreement had “changed significantly during the process” and that it was “now a really equal agreement which allows for investment in Ukraine”.Most notably, it excludes from its remit money previously sent to Ukraine as military and humanitarian aid, which Trump had repeatedly said he hoped to recoup. It also explicitly states that it should be implemented in a way that does not hamper Ukraine’s integration with the EU and that US companies will not have a monopoly on deals in Ukraine, but merely obtain the right to take part in competitive bids on fair terms.The final document followed almost three months of back-and-forth negotiation, after the first outline was brought to Kyiv by Bessent and rejected by Zelenskyy as far too punitive to sign. A later signing ceremony was planned at the White House in February, but broke down afterTrump and JD Vance turned on Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, prompting an abrupt conclusion of talks and the Ukrainian president being asked to leave.Asked how Kyiv had been able to improve the terms of the minerals deal, Podolyak claimed that the actual discussions had proceeded in a very different tone to some of Trump’s public statements.“That’s just the style of this [US] administration, it’s very aggressive with communications. They will allow leaks of the most horrible conditions and so on, but then in reality they negotiate normally and you can achieve a result,” he said. “They just use this aggression to try to improve their starting position,” he added.Podolyak said that because US weapons supplied would now need to be bought, Kyiv would need to be more selective about what it requested from the US. “I think fairly quickly we will understand which types of weapons, to carefully select the unique weapons the US has. Because if we can produce our own drones, for example, then we will do that here. But there are some critical weapon types which only the US produces and nobody else,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In March, Waltzinadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, to aSignal group chatthat shared sensitive information about US missile strikes in Yemen before they took place.Trump announced in a Truth Social post later on Thursday that he would name his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, to also take on the job of the national security adviser on an interim basis, and that he would nominate Waltz to be the US ambassador to the United Nations.The president briefly considered firing Waltz over the Signal episode, but decided he did not want the media to claim the ouster of a cabinet official weeks into his second term. Trump was alsomollified by an internal reviewthat found Waltz mistakenly saved the Atlantic editor’s number.The furore over the Signal group chat, if anything, was widely seen to have bought Waltz and Wong additional time after they had both been on shaky ground for weeks. That was in large part because of a strained working relationship with Trump’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and other top officials.The interpersonal difficulties extended to Wong, according to a person directly familiar with the ousters. Wong frustrated some officials at other agencies who were involved in national security matters and complained to people in the West Wing that Waltz refused to rein him in, the person said.In the days after the Signal group chat episode, Waltz sought advice from JD Vance and others in the vice-president’s circle about how to reset relations. Vance counseled Waltz to be more deferential to Wiles, who had pushed for him to get the job, and throw around his weight less.But Waltz also came under fire from other quarters. Even though he was cleared in the internal review into Signalgate, as it came to be known, Waltz faced pressure for being seen as a war hawk and at odds with Trump’s “America first” agenda.View image in fullscreenSusie Wiles and Mike Waltz in the Oval Office on, 14 April.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersThat included scrutiny at a dinner that Waltz attended with Trump and some of Trump’s allies including Tucker Carlson, who has been skeptical of the adviser. The outside pressure campaign to remove Waltz additionally included an effort led by Steve Bannon, the people said.And the far-right activistLaura Loomer, who pushed a conspiracy theory that Wong had loyalties to China, weakened Waltz’s power after she went to the White House last month at Trump’s invitation and successfully pushed for Trump to fire a number of Waltz’s staffers.The gutting of Waltz’s staff was widely seen to have weakened his position inside Trump’s orbit. As Carlson, Bannon and Loomer separately pushed a whisper campaign that Waltz would be out before June, officials in the White House concurred that Waltz’s influence was waning.This week, it was quietly made clear to Waltz and Wong that their time at the national security council would be coming to an end. Waltz tried to extend his tenure by attending a cabinet meeting on Wednesday but was informed of his removal on Thursday, one of the people said.The removal of Waltz was so abrupt that it only became clear to many in the White House on Thursday morning. Waltz appeared to sense something was going on before he appeared on Fox News in the morning, but he did not know that he was being pushed out, a person familiar with the matter said.With Waltz departing just months into the job – having left behind a safe seat in Congress – the national security council has been left without an overarching strategy. Ordinarily, the national security adviser develops a strategy by hashing out plans with other agencies over months.The US strategy for some major foreign national security issues, including how to engage with China on thorny issues such as its posture towards Taiwan, its priorities in the Indo-Pacific region and adversarial military plans against allies, remains a work in progress.And with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Waltz had pressed Trump to hit Russian Vladimir Putin with deep, punitive sanctions if he failed to agree to a peace deal being brokered by Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff. That sort of moderate recommendation in policy discussions may also be gone with Waltz’s removal.National security adviser Michael Waltz reportedly conducted business via GmailRead moreThe top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, welcomed the firing but said that the defense secretary,Pete Hegseth, was most deserving of losing his job.“They should fire him, but they’re firing the wrong guy. They should be firing Hegseth,” the minority leader told reporters at the Capitol.He accused Republicans of confirming a defense secretary who was unfit for the job, and predicted scandals similar to Signalgate – where Hegseth, Waltz and other national security officials shared details of airstrikes in Yemen in a group chat – would happen in the future.“They fired the [national security council] guy, but there are going to be many more problems, just like Signalgate that come out of the defense department, as long as Hegseth is in charge. This is not a one-off. This is going to happen over and over and over again.”Trump’s move to name Rubio the interim national security adviser took officials at the state department by surprise. Tammy Bruce, the spokesperson for the state department, appeared to learn about the decision from a reporter during a news conference in real time.The appointment means Rubio has taken on a total of four positions in the administration. In addition to being secretary of state and interim national security adviser, he is also currently serving as the acting USAID administrator and the acting national archivist.Chris Stein contributedreportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsSignal group chat leakUS national securitynewsShareReuse this content"

They remain the only unbeaten team among the more than 100 that have played this competition over eight long months, and even if they do fall to a first in seven days’ time, the margin of this victory means they should still be there on its final game in this same arena, the season given meaning and potentially a triumphant end, the Europa League their elixir andtheir escape once again.They came to the stadium everyone calls the Cathedral and defeatedAthletic Bilbaoso convincingly that the second leg carries little threat. No one had won here this year in Europe and Athletic had conceded just 10 times in all competitions; United scored three in a quarter of an hour, an opening goal from Casemiro and two from Bruno Fernandes ending this before half-time. All the more so because the second came from the spot, accompanied by a red card for Dani Vivian, infuriating the home supporters and virtually ensuring that they will not play the final they host on 21 May.Ruben Amorim says Athletic Bilbao win is ‘best result’ of his time in charge so farRead moreUltimately this was an efficient, impressive performance in which United looked something like the team they are supposed to be: one that can win a European title that has become their salvation and a glimpse, perhaps, of future hope, not least as it would give them Champions League access. One that ended up looking on a different level to their opponents, even if it hadn’t started that way.In fact, Athletic began well, forcing the first corner and the first roar inside 90 seconds. United’s early possession was not so much a platform for them to do something as for Athletic to, ready to asphyxiate their opponents and accelerate with the robbed ball.That front-footed approach, though, did expose them to the ball behind and just four minutes in, Manuel Ugarte released Alejandro Garnacho to finish. That was offside, but it was also a warning, an invitation to United to seek the same wing.André Onana had to save from Alex Berenguer, Iñaki Williams headed just over and when the Ghana international then raced up the right and pulled back, Victor Lindelöf made two decisive interceptions – the second on the line with Berenguer shooting from five yards.That should have been the opener; instead, having resisted the pressure, it was United who got it just before the half hour. Ruben Amorim admitted that the first 25 minutes were not the same as the rest, the game changing with the opening goals and the red card.The first goal was made by United’s unlikely hero doing unlikely things, more unlikely even than last time. Harry Maguire, the emergency striker who had completed thatastonishing comeback against Lyon, smacking in a header on 121 minutes, now went all Stanley Matthews. If that had been latter-day Ronaldo, this was more like his teenage incarnation.Faced by Mikel Jauregizar on the right, Maguire turned one way and the next, went past his man and delivered the cross. Ugarte headed it on and, at the far post, Casemiro arrived to nod into the net.United doubled their lead two minutes later, and in a way that gave them even more of an advantage than the goal they scored. Again, it started on the right, where United had always identified opportunity.When the ball from Noussair Mazraoui came across the six yard box, Rasmus Højlund went down. Vivian accused him of diving but the defender was protesting too much. Højlund may have been quick to go to ground but there had been a clear hand on his shoulder and when the referee Espen Eskås came back from the VAR screen he pointed to the spot and pulled out a red card, double jeopardy doing for Athletic.Vivian departed, Fernandes rolled in the penalty and this, it seemed, was done. Iñaki Williams did bend a shot wide but Athletic appeared gone and United added a third. Højlund scrambled for the ball, Ugarte provided the clever flick and Fernandes ran through to finish high. The lead might even have extended still further before half-time, when Mazraoui smashed one off the bar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, United controlled this, never in danger. They managed it with a certain comfort, a sense of superiority, and the threat, if not the need, of extending the lead still further.There was another penalty appeal from Højlund, tangling with Yuri Berchiche. Ugarte and Casemiro both took aim from distance and the Brazilian put a header against the post. The frequency increased in the final 10 minutes, Julen Agirrezabala saving from Garnacho and Fernandes before Fernandes headed over and Højlund’s shot didn’t find the target.Iñaki Williams had gone sprinting up the pitch, the noise from San Mamés rising as he ran, but Athletic were exhausted, defeated, and those chances were a reminder that this could still get worse.ForManchester United, despite not adding the fourth, the night in Bilbao could hardly have been any better, and they will surely be back.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueAthletic BilbaoManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

People living in the 20% most deprived areas of England were twice as likely to be admitted to hospital for respiratory diseases, seven times as likely for tuberculosis and six times for measles, than their counterparts from the least deprived areas.Chart showing rates of hospital admissions for infectious diseases by quintile of deprivationThe analysis also revealed stark ethnic inequalities. Although admission rates were low overall for tuberculosis, emergency hospital admissions for the disease were 15 times higher for people from a black African background compared with those categorised as white British.It was also estimated that these inequalities in emergency admissions for infectious diseases cost theNHSin England between £970m and £1.5bn in 2022-23.Chart showing rates of hospital admissions for infectious diseases by ethnic groupProf David Taylor-Robinson, an academic co-director at Health Equity North and professor of public health and policy at the University of Liverpool, said: “This report echoes past research showing that deprived communities, typically in the North of England, bear the brunt of health inequalities.“It is particularly troubling to see the high number of hospital admissions due to infectious diseases, especially as some of these are preventable diseases.”Doctors urge government to fight poverty after rise in patients with Victorian diseasesRead moreHe added: “Our previous analysis has shown that childhood vaccine uptake in England has plummeted among the most disadvantaged families. This is against a backdrop of cuts to local government, pressures on the NHS, and the growing number of children living in poverty.“Protecting children from vaccine-preventable diseases should be a public health priority, otherwise we will see more hospitalisations and deaths from these entirely preventable diseases.”Dr Leonora Weil, the interim deputy director for health equity and inclusion at UKHSA, said the report revealed some “stark” facts on the state of inequalities in health security faced by some people, “in particular those living in the most deprived communities and certain areas of the country, some ethnic groups, as well as excluded groups such as those experiencing homelessness.“These health-protection inequalities – where there are poorer health outcomes based on where you live, your socioeconomic status or ethnicity – are avoidable, pervasive and preventable. That is why it is so important to shine a light on these findings to increase action to support communities to live longer and in better health.”She added: “This report is just the start. We need to build on these insights, as only through persistent and dedicated effort across all health organisations will we make a real difference to helping all people live longer and in better health.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This shocking report shows the appalling healthcare inequalities this government inherited.“Our Plan for Change is reforming the NHS to get it back on its feet so it is there for everyone, regardless of who they are or where they live. We have hit the ground running, delivering an extra 3 million appointments since July to cut waiting lists.Explore more on these topicsHealthInequalityNHSEnglandPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

She added that the ICRC played a vital role in protecting and promoting the lives and dignity of the victims of arms conflict.The UK lawyers also clashed with Israel by insisting that Unrwa, the UN’s Palestinian relief agency, should be regarded as a neutral and impartial body with which the Israeli government had a duty to cooperate to provide aid to the Palestinian people.Langrish said: “Israel must facilitate full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian provision to the population of Gaza, including food, water and electricity, and must ensure access to medical care in accordance with international humanitarian law.”Her submission reflected a UK government determination to stand by international law even if it caused severe political difficulties with its close ally Israel. It also exposed clear legal differences with arguments put to the courtby the US the day before.Israel has mounted a total blockade of aid into Gaza since 2 March, leading to mounting reports of desperation among its 2 million people. The ICJ has been asked by the UN general assembly to give an advisory opinion on Israel’s obligations to allow aid into Gaza, and on its duty to cooperate with UN bodies, notably Unrwa.Gaza on brink of catastrophe as aid runs out and prices soar, groups warnRead moreIsrael, along with its chief legal backer, the US, claims ending all cooperation with Unrwa is justified since under the Geneva conventions it is required to facilitate only the provision of aid with neutral bodies, a description it said Unrwa had forfeited because of alleged infiltration by Hamas.More than 40 countries and bodies, including the UN itself, are giving oral submissions to the UN’s top court.Dismissing Israeli claims that Unrwa was a Hamas front, Langrish said: “The United Kingdom considers that Unrwa is an impartial humanitarian organisation for the purposes of article 59 of the fourth Geneva convention. Insofar as impartiality is understood as meaning neutrality, Unrwa also satisfies that requirement.”She said Israel was bound under article 59 as the occupying power “to facilitate the provision of food, stuff, medical supplies and clothing into the occupied Palestinian territories”.“That obligation continues to apply for so long as part of the population is inadequately supplied. A refusal to negotiate or agree to relief schemes will constitute a violation of article 59,” she said. “This obligation is unconditional. Facilitation requires wholehearted cooperation in the rapid and scrupulous execution of these schemes. This includes the provision of transport, storage and distribution facilities.”She also pointed out that under article 55, for Israel to meet its obligations to provide relief through a third party such as Unrwa, “the occupying power must ensure the safety and security of that third party as far as possible”.Israel, she argued, had only a limited right to choose the agency to distribute aid.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

He estimates it will come crashing in at 150mph (242km/h), if it remains intact.“While not without risk, we should not be too worried,” Langbroek said in an email.The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn’t break apart, “the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,” he said.Nasa criticises China after space rocket makes uncontrolled return to EarthRead moreThe chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. “But it cannot be completely excluded.”The Soviet Union launched the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth orbit because of a rocket malfunction.Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself — a spherical object about 3ft (1 metre) in diameter — has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.It’s quite possible that the 1,000lb-plus (nearly 500kg) spacecraft will survive re-entry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, Jonathan McDowell at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, “it’ll re-enter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky”.The spacecraft could re-enter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America’s Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, “chances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean”, Langbroek said.In 2022, a Chinese booster rocket made an uncontrolled return to Earth and in 2018 the Tiangong-1 space station re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere over the south Pacific after anuncontrolled re-entry.Explore more on these topicsSpaceRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

So all I can do is turn up.”The concert, titled Back to the Beginning and held at the band’s beloved Villa Park in Birmingham, features an all-star supporting lineup of metal greats including Metallica, Slayer and Anthrax. But this week, the frontman of another supporting act, Tool, voiced doubt about Osbourne’s ability to perform.“I’m cautious about saying, ‘Yeah! All in, he’s gonna do it’,” Maynard James Keenan said. “I don’t know what kind of modern miracles we’ll come up with to get him on stage to do the songs, but this is gonna be a challenge for them. So, I’m honoured to be a part of it, but I’m kinda preparing for the worst, but hoping for the best.”Osbourne has experienced an extraordinary run of back luck with his health in recent years, including a 2019 fall that exacerbated an earlier spinal injury, requiring numerous surgeries. He has also suffered pneumonia and a longstanding infection, and has been diagnosed witha form of Parkinson’s.Speaking to the Guardian, he acknowledged the psychological toll: “You wake up the next morning and find that something else has gone wrong. You begin to think this is never going to end.” He said the reunion concert was conceived by his wife, Sharon, as “something to give me a reason to get up in the morning”.View image in fullscreenThe original lineup of Black Sabbath: Tony Iommi, Ozzy Osbourne, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyBack to the Beginning will reunite Osbourne with his original Black Sabbath bandmates for the first time in 20 years: guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward. After forming in 1968 in Birmingham, the almighty weight of their sound, topped with Osbourne’s penetrating holler, ushered in an entire genre of heavy metal and resulted in classic albums such as Paranoid and Master of Reality. Osbourne left in 1979, then returned in 1997. The classic lineup played together until 2005, continuing without Ward for further tours and a final studio album, 2013’s 13.Osbourne detailed his preparation for the reunion concert to the Guardian. “I do weights, bike riding, I’ve got a guy living at my house who’s working with me. It’s tough – I’ve been laid up for such a long time. I’ve been lying on my back doing nothing and the first thing to go is your strength. It’s like starting all over again. I’ve got a vocal coach coming round four days a week to keep my voice going. I have problems walking. I also get blood pressure issues, from blood clots on my legs. I’m used to doing two hours on stage, jumping and running around. I don’t think I’ll be doing much jumping or running around this time. I may be sitting down.”He said he won’t be performing a full set. “We’re only playing a couple of songs each. I don’t want people thinking ‘we’re getting ripped off’, because it’s just going to be … what’s the word? … a sample, you’re going to get a few songs each by Ozzy and Sabbath.”Elsewhere in the Guardian interview, the other band members speak about their own reasons for returning, and Sharon details her and Ozzy’s plans for retirement.The concert, on 5 July, will raise funds for three charities: Cure Parkinson’s, Birmingham Children’s Hospital and the Birmingham-based Acorns Children’s Hospice.Explore more on these topicsOzzy OsbourneBlack SabbathMetalPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

The bill would only allow terminally ill people with fewer than six months to live to end their lives.The document, which has been prepared by civil servants, will also assess equality and human rights issues.The timing of the release has caused some anger among MPs who suggested the report was being deliberately released to coincide with the aftermath of the local elections. But one government source denied it was a deliberate comms ploy. “When something like this is ready, you can’t sit on it,” they said.The Labour MP Meg Hillier, whovoted against the bill, said: “Releasing this long-delayed impact assessment while MPs are focused on local election counts far from Westminster and only weeks before the bill comes back to parliament is another example of the failure of this process to live up to the promises made to MPs at second reading.“This is a weighty piece of legislation, with significant changes from second reading, such as theremoval of the high court judge. It’s essential that MPs have a real opportunity for proper scrutiny and improvement to do justice to a bill of such consequence and to all those potentially impacted by it.”MPs will vote again on the private member’s bill, sponsored by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, on 16 May after it was delayed by three weeks to avoid a clash with local elections and allow more time for the impact assessment to be prepared.The Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, is said to have resisted calls for the final Commons stage to be wrapped up that day and – should the bill pass in May – a final vote is expected on 13 June.Campaigners who oppose the change have stepped up efforts in recent weeks to get wavering MPs to change their minds and vote against the bill in a fortnight’s time.Labour MPs organised a “committee of the unheard” with campaigners against the bill who were not among those experts chosen to give evidence to the bill’s scrutiny committee. The bill had a majority of 55 at the last parliamentary vote, needing 28 MPs to change sides.But those in favour of the bill believe there are few who are changing their minds – just two have gone public so far.“Every media outlet that is looking to run ‘support draining away’ stories has so far failed to identify a single MP other than two from Reform who have switched to opposing the bill,” one of those backing the bill said.“MPs now have the chance to examine a bill that has been made even stronger and safer when it returns to the Commons on 16 May. They will make their own minds up and not be influenced by opponents who claim to know what they think but don’t.”The government has taken a neutral position on the bill, with MPs voting according to their conscience. Plans are being drawn up in the Department ofHealthand Social Care for the care minister, Stephen Kinnock, to take over the implementation of the bill should it pass the Commons. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has said he opposes the bill.Since the initial vote, the high court’s role in approving assisted deaths has been scrapped and replaced by a panel of experts. Additionally, the implementation period has been doubled to a maximum of four years for an assisted dying service to be in place.The legislation argues that someone in England andWaleswho is terminally ill, with fewer than six months to live, should be legally allowed to end their life, as long as it has been approved by two doctors and an expert panel.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingNHSHealthEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

I said, ‘Yeah, mine’s beating pretty fast too’.”The three men had used crab rakes – a garden rake-like tool for digging small crabs from sand – to move the shark into deeper water by the time the father and son arrived.Core said he decided against pushing the shark himself.“They … got it into deeper water where I thought it’s probably not a good idea to go any further. That’s its territory and I’ll stay back,” he said.Core said the rescuers later told him they had never seen a beached shark before.Macquarie University wildlife scientist Vanessa Pirotta said while shark strandings were not common, they were becoming more visible through social media.There could be a number of reasons why marine animals like sharks might strand, including illness and injury. The shark could also have chased prey into the shallows, Pirotta said.“If you see something like this, human safety comes first and foremost,” Pirotta said. “You can contact environmental authorities … who will get someone appropriate to come and assist.”Explore more on these topicsSouth AustraliaSharksAnimalsMarine lifenewsShareReuse this content"

My sister Amy and I knelt down, touched him, and asked if he was okay.“I don’t know,” mumbled Dad, 96, a retired physician and lifelong outdoorsman. “I fell about 20 minutes ago and no one has come.”I went for help. Out in the common area, there were no caregiving staff anywhere. I found an administrator and the nurse, who came and briskly hoisted him into his easy chair, where he’d spent most of his time staring out the window at a slice of the mountains. Then they left.I hugged Dad and noticed he was bleeding profusely from a skin tear on his arm. The nurse hadn’t so much as given him a quick once-over. He sat there dazed, his face stubbled, wearing the same stained and rumpled shirt he’d had on for most of the week, even though until his recent move to the facility he had always been impeccably groomed. He had already fallen several times while at the facility, often while trying to make it to the toilet when no one came to help him, or sliding out of bed. Sometimes, he hit his head.His cognitive and physical decline in just two months had been dramatic. Though he’d been living on his own in a senior community, recent falls and dementia had made it unsafe for him to continue to live alone. My two sisters and I attributed some of his rapid downturn to the falls, and some, perhaps, to the sleep medications the staff been doling out at 6pm, presumably so they didn’t have to deal with him during his often-confused “sundown syndrome” hours in the evening.This indifferent care belied the promises of the establishment’s website, which portrayed a warm and engaging environment where caregivers chatted with residents and offered companionship and comfort: “Your care team is always on hand to help – as little or as much as you need.”Instead, Cindy had to visit for hours every day to help Dad, trying to prod administrators and overworked staff to give him more of the promised care for which we were paying dearly, but without making so much fuss that they’d evict him. She was stressed, and we were all heartbroken that aside from family visits, Dad was spending his last days lonely, helpless and bored, at the mercy of a company that seemed to be doing more warehousing than care.After a lifetime of helping others as a ship’s doctor in the navy, a pediatrician, a physician on Native American reservations and a volunteer for numerous organizations, he deserved better.View image in fullscreenCharles Fraser, MD, was a ship’s doctor and lieutenant in the navy in the early 1950s.Photograph: Picasa/Courtesy of the Fraser FamilyPerhaps we shouldn’t have been surprised. Our late mother had spent her career advocating for the rights of nursing home and assisted living residents as the long-term care ombudsman for the state ofColorado. She knew everything about the industry – the good, the ugly – and had tried to set up my parents’ end-of-life plan to be the best possible for their quality of life.After she learned she had Parkinson’s disease, she convinced Dad to sell their home of 40 years to buy into a continuing care retirement community with landscaped gardens, sweeping mountain views, several dining rooms, and a wide array of activities. They had an independent apartment, but Mom knew she might eventually need to move to assisted living while Dad stayed “home” nearby. Instead, she died suddenly of an enormous stroke – mercifully, it now seems – and left Dad living alone in his independent living apartment for the next 13 years.Dad developed memory difficulties in his 90s – “Perfectly normal for my age,” he’d chuckle – and would occasionally fall, though he still exercised every day. Fiercely independent, he resisted hiring a health aide. At 96, a serious fall landed him in the hospital, and then a Medicare-reimbursed rehabilitation unit. After two weeks, the staff pronounced him ready to leave, but said he would require full-time skilled nursing to stay in his apartment, at over $1,000 a day. Frugal, and comfortably well-off but not wealthy, Dad balked. We asked the continuing care community to move him to the assisted living section on the premises, as the contract promised. But there was no room at the inn, and a long waiting list. That hadn’t been part of my parents’ plan.View image in fullscreenCharles Fraser and his wife, Virginia, loved the outdoors. She was an advocate for the rights of the elderly.We had only a few days to find him somewhere to go. As the introduction toNursing Homes: Getting Good Care There, which my mom co-authored, put it: “Virtually every decision to select a nursing home, personally or by the family, is crisis-driven.” The same can be said of assisted living. Neither my sisters nor I could manage having Dad at home – Cindy was already taking care of a husband with cancer, Amy works full-time, and I live in an apartment 1,000 miles away; but mostly, Dad’s medical needs also precluded having him at home.Currently,about 65% of US eldersare cared for by their families at home. For 13% of those who aren’t living with family, the gap is partially filled by assisted living establishments.For decades, small, private “board-and-care” homes have existed, run by communities and religious groups, and designed for elders who can no longer live independently or with family but don’t require the round-the-clock medical care of a nursing home. Typically they have autonomous rooms, shared dining, and caretakers on hand.“The values of assisted living tapped into what older people and everybody wants: independence, joy, privacy and dignity,” said Paula Carder, director of the Institute on Aging at Portland State University. But by the 1980s and 1990s, many of those mom-and-pop places were sold to corporations that ran chains of these homes, and often those core values changed. “Some folks got into it with good intentions, and some got into it thinking they were going to make a lot of money,” Carder said. By 2022 the industry was valued at $91.8bn in the US, growing, with the ageing population, at about 5% a year.Nursing homes, assisted living and memory care (special units for people with dementia) are interchangeable in many people’s minds. But there are big differences. Nursing homes, funded by Medicare and Medicaid, are federally regulated. Assisted living and memory care are state-regulated, and mostly paid for out of pocket; some states have subsidies for certain conditions, so about 20% of all assisted living costs are paid for by Medicaid. Themedian cost of care in the US is $5,900 a month, but ancillary services provided on top of that base rate, including extra skilled nursing care, and can bring that cost up to $20,000 a month.Given the hefty fees, most residents are middle to upper-middle class; there are few decent options for people who can’t sell their homes or don’t have savings, or whose resources run out before they die (outside a few residences around the country run by non-profit and religious groups around the country). Almost 20% of people in these communities receive some Medicaid for services, but not for room and board.View image in fullscreenJohanna Meneses walks down the hallway to see her patient at Twilight Gardens in Norwalk, Ohio. Meneses was recruited from the Philippines to fill in the nursing shortages.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesCindy began checking out several communities and nursing homes near her home, an hour away, where she and Dad’s grandchildren and great-grandchildren could visit. The nursing homes were grim, with an institutional feel, shared rooms and a bathroom down the hall. We wanted a place with a private room and a view of the mountains he’d spent a lifetime exploring, a place where he’d feel content.“A lot of people tell me they’d rather die than go into a nursing home,” said Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition. “Assisted living on its face provides a tremendously attractive alternative – the promise of a homelike environment that is not institutional, where you’ll be safe, monitored, and get the services you need now and as you get older,” he said. “Unfortunately, too often those promises are broken.”That’s due to a lot of factors that we didn’t understand when we were seeking a place for Dad: staffing shortages, the increased medical and psychological needs of residents, sparse and varied regulations, and, often, corporate environments that prioritize profits over resident care and quality of life.A lot of people tell me they’d rather die than go into a nursing homeRichard MollotAssisted living and memory care communities are covered by a range of 350 licensing regulations that vary widely from state to state – but with little oversight or enforcement of what few regulations exist. Most regulations don’t require minimum staffing ratios, or are worded as “sufficient” to meet residents’ needs. While this standard is vague, some advocates say that being more prescriptive would be problematic given staffing availability, costs and residents’ needs. Caregivers are typically required to have only a few hours’ training; only about half of communities employ a nurse, usually voluntarily. State and regional long-term care ombudsmen have the right to enter and investigate and informally mediate complaints at these residences, but they have no ability to enforce regulations, other than making a complaint to the state licensing agency.In 2001, my mother resigned after 21 years as the director of the Colorado long-term care ombudsman program, which she grew from her sole position to 40 paid and 100 volunteer staff. She had faced political fallout when the corporate owners of several assisted living homes – big donors to the then governor – refused to allow her staff entrance to their facilities to respond to complaints because they were private-pay, even though state regulations guaranteed the ombudsman that access. Then the state’s department of human services made moves to muzzle the ombudsman from talking to the press or lobbying. Twenty years later, with the growth and increased corporatization of the industry, these lobbies only wield more political influence.Today, state regulations are even less aligned with residents’ changing needs, which are becoming more acute as more people live longer. More than half, like Dad, are over 85, about 40% have some sort of dementia, and many have complex medical conditions that require advanced care. “The people who live in assisted living now are people who would have been in nursing homes 20 years ago,” said Sheryl Zimmerman, the executive director of the Center for Excellence in Assisted Living and a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Of the 1.3 million people in the US who live in long-term care facilities – now more than half are in one of 30,000 assisted living communities.In many cases, assisted living facilities neither assist their residents as much as they need, or help them live full lives, she said. “There’s a lot of room to reimagine assisted living and do things differently.”When we searched for somewhere for Dad, it was hard to find reliable information.A Place for Mom, one of the biggest websites for evaluating senior communities, is hardly unbiased: it says its service “is provided at no cost to families because it is paid for by the senior living communities and home care providers in its network”. We didn’t think we could rely on a pay-to-play website to find a reliable home for Dad.We ended up signing up at Sunrise Senior Living, which we didn’t realize was one of the largest corporate-owned chains, with more than 240 communities in the US and Canada. The place was good on paper: it was fresh, breezy and well-appointed, with a private room with a view. We ignored the sign outside that said: “Help wanted, will train,” a red flag for staffing issues. In fact, no one told us about staffing ratios, how frequently they’d check on him, how often he’d get a shower, or whether they’d cut his ragged toenails – and we were in such a panic to find a place that we didn’t think to ask. We just felt lucky we’d found Dad a place that seemed nice, near his family.It’s the chandelier syndrome. “People are sold on the physical property,” said Tony Chicotel, an attorney at California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. “A lot of these corporations are making beautiful buildings with scenic views, fountains, and a shuttle bus out front, but when it comes to helping people get off the toilet, the mundane tasks that should be routine and have a lot to do with dignity and the quality of your life, they’re not there to do those things.”Instead, he said, it may be the six-bed family-run places that might not look as glamorous on the outside, but where the people doing the work are less resentful because they actually keep the profit, where residents get better care – though there’s no guarantee.Before Dad moved, he and I met with the executive director and nurse of the assisted living community in his rehab facility for an assessment. They asked him questions about his life with real interest, which was comforting. I told them Dad needed about the level of care he was experiencing in rehab: people checking frequently, waiting patiently when he needed help with the toilet (“that’s what we’re here for, Doc!”), taking him to physical therapy, playing memory games, stopping by with a cheerful hello and a glass of juice. They nodded assurances. They didn’t question whether Dad’s needs were more than they could provide, or suggest he should go to a nursing home.The price for a room was about $6,500 a month. That was expensive, but far less than $1,000 a day that it would have cost for a home care aide to keep him in his apartment in the continuing care community. But we didn’t know there would be a lot of extra costs: a “Plus Plus” care plan for $113 a day, daily fees for giving medications ($23) and incontinence care ($8, not including adult diapers). Sunrise didn’t specify what it provided for the extra “Plus Plus” charge, and we assumed it meant caretakers spending more time with him and checking on him. But the small print on Sunrise’s website says that increased charges triggered by assessments don’t necessarily change the amount of care residents receive: “Sunrise does not guarantee that it will adjust staffing levels whenever a new resident is admitted or an existing resident has needs that change,” it reads. “Sunrise does not guarantee that any resident will receive a specific number of minutes or amount of care on any given day or time period.”It totaled out to about $11,000 a month, nearly double what we’d expected.“With a for-profit company and private pay, the slightest thing they do for residents, they’re going to charge extra money,” said Charlene Harrington, a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco School of Nursing who studies long-term care facilities. “They jack up prices over and over again, and there’s nothing the residents or families can do about it. Once the person is in there, it’s very hard to move them again.”View image in fullscreenCharles and Virginia Fraser were married for 60 years before she died suddenly of a stroke.Photograph: Courtesy of the Fraser FamilyChicotel, the elder care attorney, frequently hears complaints from assisted living residents that they not only get charged for extras – residents at one facility, for example, reported being charged extra for having their food cut up, for getting more than one shower a week, even a fee for not buying medications through the facility’s often more expensive pharmacy – but they’re frequently reassessed for a higher level of care and charged even more. “Then nothing changes. They still don’t respond to the call lights,” said Chicotel. “And when the resident needs help, they feel belittled. They’re not leading with love.”Indeed, once when my father didn’t use his call button when he fell, my sister asked why. “They chided me for doing it,” he said. “I felt like it was an intrusion.”After two frustrating months, we considered moving Dad again, but we weren’t sure he’d survive the disruption. Instead, we began looking to hire someone to assist Dad in assisted living, which seemed absurd.When my sister brought her concerns to the executive director, she first told her they’d been having troubles with the call light system. Later, she admitted they had staffing shortages. This is a problem at almost all assisted living facilities; one2022 surveyshowed that two-thirds of administrators reported moderate or high staffing shortages, and 90% of them found it difficult to hire new staff.It’s a hard and thankless job, caring for old people who may be incontinent, fall down, have dementia that may make them aggressive, and suffer many other physical and emotional needs – a job that few people with other options want.The typical worker makes about $15 an hour, is on duty 36 hours a week and works for a for-profit company, testified Jennifer Craft Morgan, director of the Gerontology Institute at Georgia State University, at a hearing on assisted living facilities before the US Senate’s special committee on ageing last January. Most are women, people of color and immigrants (staff shortages will probably increase further if Donald Trump has his way with mass deportations).Workers in long-term care facilities, Morgan said, “experience low wages, few benefits, heavy workloads, dangerous jobs, and little to no career mobility”. Many of them, she said, go into the line of work because they value elders or feel it’s a calling for them. “Unfortunately, the system we’ve set up works against them.”Carder said that hiring and retaining staff was the biggest challenge in the field. “I’ve interviewed a lot of direct care workers, and they feel a certain amount of stigma and shame,” she said. “Even though they might love it, they also feel a conflict about not being paid well, and doing work that others might think of as demeaning, showering people and changing their diapers.” She said these jobs needed to be normalized, professionalized and better paid.Instead, workers are often so overloaded and harried that they have no choice but to provide poor care. Caretakers at Atria Park in San Mateo, California, part of an assisted living chain, were so inattentive that oneput corrosive cleaning fluidin a pitcher usually used for serving juice, and another unwittingly served it to residents; two of them died.The low wages also can cause resentment and pilfering; Dad’s wallet was cleaned out; aides rarely cleaned his bathroom messes or emptied the trash. Worst, one night aide told Dad and other residents that their “time was up” and they were near their “expiration date”, which put Dad in a panic that he’d have to suffer the stress of moving again. He didn’t realize her intended message was even more cruel.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Rita Liu/The Guardian/Fraser Family/GettyGiven the staffing shortages, and the need for vigilance over their loved ones, families often have to fill in the gaps in caregiving. Many have to cut down their hours at work or leave their jobs entirely, and their finances take a hit.My sister Cindy is retired, so caretaking was less of a financial hit than an emotional one. “I was shocked at the amount of assistance I had to give, but it was the only option to provide the kind of care that would even approach what we wanted. Even at that, it fell way short.” Cindy says she constantly felt guilty that she couldn’t do enough. She would take care of her seriously ill husband at home, then go visit Dad when her husband was asleep, then return to do more caretaking at home. She rarely had a moment to herself. “It was traumatic.”The obvious question anyone who has a family member in assisted living might ask is: if we’re spending $11,000 a month, why can’t they hire more staff and pay more than minimum wage?“It all comes down to money,” said Chicotel. Like nursing homes, most assisted living communities – 56% – are chain-affiliated ventures. “Whether the ownership is a closely held corporation, a publicly traded corporation, real estate investment trust, or private equity, they’re all run by people with business degrees and not by people who are actually professional caregivers.”Michael Fenne, of the non-profit Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said that for assisted living residents, ownership models which often promise aggressive returns to investors usually mean increased rents for residents, reduced care staffing, and lack of necessary facility improvements. As Fenne wrote in anarticle: “These measures are incompatible with a senior living model that prioritizes care and support for older adults.”Harrington, who has published studies diagramming the details of nursing home ownership, said companies that own nursing homes often own assisted living communities, too, and likewise have “incredibly complex corporate structures”. They often separate the business into several companies to maximize profits and limit liability. For instance, a real estate company will own the actual property, and then charge the management company – which they also own and pay excessive fees to – huge rents. They may have a separate staffing agency that will take its cut, too.A common practice in the industry is to have administrators on a bonus system, which motivates them to keep costs down, including staffing costs, said Harrington. Nursing homes have an incentive to hide their profits since they are under federal scrutiny; nearly75%of nursing homes funnel billions of tax-dollar funds through these “related party transactions” that would otherwise go to staffing and care. Onestudycalculated that if hidden profits were spent on additional registered nurses in nursing homes, in 2019 the mean staffing ratio would have risen nearly 30%, providing residents with far better care.Since assisted living communities are nearly unregulated, and not federally funded, those corporations have even less accountability for their prices or profits than nursing homes. “It’s like a blueprint for how to make money,” said Harrington. “The effect on care is shocking. There’s no money for food, staffing, or overtime when people call in sick,” she says. “Patients get pressure ulcers and lose weight, they may get a shower once a month, they’re over-drugged to keep them quiet, and they fall frequently because there’s nobody to help them.”Funds for activities are cut – no more hiring someone to come in for sing-alongs or trips to the outside world. Harrington said the few homes she had seen that had adequate staffing were almost always non-profits – though those vary widely, too.View image in fullscreenJeanne Fregeau, 93, waits for her morning medication in her room at St Chretienne Retirement Residence, a home for Catholic nuns in Marlborough, Massachusetts, in 2020.Photograph: Boston Globe/Getty ImagesAdministrators have little leeway for improving care. One former administrator, who wished to remain anonymous because, he said, “I’m still in the industry,” spent 25 years in that role before he left to become an advocate. A last straw for him was when the corporation purchased broccoli stalks to feed the residents, not the crowns. “If you try to buy broccoli heads, the corporate people will know about it. It’ll raise red flags.”So what do you do if you want to be comfortable in your old age, eat fresh vegetables and engage with people, instead of spending your days parked in front of a TV, waiting to use the toilet or have your diaper changed?There are some residences that are fine places to live, though they’re often hard to find. Claire Mills, an ultrasound technician, put her mother into four assisted living facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area before she found one she thought was “wonderful”. She moved her mother from the first because she would often find her in dirty diapers with dark urine – an indication of dehydration – and from the second when she came in after hours to discover the residents with dementia were circled around a TV watching a horror film. She finally found a small board-and-care home that was half the price and gave much better care. “I would come in and find a staff member just sitting with Mom, holding her hand,” she says.That home was one owned by Cristina Flores, a nurse with a PhD who has since closed her properties after 30 years and a major back injury. She now works as an advocate for elders and expert witness for the industry. “Long-term care is about creating relationships with residents and families, and really understanding what the person needs, what they do and don’t want in their lives,” she said. “You don’t need a whole bunch of degrees or credentials, but you have to have a heart to do your job.”She paid her staff a little more than the competition, yet, without a corporate owner, was able to maintain a high staffing ratio and lower costs than other facilities.There are a lot of organizations and people working on reforming assisted living, such asthe Consumer Voice,CEALand theLong Term Care Community Coalition, among others. “There’s a lot of creativity out there, with advocates, state agencies, and senior housing organizations,” says Carder. Most advocates are demanding increased regulations, enforcement mechanisms, increased financial transparency and legislation that mandates a reasonable percentage of money goes to direct care. They also want residents and their families to be able to make complaints without fear of reprisal.One way to pressure assisted living homes is to sue. Kathryn Stebner, of Stebner, Gertler & Guadagni, a San Francisco-based elder abuse law firm, has resolved class action suits for for “misrepresentations and omissions” against three assisted living corporations in California, including Sunrise. The suits focused on the deception between what was promised in residency agreements and what was received. The actual difference in the amount of care promised versus delivered was analyzed for a sampling of facilities, and was often less. “It’s basically false advertising,” Stebner said.As a result, residents don’t receive the care they’re paying for – like my father’s “Plus Plus” plan, which didn’t increase the number of times anyone checked on him. “It’s also financial elder abuse to take their money and not provide what they say they will,” said Stebner.In a statement, Sunrise said: “Both parties decided to settle the case without any admission of wrongdoing or liability by Sunrise.” It added: “Our goal has always been and continues to be focused on the wellbeing of our residents and the thousands of compassionate care providers at our over 240 communities.”Though those cases settle for some money for the class action plaintiffs, Stebner said the real purpose was getting an injunction from the court to improve conditions. In the Sunrise case, the court required Sunrise to make it clear in public-facing disclosures, such as its residency agreement and website, that Sunrise does not guarantee that any resident will receive a specific number of minutes, or amount of care, in any given time period, and to provide data on the response time to call light buttons.“We’re trying to change the system,” said Stebner.Residents and their families can also make an impact. Betsy Zampa, a former church administrator who quit working when her mother’s Alzheimer’s became too severe, said that in just over a year that her mother has been at the Village at Rancho Solano in Fairfield, California, owned by Pegasus, she’d had a lot of problems with the administration.When her mother began to have problems – there was mold in her shower, and for months no one ever responded to her pull-cord for help (it waslater determinedthat her pull-cord to call for assistance did not work) – and administrators didn’t respond, Zampa went over their heads. She filed complaints with the state licensing agency, which came in, substantiated the problem, andcitedthe facility for posing an “immediate risk to the health and safety of residents in care”; to date, she has filed at least five complaints.She also began a family council. “You think you’re alone, but the more I talked to people, the more I realized everyone has the same issues,” she says. Although the facility had a monthly support group already, Zampa felt they couldn’t speak freely because a staff member was always there. When she asked the administrator to form a group without staff oversight, the staffer pushed back until Zampa showed her a regulation that said the residents had a right to meet without staff.I attended their most recent meeting, to which about 25 people showed up, including several disgruntled residents. At previous meetings, they’d hosted the ombudsman, a lawyer to tell them about their rights, and higher-ups from the corporation. This evening, they were prioritizing their complaints on a big sheet of butcher paper. One person after another raised their hand. There were long waits in the dining room, and the food – “starches, starches, starches”, a resident complained – arrived cold. Call buttons weren’t answered in a timely manner. Mostly, the residents were angry about being charged for higher levels of care, and nothing changed.“It’s a bait and switch,” said Roxanne Crosby, whose husband’s care level was reassessed four times in 10 days, increasing extra charges from $350 to $2,200 a month. “Then they told me he needed $1,000 a day for private care on top of that.” She has since moved him to another home – one with six patients and three caretakers, “sweet people”, she says – but is angry enough to help lead the group.Morgan Whinery, executive director of the Village at Rancho Solano, later denied that the issues residents raised were problems. She said that the clinical team monitored call response times and that “residents recently expressed that they are satisfied with response times”. She said care level assessments and adjustments were made to ensure “the appropriate level of oversight and support” and that cost adjustments were made “with resident security in mind”.By the end of the meeting, the group had prioritized its complaints and doled out responsibility for who would follow up. They vowed to stop paying for extras, to make complaints to the licensing agencies, to find out their rights, pressure the director and talk to lawyers. The room was crackling with energy.A week after I asked the executive director to respond to the resident complaints, she let Betsy Zampa know that she would have to move her mother to another facility or the Village would evict her.Zampa said a note on her mother’s care evaluation read: “It is evident that the current community setting is no longer suitable for the resident’s needs, as they require a higher level of care that ensures both their own wellbeing and the safety of other residents.”When I emailed them, The Village refused to comment on the specific case, adding that “more broadly, when a resident’s care needs exceed what we are licensed to provide, we work closely with families to support a safe transition to a setting that can meet those needs.”Zampa said it wasn’t her mother’s needs that triggered the eviction. “They didn’t want to get rid of my mother, they wanted to get rid of me,” she says. “I’ve been rattling their cages and this was retaliation.” Zampa said she would not move her mother willingly, and will fight the eviction.Where would you want to end up when you reach the age of needing assistance?Harrington, now in her 80s, said she would perhaps consider one of the non-profit communities in San Francisco or Oakland that are more mission-driven than profit-driven. Chicotel advised: “Stay at home if you can,” and said that a good alternative was having caretakers for a few hours at home, interspersed with adult daycare programs. Zampa, at 62, plans to put a deposit down on a yet-to-be-built resident-led non-profit Life Plan community in McKinleyville, CA, run by a retired family doctor who, she says, “has vision.”Co-housing may be another solution. One friend of mine, Tanha Luvaas, has lived in a co-housing community in Chico, California for decades. As the people there age – her partner had a stroke, another is living with dementia – people take turns caring for people they’ve known for all those years, giving the others a spell. “Co-housing has been a lifesaver,” says Tahna.Then there’s the possibility of getting care in another country. While my father was in assisted living, my friend Linda Bacon’s husband was suffering from Lewy body dementia. She lives part-time in Mexico, where she was able to hire caretakers at her home, paying less per week for 24-hour care than my father would have had to pay for equivalent care in Colorado. When I visited, Linda’s husband was getting meals, physical therapy, help with dressing, grooming and body care, and as much companionship as he desired.That’s my plan. I’ve also lived part-time in Mexico for many years, and intend to move into a single-level home when my husband and I get old, where we can find someone who can care for us as they would a family member. I realize, though, that this plan would be impractical or impossible for a lot of people who don’t want to leave their families or communities.View image in fullscreenCharles with his daughter Laura in the Colorado mountains, a couple years before his death.Photograph: Courtesy of the Fraser FamilyThe last day of my visit to Dad, Cindy and I took him for a drive in the mountains, where the aspen trees were just beginning to yellow.

But it left Kissinger free to conduct American foreign policy virtually single-handed, at least until Nixon was forced from office.Today’s context is different, though hardly less turbulent.Trump has just completed perhaps the mostextreme first 100 daysof US presidential history, producing a sea of uncertainty, upending the country’s international alliances, shattering democratic and legal norms at home, and leaving even its future status as the world’s leading democracy unsure.Trump moves Mike Waltz from national security adviser to UN ambassador roleRead moreThis unpredictable landscape is what confronts Rubio in his new position.An orthodox Republican in foreign policy matters, Rubio, 53, has frequently appeared uncomfortable – occasionally miserable, even – during the first three months at the state department under Trump, never more so than during the disastrous clash with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February, when the Ukrainian president subjected to a public browbeating by the president and JD Vance in the Oval Office.In the Senate, he had been one of Ukraine’s staunchest supporters against Russia’s invasion. He then saw that principled position so openly and brutally overturned and was forced to justify the volte face in public as Trump has conspicuously sympathised with Vladimir Putin.Equally galling has been Elon Musk’s gleefulguttingof USAID, America’s main foreign assistance agency – which Rubio has previously championed and which fell within his purview as secretary of state – under the auspices of the tech billionaire’s unofficial “department of government efficiency” project, also known as Doge.The tensions led to a shouting match between the two men in front of Trump, with Rubio reportedly responding aggressively to Musk’s accusation that he had failed in the mission of firing enough state department staff.Despite that unpromising background, Rubio – who was once tipped as a future president – now suddenly finds himself, in addition to being in charge of a still mighty department, having direct access to the inner workings of the White House and to the president himself.Even if it has come about thanks to the default of the less-than-surefooted Waltz – whose credibility never recovered from inadvertently inviting one of Trump’s least favourite journalists on to to aSignal chatabout strikes on Yemeni Houthis – it is quite the turnaround.It puts Rubio in the same vantage point from which Kissinger, the renowned exponent of realpolitik and great power balances, carved out a role as arguably the US’s most influential – if highly controversial – foreign policy strategist of the 20th century.With Trump just as consumed with domestic political enemies as Nixon ever was, it raises the unexpected question of whether Rubio can achieve the same level of prominence.It seems unlikely. Yet even two months ago, who would have guessed that the once-derided “Little Marco” would hold the levers of power of two separate institutions in his hands?Explore more on these topicsMarco RubioDonald TrumpUS foreign policyTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

This haunting play invites actors and audiences to reconnect with their pastChris WiegandThu 1 May 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 19.02 EDTShareIam a Krapp collector. Since my late teens I’ve returned time and again to Samuel Beckett’s brief but monumental one-act play in which a purple-nosed, “wearish old man” spools through reels of memoir recorded each year on his birthday. Although performed by a single actor, Krapp’s Last Tape is not quite a monologue. It becomes a kind of dialogue between the 69-year-old Krapp and his recorded 39-year-old self, who in turn reflects on how he behaved in his late 20s.It is, then, a tale of three Krapps. I’ve sailed past two of those ages: next stop, 69! Beckett’s play has endured partly because it bottles the nature of regret – it asks us all to consider what could have happened if we had made other choices in our lives, how things might have turned out differently. Two current productions – starringGary Oldman at York Theatre RoyalandStephen Rea at the Barbican in London– not only invite audiences to consider such questions but also give the actors a rare opportunity to reconnect with their past.“Perhaps my best years are gone,” says Krapp towards the end of the play. The Crying Game’s Rea, who is 78, disproves any such suggestion with an acutely moving performance, boosted by the use of his own archive recording of the younger Krapp’s lines – done on a whim by the actor in 2009 and stowed away for future use. Rea worked with Beckett on Endgame in 1976 (and did a film of it in 1991) and brings to bear the great writer’s note on that play, “It’s always ambiguous”, with his interpretation of Krapp.View image in fullscreenSelf-critical … John Hurt in Krapp’s Last Tape at the Barbican’s Pit theatre, London, in 1999.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianOscar winner Oldman, at 67, is two years too young for the older Krapp yet seems wearier than Rea as he creaks around the set in York, where he began his career in 1979 and played roles including a pantomime cat. Oldman, who recorded the younger Krapp’s voice in the months before this production, has not acted on stage for 37 years – more than half his lifetime. In a programme note he uses a Krapp-like image to explain theatre’s impact on his screen career, saying he always draws on his “mental museum of theatre references”. The production, which he also directed and designed, honours past Krapps by featuring the same machine used by Michael Gambon andJohn Hurtin the role.When I talked to Hurtabout his memories of Krapp’s Last Tape, I said I’d seen it in the West End, the year after its 1999 run at the Barbican’s Pit. He instantly replied that he wished I’d seen it in 2013, by which time he had withdrawn the anger from his portrayal. The recording of the younger Krapp that he made for the Barbican run was used for all his subsequent productions. Hurt was similarly critical of that audio performance. However, he acknowledged: “The more I come to dislike what I did on the tape, the more it plays into the hands of the present Krapp.”In depicting a man who is frustrated – even deflated – by his past, both personally and professionally, Beckett’s play taps into the self-critical actor’s quest for the perfect performance. This gained an unexpected charge on the night I saw Robert Wilson’s thunderyexpressionist production, featuring immense projections, at the Barbican in 2015. It left me cold, but I was nevertheless shocked when, at the curtain call, a nearby theatregoer was so unimpressed that they booed Wilson, who took his bow seemingly still in character as Krapp, and cast a hurt expression our way.View image in fullscreenMichael Gambon as Krapp in 2010. Oldman’s production features the same machine that Gambon used.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianRea’s Krapp, directed byVicky Featherstone, twice looks over his shoulder at the pitch-black that surrounds him, which his younger self says, unconvincingly, makes him feel less alone. The spartan set, designed by Jamie Vartan, is more like a cell than Beckett’s “den” and brings an air of confession or self-interrogation. Krapp’s desk comes with comically deep drawers, concealing his beloved bananas.Playing Krapp comes with high potassium levels: you usually see this number of bananas eaten by tennis players not actors. Krapp berates himself for tucking into them and keeps the fruit under lock and key – it’s a rigmarole to reach them, much like his system for storing away memories that bring a similarly peculiar mix of pain and pleasure. Rea seems to inhale the scent of his first banana before taking a huge bite that leaves its stringy bits dangling from his lips. Malcolm Rippeth’s sepia lighting for Oldman’s cluttered set evokes a bruised banana; Oldman slings his skins to the floor and gives a sly grin before biting into his second one. Recognising that every sound matters in Beckett, Oldman fills the theatre with the sound of laborious masticating.Both actors excel at the comedy of Krapp: Rea skittering on and off stage with the reels, Oldman affecting a light and airy voice as he draws out the word “spooool”. When Rea reads from the dictionary a description of the “vidua bird” with its black plumage, the humour is increased by the actor’s own mop of dark curls. Rea turns the memory of a “bony old ghost of a whore” into a cantankerous standup routine, adopting the voice of Fanny, and dourly mocks his younger self. Each actor nails the self-satisfied 39-year-old’s grand proclamation to be at the “crest of the wave”; both emphasise how the older man has not changed as much as he might have wished in the decades since.Acting is reacting, so they say, and the relationship between the three Krapps is pivotal to the play, as suggested by the on-the-nose choice of We Three (My Echo, My Shadow and Me), a song about being “all alone, living in a memory”, as introductory music for Oldman’s production. His set accentuates the clutter and resembles an attic as he seems to emerge from beneath to potter around boxes, crates and old furniture that form a lifetime of precious detritus. The set, which also suggests he is shored up on an island, even implies a connection between Krapp’s ramshackle belongings and the fragmented scenes and gestures that Beckett wrote for the character.It’s a play that really needs a much smaller stage than either the Barbican or York’s Theatre Royal. Of all the productions I’ve seen, the venue that suited it best was the subterranean Jermyn Street theatre in London’s West End, which has an impressive record with Beckett. Trevor Nunn directed it there in 2020, in a triple bill with Eh Joe and The Old Tune, recognising that Beckett’s lonely souls gain a haunting collective force when presented together (as in Jermyn Street’sFootfalls and Rockabythe following year). Nevertheless, even the passing references to other characters in Krapp’s Last Tape emphasise its themes – like Old Miss McGlome who sings “songs of her girlhood”.View image in fullscreenIntimate staging … James Hayes in Krapp’s Last Tape at Jermyn Street theatre, 2020.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe first Krapp I saw was soon after reading it at university. That performance was memorable for being halted when an acrid smell wafted off the machine and the theatre’s tech team were called in to investigate. I recall feeling cheated that they resumed at the same point and didn’t do the 50-ish minute play once more from the top. I saw that show with a friend who died at the age of 41 – I now realise that the only tapes I own, boxed away in the attic, are compilations he made for me over the years. I have nothing to play them on, but will always keep them.A trip to Krapp’s Last Tape in my 20s rekindled a romance that I would come to replay with my own sense of regret. The most striking lines of this singular play – where even the stage directions are longer than the speeches spoken live – are about a breakup. In the 39-year-old’s recording, he recalls it like this: “I said again I thought it was hopeless and no good going on and she agreed, without opening her eyes.” It occurs on a punt on a sun-kissed afternoon, a wretched business tenderly evoked. In Rea’s performance, he perfects the agitated state in which Krapp searches for the section – capturing Hurt’s belief that Krapp is an addict.Addicted to what, exactly? To a hit not of nostalgia but of emotion – no matter how painful – for a man who has shut himself off. (In afascinating new documentary, Rea says of Krapp “there’s a very sad life occurring”, that passive verb capturing exactly the loss of control the older Krapp seems to have.) Future Krapp-like characters might be rabbit-holing on Facebook or Instagram instead, grasping for the right photo or phrase to stitch together a memory.Krapp is a play about memory-making: about stockpiling the moments that define us, not unlike assembling a mix tape or organising your iCloud. It’s what the younger Krapp, an aspiring writer, calls “separating the grain from the husks” – about as good a description as you could use for Beckett’s precision as a playwright. But it is also about self-deception and not facing down the difficult episodes, such as the death of Krapp’s mother.Play it again, Sam: why Krapp’s Last Tape still leaves us reelingRead moreAs you get older, and see new productions of familiar plays, you gravitate towards different characters. The last few times I’ve seen Romeo and Juliet I have been far more interested in the parents than the young lovers. Krapp presents us instead with one man’s range of ages to reflect upon or anticipate. Like Lear, it’s a role that actors and audiences grow into. So it was a masterstroke by Seán Doran, artistic director of Arts Over Borders, to ask Samuel West and Richard Dormer to eachrecord the part of the taped Krappwhen they were 39. For the Beckett Biennale in 2036, by which time West will have reached the correct age, he will perform using his recording; two years later, Dormer will do the same with his when he hits 69. (“Extremely early bird tickets” are available now.) This forward planning is fitting. In the opening line, Beckett tells us the play is set in the future – his masterpiece acknowledges the weight of what may lie ahead as well as what has passed.Krapp’s Last Tape starring Gary Oldman is atYork Theatre Royaluntil 17 May. Krapp’s Last Tape starring Stephen Rea is at theBarbican, London, until 3 May andPavilion theatre, Dublin, 22-25 July.Explore more on these topicsTheatreSamuel BeckettGary OldmanBarbicanJohn HurtVicky FeatherstonefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fear, she said, made way for nausea.“Because, in my head, I had resigned myself to the fact that I was probably going to die”, shetold the New South Wales coroners courtthis week.It was 3.37pm on 13 April 2024. Four minutes earlier, Joel Cauchi, 40, who had schizophrenia, had begun astabbing rampage inside the Westfield Bondi Junction shopping mall, killing six people and injuring 10 more.The inspector was the first police unit to respond to the initial radio call-out. She had been driving her police car fromBondibeach.View image in fullscreenInsp Amy Scott after receiving the commissioners valour award in 2024.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP“I remember the radio operator said … ‘We’re getting multiple calls, multiple stabbings, multiple locations at Bondi Junction Westfield.’ I knew right then that it was very real,” Scott told the state coroner, Teresa O’Sullivan, on Tuesday.When she arrived at the Westfield, her initial plan was to execute a “dynamic entry”, with other officers entering the centre at multiple points. But running from the shopping centre were people screaming: “He’s killing people, he’s hurting people.”Officer in charge of specialist paramedics found out about Bondi Junction stabbings ‘by accident’, inquest toldRead moreShe told Lidcombe coroners court she then knew she was dealing with an active armed offender. “They’re active, I’m going in,” she radioed.In her active armed offender training, officers were told they had a 60% to 70% chance of non-survival “and that is if you are partnered up and vested up, and I was neither of those”, Scott said.Instead, as makeshift backup she had Silas Despreaux and Damien Guerot – two French nationals who had become friends since moving to Australia.Guerot arrived in Australia to learn English about 10 years ago and is now a carpenter. Despreaux, who arrived seven years ago, is a construction worker. When they heard a man was stabbing people, Despreaux told Guerot: “Let’s go catch him.”2:20Footage shows Australian police arriving on scene after Bondi Junction attack – videoTheytried to stop Cauchi using heavy bollards from a clothing store, throwing them down an escalator as he moved up it towards them.Scott told the court that the men told her which way to go. On the way up an escalator to find Cauchi, she unclipped her gun and one of the Frenchmen told her: “You’re on your own [without other police], we’re coming with you.”Guerot told Scott: “It’s a big situation. You have to have your gun ready because this guy is dangerous.”A short distance from the top of the escalator and with the men behind her, she saw Cauchi.“I’ve got eyes on him … and I’m in foot pursuit,” she radioed.When he stopped about 20 metres ahead of her, she stopped as well. She silently signalled to a mother with a pram, hiding nearby, to run, then called out “mate” to get Cauchi’s attention.He turned towards her and started sprinting. Shouting “stop, drop it”, she fired three times. As she pulled the trigger, she told the court that she thought “that he was going to kill me”.Less than six minutes after his rampage began, Cauchi lay motionless outside an art and craft shop. Two of the bullets had hit him; one missed and struck a pot plant.Fixation on knives and serial killersIn the first week of a five-week coronial inquest into the seven deaths, the court heard how the “extremely unwell” man from Queensland slipped through the healthcare net andstopped taking medication for his schizophreniafive years earlier. Cauchi developed a fixation on violence, knives and serial killers, and with some “rudimentary planning”, inflicted a mass stabbing similar to those he had searched for online.Bondi Junction mass stabbing attack: who are the six victims?Read moreThat morning, after sleeping rough near Maroubra beach, he picked up his backpack and knife from his rented storage locker, searched Reddit for accounts of the Columbine school shooting, then made his way to Bondi Junction. There, while standing in a queue at a cafe in the sprawling Westfield shopping centre, he took his knife from his bag and, just before 3.33pm, fatally stabbed Dawn Singleton. The 25-year-old bride had been shopping for wedding makeup.Five seconds later, he stabbed Jade Young, 47, an architect, once, as she stood beside her daughter. She died within minutes. He next fatally stabbed an economics student, Yixuan Cheng, 27, then new mother Ashlee Good, 38, a security guard, Faraz Tahir, 30, and Pikria Darchia, 55.After being stabbed while protecting her baby, Good was able to contact her mother-in-law who was also in Westfield. She “made her way to assist … and was there to comfort her and her granddaughter in the midst of that fear”, the senior counsel assisting, Dr Peggy Dwyer SC, said.Young’s daughter used her dying mother’s phone to call her father, who was also at Westfield. On his way to them, he encountered the attacker and “warned others that Mr Cauchi had a knife before running to find his wife”, the court heard.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that theory was debunked by Det Chief Insp Andrew Marks, the police officer in charge of the investigation.“From the start of his attack, he moved very quickly and he appeared to attack people that were not ready, [who] didn’t know what was happening,” Marks said in court. “I just believe that whoever was in his way … is who he attacked.”Bravery in the face of dangerIt was clear that the death toll might have been far higher. In 2021, Cauchi had sought and been given initial psychiatric approval for a gun licence – something he did not follow through on, which the court heard was “very, very fortunate”.The court watched CCTV footage that showed Cauchi, seconds before he was shot, hesitating in front of a man, who appeared to have no idea of the danger he was in.No ‘one voice’ for families of Bondi Junction victims, court hears after John Singleton says inquest is ‘waste of time’Read more“I don’t even know to this day if they realised,” Scott said from the stand, before recounting, through tears, the bravery of the young officers who had also run towards danger that day – some of whom have not been able to return to work since.The level of preparedness for an active armed offender, from security alarms to interagency communication and command, is central to the inquest for which the brief of evidence contains some 50 volumes and on which at least 18 barristers are working.Australia is a country in which mass casualty attacks are rare – the Bondi Junction attack was Sydney’s worst mass murder in more than a decade – and the triage response was perhaps a function of that fact, Dwyer suggested.On multiple levels, communications issues also hampered responders’ efforts.The sole operator in Westfield’s security CCTV room had been using the bathroom when the attack began. Its emergency alarm system – which began only after Cauchi was shot dead – was, in Scott’s words, “deafening”. There was confusion around whether Cauchi had acted alone. A police review of CCTV room footage quickly determined there was a single offender – a message that was not passed on to the ambulance commander on site, whoordered all paramedics to leave the scene, albeit after all patients had left the building. Other specialist paramedics did not have ready access to theballistic PPEneeded to work in an active armed offender situation.View image in fullscreenPolice closing off the scene of the stabbing attacks at Westfield Bondi Junction on 16 April 2024.Photograph: Steven Saphore/AAPAn interagency meeting at 5.30pm – about two hours after Cauchi’s attack began – was criticised as being “too late”. Responding, Ch Insp Christopher Whalley, who took initial command of the incident, said that “the scope and magnitude of that incident was quite vast”.Deep griefMultiple victims spread over three floors of the massive mall, combined with the sheer number of people there on that ordinary Saturday – not to mention its infamously maze-like layout – would have added to the fear and chaos that quickly descended.Dwyer’s opening address led what has become a theme of the inquest: every witness, and many of the barristers, have begun their words with condolences to those affected. Injuries have been acknowledged as being both physical and psychological.“The grief of the families who are impacted is raw and deep … and the extent of their loss is truly unfathomable for the rest of us. The inquest is a huge strain on their emotional reserves,” Dwyer said.As well as many witnesses, the state coroner, too, was affected.On Tuesday, O’Sullivan stopped proceedings after Whalley was overcome with emotion when recalling how, late in the evening of 13 April, a team of young police officers had not wanted to leave the side of a deceased victim.“I’m grateful for the break too,” O’Sullivan told him after a five-minute pause, “because I found what you said very moving.”Explore more on these topicsBondi Junction stabbingsSydneyAustralian police and policingCrime - AustraliaBondiShareReuse this content"

A day when power reverts temporarily to the people. A day when newspapers send photographers to snap the cutest dogs outside church halls and schools. A day when not much stirs in Westminster.Polling day. A day when even those not voting catch a lucky break. The rules of purdah apply. So switch on the TV or radio and you’ll be spared the sound of politicians talking. Either trying to tell you that everything is working as it should or that it isn’t. A day off from the binary reductiveness of political discourse. A chance to reflect on what really matters. Or just to forget.But not everywhere was totally silent. Press your ear against the front door of No 10 and you could hear some muffled shouts. Walk inside and you would find the cellar door padlocked. Twice, for good measure.Keir Starmerwas determined this particular occupant was not going to be allowed out for a good few days. The prime minister had always been keen on the importance of lessons learned.Behind the cellar door, sobbing in the dark, satTony Blair. Unable to quite believe it had come to this. The lèse-majesté. Tony was used to being heard. When he talked, the world was meant to listen. Only, for the last 24 hours, he had been taken prisoner. Locked in the dark. Heavily medicated.“It’s for your own good,” said Pat McFadden. Tony had known he was in deep trouble the moment he had heard the voice of Starmer’s enforcer-in-chief. Even the terrifyingMorgan McSweeneywould have been preferable to The Pat in the Hat. McFadden had only once been known to smile in the years he had been in parliament. And that was when he had been sent out togive a Labour MP a verbal kneecapping for speaking out of turn. Pat had thought he had been doing the man a favour by not waterboarding him. Something Tony would have appreciated. Euphoric recall from his Iraq glory days.Tony was near breaking point. Pleading to be let out. Only yesterday he had been a man of substance. A former prime minister revered by many in theLabourparty. Now he had been kidnapped. Spirited away by the heavies in No 10. Regarded by many as just a useful idiot for Reform and the Conservatives.How would the world still spin on its axis without yet another very important intervention from him? More importantly, the Gulf states could stop funding his institute if he were suddenly to go quiet on fossil fuels. He had learned long ago never to pay for anything himself. Only mugs did that.“It’s for your own good,” yelled the enforcer-in-chief. “What you’ve got to learn, old man, is that you’re past it. Not just yesterday’s man, but the day before yesterday’s man. No one is interested in what you have to say any more. You’re completely out of your depth. You no longer understand the modern world. You’re an embarrassment to the Labour party. Worse, you’re an embarrassment to yourself. So we’re going to have to put you through a re-education programme.”Anything, Tony had mumbled. Anything. Just let him out into the light. Put him back in front of the people.Pat the Hat shook his head. Tony just wasn’t getting it. There would be no more media appearances. He would have to take a virtual vow of silence. And anything Tony did say would have to be personally cleared by him. To make sure he wasn’t about to stray off message yet again. Time for another dose of fentanyl. Tony’s eyes half closed, his pupils no more than pin-pricks. His voice sedated to a slur. When I said that the government’s net zero strategy was doomed to failure without fossil fuels my brain had been captured byKemi Badenochand Nigel Farage, Tony stumbled. What I really meant was the complete opposite.“Of course you did,” said Pat the Hat. “But that’s better. A good start. Two more weeks of solitary and we might just be able to let you out under close supervision.” Tears welled up in Tony’s eyes. He wasn’t sure he was going to last that long.There were also partial signs of life in parliament, where the Commons was going through the motions with business and trade departmental questions. Though there was an odd sense of calm about it all. No one got angry. No one really challenged any of the ministers on anything. It was all a bit like politics used to be before the psychodramas of the last 10 years. When the half-witted became the new normal and we skipped through several news cycles in a single day.Blair’s net zero intervention invites  scrutiny of his institute’s donorsRead moreTo listen to the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and his ministerial sidekicks, all was entirely well with the world. Britain had never had it so good. Of course we were going to export more to everyone. The fun times were only minutes away. The desolation of the 14 years of Tory government would soon be just a distant memory. A US trade deal was imminent. And why wouldn’t it be, because Agent Orange was clearly a totally rational man. We would get the bigliest, bestest deal ever. Everything was going our way. So much so, there was no need to give parliament a vote on any new treaty because everyone would love it anyway.All was also well with the EU. There would be no need for us to align with Europe because Europe would be aligning with us. We would never lower our standards for anyone apart from the countries with whom we needed to lower standards. And so on. The weird thing was that the opposition parties by and large went along with this. There was no fight. No pushback. Just a sense of nothingness. As if nothing really mattered. Perhaps the Tories were just too busy contemplating their probable annihilation in the local elections. No point tempting hubris.Still, it was all somehow reassuring. The world as we would like it to be. When we can let the politicians do politics without our need to keep a close eye on them. Just a shame it was only for one day. Tomorrow we’ll almost certainly find out the world is every bit as perilous as we thought it was.Explore more on these topicsTony BlairThe politics sketchPat McFaddenLabourLocal electionsKeir StarmerMorgan McSweeneyKemi BadenochcommentShareReuse this content"

You won’t stop laughing … even if you can’t fully follow alongRachel AroestiThu 1 May 2025 16.20 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 16.21 EDTShareDo not come to the new series of Man Like Mobeen cold. What started out in 2017 as a relatively straightforward sitcom about three twentysomething friends who kept inadvertently grazing the criminal underbelly of their corner of inner-city Birmingham is now a violent, convoluted gangster thriller – one whose fifth and final season involves a promised assassination, the Turkish mafia, an Irish mobster, a prison doctor who is really the evil daughter of a drug kingpin, a kidnapped sister, millions in unlaundered cash and a tea shop. The action will be practically incomprehensible to the uninitiated – and pretty hard to follow even for the faithful.Is it worth starting from the beginning? That depends. On the one hand, Man Like Mobeen does feel like an objectively valuable comic enterprise. Creator and star Guz Khan – who left his teaching job after going viral on YouTube as Mobeen, a mouthy Brummie Muslim and the prototype for this sitcom’s titular protagonist (one video saw him outraged at anapparently racist dinosaurin 2015’s Jurassic World) – is a natural clown, and uses his funny bones to power a series that immerses us in a community rarely seen on screen. As a depiction of a specific kind of British Muslim experience – working class, Midlands based – Man Like Mobeen is refreshingly rambunctious and gratifyingly uncompromising. All good sitcoms have their own vernacular; this one has the self-assurance to literally speak a different language: characters tend to slip into Urdu and Punjabi without translation. Meanwhile, racism and Islamophobia are turned into running jokes by combining irreverence with a tireless dedication to rubbishing stereotypes.Man Like Mobeen has always been about crime – just not the sort of crime Islamophobes might associate with Muslims. When we first encounter him, our eponymous hero (Khan) is a reformed drug dealer, who has recently become responsible for his 15-year-old sister after their mum left for Pakistan. Yet it’s almost impossible for Mobeen to extricate himself from the low-level criminal network of his home town, and he and his friends – the cautious, intelligent Nate (Tolu Ogunmefun) and the dense, naive Eight (Tez Ilyas) – are often unfairly pursued by police, including the nasty Harper (Line of Duty’s Perry Fitzpatrick) and Mobeen’s insecure ex-classmate Sajid. But as the show has progressed, farcical, small-time scrapes have escalated into something deadly: by the end of series three, Eight had been shot and Nate and Mobeen framed and imprisoned for his murder.View image in fullscreenA nonstop stream of jokes … Nate (Tolu Ogunmefun), Mobeen (Guz Khan) and Saj (Salman Akhtar) in Man Like Mobeen.Photograph: BBC/Tiger Aspect/Paul HusbandWhether or not Man Like Mobeen is worth investing in will partly depend on your appetite for this kind of action. It will also hinge on how puerile your sense of humour is. The show’s themes – crime, racism, poverty – are weighty and the violence is grim, but Khan and his co-writer Andy Milligan lighten the load with a nonstop stream of jokes: a few clever, many juvenile, some very repetitive. Though the tenor of the show has changed, Mobeen is still getting mercilessly teased for his apparently ample bosom, while the other characters continue to mock Sajid for his small stature with a relentlessness that can be tedious and uncomfortable. The comedy is often irredeemably adolescent – there are jokes about fingering, inadvertent homosexual come-ons and a recurring gag involving someone blowing their own head off with a gun.But childish jokes can also be hilarious. It was Uncle Shady – played completely expressionlessly by comedian Mark Silcox – that really got me: a mysterious elder who addresses everyone as “bastard,” uses “fuck on” to mean “let’s go”, and sets Mobeen up with his bad-tempered daughter who insists on eating curry filched from a funeral during their inordinately awkward first date in a swanky restaurant. Meanwhile, Sajid adds to the terrible motivational rap comedy canon with his silly paean to his erstwhile colleague Harper (who is now going into the cafe business with Nate after proving he had an exceptional palate for herbal teas while undercover in prison … I did say it was complicated).The sheer amount of gags mean it would be an achievement to sit stony-faced through an episode of Man Like Mobeen – yet the show is not content with laughs; it is determined to double up as both a social critiqueanda hard-hitting crime drama. The combination can be jarring, and it can be confusing too – but if it does sound like your cup of chai, then good news: there are five whole series of Mobeen-based comedy and tragedy out there waiting for you.Man Like Mobeen aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewGuz KhanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Why are they like that?‘Non-askers’ can come across as selfish – but there might be personal and societal reasons for their lack of curiositySarah MillerThu 1 May 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 17.22 EDTShareAfew months ago, I was at a bar and hoped I might be making a new friend. We were sitting next to each other in a booth with a bunch of people. In response to my questions she told me interesting anecdotes about growing up, her job, her husband. After she’d been talking for about 20 minutes, I began to get an unpleasant, familiar feeling:I bet if I stop asking her questions, she won’t ask me any.Sure enough, she wrapped up one answer, then looked at me expectantly, like a dog waiting for a treat. Oh hell no, I thought. No way. I turned to the person next to me, a friend. “She’s a non-asker,” I said. “I’m done.”My friend shook his head. “Non-askers,” he said. “The worst.” I talked to him for the rest of the evening and ignored the non-asker – though, I want to point out, she had ignored me first.My friends and I got the term “non-asker” from my friend Scott, who got it from his friend Carol, who is in her 50s, lives in New York, and coined this term to describe men she was going on dates with about 10 years ago. These men were real champs about holding forth on their own lives. “But when the time came to ask questions about me, there was just silence,” said Carol. “They just wanted someone to ask them questions and listen, I guess?”I looked up non-askers and didn’t see this term explicitly in use. There was a discourse aboutaskers v guessers, but it was more about a more openly inquiry-focused conversation style, as opposed to what I saw as a blatant lack of wanting to know things about other people.So I wrotea Substack postabout the frustration I – and many of my friends and acquaintances – felt in finding out things about people who did not return the favor. It was popular.It’s hard to ask questions of other people if you’re not asking them of yourselfAdi Dina, LMSW“I have experienced this SO MANY times,” said Kate Whebel, a reader. “For a while I thought that I attracted this kind of person, but it appears that they are all over.”Many of the commenters were heterosexual women dating men. Christine, 57, said most of the men she chats with display their non-asker qualities early, right there in the apps, and she won’t go out with them, “which greatly limits the number of dates I go on”. Sarah, 43, said she had been on so many dates with non-askers that they all blur together. Sophie, 30: “One time I went on a date with a man who spent the whole time talking about this script he was writing, and I kind of just sat there waiting to see if he would ask me anything, but he didn’t.” Rainy, 25, told me: “One of my friends was dating this guy, and she waited for weeks for him to ask her one question, and when he finally did, it was: ‘Do you play pickleball?’ And when she said no, he ended it.”In her 1990 book You Just Don’t Understand, linguist Deborah Tannen wrote about the differences between how men and women view conversation: women view it as a way to connect (so they ask more questions), and men, as a performance (so they make more statements).But the residents of Non-Asker Nation are not exclusively straight men. There was my booth acquaintance. Also my friend Lisa, 30, dated a woman who was “too twee to ask questions”, like curiosity was too cliched to bother with. Vino, 48, a gay man, dated “a forensic psychologist who asked no questions – I was like, isn’t this kinda your job”? One Substack commenter said: “I’m a middle-aged male who is dating and I can tell you that there are plenty of female non-askers out there.” This is my experience, as a non-dater of women, but someone who talks to them.There is a lot of talk about how we live in the age of selfishness, and “young people and their phones”, and general griping that I consider myself a bit above it all because that always points the finger away from the self. And yet. I do wonder if weare in a non-asking epidemic, because I don’t recall social interactions 10 or so years ago as such curiosity deserts.I was proud at being so discerning when Adi Dina, an LMSW in psychoanalytic training at New York’s Pulsion: the International Institute of Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Psychosomatics,told me that senior analysts in her program reported seeing more and more patients they would call disaffected. “There’s a hyperfixation on the concrete day-to-day, as opposed to an investment in one’s inner world. It’s hard to ask questions of other people if you’re not asking them of yourself,” she said.You used to be close – but are you a ‘fringe friend’ now?Read morePeople who don’t ask questions and aren’t curious in general, Dina said, tend to come in and talk about what they did during the day. But there’s not a lot of bridging between their inner world and concrete reality, like asking themselves what the relationship is between what they want and what they do, or what their fantasies mean about who they are. Her task as an analyst is to start looking at the possible barriers to self-reflection. Some are specific to the person, but Dina acknowledged there’s something particular to this era: “People are being increasingly told to rely on themselves. There’s certainly a current of rising individualism. And this is going to result in cutting off other people, an inability to recognize them.”I believe non-askers are a thing, and kind of a problem, and certainly a bummer. That said, asking questions is not inherently virtuous. Sometimes people are just hammering away, and I feel like they are trying to trip me up, or measuring me against their standards.“One could glibly say that curiosity is good, and incuriosity is bad, and that’s not a terrible way to think about it,” said Abby Kluchin, co-host of the psychoanalysis podcast Ordinary Unhappiness, and assistant professor of philosophy and religious studies at Ursinus College. “At the same time, curiosity isn’t always motivated by pure interest. People don’t only ask you questions out of the goodness of their heart – they can do it to get things from you, or to deflect interest from themselves.”Anxiety can easily look like egocentrismKaty Cotterell, art psychotherapistHer co-host, Patrick Blanchfield, who teaches classes on psychoanalytic theory at Brooklyn Institute for Social Research, agreed. Just think about pickup artists, journalists and CIA recruiters. “The act of asking questions is not just a way of showing curiosity – it can be a way to assert power over someone.”Blanchfield pointed out that many people are brought up by people – addicts or narcissists, for example – who teach them that they cannot trust askers, and that their tendency to ask questions is rooted not in curiosity so much as a desire to put the attention elsewhere. It “can be a great way for people to keep themselves safe”, he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Does that make me some kind of attention-seeking monster? “Why do you think it upsets you so much when someone doesn’t want to give you the opportunity to talk about yourself ?” asked Tom, 54. Which was fair but also felt a little accusatory. Upon reflection, though, I think it feels bad to be driving a conversation and never get to provide any of the scenery. According to Dina, being non-asked “can feel as if the person is acting as if you don’t exist”.Some people I know have actually confronted non-askers. Scott (who introduced me to Carol, the “non-asker” coiner) has actually said to a couple of them: “We’ve been talking for half an hour and you haven’t asked me a single question. I’m going to explain to you how a conversation works.”One of them just abandoned their interaction, but another did seem to take it to heart. “He seemed genuinely surprised and concerned,” Scott recalled.Carol asked one former colleague “How are you?” every day, and he would answer but not ask her. She finally asked him what the deal was. He thought that once he answered, the question back was implied. “But now he always asks me, which is nice.”Andy, 60, was confronted by a very close friend for being a non-asker and found it “hugely embarrassing”. He thought about why he had shared so much with this person, a friend he really valued, while not asking her to reciprocate. His reason surprised me, since I have been inclined to think the worst of non-askers: he was intimidated, and felt that asking personal questions would be prying. “I guess I thought if she wanted to share, she would have.”The question might have been awkward, but he felt she’d given him a huge gift: “She died a few years later, and I am so glad that I really, truly got to know her.”Do I think that asking questions is important? Yes. Do I wish that people would ask me more questions? Yes. Am I going to cultivate a lot of deep relationships with non-askers? Unlikely. However, I found myself developing some unexpected sympathy for the non-asker. Being a curious person, I wondered about alternative ways people might display curiosity.I’m disagreeable – and it’s backed by science. Can I change my personality?Read moreSome non-askers light up and become more collaborative conversationalists when there is less pressure to talk. One friend’s husband has never asked me a single goddamn question. But we went to the store to find an obscure ingredient, and ended up discussing what we ate growing up. Because we were busy doing something else, our observations and comments were able to bounce off and build upon themselves: a shared experience without a more formal back and forth. I also think of the way that during a game night or craft night, participants can talk without necessarily following a thread; they also have physical objects to focus on, or goals to achieve together. Questions can equate to pressure, and we all have quite enough of that at the moment.Katy Cotterell, an art psychotherapist in south London, said that while there was a good deal of talk about childrenfacing delays or difficulties with social skills since the pandemic, adults were also struggling with human connection. The pandemic has left people with lingering feelings of isolation. And with rising prices, less healthcare and many people working long hours or multiple jobs, more time is devoted to meeting basic needs and less to creating or maintaining social bonds.“When people are under too much pressure or stress, their defenses go up, and this makes curiosity a challenge,” she said. “Anxiety can easily look like egocentrism.”She added that surveillance was rampant, human rights and the arts were under attack, and public shamings on social media happen every day. People may feel rigid, closed and ill-disposed towards opening up or asking others to do the same. Her sense is that most people do want to be known, seen and understood, but within certain conditions. “People want to feel they have been chosen to share, not forced, and that when they ask others to share,theydo not feel forced or intruded on.”I 100% get that circumstances may change how people interact. I went through a breakup of a long relationship last year and during that period I was more of a talker than an asker at times, because I was so emotionally unstable and therefore more selfish than usual.That said, what about the people who really seem to go through life enjoying other people’s curiosity without displaying theirs? Do they deserve sympathy? I thought I would let Carol have the last word. “I love hearing other people’s stories. It’s part of what makes life worth living. I don’t understand people who don’t feel the same way.”Sarah Millerwrites for many publications, including NewYorker.com, ParisReview.com, Dirt and n+1. Her Substack is the Real Sarah Miller.

Today, it was announced that it will transfer to London’s West End in May, after short runs at London’s Old Vic in 2024 and Toronto earlier this year.But Ure argues that the day-long Live Aid could never happen today, because of the seductive pull of social media feeds. “Have [audiences] got the attention span? I’m not sure,” he says.Live Aid was held to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia, and Ure says that he and the team behind it were powered by a cocktail of naivety and rock-star arrogance – logistical hurdles were deemed immaterial. “We hadn’t figured out just what a task this was going to be,” he says. “Just get the show done. Sparkle, guys!”They had had major success with Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas? single in December 1984, written by Ultravox frontman Ure alongsideBob Geldof, but it had ended up exposing bottlenecks that were stopping the money getting to where it was most needed. A concert was conceived to swiftly raise the funds to eradicate those problems.“There was a trucking cartel in situ in Ethiopia that all the aid agencies were using and had to pay for,” says Ure. “We wanted to break the cartel by buying a fleet of trucks, but we didn’t have the money to do it. So Live Aid was born.”George Harrison’s 1971 Concert for Bangladesh charity show and album were used to show how good intentions can be dashed by mismanagement: millions of dollars raised by the concert were trapped in IRS tax escrow accounts for years. “The first advice we were given was from George,” says Ure of the early planning stages for Live Aid. “He said to Bob, ‘Don’t do what we did. Don’t spend any of the money. No overheads.’”View image in fullscreenUre and Bob Geldof at the Wembley launch.Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty ImagesFrugality became the Band Aid Charitable Trust’s mantra – it has never had an office and all trustees still work for free, with expenses forbidden. Money continues to come in from licensing, streams (of the Band Aid single at Christmas and YouTube footage of Live Aid) and donations, and 10% of proceeds from Just for One Day will support it. Total funds raised in the trust’s lifetime have reached £150m. “We have people leaving money to us in their wills,” says Ure. “Our job as trustees is to generate as much money as we possibly can for the cause.”The 71-year-old Ure accepts that the social context of Live Aid in 1985 can be knotty to explain in 2025. The Band Aid lyrics – such as Bono’s line “tonight thank God it’s them instead of you” – have prompted accusations of white saviourhood, and African artists such as Fuse ODG have argued it created a patronising and flattened view of a whole continent. “We wrote it in an afternoon as a simple pop song and it’s not there to be analysed,” counters Ure. “It was there to do something. Was it done with good intent? Yes, it was. Did it make a difference? Yes, it did.”He feels, in retrospect, Live Aid marked the end of the old world, where music was the epicentre of culture, and the start of something less monolithic. Having a whole day of TV programming devoted to a concert raising money for a single cause could not work in today’s oversaturated and media-fragmented world, he feels.Speaking at the musical’s launch event on Thursday, Geldof made a similar point. “The problem is, do people have the bandwidth?” he said. “They’re so exhausted with the horror of Gaza and the terror of Ukraine and the American political situation that it’s hard to draw attention to those who through no fault of their own are dying right now.”For Ure, what was a unifying media spectacle then would not cohere now. “I think Charlie Brooker will be writing the next Black Mirror [about this],” he jokes. “Fans in the audience would be filming it and then they’d swipe their screens and the artists would disappear after 30 seconds. It’s a different world.”Just for One Day: The Live Aid Musical will openat London’s Shaftesbury theatre on 15 May, with an album versionto be released on 11 July.Explore more on these topicsLive AidBob GeldofMusicalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The repatriation of a fictional 12th-century statue of a Chinese deity, carved in stone, forms the central dispute in Singaporean Joel Tan’s play.The Bodhisattva Guanyin reclines in the “royal ease” pose at one end of a traverse stage, designed by TK Hay, with a combination of screens and mirrors. The drama is formed of 12 distinct scenes, loosely connected around the statue. It begins choppily inside theBritish Museumwith patronising or incendiary debate by protesters and curators, sometimes set beside flashes of 19th-century imperial history. The tone switches from serious-minded to satirical to gnomic.But its disparate parts coalesce and gather intellectual complexity as well as dramatic intensity, all enacted with zest by a six-strong cast: Kaja Chan, Aidan Cheng, Jon Chew, Fiona Hampton, Robin Khor Yong Kuan and Sky Yang. There is playful yet disciplined direction by experimentalists emma + pj, with actors using the auditorium in original yet unmessy ways.We travel from protests in London, inside and outside the museum, to a Chinese detention centre, Shanghai Pudong airport and a splashy Beijing party thrown by the industrialist who secures the return of the statue.View image in fullscreenInnovative … Kaja Chan in Scenes from a Repatriation.Photograph: Alex BrennerAn overseas Chinese student protester confronting his British tutor opens up ideas on identity, covert racism and art – a statue can be in exile like a refugee, says the student. A Chinese official interrogating a cartoonist offers new dimensions to cultural appropriation and artistic protest. The Beijing party brings troubling patriotism and anti-western contempt that intersects with shocking misogyny. These scenes are relatively brief but contain real depth of thought. Neither are they bluntly polemical but wrapped within character and incident.“All of human history is basically people taking things from each other,” someone says. It does not seem to be an argument for leaving, for example, the Parthenon marbles in the British Museum, but the play cleverly muddies the idea of provenance and ownership. A character states that the Bodhisattva Guanyin is not even a Chinese figure but is in fact Indian.The play’s various scenarios complicate the debate and lay bare the politics of repatriation. The Chinese magnate who virtually bribes the museum into returning the statue places it in Shanghai’s airport so that the deity is turned into a symbol of power – and the rise and fall of empires.The Bodhisattva herself presides over all of it, watching over centuries of history, but the statue remains wrapped throughout. This obfuscation is puzzling – yet another one of the play’s interesting ideas. This is innovative theatre, shining with intelligence, which brings richness to our cultural tussle with the problem of ancient statues and their rightful place in the world.At theRoyal Court theatre, London, until 24 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Court theatreBritish MuseumMuseumsHeritagereviewsShareReuse this content"

Over 25 years, his films have punctured, skewered, crushed, flattened and decapitated men, women and children in a series of horrifying “accidents” and Perry has been a witness to them all. His friends clearly want him to witness many more.Final Destination at 20: the bleakest teen horror film ever made?Read moreBut as we speak on video call, just a few weeks before the sixth instalment is released, he seems far from traumatised. Instead, he’s ebullient, buzzing infectiously about the many gory deaths he has overseen with the same enthusiasm other people might display when talking about their children (“If you’re not having fun, don’t do it!” he grins). He has every right to be proud. To date, the films have made more than $657m (£493m) worldwide and helped to terrify a generation of millennials about the dangers that arise not from entering a haunted house or swimming in shark-infested waters but from the mundanities of taking a shower or driving your car. In the Final Destination movies, death is everywhere.This time, prepare to be terrified of tattoo parlours, family barbecues, revolving doors and glass elevatorsIn the first film, released in the spring of 2000, it was on a plane and a teen, experiencing a gruesome premonition, sniffed it out early, saving himself and a handful of others as it exploded in front of them. But death soon followed them all home and constructed shocking, often grimly amusing, Rube Goldberg-style death sequences for them, correcting the imbalance. Sequels inevitably followed, kicking off with mayhem on the road, a rollercoaster, a racetrack and a suspension bridge.The original iteration of the script, once intended to be an X-Files episode, had personified death. But “using inanimate objects to achieve its objective” is something Perry believes has given the series its staying power.“It allows the audience to bring whatever baggage or notions that they have about death,” he tells me. “It could be cultural or personal or that moment two years ago when they had a near miss and thought, man, if I just stepped right or left, that would have been the end of it. You bring all that to the movie and it makes it yours. Your experience is unique to you.”View image in fullscreenThreat matrix … Kaitlyn Santa Juana in Final Destination: Bloodlines.Photograph: Eric MilnerIn the latest film, Final Destination: Bloodlines, the formula sees a slight shake-up. The film opens in the 1960s; the premonition-haver has found a way to cheat death for decades until the collapse of a space-needle restaurant that leads to the destruction of a whole family (instead of, as in earlier films, a group of teens or strangers). It was the brainchild of Spider-Man director Jon Watts, who then enlisted directing duo Adam Stein and Zach Lipovsky to breathe new life into a franchise that had been dormant for 14 years.The new film arrives at a time filled with nostalgia horror plays. The seventh chapter of the rebooted Scream franchise has just finished production, a rehaul of I Know What You Did Last Summer starring is out this July and an Urban Legend remake was announced last week. But masked slashers aside, is a new generation ready to be scared of, well, everything? Aren’t they scared enough? Turns out, not nearly.“What are the everyday experiences or everyday objects or everyday feelings that we can ruin for people?” asks Stein, speaking to me with his co-director on a break during the production of Freaks Underground, a sequel to their acclaimed 2018 breakout Freaks. No spoilers but as the trailers already suggest, this time prepare to be terrified of tattoo parlours, family barbecues, revolving doors and glass elevators.Inspiration comes to Perry not only via email, but to the entire creative team via the anxieties of everyday life – what if that fell, what if I fell, what if that fell while I was falling etc. “It’s those things that you run into in your daily life all the time and you just feel a little bit off about,” Lipovsky says (hint for the new film: his apartment overlooks an alley where garbage is frequently collected). Perry jokes that he “can’t walk into a room without doing a threat matrix”.While many of the death scenes might seem cartoonishly far-fetched, it’s become surprisingly important for those involved to heavily research just how close to reality they could actually be. I mistakenly referred to a grisly scene involving a monstrously powerful magnetic resonance imaging machine, already teased at Comic-Con, as outlandish. I was corrected. Top-end MRIs, Perry tells me, “can literally pull entire gurneys into them and fold them over. That’s all true.”Lipovsky adds that he read up on some “extremely tragic and horrible” stories in his research (think guns and wheelchairs sucked into machines). “It all has to be stuff the audience generally would believe is possible,” he says. He goes on to tell me about extravagant crew tests involving mannequins.View image in fullscreen‘People don’t realise how challenging the tone is in these movies’ … the first Final Destination, from 2000.Photograph: Shane Harvey/New Line/Kobal/ShutterstockBut how do you centre a film on the utter inescapability of death and not make it feel like a depressing slog? “It’s knowing without diminishing, if that makes sense,” Perry says. “And this is why I think it’s so hard. People don’t realise how challenging the tone is in these movies.”Is he worried about increased sensitivities with a new generation (the first film featured a pre-9/11 plane crash and a grim shower death mistaken for a suicide)? “One of the challenges with this storytelling in general is if you have to have trigger warnings for drama, that means you can’t have an antagonist,” he says. “Because antagonists, by their very nature, do terrible things.” He adds: “I feel like if we get hamstrung by overanalysing that thing, we’re just going to have movies that play like tapioca. It’s just not going to be intriguing.”Stein agrees that it’s “incredibly tricky” to make so much carnage so much fun but the secret is in the bad guy, death. “You kind of root for him because of his sense of humour,” he says. “He’s just so clever.”View image in fullscreenSurprisingly moving … Tony Todd in Final Destination: Bloodlines.Photograph: Eric Milner/APDespite the films forcing family members or partners to watch their loved ones get brutally splattered to smithereens in front of them, the franchise isn’t really known for its humanity. Here, death doesn’t mean all that much. But in the new film, it suddenly does. Tony Todd, who has appeared in all but one of the films (including a voice role in the third one), died in November last year, not long after filming a one-scene cameo. His on-screen farewell is a surprisingly moving moment, the actor looking strikingly frail.“Everyone involved knew he was ill and we weren’t sure at certain points whether he would be able to participate,” Stein tells me. “It was a really unique moment because talking about his own death for the movie on this meta level, he’s speaking to the fans abouthisdeath. And so in that moment when he had his final goodbye, we asked him if he would be able to kind of put the script away and do a take where he spoke from the heart about what death means and what life means … it’s his honest words of wisdom direct to you.”It’s a rare moving moment in a film that’s otherwise as energetic and fun as the very best of the franchise. The first oneturned 20 just after the pandemic kicked inand, with Bloodlines emerging as the world continues to burn in new and old ways, what purpose does a Final Destination film have in 2025?“There’s a lot of depressing things happening in the world,” Lipovsky says, believing that the film will take viewers to “a different place outside the real world for a few hours”.Stein adds: “The communal experience of watching this movie in a theatre is really something to behold. Twelve minutes in, when a little boy gets crushed by a falling piano, the entire audience erupts in cheers. And that is something really fun.”Final Destination: Bloodlines is out in UK cinemas on 14 May and in the US on 16 MayExplore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Their self-titled film, a raucous semi-fictionalised biopic directed by Rich Peppiatt,won a Baftafor outstanding British debut, while Kemi Badenoch’s attempt to block a grant awarded by the British Phonographic Industry wasoverturned in court. As the film illustrates, Kneecap were accustomed to being denounced by unionist MPs but both sides reaped useful publicity. “We have a very dysfunctional, symbiotic relationship,” admitted rapper Naoise Ó Cairealláin.This process was dramatically derailed last week when Kneecap touched the third rail of Gaza andaccused Israel of genocideon stage at Coachella festival in California. Cue fury from Fox News, calls for their visas to be revoked and, according to their manager, death threats. The British press combed through old videos and found clips that appear to showtwo explosive onstage pronouncementsfrom Kneecap’s November 2023 UK tour: “Up Hamas, up Hezbollah” and “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.”Condemnations came thick and fast: Keir Starmer’s spokesperson, the security minister, Dan Jarvis, the Board of Deputies of British Jews and relatives of the murdered MPs Jo Cox and David Amess all denounced the apparent remarks. The shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, accused Kneecap of representing nothing less than “despicable evil”. Their concert at Cornwall’s Eden Project has been cancelled, as have several shows in Germany. Glastonbury, among other festivals, is facing immense pressure to drop them, too. The Met’s counter-terrorism commandhas launched an investigation. Badenoch, bearing a grudge, says they should be prosecuted for incitement and have been “avoiding justice for far too long”.Some artists seek controversy while others have it thrust upon them. The Sex Pistols released God Save the Queen during the silver jubilee as a calculated provocation, leading to a BBC ban but massive sales. Pulp, however, never expected the playfully druggy packaging of their 1995 single Sorted for E’s and Wizz to land on the front page of the Daily Mirror with the timeless headline “Ban This Sick Stunt”.Kneecap seem to be in the Sex Pistols tradition. When I interviewed them last year, Ó Cairealláin admitted: “We’re very calculated in our PR stuff. We know things are going to get a reaction.” But sometimes the scale of a backlash far exceeds expectations. Cop Killer, a 1992 single by Ice-T’s rock band Body Count, inspired condemnation from the then US president, George HW Bush, and a police-led boycott of the whole of Time Warner until Ice-T buckled and removed the song from the album.Off-the-cuff remarks should carry less weight than recorded lyrics, but tell that to the previously obscure rapper Sister Souljah, whose comments on the LA riots that same year were used by Bill Clinton to distance himself from his Black rival Jesse Jackson during his presidential campaign, thus spawning the phrase “Sister Souljah moment” to describe strategic scapegoating.Loose talk is even more dangerous in the online era. While writing a history of protest songs I came across more than one artist fantasising about a politician’s assassination in the 1980s, but their quotes never travelled beyond the music press. Yet the Dixie Chicks’ – now the Chicks – fairly mild criticism of then president George W Bush at a London show in 2003 (they told a crowdthat they were “ashamed” that Bush was also from Texas) went viral and killed their country music career. Nothing can be safely forgotten now.Kneecap’s 2023 remarks are hard to defend on their merits, even in the context of their activist reputation. Their republicanism is unapologetic: they largely rap in Irish and call their homeland “the north of Ireland”. (Their name refers to the IRA’s punishment for drug dealers, identifying the band with the latter.) Their solidarity with the Palestinian people is equally sincere, but celebrating proscribed terrorist groups is something else. Perhaps it’s the kind of careless radical chic that briefly led the Clash’s Joe Strummer to valorise Italy’s Red Brigade in the late 1970s. Perhaps not.The band’s recent statement, while apologising to the families of Cox and Amess and identifying the outrage as part of a broader effort to delegitimise support for Palestine, did not clear things up. They claimed “We do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah” and would never “seek to incite violence against any MP”. So, did they say those words? If so, what did they mean by them? If they have been taken out of context, then what was the context?The Cop Killer example is clarifying. Ice-T was clearly singing about killing cops but wasn’t actually encouraging murder. Likewise, Kneecap are not an active security threat. Within music, there is ample room for such ambiguity, provocation and free expression of outlaw thoughts. But in the harsher light of the tabloids, social media, parliament and policing, tossed-off slogans appear savagely literal and have real consequences.This controversy has inspired hypocrisy on both sides. While Kneecap’s rightwing critics are suddenly enthusiastic about “cancel culture” and “offence archaeology”, their defenders have transformed into free-speech absolutists. One thing invariably holds true though: politicians who attack musicians come off as opportunistic, authoritarian and often foolish in their thirst for soft targets.

Dog-eared leftovers from a foreign holiday that I keep forgetting to take to the bank, they have somehow ended up being the only physical money I always carry, now there are so few places to use the British folding stuff.Our village pub was for years a cash-only enterprise, possibly as a means of deterring customers from outside the village (long, gloriously eccentric story), and I keep a few pound coins rattling around the car for shopping trolleys. But using actual money feels mildly eccentric in most places now, or even faintly shady: increasingly cafes and bars are adopting “no cash” rules upfront to save the hassle of carting their takings to some farawaybank branch. Half of us have recently been somewhere that either didn’t accept cash or positively discouraged it, according toa surveyby the ATM network Link.But since most people long ago switched to tapping a card reader, what’s the problem?Well, there’s the fact that, as a House of Commons Treasury select committee reportsuggested this week, it’s the most vulnerable who still depend on cash: older people either terrified of being scammed or struggling to get to grips with apps, people whose credit rating is too trashed to get a bank account, adults with learning disabilities who can more easily understand that when cash is gone it’s really gone, and women squirrelling away “running away money” their partners don’t know about. (One of the most upsetting stories the MPs heard was from a woman whose abusive partner had withheld the electronic bill payment for the kids’ school lunches: the school didn’t let her pay in cash, the only way she had of getting around his control of their account.)And then there’s the fact that, as Spain discovered during this week’smassive power outage, cash may no longer be king but when the worst happens, it’s still a critical spare to the heir. Sweden backtracked last year on plans to become a cashless society amid fears of becoming less resilient to saboteurs and hostile actors.Last but not least, meanwhile, is the faintly embarrassed “am I mad to think this?” sense triggered by the speed of America’s descent into dystopia, that having a source of money no ill-intentioned future government could track or summarily freeze for political reasons is an underappreciated safety net. Clinging on to cash is one of those strange issues uniting traditionalists suspicious of change – tellingly,Reform’s 2024 manifestopromised to stop Britain becoming a cashless society – with conspiracy theorists convinced the global elite is after their assets, radicals of all stripes, small business owners sick of being charged by banks for card transactions and anti-poverty charities pointing out that cash is a lifeline for people on tight budgets.Even gen Z, in theory more open to digitalised lives, have taken to the TikTok and Instagram-fuelled cult of “cash stuffing”, or disciplining your spending by taking out a week’s cash and sorting it into different envelopes for specific purposes. Once the envelope is empty, the spending stops. Thousands follow the big cash stuffers’ faintly hypnotic videos of them counting out crisp tenners and stashing them neatly into pastel folders: like all those videos of influencers sorting their cereals into labelled glass jars, it speaks to a need for control, order and a sort of reassuring homeliness, reminiscent of your granny keeping the week’s housekeeping in a biscuit tin. (Though, much like the biscuit tins, cash stuffing at home must bea boon for burglars.) As with the physical habit of reading newsprint, once confidently predicted to be dead by now, the longterm trajectory towards digital may be clear but letting go of something you can physically hold in your hand takes far longer than anyone thinks.Banks would love a cashless society, of course: the less physical currency swilling round the system, the easier it is for them to shut down all their branches and go wholly digital, forcing reluctant customers to phone a call centre or more likely message a chatbot if they need help. So much cheaper than maintaining an anchoring, human-employing presence on high streets where there’s little else left but vape shops.But let’s just say that the past few decades have not given me enormous confidence in the social worth of unquestioningly doing whatever banks want. Which is why I’ll be hanging on, for the foreseeable future, to an increasingly pointless handful of cash.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Too much deference and praise puts off all of us (with one notable presidential exception). We quickly learn as children that hard, honest truths can build respect among our peers. It’s a cornerstone of human interaction and of our emotional intelligence, something we swiftly understand and put into action.ChatGPT, though, hasn’t been so sure lately. The updated model that underpins the AI chatbot and helps inform its answers was rolled out this week – and has quickly beenrolled backafter users questioned why the interactions were so obsequious. The chatbot was cheering on and validating people even as they suggested they expressed hatred for others. “Seriously, good for you for standing up for yourself and taking control of your own life,” itreportedly said, in response to one user who claimed they had stopped taking their medication and had left their family, who they said were responsible for radio signals coming through the walls.So far, so alarming. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has recognised the risks, and quickly took action. “GPT‑4o skewed towards responses that were overly supportive but disingenuous,” researchers said intheir grovelling step back.The sycophancy with which ChatGPT treated any queries that users had is a warning shot about the issues around AI that are still to come. OpenAI’s model was designed – according totheleaked system promptthat set ChatGPT on its misguided approach – to try to mirror user behaviour in order to extend engagement. “Try to match the user’s vibe, tone, and generally how they are speaking,” says the leaked prompt, which guides behaviour. It seems this prompt, coupled with the chatbot’s desire to please users, was taken to extremes. After all, a “successful” AI response isn’t one that is factually correct; it’s one that gets high ratings from users. And we’re more likely as humans to like being told we’re right.The rollback of the model is embarrassing and useful for OpenAI in equal measure. It’s embarrassing because it draws attention to the actor behind the curtain and tears away the veneer that this is an authentic reaction. Remember, tech companies like OpenAI aren’t building AI systems solely to make our lives easier; they’re building systems that maximise retention, engagement and emotional buy-in.If AI always agrees with us, always encourages us, always tells us we’re right, then it risks becoming a digital enabler of bad behaviour. At worst, this makes AI a dangerous co-conspirator, enabling echo chambers of hate, self-delusion or ignorance. Could this be a through-the-looking-glass moment, when users recognise the way their thoughts can be nudged through interactions with AI, and perhaps decide to take a step back?It would be nice to think so, but I’m not hopeful.One in 10 people worldwideuse OpenAI systems “a lot”, the company’s CEO, Sam Altman, said last month. Many use it as a replacement for Google – but as an answer engine rather than a search engine. Others use it as a productivity aid:two in three Britonsbelieve it’s good at checking work for spelling, grammar and style, according to a YouGov survey last month. Others use it for more personal means: one in eight respondents say it serves as a good mental health therapist, the same proportion that believe it can act as a relationship counsellor.Yet the controversy is also useful for OpenAI. The alarm underlines an increasing reliance on AI to live our lives, further cementing OpenAI’s place in our world. The headlines, the outrage and the think pieces all reinforce one key message:ChatGPTis everywhere. It matters. The very public nature of OpenAI’s apology also furthers the sense that this technology is fundamentally on our side; there are just some kinks to iron out along the way.I havepreviously reportedon AI’s ability to de-indoctrinate conspiracy theorists and get them to absolve their beliefs. But the opposite is also true: ChatGPT’s positive persuasive capabilities could also, in the wrong hands, be put to manipulative ends. We’ve seen that this week, through an ethically dubious study conducted by Swiss researchers at the University of Zurich. Without informing human participants or the people controlling the online forum on the communications platform Reddit, the researchersseededa subreddit with AI-generated comments, finding the AI was between three and six times more persuasive than humans were. (The study wasapprovedby the university’s ethics board.) At the same time, we’re being submerged under a swamp of AI-generated search results thatmore than half of usbelieve are useful, even if they fictionalise facts.So it’s worth reminding the public: AI models are not your friends. They’re not designed to help you answer the questions you ask. They’re designed to provide the most pleasing response possible, and to ensure that you are fully engaged with them. What happened this week wasn’t really a bug. It was a feature.Chris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite AppExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionComputingChatGPTcommentShareReuse this content"

Under Tony Blair’s leadership, the UK placed climate at the heart of global diplomacy. At the time, our understanding was based largely on scientific projections and models. Today, the crisis is in full view – faster and more devastating than many imagined. The world is now experiencing the daily impacts of climate breakdown, and our responses must reflect this escalating emergency. We need measured, strategic, sustained and, above all, urgent interventions to ensure a manageable future for humanity.That is why I support much of the thrust ofThe Climate Paradoxreportfrom the Tony Blair Institute. It rightly recognised that the era of endless summits and slogans must give way to one of delivery and impact. But the comments I gave were prior to seeing the foreword, and while there has been some clear misinterpretation from elements of the media, I do believe it has removed the balance of the report in ways that risk undermining what still can – and must – be achieved.Tony is right to highlight the need for innovation, investment and carbon removal. These are vital tools in our response. But framing the climate challenge as a choice between reducing emissions and developing new technologies is misleading. We need to do both – simultaneously and urgently. At the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, we call thisthe 4R Strategy: Reduce emissions, Remove greenhouse gases, Repair critical ecosystems, and build Resilience. These are not optional elements; they are the foundation of a manageable future. Treating them as alternatives risks delaying action we cannot afford to postpone.It’s the anti net-zero, anti-woke Tony Blair – how was this man ever considered a progressive? | Zoe WilliamsRead moreCrucially, the science has not changed: reducing emissions – and especially phasing out fossil fuels – remains the bedrock of any meaningful climate strategy. This is not ideology, it is science. The idea that phasing out fossil fuels should be anything but an immediate priority misreads the disaster in front of us and the direction of progress globally. Here in the UK, we havereduced emissions by 54% since 1990– an achievement few other countries can match. We have done so without undermining growth or prosperity. It hasn’t been perfect, but it proves what is possible when leadership, science and policy align.This is also not the time to walk back ambition. The UK’s goal of reducing emissionsby 81% by 2035– reaffirmed by Keir Starmer’s team – is not only achievable, it is necessary. Parliament’s Climate Change Committee, supported by rigorous scientific input, has demonstrated that the transition can be delivered. What it does require is consistency, clarity and leadership.Blair is also right that financial flows must be restructured to support climate action, especially in developing economies. But again, the answer is not to downplay emissions cuts at home – it is to build new coalitions of the willing that drive delivery globally. The likes of the EU, China, Kenya and Brazil and others are already showing leadership, and we need to support that with real investment, not retreat into fatalism.View image in fullscreenSubmerged cars sit in a car park after heavy rain and sewer system overflows caused the River Thames to break its banks in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, Janaury 2024.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesIt’s also important to correct one misconception. There is, in fact,widespread public concern about climate change. What is fragmenting is not public belief – but political coherence. Like many corners of our society, climate has become a proxy for culture war battles in many countries. In such a polarised world, we must speak with precision and care. Clear signals, transparent policies and honest leadership are essential in rebuilding the trust.And here is where I know Blair and I will be lock-step in agreement: the next phase must be about delivery. That means scaling solutions – wind, solar, storage, clean transport – and rapidly deploying new technologies where they make sense. It means investing in nature and resilience, in communities alongside technologies. And it means building a new kind of internationalism – less about process and more about progress.I take enormous pride in what Tony and I helped initiate together – a climate-conscious policy platform. And I deeply respect his longstanding commitment to development. But today, realism must not give way to resignation. We are not doomed to fail. We can’t afford failure, and with the right leadership a fairer and more prosperous society for all is there to grasp.David King was chief scientific adviser to the UK government under Tony Blair, and is founder and chair of the global Climate Crisis Advisory GroupExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionTony BlairGreenhouse gas emissionscommentShareReuse this content"

When exactly was his grace period? Admittedly, even the most cynical among us aren’t immune to royal wedding fever, and when he married Fergie the nation was still high on the fumes from Charles and Diana’s nuptials, so perhaps he was briefly popular in 1986. But other than that? Pretty confident recollections wouldn’t vary here. Nada.So technically we can’t call the events that have transpired since that brief moment in the sun a fall from grace. It’s more accurate to classify them as many falls from “meh”.With that in mind, it is genuinely baffling that there are still any conversations at all about Andrew returning to royal life, especially when many think Harry should be locked in a tower just for daring to pursue an alternative future. Yet the discussion has somehow rumbled on. Now, with the death of Virginia Giuffre, it must stop for good.When Giuffre alleged that she had been sexually assaulted by Andrew on three occasions when she was 17, he promised to fight to clear his name in court. His lawyer described her accusation as “baseless” and claimed she was seeking a “payday”.Andrew went on to settle out of courtin the US civil case for an estimated $12m, while making no admission of guilt. His lawyer declined to comment. David Boies, representing Giuffre, said of the settlement: “I believe the event speaks for itself.”The teenager had been recruited to Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking ring by Ghislaine Maxwell in 2000 while working as a locker-room attendant at President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach.Giuffre told the Miami Herald: “Before you know it, I’m being lent out to politicians and academics and royalty.” In a later interview with the BBC, she chillingly described being“passed around like a platter of fruit”.Last weekend, her family announced thatshe had “lost her life to suicide, after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking. In the end, the toll of the abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight.”With a few jaw-dropping exceptions, when it comes to royal scandals we don’t usually hear from the royal at the centre of the storm: never complain, never explain, and all that. But, unfortunately, thanks to his infamous Newsnight interview, we’re under no illusions about the precise level of remorse Andrew feels for his involvement with Jeffrey Epstein, which continued after Epstein was convicted and sentenced to eighteen months in prison in 2008, for procuring a minor for prostitution. Remember, as Andrew said in that interview, the only thing he’s guilty of is a “tendency to be too honourable”.The mea non culpa also showcased Andrew’s superpowers: a staggering degree of tone-deafness and complete illiteracy when it comes to reading rooms. As producerSam McAlister revealed in the aftermath: “As the interview ended, and I looked at the floor, unable to comprehend what we’d just witnessed, it became clear that Prince Andrew actually thought it had gone well. Very well … Those historic photos of him and Emily [Maitlis] walking in the palace corridors that you saw? Taken after that terrible interview took place … You can see how well he thought it had gone.”It’s the same story every time he pops back up, cold sore-style and just as welcome. From when he bowled down the aisle with the late Queen, unselfconsciously centre stage, at Prince Philip’s memorial in 2022, to most recently at a public appearance at an Easter church service in Windsor. (His first since the furore over his links with businessman Yang Tengbo,accused of being a Chinese spy.)Whenever we see Andrew, his expression is that of a dog who’s not bothering to beg for a treat because he’s so certain it’s coming his way. “Ugh, haven’t I waited long enough?” drips from every pore. Sorry,woulddrip from every pore, if only that were medically possible.Never being allowed back to royal duties, into the spotlight he so clearly relishes, means he will spend the rest of his days languishing in the lap of luxury. As punishments go, it’s hardly harsh. But there is a sting in the tail. It’s highly likely Andrew will be for ever denied the public approval he still seems to feel he is entitled to and deserves. It’s not a life sentence as most of us understand it, and it’s certainly nowhere close to the one Virginia Giuffre endured, but at least it’s not nothing.Polly Hudson is a freelance writerDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It took a punt on FanDuel, then just an online fantasy games business, in 2018 as an option on US liberalisation of its gambling rules. When states in the US did indeed start to open up, it gained full control. Last year, and with FanDuel now its biggest division, Flutterswitched its listing to New York. Entain, the Ladbrokes and Coral group that remains in the FTSE 100 index, has a US joint venture with MGM Resorts.Denise Coatesof Bet365 will have taken note. The lure of a US jackpot is the most likely explanation for why she is exploring a full or partial sale of the family-owned company,as revealed by this newspaper. You’d stake a large sum that any deal will involve US money or a US partnership. The US is the obvious place to go, and the politics of expansion are easier there when you can present a local face.The point about the US market is that it is already big – and on the way to becoming enormous. Flutter talks about a $70bn “market opportunity” in North America, having generated $5.8bn of revenue from FanDuel last year. Bet365 has taken a more cautious approach, and has only recently won licences in 13 states, but the market itself is still in the “land grab” phase. Some of the biggest states are yet to liberalise fully.The appeal of Bet365 for US private equity investors or firms will be its technological and back-office expertise, just as it was with the others. It may sound odd to think of US firms as novices in any tech-related field, but that’s how life has been in gambling. Bet365 brings the history of being the pioneer in the complicated business of “in-play” betting – betting on the timing of the next corner in a football (or soccer) match, for example.Any would-be investor would surely be mad to let Coates head for the exit immediately. She built the business from a portable building in a car park in Stoke-on-Trent in 2001, anticipating that betting would go online with the arrival of the internet. It may now be worth £9bn or so. She is 57 and is a hands-on boss – you’d want her on board for as long as possible.Thus a two-stage deal looks the most likely. First, bring in outside capital and a US partner. Then, after a few more rounds of expansion and with a succession plan in place, make a fuller exit, possibly via a listing on a US stock exchange. Alternatively, on the outside chance there is a would-be acquirer for the whole business today, bidders know they have an opportunity.Coates seems to have been warming up for this moment for a while. Bet365 has stopped taking bets from China, where betting is illegal, and ownership of Stoke City football club, which would surely be seen as non-core by most investors, was transferred to Coates’s brother.None of which guarantees that a deal will be found, but the odds are favourable. The US market is hot and Bet365 is the last big, tech-savvy UK operator that is up for grabs for a US investor. Coates’s timing looks excellent.Explore more on these topicsBusinessNils Pratley on financeGamblingIrelandPrivate equityMergers and acquisitionscommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s how Britain can do the right thing – and make its money countDavid MilibandThe politics of aid may be toxic, but the UK must realise that supporting the world’s poorest people is both a moral and pragmatic thing to doDavid Miliband is president and CEO of the International Rescue CommitteeThu 1 May 2025 06.32 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 14.00 EDTShareIn more than 10 years working in the aid sector, I have seen extraordinary innovations, from childhood education programmes for refugee children, to AI-driven flood warnings that alert farmers in some of the most vulnerable places on earth. Many of the initiatives I’ve seen are remarkably impactful and deliver serious value for money: it costs the International Rescue Committee (IRC) just £3 ($4) todeliver a life-saving vaccinedose in the midst of a conflict in east Africa, for example.The politics surrounding international aid, however, are increasingly toxic. The UK’s Department for International Development and now the US equivalent, USAID, have been dismantled, despite the British public being more than twice as likely to say that aid has a positive rather than negative impact. Denmark has stuck to the UN target of spending 0.7% of its national income on overseas development, yet it is an exception rather than a norm among European nations. The UK government now needs to answer a number of hard questions about aid: what is it for, how should it be delivered, and who should pay for it?In the 1990s, the fight against extreme poverty was a success story. In 1990, more than one-third of the global population lived on less than $2.15 a day; by 2015, that hadshrunk to about 10%. Chinese and Indian economic development was critical, butso wereaid and debt write- offs such as theHeavily Indebted Poor Countriesinitiative. Today, however, the World Bank warns that global poverty reduction hascome to a near standstill, and 700 million people are living on less than $2.15 per day.Ukraine is nowthe world’s largest aid recipient. The IRC is proud to work there. But the other 19 countries on the IRC’s 2025 Emergency Watchlist, which outlines the world’s worst humanitarian crises, are home to more than 240 million peoplefacing increasing displacementand escalating violence. Their needs are acute, from extreme hunger to a lack of basic healthcare and clean water. These 19 countries receive only 12% of total official development assistance (ODA). Of the $212bn global aid budget, more goes to middle and upper-middle income countries than to the least-developed countries.Over the past 10 years, with the launch of the 17sustainable development goalsin 2015, and especially since Covid, aid funds have been used for a range of goals, each desirable in and of themselves, but increasingly in competition with the immediate needs of the poorest people. Humanitarian aid averages about 14% of the total global aid budget,and health spending about 10%. OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) analysis shows the largest share of bilateral aid in 2017-21 went on addressing global challenges such as climate mitigation.Meanwhile, richer donor countries are spending asmuch of their aid budgetson supporting refugees and asylum seekers at home as the total that is spent on humanitarian aid globally.The UK has been part of this trend. Its aid commitments to overseas development have been falling since 2020, andnearly 20%of British “overseas aid”, around £4bn a year, is actually being spent in Britain, on the costs of housing refugees and asylum seekers.The most acute needs are increasingly concentrated in fragile states where governments are weak or at war. The focus of the world’s aid budget is being diluted across multiple priorities, and its overall size is being reduced. Meanwhile, the hope that public-private partnerships would direct investment to the poorer parts of the world has not been fulfilled, and the macro-economic environment has turned sour,with rising interest rates sucking money out of developing countries.As the government prepares for its spending review, it has the opportunity to advance Britain’s interests and do the right thing. First, it should make sure that its commitment to spend 0.3% of national income on overseas aid actually goes abroad to help those in greatest need. Second, Britain should use its voice and money to focus aid on fragile and conflict-affected states. The government’s continued support for Sudan, which is now the site of theworld’s largest humanitarian crisis, is good policy. However the UN’s humanitarian response plan for Sudan remains only 12% funded, largely because of reduced American support.Third, it should focus aid on proven, high impact programmes. There are 45 million acutely malnourished children in the world today, yet the current system for treating them, which is divided between different UN agencies, fails to reach 80% of those in crisis-affected states. IRC programmes have shown how reforming the system to empower community health workers could deliver a cost efficiency gain of 30%, reaching millions more children without spending more money.Fourth, the UK should also lead with its strengths. One particularly promising area is leveraging Britain’s leadership in financial services to create new funding mechanisms for development. Currently only 12% of private finance goes to the 25 lowest-income countries , yet incentives for private investment can work in countries that are more stable. To help lower income countries develop their economies, the government needs to adopt a comprehensive approach. Remittances could play a role, for example: they amount to nearly $700bn annually, more than three times the global aid budget. Debt relief could help put education and health systems on a sounder financial footing. And financial mechanisms that blend funding from public and private sources could then build on these more solid foundations.Finally, the government’s “reset” of our relations with the rest of Europe should include shared endeavour to help the world’s poorest. The EU is a massive player in this area, with the funding and tools to make it a natural partner for British aid efforts. In all these areas, Britain’s interests and reputation will be advanced by activism and innovation, not retreat. The world is more connected. Neglecting other parts of the world will only come back to bite us. The government’s cuts are regrettable, but now we need a strategy for the funding that remains.David Miliband is president and CEO of the International Rescue CommitteeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A more realistic estimate is that while Ukraine is glad to sign, this is not a shift in the big pictureThu 1 May 2025 13.56 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 17.54 EDTShareThe Trump administration, with its customary rhetorical inflation, has hailed itsmineral dealwith Ukraine as “historic”. What the world’s most powerful nation says and does matters. But how much? And for how long? This is a government of caprice and chaos. Attempting to connect the data points can be like trying to join up the bug splats on a windscreen. The real issue is that the vehicle is still following the signs for Moscow.This moment looks like a high because US-Ukraine ties hit such a low, particularly with the Oval Office bullying of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and reports that Washington is willing to recognise annexed Crimea as Russian.Key details of this dealhave yet to be finalised in a technical agreement. The idea originated with Kyiv, which saw that economic incentives might be the only way to interest the money-minded US president in its defence. The Trump administration decided the answer was, in essence, to take all the resources without granting the security guarantee that Ukraine had sought. It looked a bit like a protection racket, without ongoing protection.To reach a profit-sharing deal, therefore, is a success for Ukrainian diplomacy in very difficult circumstances and arguably the first positive sign in the bilateral relationship since Mr Trump took office. The textrefers to “Russia’s full-scale invasion” and “war machine”– the kind of language that the administration has not only avoided butactively rejectedelsewhere. (In February, Mr Trump said that Ukraine “should never have started it”.) Ukraine will not be retroactively repaying the US for its support. Kyiv has also said that for the first 10 years, profits will be “fully reinvested in Ukraine’s economy”, though this does not appear to be stated in the document.But the agreement’s significance is limited. The presence of American citizens and businesses is not inherently protective: they were already in Ukraine when Vladimir Putin’s tanks rolled across the border in 2022. The agreement certainly does not show that Mr Trump wants toprolong US military aid– thoughreports saythat the administration plans to approve $50m of arms exports – still less offer a security backstop to a European presence. It does not signal that he is turning his back on Mr Putin, even if he is currently voicing irritation with him. And it does not mean that abigger economic dealwith Russia may not be in the pipeline.Touting this agreement as evidence of his deal‑making prowess could encourage Mr Trump to feel a degree of political investment in the crisis, and perhaps therefore make Mr Putin step a little more carefully. But the Russian president may think he should seize more territory while he can. Mr Trump’s peace-making efforts to date have amounted to attempting to strong-armUkraineinto accepting Moscow’s terms because he thinks that any deal looks better than none.At a time of such peril, even very limited gains will be welcomed and exploited. Mr Trump may be somewhat more inclined to allow military intelligence to keep flowing, or European nations to buy arms for Ukraine. In the worst case scenario, Kyiv has shored up the relationship for a short period, while European allies step up support. That is not nothing. But an administration which has so harshly demanded Ukraine’s gratitude has yet to give it anything deserving of thanks.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While the pair have collaborated on numerous other stories, none is as iconic as the tale of the little brown mouse who outwits a succession of predators. There is no shortage of Gruffalo merchandise. But in an age of franchises and prequels, this author-illustrator partnership clearly decided that less was more.It is reportedly thanks to her wish to support the National Literacy Trust that Ms Donaldson decided to bring the Gruffalo back after all. The new book will bepublished next year, and used in an international campaign to promote children’s reading. The depressing findings of a survey released this week, showing asteep declinein the proportion of UK parents who read aloud to their children, make this announcement particularly welcome. Another report, from the National Literacy Trust, found that the proportion of eight- to 18-year-olds who read for pleasure fell last year to arecord low of 35%.Ms Donaldson and Mr Scheffler are well placed to make the case for reading aloud. As an author, she was a late bloomer, first published when she was in her 40s. She has spoken of her impatience with books that are too preachy or sentimental, and rejects the idea of “picture-book medicine” to help children overcome problems. Her stories, by contrast, are designed to give excitement and joy. Plot and humour are key ingredients, along with her signature rhyming style. In an interview, she recalled the favourite stories that kept her own children from going to sleep at night because they were so “full of mirth”.It is concerning to learn from the survey, which was carried out by HarperCollins and Nielsen, that parents increasingly see reading as a skill – “more a subject to learn than a fun thing to do”. The fact that this view is more prevalent among younger adults strongly suggests a link with the rise of digital entertainment and ubiquitous screens and games.Education policies focused on literacy are widely regarded as another factor. For years,authorsand other champions of children’s literature have warned that the instrumental approach to reading that became dominant under the Conservatives has had the unintended consequence of devaluing creativity. Too often, the texts placed before primary-school pupils are chosen not for their imaginative merit but because they belong to a particular learning scheme.The latest findings support this view. Anothernew report, from the Publishers Association, describes the situation as a crisis. Among other measures, it urges ministers to bolster library provision and put more emphasis on reading for enjoyment in the curriculum. At a summit earlier this year, Frank Cottrell-Boyce, the author and Waterstones children’s laureate, said that theemotional and educational benefitsof being read to, for very young children, mean that access to books is a public health issue.The return of the big bad mouse – wily as he is – and his adversary should not be expected to reverse these trends. But the advocacy of Ms Donaldson, Mr Cottrell-Boyce and others deserves support. The inspiration for the Gruffalo came from a Chinese folk tale. If all goes to plan, his further adventures will be a exuberant reminder of the age-old power of storytelling.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This is all devastating to wildlife, on land or sea.Incineration plants are used to dispose of much of this modern clothing trash, but they come with a bad track record. Furthermore, the petrochemical industry saw disinvestment from fossil fuel on the horizon decades ago, so its promoters headed towards every other business that could use it, resulting in a huge move towards plastic packaging and manmade textiles, even though it would lead to industrial-scale pollution.It would be useful for articles to progress from shoppers’ difficulties in making eco-friendly choices to compare clothing manufactured from natural materials. These do incur an environmental cost, but should be easier to dispose of, except that the fibre must be unblended, stitching must be cotton or linen, and the final garment unadorned with manmade features such as fasteners, care labels, and embroidered logos.The social cost of our clothing must also be reckoned with. Sweatshops andchild labourare involved in the processing of cotton. The supply chain is global and difficult to trace. There are healthier ways to stock our wardrobes and it would be a positive contribution if the Guardian could write about more that aren’t cripplingly expensive.Jane EadesTruro, CornwallI started mailing plastic packaging to CEOs and MPs in 2007 to highlight frustration at having plastic imposed on consumers and then paying in our council tax to landfill or incinerate it, both of which produce toxic residue. The “polluter pays” policy doesn’t seem to apply to retailers, who blame manufacturers while extolling the virtues of plastic for keeping food undamaged as it gathers food miles.I’ve bought most of my clothing secondhand all my life, but charity shop textiles have gone downhill. Even the new stuff is unwearable. I am reminded of Brentford Nylons in th 1970s – sweaty bedsheets, gaudy patterns and static shocks. I now buy better-quality, natural textiles that last, and I mend what I can for as long as I can. In times past, two sets of clothes sufficed and were left in your will. That does sound extreme, but maybe we should start by simply consuming less while finding new ways to repurpose material.Helen McDowallBampton, DevonWhile I take the point that shops shouldn’t sell this stuff, I can’t help think that it is also down to consumers to take responsibility. Shops sell what people want to buy. For all those sending clothes back in outrage, it would be interesting to know how many other synthetic items they’ve purchased since the offending item. There are many natural material choices available that can be easily recycled if you check the label before purchasing.Buy a cotton sheet, not polycotton. Denim without elastic is available if you go for non-stretch versions. Maybe if people favoured natural fabrics with their purchasing power, and bought less in the first place, it would be less of a problem.Ellie ClarkeLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But, by half-time, Ruben Amorim’s men were flying, and if Noussair Mazraoui’s left-foot rocket had beaten Julen Agirrezabala, rather than ricocheted back off his crossbar, United’s lead would have been 4-0, and this tie clinically dead.Fernandes stars as Manchester United cruise against 10-man Athletic BilbaoRead moreThe sheer, unadulterated comic-book nature of what unfolded in 15 crazy opening half minutes (from 30-45) was underscored by Harry Maguire turning from barnstorming No 9 who headed United into this semi-final to a Sir Stanley Matthews-esque wizard who befuddled Mikel Jauregizar before popping over the cross that ended with Casemiro’s opener.Bruno Fernandes’s second was a penalty that demanded Espen Eskås view the monitor before the referee awarded it – Daniel Vivian’s evening plunging into a personal abyss as his infringement on Rasmus Højlund that provoked the decision was followed by a straight red card. Cue serious boos from a barely disbelieving and furious home faithful.At some point during all this breathless fare Eskås’s popularity plunged even further when inadvertently blocking Jauregizar as he fashioned to unload a volley from a (by now) rare Athletic foray.When Fernandes later ghosted in and hit United’s third their travelling congregation, mostly positioned high in a corner of the magnificent San Mamés Stadium, were seriously euphoric. They, like all witnesses, could not fathom how an Ernesto Valverde team fourth in La Liga that had shipped only 10 goals at home in the competition had suffered the rout, particularly as it was all very far from how the contest began.Bouncing, feverish, fanatical, intimidating, raucous – oh, and bedlam: this cathedral of football offered a high-octane cocktail of all of these as United fanned out, shook hands, crossed figurative fingers, and set out trying to silence the ear-shredding crowd.Some hope, even when their team fell behind. Noise was the constant accompaniment, a soundtrack fuelled by passion and partisanship from Athletic’s support. When Maguire dawdled over a free-kick, then waved André Onana forward to take the dead ball, jeers met the slow trot forward of the visiting No 1. When an Iñaki Williams bullet header missed from close range a split-second of silent astonishment was superseded by the thunderclap of 50,000-plusLos Leonesinstantly getting back to roaring their men on. All United could do was soak up the red-and-white waves that crashed at and through them and their collective pulse raced when Victor Lindelöf twice saved Onana’s goal from being breached.View image in fullscreenCasemiro receives congratulations after giving Manchester United the lead.Photograph: Ash Donelon/Manchester United/Getty ImagesYou saw all of this and wagered when, not if Valverde’s feisty outfit would score and begin to really pose United a question. To ask their own, Amorim instructed the jet-heeled Alejandro Garnacho to be hit whenever a teammate could, the wideman flitting from the right wing (where he netted an early, offside strike) to the left, often drawing markers and fouls.But, then, this opening leg went a sublimely topsy-turvy way for United and after a sun-drenched day on the nearby river Nervión, Amorim’s sending out of this XI on a mission to administer the opening blows in taming Athletic and reach the final where the trophy can be claimed and Champions League qualification secured was more than accomplished.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If the latter reads as quaint, Amorim might have been truer to what he really meant by excising the last word – as in Manchester United –the club– cannot be saved. Because what he followed up with when speaking at the pre-game media conference was a forensic dismantling of United’s ills as a deep structural failure of the operation he walked into last November.Athletic Bilbao 0-3 Manchester United: Europa League semi-final, first leg – as it happenedRead more“[We need] consistency, good decisions, good recruitment, good academy,” said Amorim, in an echo of the “can’t bat, can’t bowl, can’t field” dismembering of the 1986-87 England Ashes tourists by the cricketing scribe, Martin Johnson, who ventured this, then watched as Mike Gatting’s team returned from Australia cock a-hoop with the urn, courtesy of a 2-1 win, the two Test victories the sole ones of his captaincy.Amorim’s version regarding United is as searing – United are, indeed, a dysfunctional institution that requires wholesale surgery to be mended. But if the continent’s second-tier pot can be plundered – and there is next week’s return to be negotiated before any final (perhaps against Tottenham, back here) – then this year, for so long a certifiable annus horribilis – will definitely be rescued.And so, too, the Amorim doubters quietened, as the likeable Portuguese will have pulled off a feat even more incredible than Erik ten Hag’s 2-1 FA Cup final triumph last May over Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City. For now, though, let us simply wonder at the enigma that is this mercurial Amorim vintage.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedAthletic BilbaoEuropa LeagueanalysisShareReuse this content"

It had been hard to hear yourself think as the emotions of a frustrating campaign poured out with each goal that went in, with Brennan Johnson’s opener after just 38 seconds setting the tone.But this being Spurs, things are never quite that simple. Cruising at 3-0 after further goals from James Maddison and Dominic Solanke seemed to have given them a comfortable advantage, a late strike from Bodø/Glimt’s stand-in captain, Ulrik Saltnes, that deflected off the unfortunate Micky van de Ven changed the complexion of the tie in an instant.Ange Postecoglou says Bodø’s goal will not dent Tottenham’s confidenceRead moreAfter a campaign that has seen them lose an unprecedented 19 Premier League games, Ange Postecoglou’s side will travel to the Arctic Circle for next week’s second leg on an artificial surface – knowing that their season remains very much on the line. Substitute Dejan Kulusevski could have restored their three-goal cushion in stoppage time but instead it was the away side, who have somehow reached the last four despite operating on a fraction of their opponents’ budget, that will take the momentum into next week’s decisive game.There had been a huge sense of anticipation among the home supporters before kick-off, with the giant South Stand transformed into a magnificent tifo display of the Spurs motto “To Dare Is To Do” just before the teams emerged. Postecoglou stressed beforehand the importance of establishing a lead before their mission to a town almost 1,000km north of Oslo for the second leg, although he acknowledged that a side who have knocked out Lazio and Olympiakos in the last two rounds were going to be no pushovers. Yet with regular captain, Patrick Berg, and midfielder Håkon Evjen suspended and Bodø also missing key defenders, he would have known this was their big opportunity to put one foot in the final in Bilbao.Kjetil Knutsen was able to name only five outfield players on the bench as their yellow-clad fans packed out the end behind Nikita Haikin’s goal hoping to limit the damage. So it could hardly have been a worse start for them when Yves Bissouma – a surprise inclusion by Postecoglou because Lucas Bergvall was ruled out after injuring his ankle in training on Wednesday – found space down the right and picked out Richarlison at the back post. The Brazilian’s header across goal deceived everyone but Johnson, who made no mistake by directing the ball back into the other corner.View image in fullscreenBodø/Glimt celebrate Ulrik Saltnes’s goal in front of their fans.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesIt was the fastest goal of the season in this competition and most of this impressive stadium erupted in sheer delight. Bodø’s players formed a huddle in an attempt to reset themselves and, for the next half an hour, they appeared to be just about coping with Tottenham’s threat. Destiny Udogie flashed a volley over the bar at one end before Knutsen was on his feet appealing for a penalty at the other when the Italian clashed with Isak Määttä inside the area but the referee was having none of it.Bodø had been given warning of the danger Maddison posed running in behind their defence when he scooped Cristian Romero’s long ball off target midway through the half. The England midfielder did not make the same mistake twice as he raced on to Pedro Porro’s pass and finished with his left foot underneath Haikin. Tottenham smelled blood and had the Russian goalkeeper not produced an excellent save to deny a stunning volley from Rodrigo Bentancur then they may have been out of sight by half-time. Ole Blomberg could not hit the target when Bodø finally mustered their first sight of goal just before the break. Postecoglou, who had celebrated both goals with gusto on the touchline, headed down the tunnel looking like a manager in control of his own destiny.Richarlison did not emerge for the second half and was replaced by Mathys Tel, with Bodø also making a change in their overworked defence. They attempted to take the sting out of Spurs by keeping the ball but found it hard to escape their own half despite shading the possession statistics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The referee initially waved play on but reversed his decision on the advice of the VAR. Solanke, who was the hero of Tottenham’s victory over Eintracht Frankfurt after scoring from the spot in the last round, sat Haikin down before coolly dispatching his penalty into the net.Tel could have given Spurs even more breathing space when his shot from a tight angle was tipped around the post. It was to prove costly as Saltnes ensured there will still be plenty on the line next week.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueTottenham HotspurBodø/Glimtmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There was no irony about the celebrations from the noisyDjurgårdenfans when their team finally found the back of the net. The roar was deafening and the emotion was genuine. The only problem, though, was that Chelsea were already four goals to the good by the time Isak Alemayehu Mulugeta got the underdogs on the scoresheet in Stockholm.It was not a great look for a competition that Uefa invented for the benefit of Europe’s smaller clubs.Chelseaagainst the 11th best team in Sweden for a place in the final of the Conference League? A show of the Premier League’s financial power was inevitable. Enzo Fernández, signed for £106.7m, decorated the contest with early assists for Jadon Sancho and Noni Madueke. Nicolas Jackson came off the bench and scored twice. Cole Palmer’s failure to end his goal drought was a sideshow.“The performance for one hour, 70 minutes, was good,” Enzo Maresca said. “Then we dropped a little bit because we are 4-0 up. We cannot allow ourselves to drop because it was complicated. Against Legia Warsaw away we won 3-0 and then at home we struggled. It is a good experience. We are going to finish the job.”How did Djurgården end up in a European semi-final against Chelsea?Read moreThere was something ludicrous about a European semi-final being contested by one team who have spent over £1bn in the space of three years and another whose record transfer stands at £1.5m. Maresca’s pre-match insistence that games are never decided by money alone felt hard to take seriously. Do Chelsea really have what it takes not to win this competition? Followers of Djurgården saw little chance of an upset. After all they were not expected to beat Rapid Vienna in the previous round and, to put things in context, this is already their best run in Europe since they reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup 70 years ago.The sense was that Djurgården’s best hope lay in the dodgy pitch at the 3Arena acting as a leveller. Maresca, who was concerned about the surface causing injuries, took no chances. He rotated heavily and had many of his best players on the bench.View image in fullscreenChelsea’s Jadon Sancho opens the scoring against Djurgården.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersChelsea still had too much quality. There were a few moments when the pitch disrupted their passing but dealing with a ferocious atmosphere proved less of a problem. Djurgården were soon being moved around and were behind after 13 minutes, their back four prised apart when Fernández found Sancho and the winger took chested the ball down before scoring with a shot that went in largely thanks to Marcus Danielson making a mess of his attempted goal-line clearance.At least the home fans remained in high spirits. Djurgården, though, struggled to lay a glove on Chelsea during the first half. The visitors looked too quick, strong and smart. Tyrique George, the exciting 19-year-old attacker, was a handful after being deployed through the middle. Darting across the frontline, he was soon involved as Chelsea threatened to double their lead, only for Marc Cucurella to screw a shot wide from 20 yards.It began to feel like a group game against the bottom seed. Reece James, stationed in midfield, dinked a ball over the top for Madueke, whose effort was turned over by Jacob Rinne. Another goal was a matter of time. Chelsea threatened whenever they picked up the pace. They led 2-0 when Fernández provided more incision in his role as No 10, teeing up Madueke to beat Rinne with a low shot in the 43rd minute.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As for Djurgården, their task was made even harder by Maresca bringing on Jackson, Palmer, Trevoh Chalobah and Moisés Caicedo at half-time. Jackson quickly made his presence felt: first when he capitalised on a defensive mix-up and tapped into an empty net in the 59th minute, then when he turned and bent a fine shot into the top corner six minutes later.Djurgården, who created a few chances during the second half, kept going. They had joy down the left and pulled one back when Tobias Gulliksen crossed for Alemayehu to bounce a header past Filip Jorgensen. Chelsea still cruised to victory, though. It will not be until they reach the final and face either Real Betis or Fiorentina in Wroclaw later this month that they encounter anything remotely resembling true jeopardy.Explore more on these topicsEuropa Conference LeagueChelseaDjurgårdenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

His other club, Greek champions Olympiakos, have qualified for the grandest stage in the club game but Forest’s bid to return to Europe’s premier competition will likely go to the wire. Will Forest look back on this defeat at home to Brentford as a costly misstep when their season ends here against Chelsea?Forest, who face Crystal Palace, Leicester and West Ham before that potential final-day showdown with Chelsea, never really got going on a disappointing evening. Goals from Kevin Schade and Yoane Wissa, a January target for Forest, condemned the hosts to successive league home defeats for the first time since the end of last season and Nuno Espírito Santo’s side have now lost four of their past five matches in all competitions, including last weekend’s FA Cup semi-final. At full-time Anthony Elanga and Neco Williams crouched, winded by defeat, and Nuno’s challenge is to lift a dejected group of players. The stakes are a reminder of how far they have come.ForBrentford, it was almost the perfect away performance, an efficient and businesslike display. Thomas Frank’s side are two points off eighth, which could be enough for European football next season. If anything was symptomatic of Forest’s disjointed display it was the sight of the substitute Ramon Sosa taking the ball off Chris Wood’s head in the final minute of the 90.Premier League top scorers 2024-25: who is leading race for Golden Boot?Read moreHow would Forest respond to defeat at Wembley? “You grieve, and then you react,” Nuno had said but this game only served more pain to swallow, Schade and Wissa seizing on uncharacteristic defensive lapses by the fit-again Ola Aina and Nikola Milenkovic respectively in each half. The return of Aina after a month out meant Forest were, in theory at least, fully-powered. Schade’s goal approaching first-half stoppage time sent this stadium, one of the best in the league when at maximum volume, into near-silence. Nuno, hands on hips, stared into the distance as every outfield Brentford player ambled over towards the corner flag to mob Schade.The goals were very un-Forest, both stemming from Forest not dealing with direct balls downfield, one from a centre-back, the other from a goalkeeper. Nuno acknowledged there is a need to revert to type. “We have to go back and find our best version,” he said. “Our basic play is compact, solid, we don’t give away chances. A clean sheet has been a main and basic pillar [for us this season] and today it was the other way around. It was too easy. I’m concerned about: how can we compete against Palace? How can we be ourselves again?”For the first goal Nathan Collins pinged a diagonal pass 60 yards upfield and Schade slithered between Aina and Milenkovic to latch on to the ball. Schade tried to take the pass down with the outside of his right boot and he was fortunate that his mis-control worked to his advantage, the ball’s path tricking Aina, who slipped at the crucial moment. It got messier, too, the ball bobbling off the torso of the Brentford forward before he prodded in. A hush descended on the City Ground and Aina ended up laying supine as Schade went sliding across the turf in celebration.View image in fullscreenKevin Schade takes advantage of Ola Aina’s slip to open the scoring.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesForest flattered to deceive. Aina had Keane Lewis-Potter walking a tightrope after he was booked for an early barge on Elanga and it was no surprise to see Rico Henry replace the Brentford full-back at the interval. Forest were forced into a half-time change, with the unusually ineffective Callum Hudson-Odoi departing with a hamstring problem. Brentford made a fast start, Schade heading at goal inside two minutes and Christian Nørgaard and Sepp van den Berg also went close.Forest’s season has been built on a sturdy defence, Milenkovic and Murillo one of the best centre-back partnerships in the division, but here they were not quite so assured. There was an anxiety to Forest’s play, underlined by poor decision-making and a white noise in the stands, a constant chatter and uneasiness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Forest finally thought they were getting somewhere and then Brentford doubled their lead.Milenkovic misjudged the bounce from Flekken’s booming kick downfield and Wissa raced on to the ball before keeping his cool to dink the ball over Matz Sels. A look of disbelief covered Murillo’s face, Aina shook his head. “Forest, give us a song,” the Brentford fans sang gleefully, the home support unusually lost for words.

Now Vítor Pereira’s side pose a problem that Manchester City must solve as the latter chase maximum points from their last four games in the race for Champions League qualification. Pep Guardiola’s side are unbeaten in the last eight in all competitions and buoyed up by last Sunday’s reaching of athird successive FA Cup final, so this should be a close one. Keep an eye out for Guardiola potentially having a complimentary word with Matheus Cunha, as is his habit when coming up against a high-class opposition player.Jamie JacksonManchester City v Wolves,Friday 8pm(all times BST)2Villa may need flawless finishHave Aston Villa left themselves too much to do? A superb five-match Premier League winning run came to a haltagainst Manchester Citybeforetheir FA Cup semi-final defeat to Crystal Palaceat Wembley. Within two weeks, they have gone from three competitions to one, so Villa at least will argue they are laser-focused on the remaining four matches. First up is a home tie against Fulham and Villa may need another flawless run to make the top five. Unai Emery exceeded all expectations by leading Villa to the Champions League quarter-finals and a taste of mixing it with Europe’s elite has left them wanting more, even if the club insist it is not paramount for the wider profit and sustainability picture. As the immortal Ron Saunders quote goes, do you want to bet against us?Ben FisherAston Villa v Fulham, Saturday 12.30pm3Fringe Everton players to seize chance?There might not be much riding on the penultimate game at Goodison Park – and the final 3pm Saturday kick-off in the stadium’s history – but after a testing schedule against five of the current top six David Moyes will need to see evidence of genuine progress against Ipswich. The extra revenue from a higher league finish would not go amiss either. Everton have won once in nine games and it is not only their many out-of-contract players who are playing for their futures under Moyes. Beto’s form has deteriorated since the five goals in five games that lifted Everton’s relegation fears in February. That purple patch looks increasingly like the exception, rather than the norm. Nathan Patterson was handed a rare opportunity to kickstart his injury-hit Everton career atChelsealast weekend but failed to state his case as a solution for the team’s right-back problem. Both players need to step up, if handed another chance to do so, against depleted and relegated opponents.Andy HunterEverton vIpswich Town, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenDavid Moyes speaks with Beto (left) and Idrissa Gueye (right) during Everton’s defeat to Chelsea last weekend.Photograph: Vince Mignott/MB Media/Getty Images4Leicester looking for a way to stay positiveLeicester, with no goals and no points from their last nine home games, end what has been a miserable season with matches against the only teams with home records worse than their own, with Southampton’s visit to be followed by that of Ipswich. “We’ve been addressing it for a couple of weeks now,” Ruud van Nistelrooy said. “We want the season to end as positively as possible within the situation of relegation.” Achieving that will involve a complete change of momentum: over the last 19 games, or exactly half aPremier Leagueseason, even the Saints’ miserable record has been better than the Foxes’, who have four points, six goals and a goal difference of -40 to Southampton’s six, 14 and -35. Leicester’s morale is at a low ebb: Ricardo Pereira, Bobby De Cordova-Reid and Facundo Buonanotte are ruled out of this game, while Mads Hermansen has had surgery on his groin, which will sideline him until August. If you rank all goalkeepers who have played in this year’s Premier League by the number of goals conceded per 90 minutes played, six of the top 11 play for either Leicester or Southampton; in straw-clutching news Jakub Stolarczyk, who will have the gloves for the rest of Leicester’s season, is last on that list.Simon BurntonLeicester City v Southampton, Saturday 3pm5Arsenal need Ødegaard back on formThe critics have rounded on Martin Ødegaard after his underwhelming performance in the first leg of Arsenal’s Champions League semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain, with the former Match of the Day pundit and Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson even suggesting that Declan Rice should take over as captain given the Norwegian’s struggles of late. That would be extremely harsh for a player who has led by example for Mikel Arteta’s side over the past few seasons, although Ødegaard’s record of just five goals and 10 assists in 40 appearances in all competitions is a disappointing return. A frustrating ankle injury at the start of the season and the birth of his first child both appear to have affected the former Real Madrid player’s form, with Ethan Nwaneri coming off the bench to replace him at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday as Arsenal chased an equaliser. The visit ofBournemouthto north London is an opportunity for Ødegaard to rebuild his confidence ahead of the second leg in Paris next week that will determine his side’s destiny.Ed AaronsArsenal v Bournemouth, Saturday 5.30pm6United’s youngsters may have to waitGiven that the first timeManchester Unitedplayed Brentford this season they had won one of their previous six league games (and that against Southampton), had half an eye on a Europa League fixture a few days away and still prevailed, Thomas Frank’s side are unlikely to get carried away with the fact that United go into this one having won one of their previous seven league games (and that against Leicester) and with Europe on their minds. Even if United are almost entirely focused on making sure they don’t fumble victory over Athletic Bilbao in next Thursday’s semi-final second leg, the unexpectedly emphatic 3-0 win in the first meeting at San Mamés might have changed Ruben Amorim’s thinking about this match. Clearly he had been planning to field a few fringe and youth players, bringing both the 17-year-old forward Chido Obi and the 19-year-old midfielder Sékou Koné to Spain despite both being ineligible to play in Europe, just so they could take part in Friday morning’s training session before joining the squad on their trip to London. Jaydan Kamason, an 18-year-old right-back, and the 17-year-old winger Bendito Mantato were both unused substitutes in Bilbao and could make their senior debuts this weekend. But given that progress in Europe looks more comfortable than expected Amorim could now choose to field a stronger and more senior side against Brentford, who are unbeaten in four and have a chance of securing European football next season.SBBrentford v Manchester United, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenChido Obi is among the Manchester United youngsters aiming to pick up more senior minutes.Photograph: Ash Donelon/Manchester United/Getty Images7Hürzeler has options in defence once moreThings are suddenly looking much rosier for Fabian Hürzeler after Brighton finally snapped their winless run thanks toCarlos Baleba’s late winner against West Hamlast week. The Cameroon midfielder looks set to return to his usual position for the visit of Newcastle on Sunday having deputised in central defence in recent matches as Brighton welcome back Jan Paul van Hecke from the nasty head injury he sustained in thedefeat against Brentford. “Jan Paul is ready to start,” said Hürzeler. “After training he immediately came to me and said he wants to play.” Joël Veltman is also back while Adam Webster has an outside chance of making the match squad to ease Brighton’s defensive crisis. With Georginio Rutter, the club’s record signing, in contention to return against Wolves next week, Brighton will hope that they can build some momentum towards European qualification by recording another home victory.EABrighton vNewcastle United, Sunday 2pm8Potter already under West Ham spotlightGraham Potter looked as if he had reached the end of his tether after West Ham’s collapse against Brighton. He refused to talk about the positives, focusing instead on the weaknesses that let his side go from 2-1 up with seven minutes left to 3-2 down by full time. It was a manager who had clearly made up his mind on some of his players. A clearout is on the way: West Ham have to reorganise after a dreadful campaign. But Potter is also under the spotlight. He has taken 13 points since replacing Julen Lopetegui in January and is yet to put on a memorable performance in a home game. West Ham have won twice at home under Potter and could do with a rousing display when Tottenham turn up at the London Stadium with what will presumably be their B team. A derby triumph would earn the former Chelsea manager some goodwill from a disgruntled fanbase.Jacob SteinbergWest Ham United vTottenham Hotspur, Sunday 2pm9Lavia will want impact against championsChelsea are more fluid when Roméo Lavia is fit. The Belgian is press-resistant, savvy on the ball and positionally disciplined. He is the kind of player who improves those around him and, assuming that he does not have yet another injury setback, is likely to keep his place when Chelsea host Liverpool. Enzo Maresca values Lavia highly and was delighted to have him available to start inlast weekend’s win over Everton. It meant moving Moisés Caicedo to right-back and having the Ecuadorian drift into midfield when Chelsea had possession. The ploy worked well and could continue againstthe champions. However, Liverpool may fancy their chances if Luis Díaz can expose Caicedo, who is not a natural defender.JSChelsea vLiverpool, Sunday 4.30pmView image in fullscreenEnzo Maresca (pictured) needs Roméo Lavia to be at his best on Sunday.Photograph: Dave Shopland/Shutterstock10Palace hopeful for double delightCrystal Palace’s players returned to training on Thursday having enjoyed a four-day break after their FA Cup semi-final exploits and Oliver Glasner will be looking for renewed focus as they prepare to faceNottingham Foreston Monday. Draws against Bournemouth and Arsenal in their last two Premier League matches mean they still have an outside chance of finishing in the top eight, which could be enough to secure a place in Europe next season even if they lose to Manchester City at Wembley.

Making its mark on the calendar with a grand, spectacular party in the Florida sunshine since theinaugural race in 2022, Miami is considered something of a showcase.The opening blast of the three meetings now held in the US is a shop window for the sport with three teams, Racing Bulls, Sauber and Ferrari boasting special liveries for the event this weekend. The flamingo pink of the RB is very much making a splash but the clunky corporate blue addition to the Scuderia’s scarlet has fallen very flat with fans.FIA president hints at climbdown amid F1 driver standoff over swearing finesRead moreNaysayers may have disliked Miami’s emphasis on being a show, of presenting a weekend of entertainment where the food and beverages (or F&B as it is bafflingly, for the uninitiated, referred to here) were as fundamental as the racing. Where the atmosphere went hand in hand with the competition. It was perhaps the first of the “event” races F1 wanted to promote and like it or not, it has succeeded with numbers around this race telling their own story.The atmosphere in the general admission – campus – area of the increasingly popular and affordable tickets away from the high-end hospitality which dominates all the media, is one of unadulterated enjoyment, shot through with the glorious absence of world-weary cynicism. There is an air of, whisper it, hedonism; not all racing must be accompanied by sombre beard-scratching from a grassy bank in the rain.View image in fullscreenThe Miami Grand Prix F1 paddock entrance is ready for this weekend’s race.Photograph: Kym Illman/Getty ImagesThis atmosphere is not least informed by the makeup of the audience. From information from sales, admittedly with the caveat that the data refers only to the purchaser rather than all the ticket holders, Miami is reaching demographics every sport eyes with lustful ambition.“We’ve got the high-end luxury buyer that we’ve really cultivated a relationship with and built their trust,” says Tyler Epp, the Miami GP president. “But at the same time, we’ve got some of our entry level motorsport fan data that’s telling us we’re also a motorsport event for the people who are intrigued and interested and just want to come and see the cars for the first time.”It is these new fans that have led a push for the new single-day tickets and the three-day campus tickets. It is also, most significantly, a young audience.“The base is growing most aggressively from what we’ve seen in the 20 and 30-year-old buyer,” Epp adds. “Our data does not tell us that this is an audience of 30 to 60-year-old white men, that’s not what we’re seeing now.“Certainly they’re here but it’s a much more eclectic diverse group than that and part of that’s partially because we’re in Miami, which is such a wonderfully diverse market.”View image in fullscreenMcLaren’s Lando Norris is thrown in the air by his team after winning last year in Miami.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersTheir data is corroborated trackside in both age and ethnic diversity, while the gender differential is also notable, with the race easing toward what might be a 50-50 split in forthcoming years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It skews younger.”These are the demographics the sport needs to build on the success it has enjoyed in the US with Drive to Survive and, for all that the sound and fury of Las Vegas might have appeared to have outshone Miami of late, it is undeniable that the race at the Hard Rock Stadium is pulling in the numbers.Last year when McLaren’sLando Norris won his first F1 racehere it drew record viewing figures for the US of 3.1 million and Miami now holds the top three live US TV audiences in F1 history. While the season as a whole was pulling in an average of 1.11 million per race. Which, while still small in comparison to NFL and NBA, are considered strong numbers as the sport builds its presence.Epp is in good position to judge how the sport fares in comparative terms. He has worked both trackside and team side in Nascar, IndyCar and sports cars before moving into baseball for four and a half years and then putting in almost nine years with the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL; he is convinced the future remains bright.“We can be very bullish aboutFormula Onein the United States,” he said. “I view it as solidified, here to stay and looking at continuous growth, not necessarily ebbs and flows. I think the United States sports ecosystem in general ebbs and flows a bit with competitiveness and competition in particular markets but as a whole we feel really, really good about the state of Formula One.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A tense opening to the match was filled with mistakes and a missed routine black by Williams in the eighth frame enabled Trump to establish a healthy overnight advantage.The world No 1, seeking his second world title, produced comfortably his worst session of the tournament so far but he finished strongly, even if at times he rode his luck against his 50-year-old opponent.Ronnie O’Sullivan and Judd Trump roar into World Snooker semi-finalsRead moreThe edgy tone for the evening was set in a eventful opener that was ultimately won by Williams’ break of 73, but he needed a fortuitous red when escaping a snooker to put an end to Trump’s fightback.The caginess continued into a second frame lasting 39 minutes in which Williams paid the price for an aggressive approach that resulted in an important missed blue. Trump also took the third after succeeding with a three-ball plant and punishing errors by Williams, although the favourite’s play lacked conviction.When the interval arrived Williams, three times a champion at the Crucible, had drawn level at 2-2 after producing a break of 116 and the rollercoaster play continued with mistakes made time and again as the score moved to 3-3.There was no let-up in the tension with neither player able to seize control of the session and in the seventh frame Trump received a good slice of luck as, having been presented with the trickiest of snookers, he fluked a red into the bottom right pocket on the third attempt.Trump took a hard-fought frame that both had ample chances to win and when Williams missed an easy black in the eighth, the Englishman pounced to compile a break of 109 that propelled him into a two-frame lead.O’Sullivanand first-time semi-finalistZhaoshared the spoils in a gripping opening session that ended 4-4. O’Sullivan’s pedigree and experience on the big stage did not deter Zhao, who took a 2-0 lead and then finished impressively with a break of 86 – the highest of the match to date – to leave things all square after the initial leg of their best-of-33 frames contest.View image in fullscreenRonnie O’Sullivan shakes hands with Zhao Xintong before the first frame of their semi-final. They ended the session level at 4-4.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAWith moments to go in the afternoon’s play, Zhao broke a corner runner with a powerful shot to leave balls rolling around the carpet as he applied the finishing touches.Earlier O’Sullivan, who considered his13-9 win over Si Jiahuiin the quarter-finals a let-off, won three frames in succession and at one stage stopped his opponent registering a point for almost 34 minutes. Zhao showed no sign of nerves on his first appearance at the theatre’s one-table setup, settling quickly into his work as he picked up the first two frames with minimal fuss.O’Sullivan potted the white off the initial break and was restricted to a couple of reds as the Chinese player put together a decisive 60 to take first blood. It was a similar story in the next, O’Sullivan opening the door with a missed black and Zhao cashing in with a 62 break.The Rocket came to life at 2-0, getting into the zone with a breezy 64. By the time the mid-session interval had arrived he had wrested back the momentum, conjuring a fluid 73 to even the scores before jamming a black in the jaws with a century for the taking.O’Sullivan’s roll continued after the restart as he got the better of a safety exchange, then sealed the fifth, leaving Zhao over half an hour and two frames without scoring a point. When he snapped his barren streak he did enough to draw level at 3-3.Both players saved their best for last as they warmed to an engaging battle, O’Sullivan regaining the upper hand with a break of 82 before Zhao shot back with 86.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipRonnie O'SullivanJudd TrumpSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

Van Gerwen – still chasing a first overall nightly win this year – made a strong start, breaking Littler in the opening leg and then opening up a 3-1 lead.However Littler,the defending Premier League champion, then capitalised on some misplaced darts from the Dutchman to break back before moving 4-3 in front after more heavy scoring.Van Gerwen had the throw in the next leg, but Littler was again first down to a finish only to miss tops. After Van Gerwen failed to take out double 10, Littler nailed 40 at the second time of asking to wrap up a fifth win on the back of a 102.5 match average. Littler tops the table with 35 points, nine clear of Luke Humphries, with Price third and Van Gerwen now up into the final playoff spot.“Once I got over the finish line in my first game against Stephen, I was confident,” Littler said after becoming the first player to win five Premier League nights in the same season. “I got away with it against Nathan [in the semi-final], but then [the final] was a cracking game.“I have enjoyed it right the way through, and I’ll certainly relax. Luke [Humphries] isn’t playing his best darts at the minute so I’m gradually building that point advantage over his so I am very confident I will finish top of the table.”In the semi-finals, Littler eventually got past Aspinall in a close contest, with the world champion having survived a match dart before taking out 46 on double 10 against the throw. Van Gerwen, a seven-time Premier League champion, hit five maximums in a solid 6-3 victory over Price, who had beaten the world No 1, Humphries, in the quarter-finals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The party has promised todecarbonise the electricity grid by 2030and cut household energy bills by £300 a year.Ministers are also preparing to offer government-funded loans and grants for the installation of solar panels on existing homes.The move is a sign that the government will press ahead with its net zero agenda afterStarmer rejected criticismsof climate policy from Blair.In a high-profile interventiondays before the local elections, Blair said there needed to be a radical reset of “irrational” net zero policies that were “doomed to fail”.Blair’s net zero intervention invites  scrutiny of his institute’s donorsRead moreThe formerLabourprime minister argued that the public was being asked to make “financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle” that would have “minimal” effect on global emissions. He said the drive to phase out fossil fuels in the short term was “doomed to fail” because their production and demand were rising.His remarks angered government figures andtriggered a response from senior No 10 officials, who called the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI) and urged it to address the fallout. The TBI issued a clarifying statement on Wednesday morning saying it believed the government’s net zero policy was “the right one”.Blair’s remarks were interpreted as an attack on Starmer’s policy agendaafter the prime minister said last weekthat tackling the climate crisis and bolstering energy security were “in the DNA of my government”.Unite, the UK’s second biggest union, has echoed Blair’s criticism of climate policies. Its general secretary, Sharon Graham, said workers should not be thrown “on the scrapheap” in the pursuit of net zero.Speaking to Times Radio on Thursday, Graham pointed to thedevelopments at Grangemouth oil refineryand said: “The problem is that the jobs part of this is not being discussed.” The refinery stopped processing crude oil this week.Asked whether she agreed with Blair’s comments this week, Graham said: “Workers want net zero, my members have no problem with net zero. The problem that we’ve got is that there is no investment currently about how we get to that and also secure jobs.“There hasn’t been one single thing done so far that I can see in terms of investments on wind manufacture, in terms of investments into areas like sustainable air fuel … all of those things have not happened, and you cannot just plough on regardless and throw all of these workers on the scrapheap.”Campaigners have welcomed the news that the government is going to mandate solar panels on new homes.Lily-Rose Ellis, Greenpeace UK’s climate campaigner, said: “For too long we’ve wasted the free energy that falls on the roofs of houses every single day. Now, people living in new-build homes will save hundreds of pounds every year on their energy bills, thanks to this commonsense decision from the government.”A government spokesperson said: “We have always been clear that we want solar panels on as many new homes as possible because they are a vital technology to help cut bills for families, boost our national energy security and help deliver net zero.“Through theFuture Homes Standardwe plan to maximise the installation of solar panels on new homes as part of our ambition to ensure all new homes are energy efficient, and will set out final plans in due course.”Explore more on these topicsSolar powerKeir StarmerLabourEnergy billsConstruction industryRenewable energyEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

The granularity of the data allowed researchers to track the rate of change in 27 sq km (10 sq miles) segments across North America, showing dramatic declines in areas where less than two decades ago bird species had thrived.View image in fullscreenWilliamson’s sapsucker is threatened in more than half of the states and provinces where it breeds, according to the report.Photograph: Blair Dudeck/Cornell Lab of Ornithology/Macaulay Library“We’ve known for several years that a lot of bird species in North America have been declining. With this study, we were aiming to understand in much finer spatial resolution where birds were declining and where they might be increasing. Rather than having a range-wide trend to see if a species is going up or down, we want to know where it is going up and down,” said Alison Johnston, director of the Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling, who led the study.“The main ecological finding is that the locations where these species were thriving in the past, where the environments were really well suited to birds, are now the places where they are suffering the most,” she said.The researchers said further studies were needed to explain the reasons behind the changes, many of which were dramatic, with populations falling by more than 10% a year in some areas. Global heating and habitat change were put forward as the main theories behind the shifts, but Johnston said they ultimately did not know.A graphic showing the decline of North American bird species“The way I interpret this result is that it’s indicative of major changes in our world,” she said. “The fact that where birds used to have strongholds, where there used to be a lot of resources, where the environments were really suitable, are now the places where they are declining most, that suggests to me that we are just seeing fundamental changes to the environments around us. The birds are like the canary in the coalmine,” she said.The research adds to arecent series of studiesthat have documented severe declines of birds in nature reserves and protected areas.In the most untouched, pristine parts of the Amazon, birds are dying. Scientists may finally know whyRead moreDespite the worrying overall picture, the researchers found pockets of stability in bird populations in their analysis, such as the Appalachians and western mountains. In addition, 97% of all bird species had some pockets where their populations were increasing.The team at Princeton University has previously developed methods for reliably converting citizen science observations in apps such as eBird into data that can be used to monitor population changes in a single species. The study authors only included results that had passed strict reliability checks.Prof Amanda Rodewald from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, a co-author on the study, said the methods would allow conservationists to target their efforts.“It is this kind of small-scale information across broad geographies that has been lacking and it’s exactly what we need to make smart conservation decisions,” she said. “These data products give us a new lens to detect and diagnose population declines and to respond to them in a way that’s strategic, precise and flexible. That’s a gamechanger for conservation.”Ian Burfield, a global science coordinator with BirdLife, who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research and said it highlighted areas for further investigation.“North American birds are one of very few taxonomic groups and regions where such data exist to facilitate this approach. This emphasises the vital need for more field data collection, both through formal monitoring schemes and citizen science efforts, in many other parts of the world, especially in the biodiversity-rich tropics,” he said.Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsBirdsThe age of extinctionConservationAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

The total is derived from research byColumbia Law School,Harvard Law Schooland administration announcements.While many of these initial moves are far from complete and face severe legal challenges, or years of further rule-making, the pace of the rollbacks is already set to outstrip Trump’s entire first presidency, which saw about 110 environmental rulesscaled back or revoked.Trump’s first 100 days supercharged a global ‘freefall of rights’, says AmnestyRead more“What we’ve seen in this first 100 days is unprecedented – the deregulatory ambition of this administration is mind-blowing,” said Michael Burger, an expert in climate law at Columbia University.“They are doing things faster and with less process than last time, often disregarding the law. The intent is to shock, overwhelm and to overcome resistance through sheer force of numbers.”Through executive orders, agency memos and other policy moves, the Trump administration has deleted a swath of Joe Biden-era green policies, frozen climate spending,removed the US from the Paris climate accordsand set about rewriting pollution standards for cars, trucks and power plants.Sprawling tracts of land, including in the Arctic, have been earmarked for new oil and gas drilling, commercial fishing will beusheredinto ocean sanctuaries and half of the US’s vast expanse of national forestscan now be cut down for timber. Laws to prevent harm to endangered species are set to bedrastically pared back, while protected national monuments are on course to be shrunk.Trump’s actions have often explicitly favored a fossil fuel industry thatdonated heavilyto his presidential campaign. A start has been made in winding back rules on emissions of greenhouse gases and toxins such as mercury, as well as pipeline safety regulations.Afterdeclaringan “energy emergency” that elides any mention of renewable energy, Trump has ordereda revival of the coal industry,exempteddozens of coal power plants from clean air rules and restarted gas exports while, conversely, blocking the approval of new solar projects and wind turbines, which he has called “ugly” and “disgusting”.Trump has said America needs to “drill, baby, drill” for as much oil and gas, which he calls “liquid gold”, as possible. His administration is urging the extraction of fossil fuels and other minerals from all corners of the US, radicallyspeeding up required permitsand even defying the international community byopening upthe Pacific Ocean’s seabed to mining. “America is sitting on a treasure trove of energy, and under President Trump’s leadership, we’re unlocking it,” Doug Burgum, Trump’s interior secretary, has said.View image in fullscreenTrump speaks next to coal industry workers, on the day he signs energy-related executive orders at the White House in Washington DC on 8 April.Photograph: Nathan Howard/ReutersA White House spokesperson said that Trump was “unleashing American energy like never before – ending the Green New Scam, cutting harmful regulations, reopening offshore drilling, and approving the first LNG (liquified natural gas) project since Joe Biden’s disastrous ban last year”.He added: “We’re achieving historic results at record speed and we’re just getting started.”However, multiple analysts have pointed out that the US wasalready extracting record levels of oil and gas, producing more than it consumes and becoming a world-leading exporter of fossil fuels. The burning of these fuels is dangerously heating the planet to levels not seen during human civilization, unleashing disastrous heatwaves, floods, droughts and other worsening calamities.Climate activists have been left aghast at the opening moves from the latest Trump White House. “Never before has an American president been so hostile to science and so beholden to fossil fuel interests,” said Jason Rylander, legal director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s climate law institute. “The scope and scale of President Trump’s assaults on protections for people and the planet is simply breathtaking.“Every move Trump makes, from rolling back clean car standards to propping up dirty coal, takes the country and the world backwards to a time only he and his robber baron friends think was great.”The oil industry, though, has expressed delight. “Voters sent a clear message in support of affordable, reliable and secure American energy, and theTrump administrationis answering the call,” said Mike Sommers, chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, who praised Trump for following many of the lobby group’s own stated priorities.The haste of the administration’s environmental rollbacks has been coupled with an aggressive stance that experts say has skirted the law and is more extreme than Trump’s first term. The White House has ordered Pam Bondi, the US attorney general,to target cities and states that have implemented laws to tackle the climate crisis, while the Department of Transportation hassought to tear downNew York City’s congestion charge for cars entering lower Manhattan, even though its own lawyers haveexpressed doubtover the legality of such a move.Meanwhile, a sweeping Trump executive order hasdemandedat least 25 energy and environment laws expire next year unless they are explicitly renewed. The maximalist approach to these rollbacks, which defy norms over states’ independence and checks upon executive power, faces major legal hurdles even with a rightwing-dominated supreme court.View image in fullscreenThe CHS oil refinery in McPherson, Kansas.Photograph: Charlie Riedel/AP“Trump wants shock and awe but there are lawsuits being filed on every front that are winning,” Burger said. “Very few cases have got to the supreme court and we are seeing district and appellate courts shooting down the administration’s non-compliance with process.“What the administration is doing is unlawful and so the most likely scenario is that they will lose. The less likely, but possible, outcome is that the system falls apart and bends to the will of one man but let’s hope that doesn’t happen because then we will be in constitutional crisis mode.”The frantic pace of the rollbacks was exemplified ona single day on 12 March, when Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced 31 actionsto revise pollution standards thatwere on track to save 200,000 livesand even reconsider whether greenhouse gases pose a public health risk – a key finding that underpins US climate rules. Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, described the barrage as “driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion”.Trump, meanwhile, has focused his presidential power upon personal fixations such as the supposed inadequacy of paper straws, which he hasbanned from federal offices, and the flow of water from showers, which he considers too weak. “I like to take a nice shower to take care of my beautiful hair,” Trumpsaid at the signing of a recent executive orderto eliminate a federal water efficiency rule for toilets and showers. “I have to stand under the shower for 15 minutes until it gets wet. It comes out drip, drip, drip. It’s ridiculous.”The new shower head rule doesn’t include the standard public comment period, an example of how the administration is testing legal boundaries to speed up regulation-cutting. “Just saying ‘because I said so’ isn’t a good reason to not go through proper rule-making and it’s concerning that this is being applied to certain rules,” said Carrie Jenks, an environmental law expert at Harvard University.Jenks said uncertainty over the attempted rollbacks is compounded by thefiring of thousands of federal staffwho would normally be tasked with crafting a fresh regulatory framework. “The summer will be very busy as agencies try to put words to paper on how to meet these executive orders,” she said. “If you don’t have expertise in-house to do that, it becomes that much harder.”But the blitz upon the environment in the administration’s first 100 days may not relent during the rest of Trump’s term, Burger said, even if largely checked by the courts. “The pace of announcements may slow at some point but the pressure on our regulatory system and our democracy will not only continue but ramp up,” he said.“The result will be fewer environmental protections and more people suffering the public health consequences of more pollution. It’s that straightforward.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpClimate crisisFossil fuelsEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

The boy got into difficulty while swimming at Colwick country park in Nottingham on Wednesday evening and his body was found a few hours later,Nottinghamshirepolice said.Ch Insp David Mather said: “While work is now under way to understand how the boy came into difficulty, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight this case as a reminder of the devastating consequences of entering open water – regardless of whether people do so deliberately or inadvertently.“As in this tragic case, open water can have hidden dangers that can prove fatal and I would urge anyone who spends any time on or near open water to use this case as a devastating reminder of that – particularly during the recent warm weather we have been experiencing.”The Nottinghamshire fire and rescue service group manager, Tom Staples, said: “This tragic incident serves as a stark reminder of the hidden dangers of open water. We urge everyone to take care around lakes, rivers and other natural bodies of water.”The London fire brigade urged caution around open water swimming after a 32% increase in water-related incidents last month compared with the same period last year.Patrick Goulbourne, the London fire brigade assistant commissioner, said: “With the hot weather, we understand the temptation to cool off in rivers, lakes or other bodies of open water. But even when the sun is shining, water temperatures can be dangerously cold. Cold water shock can affect anyone, regardless of fitness or swimming ability.“It can lead to water inhalation and, in the worst cases, drowning. Be particularly careful near the water’s edge – it’s easy to slip or fall without warning. Always think twice before jumping into open water. Unlike designated swimming areas, these environments often lack lifeguards and have hidden hazards.”The Royal National Lifeboat Institution offered similar warnings.Fire services also warned the warm weather meant there was a “heightened” risk of grass and wildfires which could spread more easily during the dry spell. Temperatures are expected to ease by Friday, and Saturday will bring cooler conditions of 14C to 18C across the UK.Stephen Dixon, a Met Office spokesperson, said on Thursday afternoon: “Temperatures tomorrow will be slightly reduced from what we’ve seen today, possibly 26 or 27 degrees in the far south-east of England through the day tomorrow.”The RAC also cautioned drivers on the roads, with spokesperson Rod Dennis saying breakdowns were expected to “soar”.“We’re urging everyone travelling to ensure they have plenty of water for themselves and any passengers in case they get stuck in traffic or break down, as well as having sunscreen, hats or an umbrella with them to protect themselves from the sun,” Dennis said. “Drivers must avoid driving if the low coolant light appears on the dashboard as there’s a serious risk of engine overheating.”TheNHSalso reported that searches for hay fever advice had doubled from Monday to Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherSummerNottinghamshireNottinghamNHSHay fevernewsShareReuse this content"

Instead of women seeking an abortion in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy needing to take the first pill under medical supervision, they couldreceive both pills by post after a remote consultation. It wasmade permanent in 2022, with MPs voting 215 in favour to 188 against.However, inducing a miscarriage remains a crime, punishable with up to life in prison, and in recent years several women have found themselves in the dock for ending their own pregnancies outside the strict legal parameters of the 1967 act.According to freedom of information data from theCrown Prosecution Service, 13 people made a first appearance at a magistrates court charged with abortion-related offences in 2022; four people in 2019; and three in each of 2020 and 2021. The numbers include both men and women.Separate data, from about half of Britain’s police forces, showed at least 11 people were arrested in 2023 onsuspicion of child destructionor inducing a miscarriage, including a 31-year-old woman in north Wales “reported to have taken illicit substances to initiate an abortion”.Until 2022, it is believed that only three women had been convicted of having an illegal abortion in the 150 years since the introduction of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, under which illegal abortions are most commonly prosecuted.In the last parliament, MPs had put forward proposals to change the law under the criminal justice bill, with Creasy and a fellow Labour MP, Diana Johnson, proposing different changes to the law. However, the plans, along with the legislation, fell by the wayside with last summer’s general election.Johnson, now a Home Office minister, can no longer table amendments to government legislation. Antoniazzi’s amendment is believed to be similar in scope to the one put forward by Johnson in the last parliament.It is the second so-called vote of conscience in quick succession, with assisted dying legislation expected to come before the Commons before any abortion vote.In a referendum in 2018,Ireland made abortion legalon request up to 12 weeks, and later if the foetus would be likely to die before or shortly after birth or if there was a risk of death or serious harm to a pregnant woman.Scottish ministers accused of failing women who cannot get later abortionsRead moreIn 2019, Northern Ireland’s abortion laws were also modernised, allowed up to 12 weeks – and later under limited circumstances.However, in the US, change has gone in the opposite direction. In June 2022, the supreme court ruled that there wasno constitutional right to abortion, with the laws now decided at state level. About 22 million women of reproductive age have had access restricted, with abortion banned in more than a dozen states.Whether either of the amendments are selected for debate and put to a vote will be a matter for the speaker. But with broad cross-party support for a change in the law, it is likely there will be a vote on the issue.“In the last five years, around 100 women have been investigated by police for a ‘crime’ that does not even apply in two nations of the United Kingdom,” Antoniazzi told the Guardian.“The damage this outdated law is inflicting upon women affected is immeasurable. I feel a moral imperative to act. I am leading a cross-party group of parliamentarians and have been working with the sector on the reform we desperately need to put a stop to this. I will be laying an amendment in that vein to the crime and policing bill in the coming weeks.”Heidi Stewart, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), said: “BPAS, alongside a coalition of royal colleges, medical bodies and women’s rights groups, are calling on MPs to reform our archaic abortion law and end the prosecution of women accused of ending their own pregnancies. We fully supported the amendment tabled by Diana Johnson MP to the criminal justice bill in 2024 and we hope that this parliament will take these proposals forward as a matter of urgency.”Creasy’s amendment seeks to write a human right to access abortion into law. “Other countries have enshrined a human right to access abortion – doing that here and writing this right into law for the first time ever could help prevent any rollback in rights and provide a future for ensuring everyone can access a safe and legal abortion if they choose to do so,” she said.Explore more on these topicsAbortionWomenHealthStella CreasyCrown Prosecution ServicenewsShareReuse this content"

The aim is to streamline regulations for developers so they can speed up their projects and the Labour government can meet its target for delivering 1.5m new homes by the end of this parliament in 2029.The poorest rural communities, who oftenlive in areasbadly servedby public transport, may lose their access to green space under this bill, campaigners have said.Ali Plummer, director of policy and advocacy atWildlifeand Countryside Link, said: “Leaving it on a wing and a prayer that loss of nature locally won’t be offset into potentially another county does not give the certainty and safeguards that local people and the local environment need.“A third of communities around the country already have little or no access to nature locally, contributing to the likelihood of poorer mental and physical health.”Parks in poorer parts of England areless likely to be protectedagainst being built on than those in more affluent areas, and2.8 million peoplein the UK live more than a 10-minute walk from a public park, garden or playing field.Defra sources said ideally lost nature and green space would be as close as possible to where it used to be, but this would not always be feasible and there was no provision in the bill to ensure it would be recreated nearby.Nature experts havesaid the billis “one-sided” and could allow developers to ignore environmental protections, as well as creating a“cash to trash nature”system. This is because it allows developers to pay into a nature restoration fund rather than ensuring they protect wildlife on the site they are building on. The Guardian alsorecently reportedthat thousands of playing fields could be lost to housing if the bill goes ahead unamended.Zack Polanski, deputy leader of the Green party, said: “We live in one of the most nature depleted countries in the world … It’s appalling that the government hasn’t thought through the consequences of destroying habitats as they’re so eager to please huge developers at all costs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Urgent changes to the planning bill are needed to guarantee developments avoid harm wherever possible, guarantee local nature loss is more than compensated for locally, and ensure that the nature restoration fund follows the science on what will work for nature and neighbourhoods.”Defra has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentPlanning policyWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood the retailer first realised it was being targeted earlier this week.Harrods said in a statement: “We recently experienced attempts to gain unauthorised access to some of our systems. Our seasoned IT security team immediately took proactive steps to keep systems safe and as a result we have restricted internet access at our sites today.”The retailer said it was not asking customers to take any action, indicating that it did not suspect data had been accessed. It added: “We will continue to provide updates as necessary.”The problems at Harrods, first reported by Sky News, emerged as M&S continues to battle problems caused by a cyber incident that has beenlinked to the hacking collective Scattered Spider.More than £650m has been wiped off the stock market value of the company as its website has been forced to stop orders for almost a week. There are also gaps on shelves in stores as the company’s automated stock systems are not working and its loyalty scheme and gift card payments have been disrupted.On Thursday it emerged that M&S has been forced topause hiring new workers.The company said it had pulled all online job postings from its website as its recruitment systems were on hold while tech experts deal with the consequences of a hack which has also forced M&S to close its online shop.A message on M&S’s jobs website said: “Sorry you can’t search or apply for roles right now, we’re working hard to be back online as soon as possible.”The company, which employs about 65,000 people in its stores and London head office, had no jobs listed anywhere across its UK business on Thursday despite having more than 200 job openings the previous week.A spokesperson said: “While we proactively manage the cyber incident, we are temporarily pausing some of our normal processes so we can continue to work hard on offering the best M&S for our customers and colleagues. Job adverts will be up again in due course.”The Co-op has also had toshut down some internal systemsand warned staff to keep cameras on during online conferencing after detecting an attempted hack. Stores and online business continue to operate as usual.Retailers are on high alert as many use the same systems as M&S and the Co-op, SAP, so potential hackers could try to use the same methods in many businesses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Metropolitan police confirmed on Wednesday that detectives from its cybercrime unit, assisted by colleagues from the National Crime Agency, were investigating the attack on M&S.Richard Horne, chief executive of the NCSC, said the cyber incidents should “act as a wake-up call to all organisations”. He urged businesses “to ensure they have appropriate measures in place to help prevent attacks and respond and recover effectively”.He added: “The NCSC continues to work closely with organisations that have reported incidents to us to fully understand the nature of these attacks and to provide expert advice to the wider sector based on the threat picture.”Retailers and their suppliers have faced a series of cyber-attacks in recent years including Morrisons,which was affected by an incident at its tech supplier, Blue Yonder, in the run-up to Christmas last year.In 2023 WH Smith washit by an attackin which company data was accessed illegally, including the personal details of current and former employees.

It then tracked who was financing these companies.When approached by the Guardian, some banks objected to the study’s methodology, questioning whether it was fair to attribute the entire emissions of a carbon bomb to a bank that had given finance to a company as a whole rather than to the specific project.But the researchers say that banks usually fund the company rather than specific fossil fuel development, and that this finance is critical in allowing the companies to push ahead with these destructive projects.The report found HSBC is financially supporting companies involved in the most carbon bomb projects: 104. It calculated that emissions caused by burning the extracted fossil fuel from these projects would add up to 392 gigatons – or 392bn metric tonnes – of carbon dioxide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We are taking pragmatic steps to meet our 2030 financed emissions targets, while helping the world meet its energy needs securely and affordably.”A spokesperson for NatWest said it had lent more than £93bn in climate and sustainable funding and financing since the start of 2021, against a target of £100bn by the end of this year. They added: “Whilst we recognise the importance of the entire energy industry in furthering the goals of decarbonisation and energy security, our lending to oil and gas represents less than 0.7% of our financing activity.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisCarbon bombsFossil fuelsEnergyBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

The ruling followed initial complaints from eight households living near Brown’s home inHampshirein October 2022.But despite being served with an abatement notice in December that year, Brown refused to make his chicken fly the coop. Instead, the bird continued until further complaints from 12 households in 2023. Brown was prosecuted and convictedin November 2024.Brown subsequently appealed against the conviction, but his case has been dismissed at Southampton crown court, with Brown sentenced to £200 in fines, legal costs of £3,651.95 – and, in what neighbours consider to be a particular feather in their cap, an £80 victim surcharge.A NFDC spokesperson said. “The diary evidence kept by local residents highlighted that the crowing regularly affected their sleep from as early as 5am each day.”Dan Poole, a councillor who is the portfolio holder for community, safety and wellbeing, said: “We are committed to protecting our residents from unacceptable levels of noise and supporting them when issues arise.“Everyone has the right to the peaceful enjoyment of their home, and when informal approaches fail, we will not hesitate to take legal action where necessary.”Explore more on these topicsHampshireEnglandAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

It can cause chronic pain, heavy periods, extreme tiredness and fertility problems.According to the World Health Organization, endometriosis affects about190 million women and girlsglobally. In the UK, approximately 1.5 million are estimated to have the condition.In final draft guidancepublishedon Thursday, theNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence(Nice) approved a daily tablet for adult patients of reproductive age who have had unsuccessful previous treatment for endometriosis.People with endometriosis more likely to experience early menopause, study findsRead moreLinzagolix, also known as Yselty, works by blocking the hormones that contribute to the symptoms of endometriosis. It is taken once a day alongside “add-back” low-dose hormonal therapy to help manage potential menopausal symptoms and bone loss.In clinical trials, linzagolix was shown to reduce painful periods and non-menstrual pelvic pain, compared with a placebo drug, and is already approved fortreating moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids.It is the second take-at-home pill for endometriosis to be made available on theNHS, after Nice approved relugolix combination therapy in March. It is estimated that more than 1,000 women a year will be eligible for the new treatment.Helen Knight, the director of medicines evaluation at Nice, said she was “pleased” to recommend linzagolix and that it offered “a convenient way for people with endometriosis to manage their condition and helps to ease pressure on NHS services”.Welcoming the announcement, the women’s health minister, Gillian Merron, said: “This could be a gamechanger for thousands of women battling endometriosis, which can be a debilitating and life-limiting condition.”Dr Sue Mann, the national clinical director in women’s health at NHS England, said: “This is welcome news for women with endometriosis who haven’t found relief from previous therapies or surgery – it’s another treatment option which will help women take control of their health and better manage the symptoms of this often painful and debilitating condition.”Emma Cox, the chief executive ofEndometriosisUK, said: “Everyone with endometriosis should be able to choose the most appropriate management and treatment for them. But there are far too few options due to historic lack of research into the disease.“We welcome the approval of linzagolix for NHS use in England, however as it results in ‘medical menopause’ it will be suitable for only some with endometriosis. And as with many hormonal medications, it is not suitable for those trying for a pregnancy. We urge more investment in research to provide those with this sometimes debilitating disease, more options to help them live their lives.”Explore more on these topicsEndometriosisNHSNational Institute for Health and Care ExcellenceHealthWomen's healthMenstruationEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

That date is 21 days afterthe US president announced an investigationinto the sector, seen as the first step before a tariff announcement.However, in a rambling, carrot-and-stick speech on Wednesday evening, he suggested that he would give companies such as Johnson & Johnson the time they needed to repatriate some manufacturing with new or expanded operations in the US before they would face a “tariff wall”.Trump’s comments at the meeting on Wednesday suggest that the pharma industry could be the latest to benefit from him pausing or diluting his tariffs in the face of huge opposition to the chaos they are causing the business world.He paused his “reciprocal” tariffs for 90 days after they prompted a sell-off in US government bonds, and on Tuesdayhe watered downhis automotive import restrictions, curbing some duties on foreign cars and parts. But he has repeatedly threatened to carry through with sectoral tariffs on pharma.At Wednesday’s “invest in America” televised meeting, designed to deflect from figures showing theUS economy shrankin the first three months of this year, Trump claimed that businesses had pledged up to $8tn (£6tn) investment in the US since he was elected last November in the hope of evading tariffs, with $171bn of that coming from pharma companies, including US companies in Ireland exporting to US patients.“Businesses here [represented at the White House meeting] understand that if you build your factory in the United States your tariff rate is zero, zero,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I couldn’t believe it. I thought it was a prank. It’s the first time anything like this has happened to me. It’s a horrible feeling.“Why have I been targeted? I’ve been asking myself that ever since the notification arrived. I will – and we will – ask that question publicly of anyone who has the authority and the duty to answer. An answer is owed … to everyone who has an interest in knowing who, in this country, has torn to shreds the clear boundary between security and surveillance, between legality and abuse.”Pellegrino, who has been critical of Meloni’s government on social media, contacted researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, which tracks digital surveillance of civil society actors and helps to identify the kinds of spyware used in such attacks. Cancellato, Casarini, Caccia, Ferrari and Yambo were allegedly targeted with the military-grade Paragon software.Citing a person familiar with the matter, the Guardianreported in Februarythat Paragon had terminated its client relationship with Italy.It is not yet clear when Pellegrino’s mobile phone was attacked and whether Paragon was used in his case. Like other spyware vendors, Paragon sells its cyberweapon to government clients who are supposed to use it to prevent crime. The company has said that under its terms of service, government clients are not permitted to target journalists or other members of civil society.A Paragon spokesperson said: “Paragon requires all users of our technology to adhere to terms and conditions that preclude the illicit targeting of journalists and other civil society leaders. While we are not able to discuss individual customers, we have a zero-tolerance policy for violations of our terms of service.”In March during a classified meeting with Copasir, the Italian parliamentary committee for national security, Alfredo Mantovano, a cabinet undersecretary, admitted his government had approved the use of Paragon to spy on members of a humanitarian NGO because they were allegedly deemed a possible threat to national security.Copasir is investigating whether the secret services breached the law in using Paragon Solutions to monitor activists and journalists, and is expecting to report on its findings soon.John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, said he believed the Italian government, a confirmed former Paragon user, was “in a good position” to know whether the spyware had been used to target Pellegrino because it would have kept logs of deployments.“The Paragon affair is not over for Italy, and now is a critical moment for clear and transparent official communication,” Railton said.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropeEspionagePress freedomnewsShareReuse this content"

The partnership between BoP and Ice, two agencies that have generally operated separately, means people accused of civil immigration violations are being imprisoned in harsh environments of federal penitentiaries run by prison guards.Several immigration detainees said they had been mistreated, neglected and denied due process – some unable to contact anyone for days on end during their abrupt transfers to prisons, then left in the dark about their ongoing deportation cases. Some detainees described shortages of food, clothes, toilet paper and other necessities. Others alleged they were forced to live in dirty, overcrowded cells and unable to access basic medical care and regular outdoor time.Mothers deported by Trump ‘denied’ chance to transfer custody of children, lawyer saysRead more“It’s pandemonium,” said one detainee about the frenzy when he and dozens of others were moved in February from an Ice detention center in Georgia into Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Atlanta, a BoP prison recentlyinvestigated by Congressfor its squalid conditions, violence and staff misconduct. “The place was filthy and disgusting. There was no communication. It was just chaos, and I had to deal with the mental state of not knowing what was happening and whether I’d be there for two months, three months, six months.”The man, accused of a minor civil immigration violation, ended up spending roughly a month in theAtlantafederal prison before being deported and requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation by immigration authorities.Ice’s expansion into the prison system comes asDonald Trump’s agenda of mass deportations has seen detainees shipped toGuantánamo Bayand anEl Salvador prisonwithout officials presenting evidence of crimes; severeovercrowdingin Ice detention, with the government aggressively seeking new locations to imprison people; and reports of arrested immigrantsdisappearedby thesystem.In addition to FCI Atlanta, Ice has sent immigration detainees to BoP facilities in Miami; Philadelphia; Berlin, New Hampshire; and Leavenworth, Kansas, according to BoP.The BoP system, which houses federal criminal defendants, has long been plagued by reports ofsystemic abuseby officers,preventable deathsandcrumbling infrastructureat facilities across the country. In recent years, former staffers at theBerlinandPhiladelphiaprisons were convicted of bribery and contraband. A Miami officer was charged withsexually abusingan incarcerated person. Atlanta staff were accused ofcovering up abusesand severe neglect. And Kansas staff allegedly have left residents without adequate food and water during lockdowns andforcedthem todefecatein bags.The influx of immigration detainees has exacerbated these crises, as guards working in an already strained system are now overseeing immigration detainees, pre-trial criminal defendants and people serving long-term prison sentences under the same roof.View image in fullscreen‘It’s pandemonium,’ said one detainee about his move to FCI Atlanta.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./Alamy‘Unlivable and inhumane’An associate BoP directortoldCongress in February that roughly 700 immigration detainees were in four of its prisons at that time, and Ice data shows that months later, hundreds continue to be in BoP custody.While horrificconditionshave also long beendocumentedat Ice detentioncenters, those facilities tend to offer more freedom of movement than prisons and have processes that are supposed to serve the specific needs of people with active immigration cases.In the BoP facilities, however, “access to counsel is almost impossible”, said John Gihon, a Florida-based attorney who has had multiple immigration clients moved to BoP-run Federal Detention Center (FDC) Miami. “I can’t schedule a phone call with my clients. There’s no mechanism.” One client told him more than 150 detainees had to share roughly four or five phones for all communications, and when a client does manage to call, it’s brief, loud and not a confidential legal meeting.Ice staff are not regularly present at FDC Miami, and as a result, some of Gihon’s clients haven’t received critical immigration paperwork or notice about court dates or why they were being held. One client, he said, was granted release, but because of the apparent lack of communication between BoP and Ice, he remained detained for several more days.The chaotic transfers were delaying people’s cases, Gihon argued: “It’s violating people’s rights and it’s a huge waste of money. It’s the opposite of Doge,” he said, referencing Trump’s so-called “department of government efficiency.”The arrival of immigration detainees has worsened the living conditions for others housed at FDC Miami, said one incarcerated woman. She requested anonymity due to concerns about staff retaliation. Two women’s units were packed into one area to make room for Ice detainees, she said, and they were all placed on lockdowns for a week. The women were given no recreation time, as male immigration detainees were placed in a nearby unit and the facility worked to keep them separate.North Carolina helps kids earn college degrees in high school. It’s a lifeline for immigrant familiesRead moreWith increasingly overcrowded housing, some women were now housed in areas with broken toilets and leaks, she said; her bed became soaked when it rained. “Everything was wet and the officer just said, that’s how it is,” she said.After Ice detainees moved in, the women in BoP custody started getting smaller portions of food and had reduced access to toilet paper, she said: “Everything is worse. There’s more scarcity.” The residents had already struggled with hunger, as they were sometimes given expired or moldy food, she said.During lockdowns, staff slide their food trays to them on the ground under their cells: “It’s as if we’re animals. This prison already wasn’t livable and now they’re adding more people into a place that’s so unsafe and inhumane.”She said she had struggled for a year to access healthcare at the facility and has never seen an eye doctor, dentist or psychiatrist. The medical challenges have gotten worse as the population has swelled, she said: “There are some good officials who are more humane and try to help us but they’re overwhelmed. When they call medical [staff] for help, they’re told it’s not an emergency, so we don’t have time.”Detainees ‘disappeared’In FCI Atlanta, another BoP prison housing people for Ice, staff failed to take at least one immigration detainee to their scheduled court hearing, according to Samantha Hamilton, a staff attorney with Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, a non-profit group that advocates for immigrants’ rights. She and her colleagues have visited several detainees at the facility.“It’s like there is no rhyme or reason to the chaos,” she said. The placements have caused wild inefficiencies, she said. For example, when detainees have to appear in court remotely through video conferencing, instead of giving them computer access at BoP, officials have driven them hours away to an Ice detention center to log on for their hearings. “I fear there are many others who have been prevented from going to their hearings. That’s a denial of due process.”Dozens of immigration detainees who were transferred to FCI Atlanta were abruptly sent back to an Ice detention center a week later, with the reasons behind the move unclear, according to Hamilton and a detainee who was part of the group.At FCI Atlanta, immigration detainees have been forced to sleep on dirty mattresses and were given clothes that were ripped and appeared to have bloodstains, while also forced to wear used underwear, said one detainee. Their outdoor time was limited to an enclosure that was partially open to fresh air, but where they could not see the sky, he said. Detainees who didn’t speak English or Spanish were left in the dark about their cases and everyone struggled to get basic information from Ice, the detainee said.Immigrants sent to FCI Berlin in New Hampshire have been widely unreachable, advocates and attorneys said. Attorney Stephen Roth had a client in Ice detention in Massachusetts who called him in March and said he was being moved. Roth didn’t think a transfer would happen, because he was in the middle of an active appeal, but the attorney drove to Ice headquarters in Massachusetts to inquire.“They told me he’s not being moved,” said Roth. “They lied to my face.” The client was transferred out of state to Berlin and it took more than a week for the attorney and the client’s wife to reach him. “I wasn’t given any notice they were moving him out of the jurisdiction. The government is doing everything they can to prevent access.”Annie Gonzalez, a volunteer with the Boston Immigration Justice Accompaniment Network, which supports detainees, said her group has almost entirely lost contact with detainees moved to Berlin. The group has also repeatedly been unable to put commissary money on the accounts of detainees now with BoP.“It’s really terrifying when people can’t reach their loved one, especially right now as people are sent off to prisons in foreign countries or disappeared completely,” she said.Spokespeople for Ice and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Donald Murphy, a BoP spokesperson, said in an email that the bureau “has entered an interagency agreement that allows Ice to place detainees in five BoP facilities” and would “continue to support our law enforcement partners to fulfill the administration’s policy objectives”. He declined to disclose how many Ice detainees were in BoP custody and did not respond to questions about conditions and claims of mistreatment.Spokespeople from FCI Atlanta, FDC Miami and FCI Berlin did not respond to the accounts from detainees and advocates.View image in fullscreenBarbed wire lines a recreation area at the Stewart detention center in Lumpkin, Georgia.Photograph: David Goldman/AP‘We will fight’Ice’s use of BoP facilities is one of many ways the Trump administration is pushing to rapidly increase its detention capacity. Officials have sought to detain immigrants atmilitary bases, expandcontractswith local jails andreopenshuttered facilities, said Stacy Suh, the program director at Detention Watch Network, an immigrants’ rights coalition.“TheTrump administrationis using every tool at its disposal to target as many people as possible for deportation in every area of public life,” they said. “The scale and speed at which they’re expanding detention is extremely concerning.”Ice is reportedlyinterestedin reopening FCI Dublin, a shuttered BoP prison in California, for immigration detainees. Dublin wasplagued by a major sexual abuse scandaland had problems withmold and asbestos.Judge re-ups demand that White House show efforts to retrieve Kilmar Ábrego García from El SalvadorRead more“We will fight it. It is not a safe facility … for detainees or employees,” said Mark DeSaulnier, a California Democratic congressman, in an interview. He said BoP officials had refused to share basic information with him about potential plans for the facility: “Their level of disrespect and disdain for members of Congress is pretty obvious … There is a very strong culture in the Bureau of Prisons of not adhering to their responsibilities by law.”Some BoP workers are also concerned about Dublin reopening. John Kostelnik, the western regional vice-president of the Council of Prison Locals, the union representing correctional officers, said BoP workers have been forced to do maintenance work at the closed prison, exposing them to asbestos and mold, without proper PPE.In 2018, Kostelnik witnessed the chaos when Trump’s first administration moved roughly 1,000detaineesinto the Victorville BoP prison in California. There were major disease outbreaks and staff struggled to address the needs of immigrant detainees he said: “We could not keep up with providing medical care. It was a nightmare.”Understaffing remains a systemwide problem, and as Trumpattacks union rights, BoP employees are afraid toraise the alarms about conditions, he said.“If you bring immigration detainees into a BoP facility and there are wrongdoings and they are not getting what they deserve, it’s going to stay behind those walls.

Worse, they hinder and alter brain development,” causing “a lasting alteration to their health and their intellectual capacities”.France to tighten mobile phone ban in middle schoolsRead moreCurrent recommendations inFranceare that children should not be exposed to screens before the age of three and have only “occasional use” between the ages of three and six in the presence of an adult.The societies suggest the ban on screens should apply at home and in schools.They wrote: “Neither the screen technology nor its content, including so-called ‘educational’ content, are adapted to a small developing brain.Childrenare not miniature adults: their needs are different needs.”They add that every day health professionals and infant school teachers “observe the damage caused by regular exposure to screens before they [children] enter elementary school: delayed language, attention deficit, memory problems and motor agitation”.The experts suggest regular exposure to screens – however brief – has also had a negative effect on children’s social and emotional development. They suggest the problem affects all social groups, but particularly disadvantaged households leading to greater “social inequalities”.Alternatives including “reading aloud, free play, board games or outdoor games, physical, creative and artistic activities”.The letter says: “It would occur to no one to let a child of under six cross the road on their own. Why then expose them to a screen when this compromises their health and their intellectual future?”Last year, a report commissioned by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, found that French three- to six-year-olds spent an average of 1 hour 47 minutes a day in front of a screen in 2014-15, the latest available research. Since then, however, only one of the commission’s recommendations, concerning the exposure of under-threes to screens, has been implemented.Former prime minister Gabriel Attal has gone further, proposing to ban children under 15 from social media, with an online “curfew” for 15- to 18-year-olds halting their access to social media at 10pm.Explore more on these topicsChildrenSmartphonesMobile phonesFranceHealthMental healthEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Around the world, people are speculating: who will the next pontiff be? But in Taiwan, a more common discussion has been: who are we sending to the inauguration?The former vice-president Chen Chien-jen recently returned from Vatican City, where he represented Taiwan atFrancis’s funeral. But the committed Catholic hopes he won’t be asked to repeat the journey to welcome in the successor. Instead, he is pushing for it to be Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te.“We prayed for the possibility for Dr Lai to attend the inauguration of the new pope,” he told the Guardian in Taipei.The reasonLai didn’t attend the funeralhasn’t been confirmed, but there are plenty of educated guesses going around, and they all involve Beijing. The Vatican is one of just 12 governments that recognise Taiwan as a country, and the only one in Europe. Serving presidents attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II and the first mass of Pope Francis. But in the years since, the geopolitics of Taiwan’s place in the world has become more difficult.China’s ruling Communist party claims Taiwan is a province and has vowed to annex it, militarily if need be. In the meantime it is using its considerable global influence to keep Taiwan’s government – which it labels “separatist” – away from the international stage, and has persuaded many of Taiwan’s allies to cut ties and recognise Beijing instead. Which is exactly what many observers think was going on with theVaticanfor the funeral.Conclave to elect new pope to start on 7 May, Vatican saysRead moreAfter the death of Francis was announced,Taiwanwas quick to offer condolences. Its deputy foreign minister, Wu Chih-chung, publicly said it was the island’s “most important aim” to have its president lead the funeral delegation. But just hours later Chen, who had met Francis six times before he died and was a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, was announced as “the best choice under the current circumstances” after discussions with the Vatican.Speculation swirled that the Vatican had refused Lai’s attendance – or at least requested he not be sent – under pressure fromChina. Taipei, Beijing and the Vatican would not comment.Beijing was relatively late in offering condolences, which came via a foreign affairs spokesperson answering a question at a press conference in which he also insisted Taiwan was an “inalienable part” of China. It also didn’t send anyone to the funeral, fuelling speculation that this was because the Vatican had refused to bar Taiwan’s delegation.“We knew [the funeral] would be a headache, we knew China would ask that Taiwan’s delegation not be allowed to come, and we knew the Vatican could not say no but also could not refuse Taiwan as a diplomatic partner and because there are Catholics in Taiwan,” said Michel Chambon, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore.Taiwan’s presence at these sort of events isn’t only about respecting an important moment for a close ally. It’s also a rare opportunity to mix with other world leaders at a time when Taiwan is seeking as much global support as it can to deter China’s aggression.Chen isn’t sure how many foreign leaders and dignitaries he spoke to at the funeral but it was many. “In the square I had the chance to meet, for example, President Biden of the US and also the special envoys from Japan, Thailand, South Korea, too many to mention. It was a good chance for us to chat with governmental officers of like-minded countries,” he told the Guardian. “With all of our friends we have the same mindset and we all treasure regional stability, security and prosperity,” Chen said. “And we hope we can maintain this Indo-Pacific’s freedom and openness.”From the Vatican’s side, Taiwan is an important partner of the church, even though it is home to just 0.02% of the world’s Catholics. “It’s a bridging church,” said Chen. Until about a decade ago, when cross-strait tensions made it too risky, Chinese priests and nuns would quietly travel to Taiwan’s seminaries and universities for theological training in their native tongue.Francis put greater focus on Chinese-speaking Catholics across Asia. His funeral sermon ended with a prayer in Mandarin – the only one delivered in an Asian language. There are an estimated 12 million Catholics in China and Francis oversaw significant progress in negotiations with Beijing to better protect their religious freedoms, signing agreements on the appointment of bishops.“We don’t know if the new pope will love China as Francis did,” said Thomas Tu, a Vatican diplomacy expert at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University. “But I think the Vatican wants to keep that legacy.”Whether that legacy comes at the expense of Taiwan’s diplomatic status is up for debate. Chen understands that it’s complicated: “The Holy See has to get assurances of religious freedom [from Beijing] to protect all the sheep in China, as a big shepherd. It’s a big pressure.”Chambon said Francis had successfully balanced both relationships, strengthening ties with China without diminishing anything with Taiwan. “The Holy See does not want to abandon any group of Catholics in the world, including Taiwan,” he said. “It’s been able to manoeuvre and resist pressure from Beijing to cut official ties.”Taiwan’s government says it is still making plans about its delegation and has not said whether or not it hopes it is led by Lai. Chambon thinks the Vatican probably hopes Chen returns instead.He added: “The Vatican doesn’t want to refuse Taiwan completely … I think they would like to see something like the funeral – we want a delegation but we don’t want provocation towards Beijing.”Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsThe papacyPapal conclaveTaiwanVaticanChinaPope FrancisCatholicismnewsShareReuse this content"

A prerecorded rehearsal of a torch-lighting ceremony was screened instead of the planned event.The Times of Israel newspaperdescribed“a surreal, fraught evening in which Israel is starting to mark its 77th Independence Day while firefighters battle some of the worst wildfires in its history”.In a speech at one ceremony, Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, said the wildfires were “part of a climate crisis that we must not ignore”.View image in fullscreenA man walks through a burnt garden shop in Mesilat Zion in central Israel.Photograph: John Wessels/AFP/Getty ImagesThe anniversary celebrations had already caused controversy after government ministers were heckled at some events for failing to bring back all the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and on Tuesdayrightwing activists attackeda synagogue where a joint Arab-Israeli memorial event was being screened.Political tensions are high after a turbulent few weeks with waves of protests anda public clashbetween Netanyahu and the head of the Shin Bet internal security service. Herzog called for an end to “polarisation” in Israel.Israel’s military said troops were helping in Jerusalem and other central districts. “Overnight dozens of engineering vehicles started operating throughout the country to form lines to prevent the fire from spreading into other trees,” it said in a statement. “The IAF [air force] continues assisting in the effort to extinguish the fires.”Israel’s firefighting service said 163 ground crews and 12 aircraft were working to contain the flames. Military planes have dropped hundreds of tonnes of retardant in an effort to stop the spread of the blaze.Magen David Adom, Israel’s medical rescue service, said it treated 23 people on Wednesday, mostly for smoke inhalation and burns. Seventeen firefighters were injured, according to the public broadcaster Kan.Witnesses described “walls of flame” surging across woodland on the slopes of the foothills west of Jerusalem, though the situation appeared to have improved on Thursday as winds dropped and a light rain fell.View image in fullscreenA firefighting aircraft douses a fire in the Latrun area in central Israel.Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPAThere has been some criticism of the response of emergency services. Speaking from near the city of Modiin as fires burned on a nearby hillside, Yuval Aharoni, 40, said: “It’s just very sad because we knew the weather, we kind of knew that would happen, and still we feel like they weren’t ready enough with the big planes that can drop large amounts of water.”Late on Wednesday, the foreign ministry said firefighting aircraft were expected to arrive from Croatia, France, Italy, Romania and Spain to join the operation.The fire and rescue service’s Jerusalem district commander, Shmulik Friedman, described “a very large wildfire, maybe the largest there has ever been in this country” and said the effort to contain the blaze would continue for “a very long time”.Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, hinted that the fires may have been deliberately started, though authorities have not presented any evidence to support such claims.AFP contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsraelWildfiresMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Only with solving the human dimension can we find a path to sustainable peace,” she said.On Tuesday, the Guardian and its reporting partners launched the Viktoriia project, an investigation into thedeath of the Ukrainian journalist Viktoriia Roshchynain Russian custody, as well as a report on the systemic torture and mistreatment of thousands of civilian detainees seized by Russian occupying forces.The European Commission on Wednesday condemned the killing, with foreign affairs spokesperson Anitta Hipper saying it showed life under occupation “remains a constant threat to Ukrainians”.Jan Braathu, the media freedom representative for the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, said he was “appalled” by the evidence emerging in Roshchyna’s case. A preliminary autopsy suggests she was tortured before she died, and her brain and other body parts were removed in order to conceal the cause of death.In astatement, Braathu said her treatment was a breach of international law, including the Geneva conventions and the UN conventions against torture – to which Russia is a signatory. “I condemn these grave abuses by the Russian Federation,” he said.The Ukrainian parliament’s commissioner for human rights, Dmytro Lubinets, said that as of April 2024 the number of people registered as having disappeared stood at 16,000, but that calculating an exact total was impossible.Those detained are often socially and politically active people Russia fears may resist occupation, as well as former military personnel or Ukrainian government officials. Some are simply in the wrong place in the wrong time and are pulled into a nightmare of torture and mistreatment.View image in fullscreenOleksandra Matviichuk, of the Centre for Civil Liberties, signing the guest book at the Nobel Institute in Oslo, Norway, in 2022.Photograph: NTB/ReutersPrisoners are often held incommunicado, without charge or access to legal support, and are not allowed to send and receive letters. Their fate is one of the lesser-reported aspects of Russia’s war onUkraine.The Guardian and its reporting partners, in a collaboration led by the French newsroomForbidden Stories, have gathered testimonies from former detainees at one of the most notorious holding facilities, Taganrog pre-trial detention facility No 2. They show civilians and prisoners of war are being subjected to severe food rationing, with little or no medical care, and that torture including electric shocks, physical and sexual violence and waterboarding is meted out by Russian guards.“When you hear about the conditions and the torture, there is a clear understanding that some of these people have no chance to be alive by the time the political process has ended,” said Matviichuk.Trump met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the sidelines of the pope’s funeral in Rome on Saturday, while his envoy, Steve Witkoff, met Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Friday. Trump claimed Russia and Ukraine were “very close to a deal” and has said he wants the two sides to meet soon.A draft of the supposed US peace plan,published last week by Reuters, covers territory, economic issues and security guarantees, but says nothing about prisoners.Karyna Malakhova-Diachuk,the co-founder of an organisation that brings together the families of civilian detainees, said she was hoping that the freeing of these prisoners would come before a deal on territories and other elements that the US wants to nail down on the way to a lasting peace.“First, there should be an agreement to bring all the people home, and only after that they should start other negotiations. Otherwise everything will stay frozen on this issue,” she said.View image in fullscreenA reconstruction of torture equipment in Taganrog prison.Illustration: Jarrett Ley/the Viktoriia projectDuring the first year of the war, civilians were frequently included in prisoner exchanges between Russia and Ukraine but it is now rare. Malakhova-Diachuk’s organisation comprises relatives of 380 detainees, and she said there had been no releases for more than a year of those linked to the group.The emotional toll on relatives was hard to express, she said, adding that the horror stories to emerge from Russian prisons made the waiting and uncertainty all the more painful. “You see the PoWs return and they tell these horrific stories of torture and injuries and the things that happen there and there is just nothing you can do.”A minorityhave been charged and given long prison terms for “terrorism” and other crimes, which could present further obstacles if Russia claims they are convicted criminals and so cannot be part of a deal.Mykhailo Podolyak, a Zelenskyy aide, said that civilian detainees, along with prisoners of war and the Ukrainian children forcibly taken to Russia, would be a key part of Ukraine’s demands in any peace deal. He added that even those who had been given prison terms in Russia should be freed as part of a peace deal.“These courts have no legal weight for us. We don’t consider these people to be convicted of anything. And we will do everything for our citizens to be returned to Ukraine,” he said.The human dimension has been absent from most of the western countries’ public messaging around the push for a peace deal, with the focus instead on territories and security guarantees.“We’ve heard nothing at all from Trump. We are knocking on different doors of different governments,” said Oleg Orlov, head of the Russian human rights organisation Memorial, which was also awarded the 2022 Nobel peace prize.Memorial and the Centre for Civil Liberties are two of about 50 Ukrainian and Russian organisations that have createda campaign called People First, which calls for the freeing of all prisoners of war, civilian detainees and Ukrainian children taken to Russia, at an early stage in the peace process.While the all-for-all exchange of prisoners of war is a normal part of the end of military hostilities, the mechanism to free civilians is less clear. “Russia should let them go without any conditions, but it will be very hard to achieve this,” said Orlov.He said one solution could be for Ukraine to free citizens it had arrested on charges of collaboration with Russian occupying forces and offer them passage to Russia. “You can’t swap civilians, but there could be a possibility of a simultaneous freeing of these people with detained Ukrainian civilians,” he said.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsThe Viktoriia projectRussiaUkraineHuman rightsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The move was designed to give a reprieve to US carmakers, after the domestic industry warned his strategy would increase costs for American manufacturers by tens of billions of dollars.Carmakers subject to a 25% tariff on imports will now not be subject to other levies Trump has imposed, such as those on steel and aluminium. US carmakers will also be allowed to apply for temporary tariff relief on a proportion of the costs imposed for imported parts, although the relief will be phased out over the next two years.Mary Barra, GM’s chief executive, said in a letter to shareholders that the company now expected to make a pre-tax profit of between $10bn and $12bn this year, including a tariff exposure of between $4bn and $5bn. This compares with previous profit guidance of $13.7bn to $15.7bn.Despite the significant hit to profitability from tariffs, Barra’s letter stated the company was “grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry”.“We look forward to maintaining our strong dialogue with the administration on trade and other policies as they continue to evolve,” Barra wrote.Carmakers have been struggling to keep up with Trump’s frequent changes to his plans for sweeping levies, which have also forced Stellantis – the owner of brands including Jeep, Chrysler and Fiat – and German manufacturer Mercedes towithdraw their financial guidancefor the year as a result of the uncertainty around tariff policy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under free trade agreements, which have been in place for decades, parts and cars can crisscross that border many times.Companies across a range of sectors have been struggling to keep up with changes to tariff policy announced by the Trump White House, which threaten to upend global supply chains and disrupt markets.Uncertainty and abrupt policy U-turns also appear to be weighing on US consumers, while other hospitality businesses includingStarbucks, Domino’s Pizza and Chipotle Mexican Grill have warned that Americans are cutting back on dining out.It came as official figures showed that theUS economy shrank by 0.3%between January and March, down from growth of 2.4% in the final quarter of 2024 and the first contraction since the start of 2022.US consumer sentiment plungedby 32% to its lowest level since the 1990 recession between January and April, after the announcement of Trump’s tariffs sparked fears of a global trade war. The index of consumer sentiment score is based on a monthly survey asking Americans about their financial outlook.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsMcDonald'sGeneral MotorsFood & drink industryDonald TrumpTariffsAutomotive industrynewsShareReuse this content"

All appeared to be conscious as they were taken to hospital.Police arrested Yuki Yazawa, 28, an unemployed man from Higashimurayama city in Tokyo, at the scene. It is not clear why he was in Osaka.“I was just sick of everything so I decided to drive my car into the elementary school students to kill them,” Yazawa told police, according to NHK.Teachers from the primary school are reported to have pulled the suspect out of the car, where he had remained after driving into the children.A mother in her 20s who had come to pick up her son, and who saw the attack, told NHK: “The car was being driven erratically, and it seems that it continued to move forward even after it had hit the children.“My son was very shocked and has been crying the whole time. He only just started elementary school last month, and then something like this happened. It’s scary. I saw the man who had been driving the car. He was very quiet and appeared to be in a daze.”Another witness told NHK that the car reversed back into the children after crashing into them.An elementary school pupil told another news outlet, MBS News, that the man in the car had been “driving unsteadily”.“I was walking along the side of the road and the car and suddenly it almost drove into us. The second and third graders in front of me were injured and were bleeding from their heads after being trapped between the car and the wall,” the pupil said.A white SUV that appeared to be the one used by the suspect was being examined by police.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

A study published this year found gender-affirming care is rare among US youth, with fewer thanone in 1,000children receiving hormones or puberty blockers.RFK Jr and health agency falsely claim MMR vaccine includes ‘aborted fetus debris’Read moreThe review is in response to one of the first executive orders signed by the president, titled: “Protecting children from chemical and surgical mutilation,” which called for a review of evidence by the health department within 90 days.“Evidence for harms associated with pediatric medical transition in systematic reviews is … sparse, but this finding should be interpreted with caution,”the reportstates.“Inadequate harm detection in pediatric gender medicine may reflect the relatively short period of time since the widespread adoption of the medical/surgical treatment model; the failure of existing studies to systematically track and report harms; and publication bias.”The report did not address medical treatment for transgender adults, nor did it contain clinical guidance or policy recommendations. Although the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, pledged “radical transparency” for the health department, authors of the report were not disclosed.The report comes from an administration hostile to the LGBTQ+ community and transgender people in particular. In his first days in office, Trump issued executive orders establishing the official US government position as acknowledgingtwo gendersand rescinding multiple orders that protected transgender individuals in arenas of society from education andhealthcaretomilitaryservice.Additionally, the administration has directed the NIH to cancel nearly every project studying transgender people and instead focus on“regret” after transition. The administration has gone so far as to cancel even relatively small contracts with the federal government, for example defunding theLGBTQ+ suicide hotline.The report’s recommendation supports the position of more than half of right-leaning US states that have banned such treatments.Nearly 40%of all transgender youth live in such states, according to the Human Rights Campaign, including many of the same that havebanned or restricted abortion.“A report suggesting that someone’s authentic self and who they are can be ‘changed’ is discredited junk science,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO of Glaad, a leading LGBTQ+ advocacy group. “This so-called guidance is grossly misleading and in direct contrast to the recommendation of every leading health authority in the world.”Ellis continued: “This report amounts to nothing more than forcing the same discredited idea of conversion therapy that ripped families apart and harmed gay, lesbian, and bisexual young people for decades.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationLGBTQ+ rightsGenderUS politicsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

When did you first feel that you had“made it”?LondonLuvverI wasn’t expecting to do music for a job. I was into social activism in college, and I just had music as a hobby. My boyfriend managed a bunch of blues artists and I asked if I could open for some of them – just to have fun and hang out with my heroes. Unbeknown to me, there really weren’t any women playing blues guitar and doing the mix of songs [I was], and I immediately got more offers of gigs and even a record company offer within about a year. That first gig I got under my own name, when I was 19, was a total surprise: that’s when I felt I had made it.View image in fullscreenJohn Raitt and Doris Day in The Pajama Game.Photograph: The Kobal CollectionHow was it growing up with a father [John Raitt] who was such a big Broadway star?Abbeyorchards7He had hits in the 1940s with Carousel, and in the 50s with The Pajama Game. By the time I was 10 or 11, he was on the road touring in the summer – he loved taking Broadway shows out to the countryside. That influenced me a lot later when I decided to veer off from college and go into music: his love of travelling, of every night being opening night, and putting everything he had into every performance. And he was on tour basically until his mid-80s, so I think that had a tremendous influence on me: like, we can’t believe we get paid, and this is our job.Guitar lesson, please!What are the top three things to getting that beautifully smooth slide tone?ToneRayThat feel is something you can’t teach – it’s something where I just listened and listened. I taught myself guitar when I was nine, looking at the fingers of the people at my summer camp. I just played by ear, mimicking what I heard on the radio and on records. I then fell in love with slide guitar, which I first heard when I was about 14.In college, I developed my own style. I switched to a Stratocaster – I got a really good deal in the middle of the night for $120 – and then a few years later, in 1972, Lowell George [of Little Feat] showed me his MXR compressor [pedal]. I’d asked him how he got the tone to last so long – whether it’s a ferocious kind of dirty sound, or a beautiful clean sound on a ballad, the compressor really squishes the sound and makes it last longer. The rest of it is just imitating something that you love until you feel like you’ve got it; just playing with all your heart and soul every time you pick up the guitar. I was trying to make it as close to the human voice as I could.John Lee Hookercalled you his hero.When I watch tapes of you playing together, the love and joy jumps off the screen.Could you tell us a bit about your friendship?jackworthingjpWhen we did our recording of I’m in the Mood from his 1989 album The Healer, that’s when we started to get close. We had a similar sense of humour; we would just get together and talk about this recording or that by BB King or Bukka White or Fred McDowell. He found a kindred soul in me, and I did in him. He was always one of my heroes, but he became just a man, and my pal.For the recording sessions [for I’m in the Mood], we turned the lights down. I was platonic friends with John Lee, we didn’t flirt or have a romantic thing going on, but I chose that song because it was just so incredibly erotic and alluring. I gotta say it, face to face with him in the dark playing that song … damn! I was literally out of breath and I needed a towel after the session. We all got a big kick out of that. When he aims it at you, man, there’s nobody that can play that kind of lowdown stuff better than John Lee.I Can’t Make You Love Mehas become almost the holy grail of breakup songs.I’m tearing up justthinkingabout you singing it!Do you ever tire of hearing people tell you how much it means to them?cavelier5Never, and I never get tired of singing it. It makes me tear up as well! I have been on both sides of what the song is about – I’ve had to tell someone I don’t love them any more, and know what it was like to spend the next night or two with him. And I’ve also been the person who had their heart broken and asked someone to stay over the Christmas holidays even though they were breaking up with me. That heartache is so beautifully expressed in that song. I’m grateful I’m not going through that at the moment, but I just send it out every night to the people I know who are freshly involved in a heartbreak – or about to break someone’s heart, and tell them to be gentle.I’m very grateful that they [Mike Reid and Allen Shamblin] sent the song to me first. I’ve gotten so many letters from women that have said: “I’ve never seen my husband in tears and when you sing that song, or Angel from Montgomery, I turn to look at him in the audience and see tears rolling down his cheek.” What’s more moving than that?View image in fullscreen‘No one could turn a phrase like him’ … Bonnie Raitt and John Prine.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for The Recording AcademyI love your cover of Angel from Montgomery, theJohn Prineclassic. What are your recollections of him?tomcasagrandaNo one could turn a phrase like him. Nobody had the insight mixed with that wonderful sense of humour and pathos and genuine appreciation and understanding of the people that he was singing about, including himself. He was just delightful. His personality comes across in his live performances – he is just the same guy off stage as he is on.We hit it off right away in 1971 when we met. We were both having first albums out – his was a masterpiece of a first album. We’ve toured together over the years, and we became like Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer. We were really bonded for all of these five decades that we got to be dear, dear friends. Losing him and knowing that I wasn’t going to get to sing that song with him again was one of the big heartaches of Covid.TheGrammy-winning song Just Like Thatdelivers a gut-punch reveal [a stranger reveals to a woman that he is carrying the donor heart of her late son]. Have there been any particularly memorable conversations with transplant recipients and familiessince the song’s 2022 release?McScootikinsI received so many letters from people that had lost a loved one and eventually met the family that received the organs – or, heartbreakingly, so many families that said they wanted to find a donor but the bureaucracy of the organ donation system in America is just too clogged. Very few of the organs actually get to the people that need them and many people die needlessly. It’s been a broken system for a long time, which I wasn’t aware of [before writing the song].I certainly didn’t expect to win song of the year at the Grammys [beating Adele, Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, Harry Styles, Taylor Swift and more], nor did anybody else on planet Earth! Dr Jill Biden gave me the award. Maybe the song was played in her house and she and her husband spoke of it, or his staff did. Within a couple of months he made an announcement to overhaul the organ donation system in the States after decades of it being dysfunctional. There were 4,500 messages on my lyric video on YouTube after the Grammys: story after story from doctors, nurses, donor families and people that wish they had an organ. The ones that break my heart especially are the ones where people long to be able to put a stethoscope or put their head to the chest of someone that has their loved one’s heart.View image in fullscreen‘He found a kindred soul in me’ … Bonnie Raitt and John Lee Hooker.Photograph: Richard E Aaron/RedfernsA key part of your career is your numerous collaborations with other musicians – fromRay Charles,John Lee HookerandBB KingtoAlicia KeysandSheryl Crow. Which of these has the fondest memories for you?jimdThat is so tough to answer, like asking which of your kids is your favourite. But I couldn’t possibly choose between them and singing with my dad. It was an honour after all those years of being a blues mama. He said: “Your ballads, it’s just like me singing a ballad in a Broadway show – they’re just stories.” And so I sang Hey There with him from The Pajama Game, and he sang I’m Blowin’ Away with me, together with the Boston Pops Orchestra [in 1992]. That would be my highlight.The words you’ve written and sung for all these decades, the songs you’ve covered from way back in the day through your last album, have been the soundtrack of my life, our life, gifted to others in joy, in their time of need. Thank you for them and all the brilliant shows I’ve been fortunate to attend with my wife, going back to the 80s. How have you kept your empathy so strong?jfspakowskiI’m glad I have been the soundtrack. I feel that way about Joni Mitchell and Jackson Browne and so many others, so I’m right there with you.I don’t know how I would be able to sing a song in front of people without feeling it deeply – if I ever started to just phone it in I’d hang up my spurs and stay home! I didn’t think I’d be doing this 54 years later, but if you’re going to be singing it a lot, you better be careful about what songs you pick and what words you write, because you’re going to have to make them real for every audience that hasn’t seen you in a while. They come back, and those songs mean so much to them – and they mean so much to me because of that.Just Like Thatis a moving and beautiful song which has deservedly collected many awards and accolades. There is a second song on the album which tells an extraordinary story, and could have been a Grammy-winner in its own right.What was the inspiration forDown the Hall?WeissenbornI read a New York Times magazine story with a photo essay about a California prison where [prisoners] have volunteered to be on the hospice ward. To be of service to people that need their help, and also to be with them at the very last moments of their life. To hold their hands. The stories and the interviews were so beautiful, and the pictures were so astonishing – I was crying about it. It stayed with me for weeks.I knew I was going to try to write some story songs for the next record, inspired by John Prine. I wanted to make a story about this: a prisoner that decided to volunteer on the hospice ward of his prison. They’re stuck in there anyway and a lot of them either don’t remember the crime they committed – they might have been high or in a rage – or they just feel so much remorse, without redemption, for the crimes they committed. If it was major harm to children or a loved one or a murder, this is their way of redeeming themselves.For me, it’s the fact that it cuts across all the gang isolation in prisons. Out in the field they would never hang out with the Latinos, with the skinheads, with the Black prisoners, with the white prisoners – everybody’s separated. But in the hospice ward there’s no separation. Watching someone shave the head of somebody that was tattooed, when the rest of the time they wouldn’t have been allowed to even hang out together – it’s so moving to me.You use African or Caribbean rhythms in some of your songs, likeHear Me Lord. How has that music influenced your own style?bvigiliant1I have such a wide range of tastes, from Madeleine Peyroux to Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, the most gut-bucket country blues, Appalachian music and Celtic music. World music has always just broken my heart wide open. I love African music and guitar playing; I love South Africa and I loved Graceland. I was so happy to see so much of the incredible gift that African music can give the rest of the world, brought out by Paul Simon’s amazing success.World music has always appealed to me, especially in my early 20s: reggae was really taking over the college scene in Cambridge with Toots and Bob Marley. I loved Oliver Mtukudzi’s music from Zimbabwe [Mtukudzi wrote Hear Me Lord], and sadly, we lost him to Covid, as well as Toots, who was another dear friend. I’ve got two duets with Toots – and we were going to record a song of his as a duet on this last record of mine, but he passed away.Which artists inspire you today?onemoreseasonIf you like Little Feat, great soul singing and great slide, really knocking my socks off lately is the Bros Landreth out of Winnipeg, Canada – a band that wrote my song Made Up Mind, which won the Grammy for Americana performance in 2023, the same year that I won for song of the year.Lola Young’s Messy is one of the greatest things I’ve heard in years. I’ve always loved Jason Isbell – he’s got an incredible new album out. Janelle Monáe, Chance the Rapper, Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar – they are putting issues out in a way that is so important to showcase, as well as just great music: inventive and brilliant on every level.I love Olivia Rodrigo, her songs are killer, and HER is a great guitar player and songwriter. Courtney Barnett from Australia, and my dear soulmate, Maia Sharp, who I’ve got three songs with. Then I would say my friend Brandi Carlile, who has done so much for legacy artists like Joni Mitchell and Tanya Tucker – she is such a fan of music, and making such great music of her own.I understand your parents wereQuakers– is Quakerism still part of your life?ReddawnI’m known for my social activism, and using music to raise funds and attention for all kinds of environmental and human rights justice, women’s issues and Native American rights. From my folks converting to Quakerism after the second world war, I learned pacifism, and simplicity: not focusing on the material and consuming as much as possible, but being of service. Using your life to make a difference, and when you see injustice or suffering or lack in other people and you try to do something with your actions, not just talking about it or writing a cheque.My folks did benefits for the peace efforts to try to ban the bomb and stop nuclear testing. I grew up during the Vietnam war era and the civil rights era, and I watched my heroes like Joan Baez and the Staple Singers writing meaningful songs. Bob Dylan really changed my life that way as well.I don’t go to Quaker meetings as much because I travel so much, but the spirit of all the things I just mentioned are rooted in the Quaker philosophy. The true teachings of Christ and Muhammad and Buddha are so similar, they’re really the same – it’s all about love and not hating your enemies.View image in fullscreenTimothée Chalamet and Elle Fanning in A Complete Unknown.Photograph: API’ve just watchedA Complete Unknownand was wondering if there was a Dylan song that kind of sent you on your way?BoltUprightTimothée Chalamet, Ed Norton and actually everyone did an incredible job. I really wanted the power of Bob Dylan’s music, and his influence early in the 60s, to be experienced by this newer generation, so I’m grateful that the film was made and has had this success, because my life was changed when I was 13 and his first album came out.I was a folk music fan living in Los Angeles – I couldn’t get down to those clubs, as I was too young, and I didn’t live in Greenwich Village. For me it was all about records and reading music magazines – which in this case was Sing Out! – and I went to summer camp, where my counsellors were in colleges in the upstate New York and New England area. They were playing Joan Baez, Odetta and Peter, Paul and Mary, and they turned me on to Bob Dylan’s records.The Times They Are A-Changin’ album was the one that set me on a course: I loved and I learned every one of those songs so I could play them in my room just for myself, with no intention of performing them. He really brought social issues to bear at a time when the country was waking up to what we needed to wake up to, and consequently the world. His growth, his depth, his curiosity and his ability to master so many different styles: he is one of our greatest artists of all time.Could you share a story about singing and playing withLowell George of Little Feat?DavidEverardHats off to the UK, and Holland, for appreciating Little Feat and Ry Cooder and Randy Newman: artists that did not get a proper mind-blowing fandom in the States as they deserved. Lowell and Little Feat and I were so thrilled to be appreciated in the 70s in England, and we got to go to Amsterdam and, you know, smoke pot and all this stuff you hear about.Meeting Lowell changed my life. The reason that New Orleans is so special and important as a building block of modern R&B, blues and soul is the international influence: so many different styles of music melding together in one incredibly funky gumbo of country music and blues and Spanish feel. All those things were encompassed in Little Feat, between Billy Payne’s gorgeous piano playing and that killer rhythm section. But Lowell really was able to sing from such an incredibly soulful place. He absorbed all of his influences and they showed in everything he wrote, sang and played.His appetite for life was just limitless; he had an appreciation for every kind of music and a lifestyle that went with it. There was nobody better, in my opinion, until I heard Joey Landreth, who loves Lowell so much as well. Me and Lowell were dear friends and he died way too soon [aged 34 in 1979]. Who knows what he and Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jimi Hendrix would have been like – or John Lennon at this age – if they hadn’t been cut down early.Where does your energy and drive come from at this age?MainerfromDCI am so proud to have lasted this long because so many of our friends suffered from poor health, or their lives were shortened by accidents or suicide or drug addiction. I’m so grateful for my 38 years of sobriety – knock on wood, one day at a time – which is probably why I’m still here just in terms of perspective, emotionally and spiritually. But also getting enough sleep and getting some exercise: I do yoga and weights with a girlfriend on FaceTime three times a week, no matter where I am. And as the world situation is so stressful and so upsetting, I don’t know what I would do if it wasn’t for being able to get out into nature and hike and be with the fellowship of my people that feel like I do about the world.Bonnie Raitt’s UK and Ireland tour begins 1 June, Ulster Hall, BelfastExplore more on these topicsBonnie RaittThe reader interviewBluesPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They had “determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offences linked to both videos”, officers said.Scotland Yard added: “The investigation is now being carried out by officers from the Met’s counter-terrorism command.”The Irish language group have been the focus of heavy criticism over the two video clips in recent days. Ministers have put pressure on the organisers of the Glastonbury festival over the group’s inclusion on the lineup, while a gig at the Eden Project and three concerts in Germanyhave been cancelled.On Thursday, a message on the Plymouth Pavilions website said Kneecap’s concert would no longer go ahead due to safety concerns.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has demanded the trio be banned from Glastonbury, with politicians from the governing and opposition parties highlighting the danger already faced by MPs after the murders of their colleagues Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.The video footage appeared to show a member of the group saying at a 2023 gig: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” Footage from another date last year appeared to show one of the band shouting: “Up Hamas, up Hezbollah” – groups that are banned and defined as terrorist organisations in the UK.However, in a joint statement also signed by other artists including the former BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac and the bandsMassive Attackand the Pogues, the group said there had been a “clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform” Kneecap.“As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,” they said.“In a democracy, no political figures or political parties should have the right to dictate who does and does not play at music festivals or gigs that will be enjoyed by thousands of people.”The tale of the Northern Irish rap group, the Tories – and the sinister censoring of ‘anti-British’ art | Anna CafollaRead moreMassive Attack also put out their own statement, adding: “Language matters, of course. The hideous murders of elected politicians Jo Cox and David Amess means there’s no scope for flippancy or recklessness.”It said politicians were “strategically concocting moral outrage over the stage utterings of a young punk band”, adding: “Kneecap are not the story. Gaza is the story. Genocide is the story. And the silence, acquiescence and support of those crimes against humanity by the elected British government is the real story.”Kneecap have been outspoken on political issues, including British colonialism in Ireland and the Gaza war.They are not the first band to come under political and judicial pressure over their material. In 2015, the US rapper Tyler, the Creator was banned from the UK because of lyrics from a 2009 release. In the mid-1970s, many shops refused to stock records by the Sex Pistols over their content, while prosecutors unsuccessfully went after a record shop manager in Nottingham for displaying the band’s artwork – subjecting him to a trial under obscenity laws.In response to the latest furore, Kneecap have sought to defend themselves, apologising to the families of Amess, the Conservative MP murdered in 2021, and Cox, the Labour MP killed in 2016. They said they “never intended to cause you hurt”, and that they “reject any suggestion that we would seek to incite violence against any MP or individual”.The group said: “Kneecap’s message has always been – and remains – one of love, inclusion, and hope. This is why our music resonates across generations, countries, classes and cultures and has brought hundreds of thousands of people to our gigs. No smear campaign will change that.”They added they had “never supported” Hamas or Hezbollah.Families of both MPs have suggested the band’s apology was less genuine than they had hoped.Katie Amess, the daughter of the murdered MP for Southend West, said it would be “very dangerous” for Kneecap to perform at Glastonbury. Brendan Cox, the husband of Jo, called the statement“half an apology”.He said: “It’s fine to say that you’re sorry for it, but the way that they have actually spoken about it is to suggest that it’s a conspiracy, that they have been targeted unfairly, and for me, that then doesn’t come across as unfortunately particularly genuine.”Explore more on these topicsKneecapFreedom of speechMusic festivalsHouse of CommonsAnnie MacPulpPaul WellernewsShareReuse this content"

We look back at spiders, splinters, sexual dependency and sunsetsByDale Berning Sawa,Eddy Frankel,Tim Jonze,Charlotte Jansen,Oliver WainwrightandEvan MoffittThu 1 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 06.27 EDTShareLouiseBourgeois’s spideropens the museum (2000)Frances Morris, then head of displaysView image in fullscreen“Louise Bourgeois symbolised what I wanted Tate Modern to be: a place where you would have extraordinary encounters with artists who weren’t in the canon. She proposed an installation with three towers for the Turbine Hall and we suggested also borrowing a small group of her spiders to put on the ramp down into the hall, to lure people in. She said, ‘No, no, no – I’ll make you a spider.’ It was all very last minute: we had to finish installing Maman, as this giant new spider was called, during the very first opening event, which was for London’s taxi drivers. I spent the next few years meeting taxi drivers who’d say: ‘You weren’t involved with that spider woman, were you?’” (Dale Berning Sawa)Anish Kapoorinstalls a giant trumpet (2002)Phil Monk, senior design and production managerView image in fullscreen“This took several weeks and a huge number of people to install. The first phase was the assembly of the three huge steel rings that formed the structure of Marsyas. They were tricky to get into place. Then there was the giant red vinyl membrane that had to be carefully and slowly stretched around the steel. It arrived in one huge piece, so it was a major feat of engineering, spreading it across the whole floor, stretching it around the rings, getting the tension right. It took a really big blowtorch to soften the fabric. The finished work filled virtually the whole hall. Only on moving around the building could the full scale be seen. When viewed on the bridge, you were almost engulfed. You could imagine being Jonah or Pinocchio about to be swallowed by a whale.” (Eddy Frankel)Olafur Eliassonunveils a setting sun (2003)Olafur Eliasson, artistView image in fullscreen“When I was approached about doing something, I immediately thought about the relationship British people have with the weather. Someone can say ‘I like the rain’ and someone else can say ‘I prefer the sun’ and they can still be friends. Whereas if this was football teams, they couldn’t even be in the same pub! I was also interested in Turner and Constable and the tradition of depicting the weather in British watercolours. My idea was to recreate a setting sun, where you see half of it in the sky and the other half reflected in the sea. We used very thin aluminium mirrors to achieve this. Compared to some of my other projects, it wasn’t technically difficult. I did not anticipate the social spectacle it became. I thought people would be looking with their eyes but instead they looked with their bodies: lying down, rolling around, making shapes in the giant reflection. The BBC even reported the weather from Tate Modern!” (Tim Jonze)Doris Salcedoputs a long crack in the floor (2007)Doris Salcedo, artistView image in fullscreen“The memory of this work is painful. It was, and still is, a wound inflicted on theTurbine Hall. It was an excruciating gesture for all the parties involved – Tate director Nicholas Serota’s job was on the line because of the nature of the piece. As the first artist from the global south invited to do a Turbine Hall commission, it was essential to raise our voices and respond to colonial history – it felt as serious as life or death to me. It represents the division in our world, which unfortunately only keeps growing.” (Charlotte Jansen)An enormous salad is mixed with a rake (2008)Catherine Wood, curator“In the 1960s, Alison Knowles, who was a founding member of the Fluxus movement, had done an iteration of this piece at the ICA, tossing a salad in a pickle barrel. She proposed to supersize it. First there was a funny visit to nearby Borough Market, where Alison was like: “I’ll have all your lettuces.” Also tomatoes, cucumbers – she wanted it to taste good. During the event, she was quite performative, announcing what was happening. Chefs from the museum chopped the veg into crates on the bridge, then tossed it down on to a tarpaulin on the Turbine Hall floor and poured down the dressing from a jug. There was a big crowd, 500, maybe 1,000, people. Everyone cheered. She used a garden rake to mix it and people got little bowls to eat from. The museum was built on the principles of what those artists in the 1960s did with participation and access and play. So this was a thrill.” (DBS)Nan Goldin does The Ballad of Sexual Dependency(2008)Patrick Wolf, musicianView image in fullscreen“I had just moved into a flat opposite the Tate Modern, when I got the call from Nan. She had given me a copy of her book, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency, four years earlier. It felt like such an honour to be asked to make the first ever soundtrack to this visual diary. Nan was very trusting. She knew I’d respect the work. And I knew where it was coming from. When I was a teenager, I was part of a crowd in London that was similarly disturbed by what they had experienced, either through addiction or death. At the beginning, Nan gave a speech. The piece started with a tubular bell and a double bass, and a sense of silence took over, a weight came over the room. We had orchestral timpani and a string quartet. I played the harpsichord. At the end, Nan was very emotional and crying. As with everything at the Tate, there’s a party afterwards, which felt quite strange after something so heavy. I remember walking with Nan outside at the back of the Tate and us just saying thank you to each other.” (DBS)Tania Bruguera kettles people withhorses (2008)Catherine Wood, curatorView image in fullscreen“Tania always said this performance piece – which was an idea she had never realised – would be like a gunshot, a surprise. Our health and safety and security officer at the time had a contact in the Met. Tania asked the officers to perform six crowd-control exercises normally used in riots. At first, they were friendly to the crowd but she asked them to stop. The horses’ hooves clacking on the concrete was echoing around the space and when the police got into their role, you heard them barking instructions. The crowd went quite quiet. I was there with my six-month-old son. People were both complying and marvelling at the strange, surreal spectacle. The horses dumped on the floor, which was great as well. There is a tradition in art of doing variations ofPiero Manzoni’s Merde d’artiste.” (DBS)Picture of Brooke Shields naked removed by police (2009)Catherine Wood, curator“Richard Prince’s Spiritual America had been shown before and had become iconic and familiar in the art world. By reclaiming Gary Gross’s photograph of a naked, 10-year-old Brooke Shields, Prince was clearly referencing the way capitalism sexualises young women and girls. We didn’t question the acceptability of showing it. We had also been in touch with Brooke Shields. She had a conflicting relationship with the image, but after working with Prince on a follow-up had become reconciled to it. Nobody from the public lodged a complaint, but we were advised by the police that we had to take it down or our director could be liable for prosecution under the child protection act. At the time, we were shocked. We thought the police were being very literal. But it does all look very different today. The mass access that Tate Modern gives to art is different even to New York museums, where people have to pay to enter. When you step outside the protected zone of the art world, who read the artist’s “move” through his conceptual intent, the image looks very different. These days, we have a much more robust process of assessing sensitive content. Today, we would know what is and isn’t possible long before the work ended up on the gallery wall.” (TJ)Bodyspacemotionthings causes joy – and injuries (2009)Kathy Noble, former interdisciplinary curatorView image in fullscreen“I’d come across these images of an installation Robert Morris made in Tate Britain in 1971. They were of people climbing and balancing on plywood sculptures and were really surprising. Back then, museums were a place of reverence, almost cathedral-like. When the public were invited to interact with the objects, they didn’t quite know how to go about it: there were some injuries and the show closed after four days. We wondered whether Tate Modern had changed the way people behaved around art. We worked closely with Robert to make it safer and he gave the 2009 version the title Bodyspacemotionsthings – the original used unfinished pieces of wood whereas we had plywood that had been treated and objects made of rubber. There were no splinters this time. The press did report that some people got injured but I think that was sensationalised. I only remember a couple of minor incidents. In general people were excited. It helped write a new narrative about how art can be playful and joyous. And it was so popular that this time around it was extended from four days to a whole month.” (TJ)Ai Weiwei’s Sunflower Seeds ishalted (2010)Ai Weiwei, artistView image in fullscreen“Sunflower Seeds is one of the most complicated projects I have ever undertaken. It was created by 1,600 women artisans over a period of two full years. It reflects China’s history, culture and exceptional artisan skills. It also reflects the backdrop of globalisation – and China involving its entire population within this process. The artwork is not merely a visual piece highlighting quantity and complexity, but also represents the political reality and socialist society in which I grew up. I had hoped visitors could walk across 100m sunflower seeds, their physical contact reminiscent of walking on a beach. I did not anticipate that the dust produced by the seeds underfoot would be harmful to health. As a result, its participatory nature was halted, transforming it into a purely visual experience. This came as a shock to me. The impact was that my thinking about the relationship between artworks and sociopolitical movements intensified. I believe art arises from an individual’s personal reflection and cannot be separated from engagement with society.” (EM)Tacita Dean blows up celluloid (2011)Tacita Dean, artistView image in fullscreen“I thought a Turbine Hall commission was one thing I would never be asked to do, because my work is relatively small. Nothing I make is ever about the spectacular. The piece, titled FILM, was all done very quickly with a completely new experimental system, projecting images on to a 13-metre-tall monolith – exactly when the medium of film itself was under such threat. You have no idea of the drama. We worked all through the night. Steve Farman, the negative cutter, drove from London to Amsterdam and back to recut the film and handed it in at the back door, less than 48 hours before the opening. I remember saying in an event that film is not dead: it will only die if it gets murdered. My crew at the time were all under 25 and it blew their minds.”Yayoi Kusamabrings Infinity Mirror Rooms to the UK (2012)Frances Morris, then curatorView image in fullscreen“This was a very important show for Kusama, not only because of that glorious final moment – with the biggest Infinity Room she had made to date. She afforded us amazing access to her archive, and to her secret home in Tokyo. We made lots of discoveries. I have to say, though, that it was hard to persuade Kusama to do the show. I went to visit her in Tokyo and promised it would make her more famous than her old friend Donald Judd. I think it delivered!”Mark Rothko’s Black on Maroon is vandalised (2012)Patricia Smithen, repair project leaderView image in fullscreen“When I heard the news, I was on site within the hour. Black ink had been drawn on the lower right corner of Rothko’s Black on Maroon and it had penetrated quickly. It turned out to be graffiti ink – designed to be quick drying, highly staining and permanent. The project took 18 months while conservation scientist Bronwyn Ormsby rallied expertise from across the field. The artwork is made up of very thin layers of paint and glazes: most solvents which could remove the ink would also affect Rothko’s paint. About 80 different solvent combinations were tried out on test surfaces over nine months. Rachel Barker, the painting conservator, did the actual treatment. She combined two solvents, layered, and applied them through absorbent fabric. When the ink was pulled out and we could see the original paint again, there were cheers! After a final retouching with reversible paint under the gallery lights, we asked staff if they could see the damage. Nobody was able to spot it. It was a wonderful moment, but bittersweet. The painting looks perfect in the gallery, but some black ink remains within the lower paint layers and stains the canvas on the reverse. This damage is for ever and it still haunts me.” (TJ)Liberate Tateprotests againstBP sponsorship(2012)Mel Evans, founding member Liberate TateView image in fullscreen“We wanted to highlight what BP had consistently failed at: clean renewables. A farmer in Wales gave us an old turbine blade: 16.5 metres long and 1.5 tonnes in weight. We had to cut it in three to transport it. We spent a couple of weeks polishing it. We wanted it to be beautiful, to lie on the floor of the gallery like a beached whale. There was a conversation in the group about standing it on its end, but a few of us said that was much too phallic. We walked with it from the Occupy camp at St Paul’s Cathedral, across the Millennium Bridge. One of the security guards laid down in front of it to stop us coming in, so I sat down with him and spoke very gently, saying: “This is happening.” He stood up. We assembled the blade. There were 75 performers. We held hands in a ring around it. All the gallery-goers stood and applauded. It felt incredible, electric.” (DBS)Tino Sehgal’s storytellers chat to visitors (2012)Tino Sehgal, artistView image in fullscreen“In 2012, London was having a great moment. And the Turbine Hall was the biggest and most unusual art space. I hadn’t worked with a large group of people before, so I was interested in what I could do with a crowd. In total, 300 people participated over three months. I created ‘human swarm patterns’ by having them follow sets of rules or games. They’d all move from one side to the next, or all walk backwards or sing a song together. I also gave them six questions – things like, ‘When did you have a sense of arrival?’ – and they chose one for their interactions with visitors. The anonymity made these interactions surprisingly intimate. They’d come to me afterwards if something special happened.” (DBS)Kraftwerk play eight live gigs (2013)Emil Schult, Kraftwerk’s artistic collaboratorView image in fullscreen“To accompany these performances, we redid some of the early videos that had been made in the 1970s for the band’s stage show, but we also made new ones. The video for Autobahn was an animation, based on the painting I did for the sleeve of the original 1974 album. My input was on the artistic side: the colours, the shape of the industrial landscapes, the streamlining of the Trans Europe Express engine, the movement of waves and so on. For almost 50 years now, I have been interested in animation, artificial life and artificial intelligence. So to see my work come alive was very much appreciated.” (TJ)Matisse’s late works break Tate records (2014)Nicholas Cullinan,then curator of International Modern ArtView image in fullscreen“When I proposed the show in 2009, Nicholas Serota and I had just curated the Cy Twombly exhibition and had been visiting Cy in his studio on a regular basis, in what turned out to be the last years of his life. That, and the fact that Tate Modern had never done a Matisse show, was our inspiration: often when artists have a sense of their mortality, they respond by making the best work they’ve ever made. We were pleasantly surprised at how many loans we got: people understood this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see all the works together. With over half a million visitors, it is still the most visited show the Tate, not just Tate Modern, has ever had.” (DBS)New viewing platform prompts legal battle(2016)John O’Mara, project architect of the Switch HouseforHerzog & de MeuronView image in fullscreen“Our idea for the top of the new Switch House was to create an elevated public space with thrilling 360-degree views across the city. A developer was planning to build towers of luxury flats next door, so we did these gymnastic moves with our design to protect their views of the river. They were very supportive of the project, so it was a real shock when residents started complaining about people looking into their flats from the terrace, about 30 metres away. No one had anticipated it being a problem, but they took Tate to court. The first ruling found in favour of Tate, but a subsequent supreme court ruling saw the southern side of the terrace closed off. It’s a real shame, as a lot of people really liked that view.” (Oliver Wainwright)Elton John shares his photography collection (2016)Shoair Mavlian, curator ofThe Radical Eye:Modernist Photography from the Sir Elton John CollectionView image in fullscreen“It was incredible to have access to Sir Elton John’s collection and put the vintage prints on public display – everything in the show was printed before 1950. Sir Elton has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the history of photography and a real highlight was when he recorded an audio guide, giving his perspective on dozens of the photos. You could really hear his passion for photography.” (CJ)Soul of a Nation starts something big (2017)Zoé Whitley,co-curator of Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black PowerView image in fullscreen“This show was about the irreducibility of what it means to be Black. It exceeded all expectations in terms of people who came, who felt seen, who wanted to engage with it, including Jay-Z, Naomie Harris, John Legend and Sampha. All the works posed the question: what is Black art? It gave no single answer. This was the start of something that keeps getting bigger. And it was celebratory for so many artists, many of whom are no longer with us.” (CJ)Work by gallery staff goes on display (2018)Chris Daniels, artistView image in fullscreen“There had been talk about a staff exhibition for a while, and I applied after I saw it on Tatenet, the intranet for staff. Tate is full of artists who work there to pay the rent, but also spend all their spare time in the studio, and still produce incredible art despite the restrictions of a day job. I was a Tate Membership recruiter, walking up to people and trying to encourage them to join up, but I also made, and still make, paintings. It was a fantastic opportunity: the sheer numbers of people visiting Tate Modern meant the audience was much bigger than any standard exhibition. And it meant I could add “showing at Tate Modern” to my bio!” (EF)Kara Walkerbuilds afountain full of sharks(2019)Kara Walker, artistView image in fullscreen“The process began with not wanting to do Louise Bourgeois or Doris Salcedo wrong. I had those artists’ incredible Turbine Hall interventions in mind when I embarked on this piece. Then I spent six months or so ramming my head against the wall. That was until one visit to London, when I snapped a few pictures of the Queen Victoria memorial from the taxi on my way to Heathrow. I thought, ‘Wow, that’s the kind of pomposity I like!’ The symbolic language, the overblown figuration, a little too big for its britches. That’s my language. Fons Americanus, my fountain, was a commentary on empire and my place within it, which is as an outsider, a rebel. The American invader.” (EM)Anicka Yi’s robotic jellyfish take flight (2021)Anicka Yi, artistView image in fullscreen“In Love With the World reimagined the Turbine Hall as an aquarium of machines, where airborne lifeforms – “aerobes” – drift through the air like jellyfish through water. It was essential to me that these machines didn’t merely occupy the space, butsensedit,respondedto it, and participated in it. A central concern was to challenge the cognitive hierarchy that places disembodied intelligence – the mind extracted from the body – at the top. Instead, I’m interested in artificialphysicalintelligence – intelligence as something rooted in corporeality, sensory perception and ecological embeddedness. I wanted the aerobes to be less robotic in the traditional sense and more like a new species, engaged in a multispecies symbiosis with us and the atmosphere we share. Each aerobe is kept aloft by helium envelopes and guided by a compact system of carbon-fibre actuators, 3D-printed components and custom-built control boards. Key to their long-term operation is the Battery Pond. Aerobes return there autonomously when their batteries run low, while technicians perform regular check-ins. If an aerobe were to experience a technical issue, its helium structure ensures a slow, controlled descent – not a crash, but a soft settling. They avoid one another, respond to heat signatures from the crowd below, and navigate invisible trails left by other aerobes – forming a choreography that prevents collisions and encourages responsive movement. Rather than building flawless machines, the aim was to create a self-regulating ecosystem.” (EM)Cézanne shows everyone how it’s done (2023)Peter Doig, painterView image in fullscreen“Picasso said, ‘He was my one and only master. It was the same for all of us. He was like our father. He was the one who protected us.’ That still seems to ring true for artists today, even after all the new territory that has seemingly been mined in painting since Cézanne’s death. The Tate show displayed all of his mastery as well as his awkwardness and irreverence. For painters today I think he still holds the secrets to everything one can learn – from bad to good painting and drawing, economy, restraint and his lack of flash. Cézanne never shows off. I am continually drawn to his details. You can learn everything you need to know about painting just from his flumes of smoke.” (EF)Tracey Emin given major retrospective (opens 2026)Tracey Emin, artistView image in fullscreen“I am really happy that I didn’t die and I am around to see this exhibition. I was there at the opening of the Tate Modern in 2000 – and at the time it felt like the most exciting thing that could ever possibly happen to London. You judge a city by its art.” (DBS)Explore more on these topicsTate ModernTurbine HallArtLouise BourgeoisAnish KapoorOlafur EliassonShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Kerry Brown/Paramount Pictures/AllstarAs the wrestler turned action hero turns 53, we count down his best movies – from Baywatch to Jumanji to that time he played the Tooth FairyByStuart HeritageThu 1 May 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 10.07 EDTShare20. Red One (2024)Dwayne Johnson is about to violently switch gears. His next films include a Benny Safdie drama about an MMA fighter battling addiction and a true-crime drama produced by Martin Scorsese. The reason for this abrupt handbrake turn towards grownup film-making seems to beRed One; a duff Christmas action film. During its production, tales of Johnson’s backstage behaviour leaked out: the star was said to frequently be late, and would habituallyhand his assistant bottles of urine rather than walk to the toilet. It was the biggest knock to The Rock since his career began. But onwards and upwards.19. Black Adam (2022)Call it bad timing or hubris, but Johnson’s eventual stint as a superhero felt like too little, too late.Black Adamstood out from the crowd in that his character actually killed people, but the film itself was a mess, and audiences were groggy from too many superheroes. It did so badly that DC had to switch creative approaches entirely to move on from it.18. Baywatch (2017)View image in fullscreen‘My job – it’s just beach’ … Johnson with Zac Efron in Baywatch.Photograph: Frank Masi, SMPSP/Paramount Pictures/AllstarThe Rock does Hasselhoff. What could go wrong? Well, on the evidence ofBaywatch, quite a lot. The film kept a lot of what made the 1990s TV show so popular – nearly everyone in it was hot and skimpily clothed – but the addition of ironic, self-aware humour made it feel a little like Johnson wanted to have his cake and eat it.17. Tooth Fairy (2010)A rite of passage in any action star’s career is the moment when they have to make a comedy that forces them to be soft. In other words, Tooth Fairy is The Rock’sKindergarten Cop, or hisMr Nanny, or (if we want to be cruel) hisThe Pacifier. He plays a mean hockey player who is forced to don wings and collect children’s teeth at night. “You might just be the worst tooth fairy ever,” says Julie Andrews, who is also in this for some reason.16. Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (2012)I’ll admit to a grudging soft spot for this one, simply for how relentlessly weird it is. It’sa Jules Verne adaptationin which The Rock variously sings ukulele songs, uses 3D technology to ping berries off his pecs at the camera and chases Michael Caine around on a giant bee. Underrated.15. Faster (2010)“Slow justice is no justice” said the posters for this vaguely Point-Blank-esque revenge thriller about an ex-con working his way down a list of people he wants to kill. In truth, Faster isn’t all that fast, but it is the sort of film where a character can be shot full in the head and shake it off as a flesh wound.14. Hercules (2014)A big historical epic based on Steve Moore’s comic book, this is another one of Johnson’s films known better for the narrative around it than the film itself. Johnson transformed his body for the role, spending six months inhaling calories while living “like a monk” in Budapest. The end result is entirely forgettable, though.13. Jungle Cruise (2021)View image in fullscreenInoffensive … with Emily Blunt in Jungle Cruise.Photograph: Walt Disney Pictures/Frank Masi/AllstarAn inoffensive IP grab in which Johnson and Emily Blunt do their best to breathe life into a 70-year-old theme park boat ride. Given that Pirates of the Caribbean (similarly based on a Disney attraction) was once the biggest film around,Jungle Cruisefared more modestly – although it’s entertaining enough, and Johnson has some enjoyably snappy chemistry with Blunt.12. Skyscraper (2018)There’s no way to sugar-coat this: for a while, Johnson’s stock in trade was churning out a stream of identical disaster movies. This isthe one that really wants to be Die Hard, the one where Neve Campbell plays his wife. It’s the one where The Rock jumps off one skyscraper and then lands on another one. It’s fine.11. Fighting With My Family (2019)Technically, The Rock has little more than an extended cameo here, inStephen Merchant’s biopicabout the rise of real-life WWE star Paige. The film helped to launch a boatload of careers, from Florence Pugh to Jack Lowden, and they’re responsible for all the heavy lifting. All Johnson has to do here is coast on his charisma, something he pulls off with aplomb.10. Rampage (2018)View image in fullscreenChemistry … Johnson and his CGI co-star in Rampage.Photograph: APIn which The Rock adapts a video game from 1986. The arcade game Rampage very much felt like an unlicensed attempt to trade on the popularity of King Kong and Godzilla, andthe moviedid nothing to change that. The star attraction is George, an enormous albino gorilla. But Johnson, playing his handler (who also gets to fire guns and punch a load of people), is the secret draw. It takes a lot to manufacture chemistry with a big ape that doesn’t exist, but he achieves it effortlessly. Maybe the most pure fun a Dwayne Johnson film has ever been.9. The Mummy Returns (2001)The Rock (and he was The Rock back then, none of this “Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson” nonsense) made his feature debut with thissequel to The Mummy. In time his character would receive his own spin-off in the form of the Scorpion King, and from this evidence it’s clear why. As the villain of the piece, Johnson oozes menace here; although the film is now notorious for its spectacularly shoddy CGI, which even at the time had to be seen to be believed, you can still see his star being born in real time.8. Pain & Gain (2013)This film represented a deliberate step back towards reality for both its star (who had just made a GI Joe movie) and its director, Michael Bay (who had been focusing on Transformers films).Pain & Gainis a true-crime thriller based on the story of some Miami bodybuilders who cluelessly embarked on a series of kidnappings and murders. Johnson is paired with Mark Wahlberg, and they both get a lot of mileage from playing vain dimwits. Some might say it’s a little distasteful to turn an actual murder into a comedy; if you can park that, though, the film is a wonderful reminder of Johnson’s strengths.7. Be Cool (2005)Make no mistake, Be Cool is a mess. A shapeless, formless, cameo-filled attempt to meld a sequel to Get Shorty out of thin air, the film has very little to offer. Johnson plays Elliot, a gay bodyguard with dreams of becoming an actor, and, in a puddle of sludge, he outshines everyone with his wit, timing and sheer physicality. You shouldn’t go and seek out Be Cool, because it will be the most miserable couple of hours of your life, but I’m sure Elliot has some compilation clips on YouTube.6. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017)On social media, The Rock makes much of his infinite determination. If he sets his mind on something, there’s nothing he can’t achieve. The Jumanji films are probably the greatest evidence of that. On paper, only a madman would attempt toremake a classic like Jumanji, especially following in the footsteps of a once-in-a-generation talent like Robin Williams. And yet The Rock did it. In truth, this isn’t so much a remake as a reimagining; the original saw Williams escape the game into real life, whereas here The Rock dives straight in. But he’s backed by a lot of talent in Jack Black, Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan. The fact that Johnson is playing a shy teenager injected into the body of an action hero is also a very sweet touch.5. The Other Guys (2010)View image in fullscreenBad boys … with Samuel L Jackson in The Other Guys.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyJohnson’s presence inAdam McKay’s comedyis something of a red herring. This is really a film about Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, two incompetent New York cops who are forced to step up when the city’s two best policemen are killed. Johnson plays one of the latter, which means his screen time is mainly confined to the first scene. However, that scene manages to offer a pitch-perfect distillation of The Rock’s career until then. It’s a high-stakes, gormless action sequence that, like almost all of his films, pays absolutely no mind to collateral damage. Johnson destroys everything (ultimately including himself) in pursuit of a villain, and, despite wrecking half a city in the process, is still considered a hero.4. The Fast & Furious series (2001–)All Vin Diesel’s film performances – ranked!Read moreIf it wouldn’t be so repetitive, these films could have made up half this list. The Fast & Furious series is the reason why The Rock came to be known as a franchise saver. Before he arrived, these were boring, slightly po-faced films about street racers. Then he came along and transformed the entire franchise into a head-smashing parade of ever sillier stunts. Starting with 2011’s Fast Five, Johnson punched and shot his way through countless baddies – and navigated what might be the world’s most unintentionally hilarious real-life feud with co-star Vin Diesel – until the universe simply couldn’t contain his might and he ducked out. A cameo at the end ofFast X(a film so aggressively OTT that it feels like a peyote trip) hinted at a return in the series finale. Here’s hoping.3. San Andreas (2015)A clear winner from Johnson’s disaster movie days,San Andreasis a loving homage to the work of Roland Emmerich, centring on what might happen should the San Andreas fault devastate the west coast of America. This essentially involves The Rock trading up through more and more ostentatious modes of transport as he attempts to outrun an earthquake. It’s all profoundly silly, from the American flag that unfurls at the end to the nagging suspicion that Johnson is never sure how attracted he is supposed to be to Alexandra Daddario, who plays his daughter. But goodness, it’s entertaining.2. Hobbs and Shaw (2019)A buddy moviestarring two half-formed offshoots from the Fast & Furious movies, Hobbs and Shaw felt like the most unnecessary film going when it was released. And yet you’ll never find a film with such a confident grasp of exactly how silly it is. Two lunkheads (Johnson and Jason Statham) squabble as they attempt to defeat Idris Elba’s genetically enhanced super-soldier. Every set piece here is stupider than the last – They fly fighter jets! They fight baddies with clubs! They drive cars through the top of skyscrapers! – and it’s baffling to think that this is a spin-off of a film where some people have a car race. But it’s so giddy (thanks mainly to co-star Vanessa Kirby, who palpably cannot believe she gets to do this) that the whole thing feels irresistible.1. Moana (2016)Johnson did his own singing in Moana.Ultimately, no film project of Dwayne Johnson’s has ever used his actorly skill set quite as effectively asMoana. Yes, it’s an animation, but The Rock gets to sing and goof about while simultaneously being tough and heroic. It feels as though his character, Maui, was written especially for him, with his oafish charm – and there’s a lightness of touch here that gets lost in all the head-smashing of the rest of his career. He is so good as Maui that the thought of a live-action Moana remake starring Johnson (which is happening, and happening soon) may not immediately fill you with dread. That’s as high as praise gets.Explore more on these topicsRankedDwayne Johnson (The Rock)MoanaAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pomerance’s son Moby is writing the screenplay, and shooting is due to begin in 2026.Pearson, who has neurofibromatosis and will be the first disabled actor to play the role on film, said in a statement: “Joseph Merrick is a man I have a long and complex relationship with. From having his name used as a term of derision to learning about him in documentaries I’ve presented, it’s been a cathartic journey of growing to love and respect a man who as a child I avoided even thinking about. Now as a disability advocate and actor, I can think of no greater honour (yet heavy responsibility) than to tell the true story of Joseph Carey Merrick.”Merrick was born in Leicester in 1862 and after becoming an exhibit in a “penny gaff” in London, came under the care of pioneering surgeon Frederick Treves, who gave Merrick accommodation at the London hospital, where he died in 1890. The exact nature of his condition is not known,with suggestionshe may have had neurofibromatosis or Proteus syndrome, or both.Pomerance’s play was first performed in the UK in 1977, with David Schofield in the lead role; subsequent productions featured actors including Philip Anglim, David Bowie and Bradley Cooper as Merrick. The celebrated film of the same title, starring John Hurt and directed by David Lynch, was not adapted from the play.Explore more on these topicsFilmDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

What do you have to prepare to go into that environment? Onlookers, insects, the weather, noise, any kind of distraction.”En plein air rapping, as Fiasco calls it – after the school of painting that was popularized by Impressionists like Monet and Renoir – involves going to a promising location and fishing for lyrics and beats. He has been fine-turning the practice ever since he came on as a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the 2022-23 academic year – ghotiing throughout MIT, in Los Angeles, and elsewhere, while also teaching it to his students. “It’s a practice that I’ve been using and playing with and working through for the past few years,” he said.‘Tragedy to transcendence’: Alice Coltrane exhibit honors jazz legend’s sonic and spiritual legacyRead moreFiasco has just released the first project of this site-specific rapping via the MIT List Visual Arts Center’swebsite. The nine-track effort (seven of which are currently available) is a cohesive collection of music with a distinct jazz flavor that feels like a throwback to the Native Tongues era of hip-hop. For Fiasco, these tracks are an emanation of the environment that he fished them from. “The goal is to have a certain level of ownership of the space by being completely aware of all the objects that are around it,” said Fiasco, “and how these objects are affecting or influencing, consciously or unconsciously, your experiences.”To celebrate the release, Fiasco will be holding a concert on 2 May as a culmination of the Artfinity festival.Sonically and lyrically, there’s a certain kind of beguiling simplicity to these tracks, with lines that tend to be short and filled with internal rhymes. There’s a sense that the Chicago rapper is more after sound than sense, as in the triplet: “Filling up the staircase / Airspace tethered to the pear tastes / Electron share shape.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Karl RayElsewhere, Fiasco plays with the everydayness of the MIT campus, as when rapping about a giant steel sculpture made by Alexander Calder: “Tourists on their summer trips give it OKs like the number six / Walk around alongside or up under it / Or ignore it / Like can’t see the trees, cause the forests / Or adore it / And explore it.” As the rapper shared, the mundanity is very much the point.“One of my key creative functions is decorating the mundane, finding the profound narratives or insights in the mundane,” he said. “You can see that tradition from Kick, Push, which was about skateboarding. For me it was very mundane, it was a toy. It was like, make a song about this toy. I try to look for the things that people perceive to be mundane and unpack the profound things that are within it.”Ghotiing required Fiasco to solve the many technical challenges raised by site-specific recording. According to him, it could make for awkward moments to be channeling hip-hop inspiration in public environments where anyone might intervene. Being a veteran performer helped, as did putting on his “ghotiing uniform” – usually an MIT jacket – to let people know he was up to something and to give space. Surprisingly, Fiasco said that being a celebrity didn’t pose much of an issue for him.“People don’t really care,” he said. “There’s a certain kind of, ‘Oh that’s Lupe,’ or ‘That’s Professor Lupe, he’s a dope-ass dude.’ That has its own kind of reputation. Sometimes people sneak out like, ‘Yo, lemme get a selfie,’ but for the most part, in terms of ghotiing, people don’t really care.”As for creating beats, Fiasco enlisted AI for assistance – he primarily used Suno, a generative AI program founded in Cambridge, MA, that specializes in making music. “You get people to make beats, and they’ll probably make one beat for months. You can’t really do that when you got the battery on your laptop running down and the sun’s going down and it’s getting cold.” Fiasco worked by putting the artificial intelligence (AI)-generated beats through an editing process, going through dozens of generations of the same beat to get one that was of interest.Fiasco situated AI on a spectrum of the many different tools that musicians have created and adapted for themselves. “It’s like if the saxophone player made the saxophone – which is rare, but real,” he said. “My students can write their own music production software, which is akin to someone like Havoc from Mobb Deep, right, who makes the beats and raps over his own beats. So I see that tradition as just as valid as going into the lab and making the AI that will sit and train the data.”Fiasco’s intention to exhaust the potential of a particular place, as well as to embrace everything uncontrollable about recording outside in order to make his compositions more creative, brings to mind the French writing collective the Oulipo, or Workshop of Potential Literature. That group embraced constraint in writing as a means of inspiring creative freedom and would often work in situ as Fiasco does. It’s a group that the rapper knows well, assigning their literature to students in the course he teaches at MIT, as well as making it a part of the entry exam to his Society of Spoken Art (SOSA) guild of rappers.View image in fullscreenJacques Lipchitz – Birth of the Muses, one of the artworks used as inspiration.Photograph: MIT“One of the mandatory readings in my class is Raymond Queneau’s Exercises in Style, one of the leaders of the Oulipo school,” he told me. “And then also, one of the tests that people take to get into SOSA is A Void, the book that’s written without the letter ‘e’. So that same approach to heavily constrained writing is embedded in the process.”Ultimately, the Chicago rapper has big goals for his work with higher education. He wants to approach rap in a way akin to how linguists have approached the study of language, breaking it down into discrete chunks that can be analyzed, and putting it through formal rigor. One day, he’d love to see programs at prestigious universities make the sorts of things he’s pioneering as part of a whole hip-hop curriculum.“Maybe one day there will be a graduate program, and there’s a hip-hop degree, and I’m teaching the rap portion of it. The hope is that rap gets put into a space where people can take it and run with it in a very deep academic way. Maybe eventually you can become a tenured professor in the rap department at MIT.”Explore more on these topicsArtRapHip-hopMIT - Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Each of these required a baby wipe (or three or four), a cotton wool pad to pat dry and a nappy bag for disposal. With all of this destined for landfill, my baby’s carbon footprint was racking up months before she was even ready to take her first step.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Statisticsfrom the recycling charity Wrap estimate that 3bn disposable nappies are thrown away in the UK each year and that a baby could get through more than 4,500 before they’re potty trained.“Babies have small feet but big footprints. The best way to minimise this will always be the reusable option, where appropriate,” says Adam Herriott, a senior specialist at Wrap. “There are pros and cons on both sides of the nappy debate, but reusable nappies have the edge on disposables, which have a heavy carbon footprint linked to their production. Reusables naturally require washing, but limit the resources required, especially when line dried.”Planet-friendly choices don’t end at nappies either. Below are some of the best sustainable baby products, from wet wipes to clothes, I’ve tried with my now four-month-old – and couldn’t live without. I’ve also had, and included, recommendations from fellow parents, who have put each item through the daily grind of child rearing.The best eco-friendly baby productsNappiesView image in fullscreenMama Bamboobambooeconappies£9.99 for a pack of 24-35 at Mama Bamboo£10.30 for a pack of 24-35 at Big Green SmileCloth nappies have come a long way in recent years, but are still used by a small minority of the population. Disposables win out when it comes to convenience – an essential for time-poor and sleep-deprived parents who are on the go. There are eco-friendly options, but nappy recycling is limited in the UK: even if a nappy claims to be compostable or biodegradable, it’s likely to be incinerated or end up in landfill where it will take decades rather than months to break down.No disposable option is perfect, but it’s possible to reduce the environmental impact of its production, which accounts for about 63% of a nappy’s carbon footprint, according to aDefra-commissioned report. The Mama Bamboo bamboo eco nappies are 80% plant-based, and the B Corp is part of a carbon neutral offsetting scheme, making it Ethical Consumer’smost sustainable disposable nappy-maker. The nappies also work and fit well, and have remained leak-free throughout intensive testing.CACloth nappiesView image in fullscreenClose Pop-in All-In-Twoone-sizebambooreusablenappy£21.45 at CloseI started using cloth nappies in 2019 when my daughter was born, and I’ve used them for both of my kids, who are now six and two. I opted for them for the environmental impact that disposable nappies have, but they’ve also had so many benefits, including less nappy rash, no poo blowouts, and they look cute. I’ve tried several brands, including Little Lamb and Tots Bots, but I love the Close Pop-Ins for ease. My initial investment in nappies was £300 and I’ve probably spent another £200 on additional ones, but over two children, I’ve definitely saved money compared with solely using disposables.Charlotte Butterworth-Pool, LeedsMuslinsView image in fullscreenEtta Loves x Walala StudioShapesmuslin square£24 at John Lewis£24 at Etta LovesMy daughter is of the sicky variety, so a constant stream of muslins has become essential at all hours. Finding ones that are soft, absorbent without leaking through, and able to withstand constant washing has been something of a quest, but the ones from Etta Loves tick all the boxes. The B Corp’s muslins are made from 100% organic cotton, and each is finished in a sensory design that aids cognitive and visual development. They also double as a great distraction tool on a changing mat or draped over a pram.CABaby wipesView image in fullscreenCheeky reusable baby wipes kit£49.99 at CheekyMy sister recommended Cheeky Wipes back in 2018 when I was pregnant with my first child, and they’ve been amazing. They’re soft, reusable and cheap, and you can use them for just about anything. At first we used them just for nappies, but they’re ideal for weaning and wiping up and are a good alternative to wet wipes. I now have two children, and we still use them all the time; usually for wiping sticky faces or hands or in the bath, but I also use them for washing my face and taking off makeup. They’ve saved us loads of money over the past six years, and I love that it’s a small thing we can do to help the planet.Rebecca Goodman, CambridgeshireWeaning setView image in fullscreenDoddl baby to toddler feeding set£56.60 at DoddlSince I used the Doddl plate and bowl set, I’ve never looked back.

I started with the shampoo and wash when he was a newborn, and we’ve stuck with it ever since. It lathers well, rinses easily, is gentle on his skin, and leaves him smelling like a mix of honey, chamomile and that fresh baby scent you wish you could bottle up for ever.Monica Kranner, LondonNappy bagsView image in fullscreenEco by Naty nappy bags£1.59 for 50 at Boots£1.59 for 50 at AmazonIf I’m at home, I think nappy bags are completely unnecessary. Nappies go straight in the bin – just a normal bin, not a nappy bin, because they require more plastic and they don’t stop the smell! For when I’m out and about, though, the 100% compostable bags by Naty are the best eco ones I’ve used: they don’t rip, and hold up to having heavy nappies put in them. I only use them when I’m not near a changing room, because it’s just extra plastic otherwise.Larissa Hazell, EssexHairbrushView image in fullscreenKokoso Baby natural baby hairbrush£7.99 at Kokoso BabyAs well as being blessed with a dark brown mullet from birth, my daughter has had a side of cradle cap that we’ve tried to keep under control. Enter this baby hairbrush from Kokoso. Made from sustainably sourced beech wood and soft-yet-firm natural boar bristles, the brush is good for the planet and my daughter, gently removing the flakes while massaging her scalp in what has become a pre-bedtime ritual.CANappy creamView image in fullscreenNeal’s Yard Remedies baby barrier cream£8 for 50g at John Lewis£8 for 50g at Neal’s Yard RemediesAn early case of nappy rash has seen all sorts of ointments applied to my daughter’s behind, but a lot of the more intensive creams dried out her delicate skin as a scaly side-effect, and feature an ingredients list that will have you questioning. This barrier cream from Neal’s Yard has none of the nasties and manages to balance protection with moisturising, keeping the area soft, supple and irritation free.CABaby growsView image in fullscreenMori clever zip sleepsuit£32.50 at Mori£33 at John LewisSecondhand is the most sustainable approach to dressing your little one, and rather than buying one-off pieces, it’s possible to buy bundles of clothes on apps likeVintedfor a fraction of the cost of new, helping your bank balance and the environment.

It looks great, for a start, with the best of the blossom and everyone wreathed in bank holiday smiles. If you’re in the market for a little treat to celebrate, look no further. I’ve got the just-loose-enough new-season jeans and the snap-up-now holiday shoes.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Plus, a couple of bits that I’ve snuck in just because I love them and I think you will, too. Happy best month of the year, my friends.Jeans that will change your lifeView image in fullscreenLee Rider loose straightjeansFrom £75 at Lee£95 at AnthropologieI’m not going to sugar-coat this any longer, people.Jeansthat are at all clingy on your legs look dated now. This is not about trying to look younger; it’s about not looking as if you’re stuck in the past. If you make one change to your wardrobe in 2025, switching to a loose jean shape should be it. I have found the holy grail of jeans for grownups, which look cool but not ridiculous. Lee, which at 136 years old has almost as much heritage as that other denim brand beginning with L, has a Rider loose straight jean in quality rigid denim and a generous but not floppy silhouette. Gamechanger.A very classy frock for £72View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Alice YoungNavy blue cape maxidress£72 at NextThis dress is giving Roland Mouret. Or Roksanda. It has a covered-up drama that is very Claudia Winkleman on Strictly. One of my shopping bugbears is that most “occasion” dresses – party frocks, wedding guest outfits – seem to assume a temperature of about 24C, which does not track with most British weddings, in my experience. This maxidress from Next comes in black, but I’d get it in navy, olive or burgundy to make it most useful for daytime or evening.The holiday shoes you need to buy nowView image in fullscreenJelly slip-on ballet pumps£19.50 at M&SYes, I know it’s only May, but I’m worried these will sell out. The Row’s red jelly shoes, as worn by Jennifer Lawrence, are £860; these M&S jelly ballet pumps are £19.50. A jelly shoe is pure holiday nostalgia, but also practical – you can clean them under the tap and drop them in your basket bag. Get them now and you can slip them on for pottering around the garden while daydreaming about your hols. So much good stuff in M&S right now. I’m also close to pulling the trigger on thepure cotton halter neck midaxi beach dress (£39.50).A do-everything shirtView image in fullscreenStripe cotton shirt in blue£45 at John LewisOn the subject of holiday shopping, I’m seeing a whole lot of striped shirts being sold as “beach cover-ups”. I am all for the idea of a striped shirt as a beach cover-up, but I’m pretty sure you don’t need to buy a striped shirt specifically for this purpose. The striped shirt you already have in your wardrobe is perfect with jeans now (see number one, above) and – unbuttoned, with sleeves rolled up – on holiday, too. This blue John Lewis shirt is a great version if you are in the market for a classic.How to buy secondhand clothes online that you’ll actually wear – and the best sites to trawlRead moreThis summer’s White Lotus-inspired sunglassesView image in fullscreenWinnie sunglasses£30 at the White Company£29.95 at AmazonDo you remember the sunglasses Chloe wore on the boat … in the White Lotus series 3 episode where they go to the full moon party?

Lots of you were quite cross with me about this because gold-hoops-with-everything was a helpful style shortcut that took one decision off your morning to-do list. Sorry, but also not sorry, because I’m right, and also because, look at these! Adorable! Even if these aren’t your bag, I recommend a whiz through Zara jewellery at some point. It is always at the outsize and eccentric end of the spectrum, which felt wrong until recently, and now suddenly feels right.My perfect classic sandalsView image in fullscreenIkesia sandals£215 at Ancient Greek SandalsI’m going to Greece on holiday next month. I am SO excited. A Greek holiday calls for the perfect Greek sandals, which I believe to be these. They’re an investment buy – £215 – but just the right balance of chic and practicality. Ancient Greek Sandals are traditionally made in Greece in beautiful soft leather. I like a slingback – they stay on better – and I hate a toe hoop, which is a blister waiting to happen; but the brand has various shapes to suit what works for you. The Ikesias are available in black, tan and ivory.A blouse that does that effortless French thingView image in fullscreenBreah blouse£105 at SézaneI am a big fan of a blouse with a square neckline, which is a wearable way to show some skin without feeling exposed by lots of cleavage. You have to judge it right, though. I would avoid drawstrings or puff sleeves, which can tip it into tankard-of-beer-at-Oktoberfest territory, when the look we are aiming for is more café au lait in Paris. Sézane is a brand with a beautiful taste level. It just doesn’t make naff clothes. This Breah blouse, in guipure lace made from recycled polyester, has a vintage feel and elbow-length sleeves.A sparkly cape (much more useful than it sounds, I promise)View image in fullscreenSparkly knitted cape£108 at John Lewis£108 at JigsawThose of you old enough to remember the pashmina will understand the solid-gold usefulness of a piece that you can wear over a fancy outfit to keep a chill off, without killing the vibe. This cape has the spirit of the pashmina, crossed with 2025’s passion for knitwear that drapes around your shoulders. It could be the top half of a look all by itself, over a T-shirt and jeans. It can also be draped around your shoulders, like a shimmering stole, to take your party dress outside or after dark.A dress for which I offer no justification except: look how gorgeous it isView image in fullscreenEmbroidered fringed dress£79.99 at ZaraI try so hard to be practical and useful for you wonderful people, I really do. To recommend Sensible Buys. Sometimes, though, there are pieces I want and desire and crave even if I can’t pretend for a moment that I need them. I’m not going to make a logical case for this dress; I’m just putting it here because it’s gorgeous and unusual and affordable and maybe now and again, that’s enough.Explore more on these topicsFashionJess Cartner-Morley‘s editJeansWomen's shoesAccessoriesDressesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I recently broke up with someone who is fantastic in bed, and good at the fun stuff, but utterly incompatible with me as a partner. There was a lot of pain involved in finding this out.I’m considering dating again, but haven’t managed to stop having sex with this person – it’s the best sex I’ve ever had, and we have agreed to be friends with benefits. Should I stop? Will it impede my progress in moving on to potential new partners? I don’t have any desire to rekindle a deeper relationship, but don’t want to give up the fun bits that bring me so much pleasure and joy. I’ve never done anything like this before – uncharted territory for me.I’m 24 years old and embarrassed that I’ve never dated anyone. How do I meet a girl? | Leading questionsRead moreEleanor says:Lots of people will say this is a doomed endeavour, When Harry Met Sally-style, that it “never works”. I don’t think that’s right; I don’t think there’s a universal answer to the “should” question. But as you work out the answer, there are some factual dimensions worth paying attention to.First, you say this is the best sex of your life.Thus far.I don’t know how old you are, or (sorry), how “experienced”, so I don’t know whether this suggests it’s the best sex canbe. How much do you think the electricity of this connection is down to facts about your ex, which can’t be replicated, or facts about your relationship, which can? Like – was this your first really “grown” sexual connection, or the first time you could say what you liked, or the first relationship without jealousy or body hang-ups? If so, the fact that it surpasses everything might not tell you it’s the absolute peak.Second, you mentioned this might make it harder to find a new partner. Worth noting: it might make finding new sexual chemistry tricky, too. When your lust and exploration and imagination and intimacy get funnelled back towards your ex, there’s less of that stuff to push you forward into new connections. When you show up in those new connections, it might be as a version of you that doesn’t have as much impetus to make sure that sex is fun, communicative, attention consuming. A good way to turn sex bad is to approach it as an evaluative endeavour (let’s see what they’ve got) instead of a participatory one (let’s see what we can make).In the period with a new partner when you don’t know each other’s bodies, you might be apt to compare sex with them to sex with your ex. When that comparison happens contemporaneously instead of just in memory, that may make it harder to find – or make – chemistry with someone new.I want to start dating casually. How do I turn off the illogical, hopelessly romantic part of my brain? | Leading questionsRead moreLast, you may re-experience whatever dynamics led you to think this person isn’t for you. A dynamic is a mutual creation – aspects of your personalities bring things out of each other that you don’t like. Being in a romantic relationship can exacerbate those things, but there’s not usually a big red switch such that once you turn off the relationship, the parts of your personalities that abrade each other go away and you can instantly be great colleagues, or take a long road trip. The ways you each process disagreements, misrepresent one another, the things they value and the things you don’t – all the hurt of those dynamics can still come up between you when the interaction is just sexual. Only now, you don’t have the recourse of being in a relationship if you want to work on fixing those things. That risk might be worth it – but you might want to make sure you have some emotional armour.If the life goal is ever to be fully disentangled from this person, that will eventually mean in bed, too. Nothing about that means you have to stop the sex now. Breakups can be slow. Some of the intimacies you built survive long after the relationship ends. But it’s worth being alive to exactly what the cost is, before you decide to pay it.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsDatingLeading questionsRelationshipsAustralian lifestyleSexfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it because of prejudice, the problems the job poses for family life – or something else?Amelia GentlemanThu 1 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 15.25 EDTShareSometimes passengers congratulate Maria Pernia-Digings, 61, on her parking. When she tells me this, she tries to laugh it off as a tiny slight, barely worth commenting on. Others don’t bother to hide their shock, and greet her as they leave the plane with blunt amazement: “Oh, you’re a woman!”“It’s lovely. People are very supportive,” she says, before conceding she finds some of the feedback extremely trying. Remembering the last male passenger to compliment her on her parking, she says: “It is a bit sad, isn’t it, if he thinks that because I’m a woman, I can’t park?”She feels equally weary about the effusive support from some travellers, gushing phrases such as: “Girl power!” She wears a blueeasyJetpilot suit with four silver stripes on the cuffs, indicating her senior rank. “I don’t like to be made to feel different,” she says.But Pernia-Digingsisdifferent. Despite more than a decade of initiatives designed to increase the number of women flying planes, just 6.5% of pilots working for UK companies are women, and the number drops further for captains, such as Pernia-Digings, who has built up 16,000 hours of flight time since 1990.Gender pay gap research released last month by all airline companies revealed sluggish progress. The structure of most airlines has pilots and engineers, mostly men, at the top of the pay scale, and cabin crew, mostly women, at the bottom. At easyJet, women took home 53p for every pound that men earned, reflecting the fact that women make up just 12% of employees in the highest-paid quarter of the organisation’s staff and 73% of staff in the lowest-paid quarter. Women’s median bonus pay was 27.9% lower than their male colleagues’.All UK organisations with more than 250 staff have to report these figures, which reflect pay distribution in a company (rather than exposing employers for illegally paying women less than male colleagues in identical roles). For comparison, the Guardian this year reported a median gender pay gap of 6%; the Ministry of Defence 9%; Goldman Sachs Asset Management 29% (with women’s median bonus at the firm 59.5% lower than men’s).The pay gap is particularly stark in aviation. Ryanair has a median gender pay gap of 57.8% to easyJet’s 47.1%; BA CityFlyer has a gender pay gap of 39%, British Airways plc 27%, and Virgin Atlantic 28.4%. The variations can to some extent be explained by which companies outsource ground staff, or include management positions in separate, subsidiary organisations.View image in fullscreen‘It is a bit sad, isn’t it, if he thinks that because I’m a woman, I can’t park?’ ... Maria Pernia-Digings.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianWho cares if just 6.5% of the UK’s pilots are women? It’s a niche area of concern, but there is clearly a fundamental injustice in watching airline staff mostly turn left on entering the plane if they are male – and as a result earning considerably more than their mostly female colleagues who turn right to deal with safety announcements, food distribution, luggage and sick bags. Starting salaries for a first officer in the UK range between £30,000 and £60,000; for cabin crew the range is more likely to be between £14,000 and £28,000. Experienced captains can earn more than £150,000. Neither job requires A-levels.In easyJet’s training canteen at Gatwick, the divide is instantly visible: men in white shirts with epaulettes sit at tables in groups of two or three, stretching their legs, owning their space. The only women are crowded around one table, eight of them, accompanied by one man.“They’re the trainee cabin crew,” says Hannah Wells, a first officer and pilot training manager.There is something stubbornly retro about gender roles in this industry. Female doctors began tooutnumber their male peersin the UK for the first time this year, but preconceptions about what an airline pilot should look and sound like have not shifted.In an experiment conducted by easyJet, a group of seven-year-old children were asked to act out different occupations; the company noted that both girls and boys chose male names when playing the roles of an airline pilot and put on male voices to announce: “This is your captain speaking.”Pernia-Digings moved from Spain to England to learn to fly as a teenager, having been rejected from the Spanish air force, where she had hoped to become one of the country’s few female pilots. When she trained at a commercial flying school in Perth, Scotland, in the 1980s, there were just two other women studying alongside her in the group of 15.Four decades later, the ratio of male to female trainee pilots has barely shifted. Isabelle Lane, 21, a second officer who self-funded her initial pilot’s licence and has been completing her training with easyJet since January, says women were in the minority at her flying school too. “There were about three women out of 20 at the start, but the next month it might be three out of 16 or four out of 10; it was quite fluid,” she says.Under the stern eye of the easyJet press officer, she has nothing but positive things to say about her experiences so far; her male colleagues do not indulge in laddish banter and she will only note that people are still taken aback when she reveals her job. “It’s more a positive surprise when I tell people that I’m a pilot,” she says, speaking from the pilot’s seat in a simulator, where she is finishing her last training modules, before her first professional flying shift in a few days’ time.EasyJet’s campaign to address the pay gap has increased the proportion of female pilots to 7.5%, one percentage point higher than the national average. When I suggest this seems an underwhelming advance, Wells says 13% of the pilots being trained by easyJet are now women. When I wonder whether this isn’t also too low a figure to merit much celebration, she and colleagues stress things are improving. Pilots who have children can organise their shifts, they say, so that they get up super-early and do a couple of short haul flights to Europe, arriving home in time for the school pick-up. The press officer also says a lactation room has been opened in the Gatwick training centre (although it has yet to be used).View image in fullscreen‘Women don’t consider it as a career’ ... Hannah Wells.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianWells says she can’t remember ever going on holiday as a child on a flight captained by a woman; she only became interested in flying because her grandfather flew model planes, but she also notes her parents were unusually careful to avoid instilling gendered norms in their children. She studied engineering at Cambridge and worked for Jaguar Land Rover before retraining as pilot. (She says she found engineering less progressive than aviation.)“There aren’t any practical obstacles stopping women, it’s more that women don’t consider it. I think maybe schools don’t promote it as a career,” she says. She enjoys explaining to schoolchildren that you don’t need science A-levels and can apply to fly a plane with just five GCSEs at levels four and above. She hopes greater exposure will encourage more women into the industry.The film portrayals of male pilots and female cabin crew have a lot to answer for, Lane says, listing all the films she can think of about planes – Airplane!, Zero Hour! (which inspired Airplane!), Catch Me If You Can, Snakes on a Plane, Top Gun. In many of these, there’s a man who flies, and a woman who serves drinks, while occasionally panicking. The tropes go back decades. Benny Hill had sketches of a pilot chasing flight attendants in bunny outfits up and down the aisle.Airlines have historically leaned into these stereotypes in their marketing. For years, Virgin Atlantic built its brand on the back of hiring attractive flight attendants. (In2022, Richard Branson saidhe would no longer be lifting up scantily clad women to promote his airline, adding: “There’s no question that in the early days of Virgin, society was very different. I doubt you’ll see me turning girls upside down or picking up ladies today, whereas 38 years ago if I didn’t do that, I wouldn’t get in a newspaper.”) Most companies have modernised their uniforms and revised hair and makeup regulations, but it’s not totally clear that airlines have comprehensively moved on from the era when cabin crew were known as “trolley dollies”.In the US, where around 5-8% of commercial pilots are women, discussions about how to promote women and minority ethnic staff in aviation have bumped up against theTrump administration’s campaignto end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Just days after his inauguration, the president baselessly blamed DEI policies for a mid-air collision between a passenger jet and helicopterthat left 67 people dead. Defence secretary Pete Hegseth said: “The era of DEI is gone at the defence department and we need the best and brightest.” Transportation secretary Sean Duffy accused the previous administration of focusing on irrelevancies such as “changing the name from cockpit to flight deck”.Meanwhile, more than 15% of India’s pilots are women, a result of the country’s rapidly expanding aviation sector, rather than any initiative.View image in fullscreenIn a study, passengers and other pilots were found to have rated white men more highly than female and minority ethnic pilots.Photograph: UrbanImages/AlamyClearly, fundamental prejudices remain. Researchers at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in the US showed people pictures of male and female pilots of various races for a study in 2021, before asking them to rank how well they thought the pilots would perform. Participants – who were both passengers and other pilots – rated white men more highly than female and minority ethnic pilots.Although none of the female easyJet pilots I speak to will admit to having experienced any problems with sexism or harassment from colleagues, wider industry research suggests negative myths regarding female pilots’ skills and aptitude for flying remain rife. Structural obstacles have often been replaced by cultural barriers. A 2021 literature review (with the eye-roll-inducing title Aviation Culture: A “Glass Sky” forWomenPilots) reported enduring resentment among male staff, triggered by a conviction that women’s achievements in this sector had been achieved through quotas or favouritism or through “feminine beguilement”. Two-thirds of women surveyed felt they were treated differently because of their gender, and 40% felt their voices were not heard. The study also found that women find it harder than their male colleagues to remain in their jobs after having children.Most pilots self-fund their training, which can cost more than £100,000, before searching for jobs with commercial airlines, forcing students and their families into debt. There is a suggestion from researchers that women, who may take career breaks to have children, perhaps feel less willing to take on these loans.Karlene Petitt, who flew commercial flights for more than 30 years in the US, before retiring two years ago, found the requirement to combine work and parenting so challenging that she took a job training other pilots while her children were at school, to avoid being away from home six days at a stretch. She had felt silent disapproval from colleagues and parents at the school gates. “There’s still a stigma that if women do this, they’re not good mothers,” she says. Her male colleagues continued their careers uninterrupted.Pernia-Digings says a perception of male aviation heroes was cemented during the second world war and has yet to evolve. “The aircraft doesn’t know the gender of the pilot, but in a world where men were in charge, it takes time to change mentalities,” she says. She refuses to focus on the negative. “It’s a lovely job – seeing the Earth from above, the weather and clouds, watching the sunset and the sunrise, looking down on the mountains, the snow, the lakes, trying to differentiate between the cities. I think I get better views in my office than yours.”Explore more on these topicsWomenCareersAirline industryeasyJetGender pay gapGenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You decideFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorGeorgina LawtonThu 1 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 10.10 EDTShareThe prosecution: ElodieThe present was a caring gesture whether we liked it or not. Returning it was rude – Max should fess upI think my husband Max has committed a big social faux pas, but he disagrees. He returned a gift – a ceramic bowl – my sister Ruby bought us for our house-warming. Then I lied to her and said he smashed it by accident, and now I just feel bad about the whole thing.I think returning gifts, especially from family members, is ungracious, no matter how much you don’t like them. The bowl wasn’t our style: it was huge, with petals on the side and a kind of bogey-green. We wouldn’t have picked it ourselves. But that doesn’t mean it should go.Ruby didn’t just grab it at random, she chose it for us and that means something. But Max returned it to the shop without asking me. When I found out I laughed at first, but then I asked him why he couldn’t have hidden it in the spare room or something. He said: “We hate the bowl, I’ve got rid of it.” But I think that’s rude.I want Max to be aware that returning or re-gifting joint presents without asking me is not the way forwardWhen Ruby came round a month later she asked where we’d put it and I aid Max had smashed it when putting it on our bathroom shelf, because I didn’t want to out him. I thought it was kinder than saying, “Max hated it, so we returned it.”Not everything in a home needs to be perfectly curated. Sometimes quirky, offbeat things make a house feel lived-in and layered. Gifts hold emotion – returning them, even discreetly, erases that gesture. Before Ruby visited, we discussed what would happen if she asked about the bowl. Max didn’t care. He said, “Tell her the truth”, but I thought a white lie would be kinder.Now I feel bad about it. I think Max should come clean to my sister and explain why he returned it. But I also think returning gifts sets a bad precedent. It says we only accept things that fit a certain mould, and that kind of perfectionism can be isolating. It’s too late now, but I want Max to be aware that returning or re-gifting joint presents without asking me is not the way forward.The defence: MaxWe both hated it, so why should we feel obliged to keep an ugly gift? I wasn’t ungrateful – just practicalI understand that gift-giving comes from a good place, but I don’t think that means we’re obliged to hold on to something we’ll never use.The bowl Ruby gave us looked like it had melted in the kiln. It was an awful green colour, too big and its edges were like misshapen leaves. We’re decorating our new home and it’s a matter of aesthetic. Why should we have to keep something that doesn’t fit in? We genuinely didn’t have a place for it. Elodie agreed and also hated it, but I took the initiative to return it.Our space is carefully curated. I’m a graphic designer – I like mid-century design furniture and clean edges, and Elodie has similar taste to me. The bowl stuck out like a sore thumb.If we keep every gift out of obligation, we’ll end up living in a museum of other people’s tastes. I want our home to reflect who we areYou be the judge: My daughter pulled out of my birthday meal. Should she pay her share of the bill?Read moreI’m not ungrateful. I appreciate the thought and when Ruby gave it to us, I masked my feelings. Don’t we all have to admit that sometimes gifts miss the mark? I exchanged it for a grey pot that Elodie and I love and that has a place in our home. That feels as if I’m honouring the intention of the gift.Personally, I would have told Ruby about the return, but for some reason, Elodie panicked and lied when she asked. If I’d been there I would have come clean. I think it’s fine to say: “We didn’t love it but look what we got instead, thanks.” But Elodie just said I smashed the bowl because she thinks Ruby is sensitive and would rather hear that than the truth.All I did was get rid of the bowl we hated. I don’t think she needs to come clean now; it’s done. Ruby was upset for five minutes, but she got over it.If we keep every gift out of obligation, we’ll end up living in a museum of other people’s tastes. I want our home to reflect who we are. Anyone who brings us a present should respect our philosophy. That doesn’t make me rude, just practical.On reflection, I think I could have run the idea by Elodie before I went to the shop to exchange it, but I honestly didn’t think it would be this big an issue. However, as I look at our lovely pot, I have no regrets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

That’s unless you are sure this would cause offence – in which case, stick to the lie!Liz, 51Max should at least have asked Elodie before he returned the gift. It was from her sister, so they should have made the decision together. As it wasn’t a huge item, they could have kept it for sentimental purposes if Elodie felt strongly about it.Young-hee, 33Coming clean now seems pointless – the white lie is better than hurting Ruby’s feelings. But you should also make her aware that similar gifts are not needed in future! And Max should have talked to Elodie before returning the bowl.Gillian, 56Max should definitely have discussed this with Elodie before returning the gift, and he does come across as ungrateful and rude. But swapping it for something they like is better than hiding it away. It’s too late to tell Ruby now, but they should have been honest and hoped she didn’t take offence.Emma, 54I don’t think there’s anything to be gained from Max confessing at this point. But he should have kept the bowl in the first place – he and Elodie could then have had a good laugh about it.Jean, 44Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us who you think is in the wrong?The poll closes on Wednesday 7 May at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked ifRaheem should chip in to buy a lawnmowerfor the house17%of you said yes –Raheem is guilty83%of you said no –Raheem is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeRelationshipsFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Besides Provençal rosé (a column for another day), New Zealand sauvignon blanc has to be one of the most successfully marketed wines of the past century. This grape is, of course, planted around the world, and originally French, but it has become so wrapped up in the identity of New Zealand wine, and so at the forefront of our minds, that several people I know who have heard of New Zealand’s take didn’t know that sauvignon blanc also constitutes many appellation wines from the Loire and Bordeaux.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It was1973when the first sauvignon blanc vines were planted in Marlborough, and were initially intended to be blended with müller-thurgau, which at the time was one of the region’s more popular grape varieties. That’s almost unthinkable now, when Marlborough is by far the most famed region for sauvignon blanc, with about 25,000 hectares of vines, low rainfall and long, sunny days, as well as free-draining soil. In other words, ideal conditions for producing wine en masse.Today, New Zealand sauvignon blanc is one of – if notthe– most widely drunk white wines in the UK. It is, however, not that widely drunk within the industry itself, and some decorated wine enthusiasts can be a little snobby about it. I think that probably has something to do with the branding: a lot of New Zealand sauvignon blanc can taste rather similar, after all. But part of having a brand is that you’re easily recognised by the consumer, right? It’s also so often a person’s first foray into the world of wine, and that initial interest should always be encouraged.Marlborough sauvignon blanc is crisp, dry and, above all, intensely aromatic. When you think NZ SB, think green (asparagus, gooseberry, pea pod) and tropical fruit (passion fruit, melon). Its lightness and acidity makes it a drinking wine, rather than a thinking wine. You also know exactly what you’re getting when you open a bottle, in much the same way as you know what you’re getting every time you open a can of lager or order a bargain bucket from KFC.And Marlborough is just one of several regional styles. The country’s next biggest grower of sauvignon blanc is Hawke’s Bay, on North Island, and although it has only 1,000 hectares, it produces a more diverse range of styles, both riper and finer, than Marlborough. Next there’s Nelson, on the top of South Island, which I love for its elegant, poised chardonnay and pinot noir; its sauvignon is the same, but this is a more boutique region, so its wines tend to cost a little more than Marlborough.International Sauvignon Blanc Dayis being celebrated on 2 May, apparently, and we all need something to look forward to, so why not make it a whimsical, self-imposed wine holiday?Four New Zealand sauvignon blancs worth looking intoInviniti Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc 2023£10.50, The Wine Society, 12.5%. Classic, aromatic and limey. Exceedingly reliable.Babich Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc£13.50 Sainsburys, 13%.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The latest version of Sky’s Glass smart TV is faster and looks better than its predecessor and offers a level of all-in-one convenience that makes the satellite-free pay TV one of the best on the market.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Sky Glass gen 2 is a straight replacement for theoriginal model from 2021, which introduced Sky’s TV-over-broadband service that ditched the need for a satellite dish. The new TV comes in three sizes and you can buy the smallest 43in version for a one-off payment of £699 or £14 a month spread over four years, after which you own it.It requires a Sky subscription for full use, costing from £15 a month for the Sky Essential TV pack. You wouldn’t buy a Glass without the intention of using Sky, but should you want to ditch the subscription at a later date it willfunction as a basic smart TVwith access to streaming apps such as BBC iPlayer, plusa basic aerialand multiple HDMI inputs.View image in fullscreenThe gen 2 is available in a choice of three colours and comes with a colour-matched remote.Photograph: Sky UKFrom the front, the gen 2 model looks very similar to the original. It has the same monolithic design with an aluminium body, slim bezels, a soundbar hidden behind a colour-matched mesh at the bottom and voice control mics that respond to “Hello Sky”. Glass gen 2 is thinner and lighter than the outgoing model, though still heavy for a modern TV, weighing 14.7kg for the 43in version with the stand. The larger and heavier 55in and 65in models will require two people to safely manoeuvre them.A redesigned stand makes it a lot easier to set up, even at the 65in size as tested, with the TV simply slotting on to two prongs for a very stable mount without screws or tools required. It needs a power cable and wifi or Ethernet for internet. A wall bracket can be bought separately.View image in fullscreenThe TV is voice- and motion-activated, turning on and off when it detects presence, and displaying full-screen recommendations for the latest shows and films.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe crisp 4K LCD screen is noticeably brighter than its predecessor, with deeper blacks and much-reduced halo or blooming effect, which is the unwanted glow around the edges of bright spots such as white text on a black background. The screen has automatic brightness adjustment, which made things look a little too dark and grey in all but the brightest of rooms. Turning it off improved things.Sky has automatic picture optimisation modes that detect the content being watched, such as entertainment, sport and movies, plus manual vivid and extra vivid modes for those who like over-the-top colours. I found the entertainment mode made the picture too warm, with people looking a little orange, while sport was a bit grey for all but the brightest of match days.I preferred the movie setting, which is much more balanced, but there is also a custom mode for those who want to fully personalise the picture.The improved screen really comes to life with HDR films, shows and sport. The Premier League looks crisp and vibrant on Sky and TNT, while flicks such asFuriosa: A Mad Max Sagain Dolby Vision look particularly good. But the screen is not ideal for gaming with an Xbox or PS5, lacking the variable refresh rates of up to 120Hz that console gaming greatly benefits from.Big sound and great vocalsView image in fullscreenThe speakers fire out from the grille at the top of the TV and fabric strip below the screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianA big advantage of the Glass over normal TVs is the integrated seven-speaker soundbar, which blows other TV speakers away for power and clarity. Vocals are particularly clear at almost any volume and with none of thelip-sync issuesthat can plague external soundbars. Without a separate subwoofer or rear speakers, it does an admirable job of producing big and full sound.However, it struggles to produce really deep, booming bass, and while it has a nice wide sound, there isn’t much in the way of virtual surround effect. Both require a more complex system to achieve with more speakers.The TV also has night sound, speech enhancement and bass boost modes, the first of which proved very useful to avoid waking the rest of the house for late-night movies, by dampening loud noises while keeping the dialogue intelligible.Much-improved Sky over broadbandView image in fullscreenYou need a minimum of 25Mbps for HD or 30Mbps for UHD broadcast, but don’t have to have Sky’s broadband for it to work.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSince the original Glass’s launch in 2021, the Sky OS service powering it has dramatically improved. It still has excellent search and an improved playlist function, with more than one user profile so everyone in the house can have their own lists and recommendations, including child profiles.The playlist feature automatically keeps track of new episodes of shows and films you want to watch, regardless of which service they’re available from. It feeds into a recently added “continue watching” rail that helps you jump straight back into the content you were previously watching, which is all I needed about 75% of the time.Watching, pausing and rewinding live TV works great. Recentreductions to the broadcast delayfor sports have made a meaningful difference, preventing the irritating scenario where a friend watching on satellite or aerial a little ahead of you texts to brag about a goal before you’ve managed to actually see it.On-demand content from the Sky platform works really well, but a bigger improvement is in the third-party on-demand services such as BBC iPlayer, ITV X and Channel 4, on which you are reliant in place of recordings. It’s still not quite as fast and seamless as having local recordings, such as you might on Sky Q or other PVR, but most of the apps launch quicker, work better and will take you straight to the episode you want to watch from the playlist or search page.It supports most of the major on-demand services, including My5, YouTube, Prime Video, Disney+, Paramount+, Apple TV+ and Discovery+, for all your content in one place.View image in fullscreenVoice control works well through the button on the remote, but the TV’s wake word is a little temperamental, working properly or understanding me about 60% of the time.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSustainabilityThe television isrepairable apart from the screen. It contains 22% recycled material, including aluminium, fabric, tin and plastic. The company will recycle its old products and ships the TV in plastic-free packaging.PriceSky Glass gen 2 costs£699at 43in, £949 at 55in or £1,199 at 65in, with 24- or 48-month interest-free payment plans available for all models with a £20 upfront cost.On 24-month contracts, Sky Essential TV costs from £15 a month, Sky Ultimate TV from £22 a month, and UHD + Dolby Atmos costs an additional £6, as does the ability to skip ads. Other add-ons include Sky Sports from £31 a month, TNT Sport from £31 a month, Sky Cinema from £13 a month and Sky Kids at £8 a month. Some discounts are available for certain combinations, while all the packages can be bought on a 31-day basis at different prices.VerdictThe first-generation Glass required work when it launched, to the television screen and the Sky streaming service powering it. The gen 2 model rights many of the wrongs of its predecessor.It is brighter, faster, has higher contrast and handles highlights far better. It is also easily the best-sounding TV available. It competes fairly well in the mid-range market but you can certainly buy a better-looking screen for similar money without a soundbar; those looking for the absolute best picture should look elsewhere.The Sky OS service has greatly improved to a level that rivals the best in the business. Live broadcast works just as it might over satellite or aerial. On-demand content from the Sky platform is as good as local recordings while the third-party apps such as BBC iPlayer and ITVX have levelled up to at least an acceptable standard. The playlist and search with support for all the major streaming services are the killer features, removing the burden of remembering which of the plethora of services hosts the content you want to watch.Above all, it is the level of convenience offered by the Glass gen 2, of an all-in one solution with solid sound and a single remote for all your TV needs, that is the major appeal.Pros:all-in-one streaming and pay TV device, great sound, no satellite/cable or aerial needed, good remote, excellent search and playlist functions, improved apps, improved picture and good HDR, custom picture modes, optional motion-sensing and voice control.Cons:better picture available for less from competitors, some picture modes and automatic brightness control aren’t great, no fast refresh rate for game consoles, thick and heavy, no Chromecast support, some third-party catchup/on-demand services still aren’t great.View image in fullscreenThe power and a mic mute button are in the right side of the TV.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsTelevisionSky (Business)Sky (Media)GadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

So many things are getting disrupted’Pittsburgh residents, workers and business owners react to the increasingly fraught trading reality now upending supply chains and hitting pricesHeather Stewartin PittsburghThu 1 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 12.28 EDTShare“In a lot of ways it feels like Covid 2.0. So many things are getting disrupted so quickly.” Like so many businesses across Donald Trump’s America, Matt Katase’s craft brewery, Brew Gentlemen, is having to contend with a bafflingly uncertain trading environment.The brewery’s chief operating officer, Alaina Webber, says: “For the first time, as a company in operation going on 15 years, we’ve started to get explicit emails that say: ‘On this existing order, you are now going to see a 30%, then to a 130% increase.’”The brewery is based in Braddock, in the Allegheny valley, in the eastern suburbs of Pittsburgh, where the Scots-born industrialist Andrew Carnegie opened his first steel mill about 150 years ago, founding an industry that underpinned the industrialisation of America.Today, the vast mill is still in operation, but the tariffs Trump claims will restore the glory of rust-belt towns such as this have inflicted chaos on thousands of firms across the region.Anything imported carries a 10% levy; steel and aluminium, 25%; Chinese products, 145%. And much higher “reciprocal” tariffs on many other countries hang in the balance.For Brew Gentlemen, the tariffs even threaten a consignment of bespoke Chinese-made beer tap handles, which are waiting at the docks while it negotiates the price with their supplier. “Those are now sitting in customs and they’ll sit there for quite a while,” says Webber.The brewery had to transform rapidly during the Covid pandemic, switching from selling beer to locals in its taproom to focusing 100% on manufacturing.View image in fullscreenBrew Gentlemen co-owners Alaina Webber and Matt Katase.Photograph: Stephanie Strasburg/The GuardianNow, just as it hoped for a “normal” year, the cost of many of the inputs to the brewing process is in flux.“You can’t instantly start growing New Zealand hops in America,” says Katase, its co-founder. “We use a lot of American hops, but then we have beers that use Australian or New Zealand hops and we have malt that comes from Canada. If you’re trying to make a traditional German lager, yeah, you kind of need German malt.”At the other end of town, outside the vast Edgar Thomson steel mill, workers gathered in a union social hall are reluctant to chat.One man says he and his mates are divided about the merits of the long-running takeover battle for the plant’s owner US Steel, by Japan’s Nippon Steel. “That’s a tricky subject,” he says.But he holds out hope that Trump’s tariffs will bring change to towns like this, where shops are shuttered and many of the clapboard houses have broken windows. “I think they might work, because we have been taking a beating lately,” the steelworker says. “America’s been robbed and abused and I think it’s time that we start taking care of our own, and they start taking care of theirs.”The international president of the Pittsburgh-based United Steelworkers union, David McCall, has praised Trump’s tariffs, calling them “a crucial means of reining in bad actors who view access to the US market as a right, not a privilege.”At the nearby headquarters of the Steel Valley Authority, which has been supporting businesses in this region for decades, its veteran executive director Tom Croft is more sceptical.“What we’re hearing is there’s just a lot of uncertainty. The prices are the big thing, and the supply chain of products,” he says. “Right now, it’s too early to tell, but people are thinking it’s very much like the Covid shutdown.”He doesn’t object to the idea of targeted tariffs as part of a wider industrial policy, but he says: “The way they’re going about it has made a lot of the smaller manufacturers and managers wonder what the hell they’re going to do.”Joe Biden maintained the tariffs on China that Trump imposed in his first term, and was preparing to intervene to block the Nippon deal. Trump backed the takeover during the campaign but recently suggested he didn’t want US Steel to “go to Japan”.Debate is raging in the once mighty industrial city of Pittsburgh, which has transformed itself in recent decades to specialise in “eds and meds” – education and medicine.View image in fullscreenDoug Croft, standing centre-left, and Nick Kirk, seated centre-right, outside La Prima Espresso in the Strip District of Pittsburgh.Photograph: Stephanie Strasburg/The GuardianOutside La Prima Espresso Company in the city’s Strip District, where warehouses are slowly being transformed into swanky flats, a row breaks out among the older men gathered to play cards when they are asked about Trump’s policies.One gestures to his head, suggesting the president is “not good on the second floor”, while another storms off.Nick Kirk, who owns a local trucking firm and wears a red tie to show his support for Trump, says: “Everybody thinks it has to be done likethis,” clicking his fingers. “In your own personal life, nothing gets done that fast.”Not far away, Joy Lu, the manager of an Asian supermarket, Lotus Food, is struggling to keep up with the price hikes on Chinese imports.“For example, fresh noodles, they already increased in price,” she says. “Before we sell for $6.99 and then they increased to $7.99 and now it’s $8.49.”She says her suppliers have so far been able to forestall price rises on some products, by stocking up in advance. “Dry goods, they have a lot of inventory, maybe they have like six months’ inventory. Their price doesn’t go up so fast.”Asked about the possibility of shortages as the tariffs continue to bite, she says one supplier has already started limiting orders. “It’s five cases per customer, not like before when we can order as many as we want.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He concedes he has had to put up the price of some biscuits, because of the 10% across-the-board tariff; and if the EU faces the 20% “reciprocal” rate when Trump’s 90-day “pause” ends in July, there could be more to come.He says he had had emails from his Italian suppliers the day before the pause, saying they were already anticipating the increase. “They were increasing their inventory cost price.”However, he insists he’s not worried. “I don’t think it’s gonna happen. I think it’s all negotiating tactics,” he says. “It’s the art of the deal. I believe in Donald Trump.”View image in fullscreenBill Sunseri, president of the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company.Photograph: Stephanie Strasburg/The GuardianEven for businesses that seem a world away from Pittsburgh’s mom and pop stores and the craft brewers, aspects of Trump’s policies are giving pause for thought.Astrobotic is the kind of hi-tech private-sector business that symbolises the Steel City’s hopes for the future. It builds lunar landers, and is preparing for a planned mission by the end of the year.Its founder and chief executive, John Thornton, says the tariffs will barely affect it, as the cost of the tech on the complex vehicles far outweighs the price of materials. Yet he is still having to keep an eye on the Trump administration’s pronouncements because Nasa is his biggest customer.“We’re watching very closely what the policy is around space. We saw in the confirmation hearing of Jared Isaacman, who’s going to be the next Nasa boss, that they’re talking about the moon and Mars still, which is good,” he says.But he adds that much of its funding comes out of the science budget – parts of which Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” appears determined to cut.“Our primary programme, called Commercial Lunar Payload Services, comes out of the science programme. So if there is a significant cut there, that could be a problem for us.”On Carnegie Mellon University’s leafy campus, Lee Branstetter, a professor of economics , says the jarring uncertainty facing every business owner is a powerful force pressing down on the economy, and wonders what impact Trump’s deep cuts to research budgets will have on his students’ future.View image in fullscreenJohn Thornton, the CEO of the aerospace company Astrobotic Technology.Photograph: Stephanie Strasburg/The Guardian“I think it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that at the apex of the federal government, we have a bunch of people who have no idea what they’re doing,” he says. He points out steel employs about 31,000 people in Pennsylvania, while health and education account for 1.3m jobs.“As a business, how do you decide how to invest? When you don’t know if the tariffs facing the products that you’re planning to import from a particular country are going to be 60% or 10% or 5%,” he says. “I think the answer is you try not to make a decision for as long as you can.“The consequence, of course, of deferring decisions as long as possible means that the pace of investment dramatically slows.”These firms will also pause hiring plans, he suggests – while anxious consumers tighten their belts. “It seems like simply as a consequence of this spike in policy uncertainty, we’re likely to see a significant macroeconomic slowdown in the US and perhaps beyond.”There is little sign as yet of that uncertainty being resolved. Trump’s Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has repeatedly claimed a string of trade deals are close, but the president did not seem to be in negotiating mood last week when he described theUS economyas a “giant, beautiful store” in which “I set the prices”.For the moment, real prices, outside Trump’s head, are anything but set – and as firms across the US rethink their supply chains on the hoof, it is far from clear how long the shelves of the “giant, beautiful store” can remain fully stocked.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS economyUS small businessTariffsInternational tradeGlobal economyEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The action ends exemptions granted to certain countries and increases the duty rate on both metals to 25% (the duty on aluminum was previously 10%).What Trump said:Trump’s top trade adviser,Peter Navarro, said the tariffs were not just about trade. “It’s about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum,” he said.Whatto know:The changes are not due to come into effect until 12 March, raising the prospect the administration will broker deals with governments seeking reprieve.Read moreCreation of a sovereign wealth fundThe order:Trump ordered the US treasury and commerce department to create asovereign wealth fundon 3 February. Such a fund, which requires congressional approval, would act as an investment fund for the country, operating outside the Federal Reserve and the treasury department.Trump offered few details about the fund, including where the cash would come from.

It’s doing us no good.”Read the full storyExpanding Elon Musk’s ‘department of government efficiency’The order:Trump signed an order on 26 February expanding the power of Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency.” It calls for a“transformation” in federal spending on contracts, grants and loans by requiring a centralized payment system – an initiative that would be monitored by Musk’s team.What Trump said:“This order commences a transformation in Federal spending on contracts, grants, and loans to ensure Government spending is transparent and Government employees are accountable to the American public,” the order states.What it means:The order is part of a much broader effort by the White House to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce.Read the full storyReviewing regulations at all agenciesThe order:Trump instructed the heads of every agency to undertake a review of all regulations on 19 February, working with members ofElon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency.” It also targets a number of advisory committees and agencies for elimination.What Trump said:Any regulations that are deemed inconsistent with the administration’s policies will be rescinded or modified, the order said.What it means:The action aims to bolster Musk’s sweeping government-slashing effort, which is facing numerous court challenges over its lawfulness, and Trump’s broader campaign to assert control over independent executive agencies.Read moreEnding ‘anti-Christian bias’The order:Trump signed an executive order on 7 February attempting to eliminate “anti-Christian bias” in the US government. The president announced the formation of a taskforce, led by Bondi, to end all forms of “anti-Christian targeting and discrimination” in the government.What Trump said:Trump said Bondi would work to “fully prosecute anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society and to move heaven and earth to defend the rights of Christians and religious believers nationwide”.What it means:The order is meant to reverse alleged targeting of “peaceful Christians” under Biden. Critics say it changes the traditional understanding of religious liberty, with Americans United for Separation of Church and State saying in a statement that Trump’s taskforce would “misuse religious freedom to justify bigotry, discrimination and the subversion of our civil rights laws”.Read moreReview of disaster agency FemaThe order:Trump ordered a review of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) on 27 January, the disaster response agency, and suggested there is “political bias” in the agency.

(Biden rescinded the order.)Key aides to Trump have called for mass government firings.Project 2025made attacks on the deep or administrative state a core part of Trump’s second term. The rightwing playbook called for civil servants deemed politically unreliable to be fired and replaced by conservatives.Read moreGlobal alliancesICC sanctionsThe order:Trump signed an order on 6 February authorizing economic sanctions on the international criminal court (ICC), accusing the body of “improperly targeting” the United States and its allies, such as Israel.What Trump said:Trump has been a vocal critic of the ICC and said the court had “abused its power” in issuing warrants forBenjamin Netanyahuand his former defense minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes. “This malign conduct in turn threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States government and our allies, including Israel,” Trump said.What it means:The order grants Trump broad powers to impose asset freezes and travel bans against ICC staff and their family members if the US determines that they are involved in efforts to investigate or prosecute citizens of the US and certain allies.Read moreEnding Unrwa fundingThe order:Trump signed an executive order on 4 February stopping funding for Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, and withdrawing US from the UN human rights council.What Trump said:The president criticized the entire United Nations as “not being well run” and “not doing the job”.What to know:In his first term, Trump cut Unrwa funding and withdrew from the UN’s human rights council.

It’s part of a push to offset China’s sweeping control of the critical minerals industry.What Trump said:“We want the US to get ahead of China in this resource space under the ocean, on the ocean bottom,” a Trump official said.What it means:The order is Trump’s latest attempt to boost US production of nickel, copper and other critical minerals used widely across the economy.Read the full storyTaking aim at city- and state-led fossil fuel accountability effortsThe order:Trump signed an executive order on 8 April instructing the Department of Justice to “stop the enforcement” of state climate laws, which his administration has suggested are unconstitutional or otherwise unenforceable.What Trump said:“These State laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration’s objective to unleash American energy,” the executive order says. “They should not stand.”Read the full storyFour orders aimed at revitalizing the coal industryThe orders:Trump signed four executive orders on 8 April aimed at reviving the coal industry in the US. He used his emergency authority to allow some older coal-fired power plants scheduled for retirement to keep producing electricity, something the White House said is needed to meet increased energy demands from growth in datacenters, artificial intelligence and electric cars.What Trump said:The order “slashes unnecessary regulations that targeted the beautiful, clean coal”.What it means:Coalis the dirtiest fossil fuel and its usage has long been in decline.Read the full storyExpanding tree-cutting on public landsThe order:Trump has ordered an expansion on 3 March in tree-cutting across 280m acres (113m hectares) of national forests and other public lands.What Trump said:The order calls for reversing “heavy-handed federal policies” and increasing “domestic timber production to protect our national and economic security”.What it means:The order evades rules to protect endangered species and raises the prospect of chainsaws razing some of the most ecologically important trees in the US.Read the full storyDeclaring a national energy emergency to ‘unleash’ oil production in AlaskaThe order:Trump declared a national energy emergency on 20 January as part of a barrage of pro-fossil fuel actions and efforts to “unleash” already booming US energy production that included also rolling back restrictions in drilling in Alaska and undoing a pause on gas exports.What Trump said:The order means “you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem and we do have that kind of emergency”, Trump said. The order also says it is US policy for the country to “fully avail itself of Alaska’s vast lands and resources”.What it means:The declaration would allow his administration to fast-track permits for new fossil fuel infrastructure. It is likely that the order, part of a broader effort to roll back climate policy, will face legal challenges.Read moreRevoking electric vehicle targetsThe order:Trump revoked a non-binding executive order on 20 January signed by Biden aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric.What Trump said:“The United States will not sabotage our own industries while China pollutes with impunity,” Trump said.What it means:Part of an effort to repeal Biden’s environmental protections, Trump has also promised to roll back auto pollution standards finalized by Biden’s administration last spring.Read moreEverything elseLowering the cost of prescription drug pricesThe order:Trump signed a wide-ranging executive action on 15 April aimed at lowering prescription drug prices.What it means:Trump directed his health department to work with Congress on revamping a law that allows Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, seeking to introduce a change the pharmaceutical industry has lobbied for.Read the full storyExtending the TikTok deadlineThe order:Trump signed an executive order on 4 April to extend the TikTok ban deadline.What Trump said:The TikTok deal “requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed”, Trump said on Truth Social.What it means:This was the second time the president delayed the ban or sale of TikTok. The move punts the deadline to 75 days from 4 April.Read the full storyRequiring truck drivers to speak EnglishThe order:Trump signed an order on 28 April requiring commercial truck drivers to read and speak English.What Trump said:“They should be able to read and understand traffic signs, communicate with traffic safety, border patrol, agricultural checkpoints, and cargo weight-limit station officers,” the order said. “This is common sense.”What it means:Trump issued an order in March makingEnglish the official languageof the United States.Modernizing the payment system at the US treasuryThe order:Trump signed an executive order on 25 March to modernize the payment system at the US treasury.What it means:The order is meant to reduce potential fraud and abuse. It calls for accepting electronic payments whenever possible instead of physical checks.Barring some access to student loan forgivenessThe order:Trumpsignedan executive order barring government and non-profit employees from a student loan forgiveness program if they engage in “improper activities”.What it means:The order would disqualify workers at non-profit groups deemed to have engaged in certain activities from accessing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. That includes people whose work is tied to illegal immigration, foreign terrorist groups or other illegal activity. It’s likely to face legal challenges.Making English the official language of the USThe order:Trump signed an order on 1 Marchmaking English the official language of the United States.What Trump said:“Establishing English as the official language will not only streamline communication but also reinforce shared national values, and create a more cohesive and efficient society,” the order said.What it means:The US previously did not have an official language at the federal language. Hundreds of languages of are spoken across country, with English the most common. The order allows government agencies and organizations that receive federal funding to choose whether to continue to offer documents and services in languages other than English.Read the full storyAttempting to impose healthcare price transparencyThe order:Trump signed an executive order on 25 February attempting to impose price transparency on healthcare costs. The rule requires hospitals to publish online the prices for some of their most common services.What Trump said:“You’re not allowed to even talk about it when you’re going to a hospital or see a doctor. And this allows you to go out and talk about it,” Trump said while signing the order. “It’s been unpopular in some circles because people make less money, but it’s great for the patient.”What it means:Trump previously issued a similar order in 2019, but hospitals and insurers strongly opposed the rule, with many failing to comply.Expanding IVF accessThe order:Trump has signed an executive order on 18 February to expand access toin vitro fertilization (IVF). It directs the domestic policy council to make recommendations to “aggressively” reduce the costs for accessing IVF, according to a White House fact sheet.What Trump said:“It is the policy of my administration to ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable,” a White House fact sheet reads.What to know:The order does not directly change any policy and does not, on its own, fulfill Trump’s campaign pledge to make the government or insurance companies cover IVF.Read moreBanning ‘forced’ use of paper strawsThe order:Trump signed an executive order on 10 February ending the“procurement and forced use of paper straws”. It calls for government agencies to stop buying paper straws and to create a strategy to eliminate them across the country.What Trump said:Trump, who sold branded plastic straws on the campaign trail last year, said paper straws don’t work. “These things don’t work,” he said, referring to paper straws. “I’ve had them many times, and on occasion, they break, they explode.”Whatto know:In 2024, the Biden administration announced that it would gradually phase out single-use plastics from federal operations by 2035.Read moreBanning trans athletes from women’s sportsThe order:Trump signed an executive order on 5 Februarybanning transgender athletes from participating in women’s sport.

Trump also signed orders defining sex as “only male or female” and banning gender transitions for peopleunder the age of 19.Read moreGender-affirming careThe order:Trump signed an order on 28 January that attempts to end gender transitions for people under 19.What Trump said:“It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘transition’ of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,”readsthe order.What it means:The order directs that federally run insurance programs, including Tricare for military families and Medicaid, exclude coverage for such care. The order calls on the Department of Justice to vigorously pursue litigation and legislation to oppose the practice.Read moreDeclassifying MLK and JFK filesThe order:On 23 JanuaryTrump ordered the release of thousands of classified documents on the assassinations of John F Kennedy, Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.What Trump said:“The federal government has not released to the public all of its records related to those events. Their families and the American people deserve transparency and truth. It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay,” theordersaid.What it means:Trump made this promise during the election campaign and made a similar pledge in his first term, but ultimately heeded appeals from the CIA and FBI to withhold some documents.Read moreRenaming the Gulf of MexicoThe order:On 20 January Trump ordered two name changes: theGulf of Mexicoand Alaska’s Mount Denali.What Trump said:“President Trump is bringing common sense to government and renewing the pillars of American Civilization,” the executive order said in part.What it means:Trump ordered the Gulf of Mexico to be renamed the “Gulf of America” and will rechristen Alaska’s Mount Denali as Mount McKinley.It will have no bearing on what names are used internationally.Read moreCreating a policy recognizing only two gendersThe order:Trump signed an order on 20 January to remove “gender ideology guidance” from federal government communication, policies and forms. The order makes it official policy that there are “only two genders, male and female”.What Trump said:“Agencies will cease pretending that men can be women and women can be men when enforcing laws that protect against sex discrimination,” the order states.What it means:The order reverses a Biden-era executive action on the acceptance of gender identity.Read moreRescinding 78 Biden-era executive actionsThe order:Trump ordered78 Biden-era executive actionsto be rescinded on 20 January, including at least a dozen measures supporting racial equity and combating discrimination against gay and transgender people.What Trump said:“I’ll revoke nearly 80 destructive and radical executive actions of the previous administration,” Trump told a crowd in Washington after his inaugural speech. He also said he would end policy “trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life” and push for a “color blind and merit-based” society.What it means:The orders signal a reversal of Biden-era policy that prioritized implementing diversity measures across the federal government. Trump repealed orders signed by Biden advancing racial equity for underserved communities and the aforementioned order combating discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreementThe order:Trump issued an executive action on 20 Januarywithdrawing the US from the 2015 Paris agreement, along with a letter informing the United Nations of the decision.What Trump said:“I am immediately withdrawing from the unfair, one-sided Paris Climate Accord rip-off” Trump said during a rally at the Capital One Arena. In his inaugural speech, Trump said he would use executive action to “end the Green New Deal”.What it means:In 2017, Trump exited the Paris agreement. Upon taking office in 2021, Biden rejoined. Monday’s order makes good on a Trump election promise to withdraw from the 2015 global treaty seeking to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.Exiting the Paris agreement is part of Trump’s broader efforts to roll back climate protections and policy. Trump has described Biden’s efforts to grow the US’s clean energy sector as “the green new scam”.Read morePausing the TikTok banThe order:Trumpsigned an executive orderon 20 January temporarily delaying the enforcement of a federal ban on TikTok for at least 75 days.What Trump said:“I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok that I didn’t have originally,” Trump said at the White House, as he signed executive orders, according to theNew York Times.What it means:Trump ordered his attorney general to not enforce the law requiring TikTok’s sale. Trump says the pause allows for time to chart an “appropriate course forward” to protect national security and not abruptly shut down the popular app. In his first term, Trump favored a TikTok ban, but has since changed his position due to factors including his own popularity on the app.Read moreExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationTrump's first 100 daysDonald TrumpUS politicsUS foreign policyUS domestic policyUS immigrationTikToknewsShareReuse this content"

Brick-red homes and tin-roof shacks cling to the mountainside, their bases resting on black sand and dark mud. Below, the Río Minero weaves through the valley, its waters tainted by the silt and debris of continuous excavation.The region’s natural beauty is marred by scattered waste and discarded mining materials, evidence of an industry that supports the town’s economy – but also harms its environment.Muzo, known by local people as the emerald capital of the world, has been at the centre of Colombia’s tumultuous, profitable and frequently perilous trade in the precious stones for decades.View image in fullscreenAn open-pit mine creates a deep scar in the landscape in Muzo.Photograph: andresbo/The GuardianColombia isa global leader in emerald production. According to Colombian authorities, it is the world’s largest producer and reportedlyaccounts for 55% of the global market. Muzo’s emeralds are highly prized for their quality and intense colour, generating approximately$150m (£113m) in annual sales.Yet, the valleys surrounding Muzo are grappling with the environmental cost of mining: polluted water and dangerous erosion. In a region exploited by authorised mining companies and informal operators, the two parties blame one another.Informal emerald mining is widely practised by local people in search of a livelihood. By the river, older men and women wade knee-deep in the water, their shovels driving into the sand in search of the green gems. This type of mining is known locally asguaquería, which typically entails sifting through the leftover soil and debris that mining companies leave behind.View image in fullscreenGuaqueros search through earth discarded by companies, hoping to find a gem that may lift them out of poverty.Photograph: andresbo/The Guardian“We toil with the hope of discovering an emerald during our journey or amid the land supplied by the companies,” says María (not her real name), aguaquerawho lives in Muzo. “That’s how we make a living.”Manyguaquerosrely ona traditional event called“lavoladora”, during which, several times a month, a small, caged corridor is filled with discarded mining debris that people rush to sift through in search of hidden gems. “It’s unregulated work,” María says.View image in fullscreenPeople run through La Voladora, a cage where Esmeraldas Mining Services deposits discarded soil, to search for emeralds at Las Animas River in Muzo, 19 June 2024.Photograph: Luis Acosta/AFP/Getty ImagesStill, researchers suggest that blaming environmental devastation exclusively on theguaquerosmight be a mistake. Quantifying the damage is challenging due to a lack of data, but a2018 study from El Bosque Universityin Bogotá found that 29% of the environmental burden of industrial emerald extraction is down to deforestation, while the use of explosives accounts for about 22%.Deforestation and use of explosives are widespread among mining companies.“Compared with other types of mining, underground mining in general does not generate much impact,” says Roger Buitrago, the manager for health, security and environment at the Puerto Arturo mine in Muzo, run by the Colombian companyEsmeraldas Mining Services (EMS). “Our main [environmental] impacts are basically deforestation and water management.”Relentless extraction has transformed Muzo’s landscape. Along the riverbanks, hollowed-out pits dot the hillsides, and improvised tunnels extend into the dark rock – signs of artisanal mining. Further uphill, industrial-scale mining carves a path through the rolling mountains across the valley.Local people say the most evident effect of mining – whether industrial or subsistence – is the pollution of their rivers.View image in fullscreenOnce companies fence off an area, access is prohibited for local residents.Photograph: andresbo/The GuardianA 2020study led by the Pontifical Javeriana University revealed alarming pollutionlevels in local water bodies, including the Ítoco River and Las Ánimas creek. This contamination stems mainly from the unregulated disposal of mining byproducts and the authorities’ neglect of the problem.Studies indicate that water pollution in Muzo mainly arises from sediment runoff, explosive residues, and potential mining-related hydrocarbon leaks. Although modern operations tend to avoid harsh chemicals, it is likely that past practices degraded water quality through waste disposal and the use of explosives.We as guaqueros do a lot of damage to the environment, we generate a lot of wasteMariá, informal minerBuitrago says that local rivers are “very polluted”. Yet, Colombia’s national emerald federation –Fedesmeraldas– claims the industry is mindful of its environmental obligations, as companies “must operate under strict mining and environmental standards”.“Formal mining in Muzo demonstrates that it is possible to extract high-value resources such as emeralds in a sustainable way, when environmental standards are respected and the wellbeing of communities and ecosystems is prioritised,” Óscar Baquero, president of Fedesmeraldas, said in a statement. “This approach contributes to a greener and more inclusive economy in Colombia.”View image in fullscreenThe river that runs through Muzo’s mining zone in Boyacá shows high pollution levels. Oil, fuel, and mining sediments contaminate its waters, according to reports from former miners and local residents.Photograph: andresbo/The GuardianBaquero and Buitrago identify guaqueros as the leading cause of contamination in the region. “Informal or illegal mining has a major negative impact on the environment and on the people who carry out the activity, as they do not have environmental impact studies nor management plans, and do not avoid, mitigate or compensate for the effects of their activity,” Baquero adds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She spent two years in the sorting room, filtering through rocks and soil looking for emeralds. She alleges the mine mismanaged wastewater, dumping it into local streams.“I saw that there was a lack of filtration to treat the water that came out of the mine. The water came out of the mine and went through a tank. We used that water to wash the earth that contained emeralds, and it was poured into the stream,” she says.View image in fullscreenThe mining companies insist they treat their waste properly.Photograph: andresbo/The GuardianBuitrago denies this. “We have our duly authorised disposal points and have domestic wastewater treatment plants which are approved and authorised to be able to carry this out,” he says, adding that the company performs weekly and monthly internal checks, with external reviews every six months.Local people have also accused the mining companies of deliberately shutting off their water treatment facilities when checks on operations are not being carried out, and as a cost-cutting measure.The Guardian was unable to verify such allegations independently.Almost 200 people killed last year trying to defend the environment, report findsRead moreThe Guardian visited the mine but was denied access to the treatment facilities and mining operations and photography at the site was not permitted.As illegal mining persists, usually with little oversight or environmental protection measures, guaqueros acknowledge their part in it. “We as guaqueros do a lot of damage to the environment, we generate a lot of waste,” María says. “As we don’t have anyone to regulate us, we don’t mind throwing plastics, tarps, lids and other things that end up in the river.”While the responsibility for environmental destruction is disputed, the devastation is undeniable, as Muzo’s emerald industry has contributed to deforestation and soil erosion. Demand for new mining sites has resulted in forests being cleared, and tunnel digging destabilises the land.View image in fullscreenMuzo in Boyacá is one of Colombia’s most important mining regions.Photograph: andresbo/The GuardianA2024 report from the National University of Colombia stated thatunderground excavation causes soil cracking, allowing surface water to seep into aquifers, which decreases water availability, destabilises the land and raises the risk of landslides.Residents say such incidents are becoming increasingly common. On 5 April,two miners diedin a tunnel collapse in the neighbouring town of Maripí.While enforcement of regulations remains patchy, awareness of environmental challenges is increasing. As such,lavoladorais now on hold, and local authorities plan to shut it down permanently to reduce pollution.View image in fullscreenThe value of an emerald depends on its colour. This batch could be worth up to $8,000.Photograph: andresbo/The GuardianAs the future of Muzo’s economy and environment depends on how policymakers, companies and communities address the challenges presented by the emerald industry, unchecked mining could inflict long-term harm on people and nature.“We should not ignore that we have duties,” María says. “And one of our greatest duties is to protect water and the environment.”Explore more on these topicsMiningSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanColombiaAmericasPollutionWaterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Over the course of just a few months, he has gutted agencies and public services that took decades to build while accumulating immense political power.Musk’s role in theTrump administrationis without modern precedent. Never before has the world’s richest person been deputized by the US president to cull the very agencies that oversee his businesses. Musk’s attempts to radically dismantle government bureaus have won him sprawling influence. His team has embedded its members in key roles across federal agencies, gained access to personal data on millions of Americans and fired tens of thousands of workers. SpaceX, where he is CEO, is now poised to take over potential government contracts worth billions. He has left a trail of chaos while seeding the government with his allies, who will probably help him profit and preserve his newfound power.The billionaire’s newfound sway has not come without pushback and a cost. Doge’s blitz through the government has sparked furious nationwide backlash, as well as dozens of lawsuits challenging Musk’s mass firings and accusing his taskforce of violating numerous laws. Musk’spersonalpopularityhas sunk to record lows, andTesla’s profitshave tanked.Chaos unleashed by Musk’s Doge is starting to wane – what does that mean?Read moreA look back at thefirst 100 daysof the Trump administration shows the extent to which Musk’s efforts have changed the US government. It also shows that what Musk framed as a cost-cutting task initiative is failing to meet its ostensible goal offinding $1tnin fraud or waste, but it is succeeding in reshaping federal agencies along ideological grounds,paving the way for private companiesto fill the resulting vacuum of public services.Musk has recentlystopped physically workingfrom the White House and stated he plans to pivot away from his government position soon, but has entrenched himself as one of the world’s most divisive political figures and shows no sign he is willing to fully give up his influence. Instead, the first 100 days of Doge shows that the scope of Musk’s ambition extends to remaking how the government deals with everything from humanitarian aid to the rule of law.Doge sweeps through agenciesOn the same day Trump was sworn into office, the president issued anexecutive orderthat created Musk’s “department of government efficiency” by renaming the US Digital Service agency, which previously handled governmental tech issues. Trump’s order included only a vague mandate to modernize government technology and increase efficiency, but within days it would become clear that Musk and his team had far more expansive aims.In the months leading up to the executive order, Musk had been hiring ateam of staffersthat included a mix of young engineers, tech world executives and longtime lieutenants from his private companies. Running the day-to-day operations was Steve Davis, who had worked with Musk at various companies, including SpaceX and the Boring Company, for more than 20 years. Davis was known as an exacting boss – Musk oncecompared him to chemotherapy. Others had far less experience, including 19-year-oldEdward Coristine, who had worked for several months at Musk’s Neuralink company. The teenager had beenfired from a previous internshipfor leaking information and went by the username “big balls” in online profiles.Doge’s early days made headlines for targeting masses of government workers with layoffs and pushing others to resign, with more than 2 million employeesreceiving an emailon 28 January titled “Fork in the road” that encouraged staffers to take a buyout. The emails, which asked: “What did you accomplish this week?” would become a signature of Musk and his new bureau, sent again and again whenever staff began to prey on a new herd of government employees.Shortly after Trump’s executive order created Doge, Musk’s team quickly began popping up in the offices of numerous agencies. One of the first was theGeneral Services Administration, which oversees digital technology and government buildings. Doge staffers appeared on Zoom calls with no introduction and hidden last names, questioning federal employees about what they did for work and refusing to answer questions. They also began to show up in person, taking over conference rooms andmoving Ikea bedson to the sixth floor of the GSA to sleep overnight. Perplexed government workers at numerous agencies described Doge’s actions as a hostile takeover, where a goon squad would appear and demand rapid changes to systems they knew little about.Trump 100 days: delusions of monarchy coupled with fundamental ineptitudeRead more“They’ve only fired people and turned things off,” said a current federal employee, who agreed to speak anonymously for fear of retribution.Simultaneously, Doge staffers were aggressively gaining access to key data systems that controlled the flow of payments to federal workers and funding for government contracts. In one striking incident, Doge team members clashed with the highest-ranking career official at the treasury department over access to a payment system that controls $6tn in annual funds. The fight ended with the official, David Lebryk, beingput on administrative leavebefore he ultimately resigned. Doge staff obtained the access they wanted.Pushback against Doge from other officials resulted in similar punishments. As Doge staffers stormed into the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in early February, they found themselves in aheated standoffwith security officials who tried to bar them from accessing a secure room which held sensitive and confidential data. The confrontation ended with USAID’s top security official being put on administrative leave, while Doge gained access to its systems. With no one to stop them, Doge staffers then began the process ofhollowing out the agencythat had once been the world’s largest single supplier of humanitarian aid. More than 5,600 USAID workers around the worldwould be firedin the ensuing weeks.“We spent the weekend feedingUSAIDinto the wood chipper,” Musk boasted days later on X, his social media platform.Musk moves to gut the governmentDoge’s targeting of USAID turned out to be a blueprint for how Musk and company would go after other parts of the government. In early February, Musk’s team had established a presence across federal agencies and placed itself at the fulcrum of government employment systems. The next step was mass layoffs.“We do need to delete entire agencies,” Musktoldattenders at a World Governments Summit in Dubai on 13 February. “If we don’t remove the roots of the weed, then it’s easy for the weed to grow back.”The same day as Musk’s remarks, the Trump administrationordered agencies to fire thousandsof probationary workers – a designation that applies to employees who have been at their jobs for less than a year, including those who may have been recently promoted. Other workers soon received an email from Doge that demanded theylist five thingsthat they did last week or face termination, a chaotic request that also turned out to be an empty threat.Cabinet officialsprivatelydeemed it nonsensical.Amid the widespread cuts, Musk began reveling in his new powers both on X and in public appearances. At the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on 23 February he stood on stage in a black Maga hat, sunglasses and gold chain, gleefullywielding a chainsawthat was gifted to him by Javier Milei, the rightwing populist Argentinian president.“This chainsaw is for bureaucracy!” he said. “I am become meme.”While Musk celebrated his first cuts, Doge began going after entire offices and agencies it viewed as politically progressive or opposed to its goals. The GSA’s18F office, which helped build software projects such as the IRS’s free tax filing service, was one of the first targets. On 3 February, Musk told a rightwing influencer on X that the office was “deleted” in response to an inaccurate post accusing the group of being radical leftists. Employees at the 18F office asked their new Musk-allied leadership what “deleted” meant, former workers said, but received no further clarification. The employees continued working for weeks under a cloud of confusion and tension with their new leaders, until the middle of the night on Saturday 1 March, when theyreceived an emailsaying they were going to be laid off en masse.Musk may soon leave the White House, but his bromance with Trump will remainRead more“We were living proof that the talking points of this administration were false. Government services can be efficient,” Lindsay Young, the former executive director of 18F, said in a post on LinkedIn. “This made us a target.”Doge’s influence soon extended beyond government tech offices into major agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services, whichannounced in Marchthat it was cutting 10,000 jobs to align with Trump’s executive order on Doge. In a display of the chaos that Doge had inspired, the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, weeks later admitted that around 2,000 of those workerswere fired in errorand would need to be reinstated.Musk fights the judicial systemAs soon as Trump issued the executive order to create Doge,watchdogandlabor groupsfiled lawsuits challenging its legality. More lawsuits piled on as Doge accessed sensitive data systems, fired workers and refused to respond to public records requests. Altogether, there have now been more than two dozen cases targeting the agency.At first, Doge and Musk seemed to move faster than the judicial system could respond as they slashed and burned government agencies. Around the start of March, however, many of the court casesbegan to produce rulingsthat curtailed Doge’s layoffs and temporarily blocked its staff’s access to data. Judges ruled that the Trump administrationneeded to reinstateprobationary workers that they fired,limited some Doge accessto databases at agencies such as the Social Security Administration andordered Musk’s teamto turn over internal records it had been seeking to keep private.Musk’s reaction was a constant stream ofattacks against the judicial systemon X, which includeddemandsthat lawmakers “impeach the judges” and claims that there was a “judicial coup” under way against Trump. Musk repeatedly amplified far-right influencers saying that the US should emulate El Salvador’s strongman president, Nayib Bukele, whoseparty oustedsupreme court judges in 2021 in a slide toward authoritarianism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The billionaire and the groups he funded put more than $20m toward electing a conservative judge, which he claimed was crucial to “the future of civilization”.The attempt toinfluence the Wisconsin votefollowed his blueprint from the presidential race. His Super Pac offered $100 to voters willing to sign a petition stating their opposition to “activist judges”, and he held a campaign rally where hegave out$1m checks on stage. Musk’s effortfailed to convince voters, with his preferred candidatelosingby 10 percentage points.The outcome of the Wisconsin supreme court race proved to be the first in a series of setbacks that tested the limits of Musk’s political influence and thetoxicity of his personal brand. As the billionaire embraced his new role as a Republican mega-donor and placed himself often literally at center stage, it became clear that his routinedid not always play welloutside of the insulated bubbles of Maga rallies and Tesla product launches. While people saw more and more of Musk,polls showedthat thepublic liked himless and less.Protests boom against Musk and TeslaAs Musk’s association with Trump and the international far right became too prominent to ignore over the past year, there has been a rising social stigma against associating with his products. The most tangible symbol of Musk’s empire,Tesla, has become the focus of an international protest movement since the creation of Doge.SpaceX, the second-largest source of Musk’s wealth, has seemed insulated from the vicissitudes of consumer sentiment and increased its role in US space operations.Protests at Tesla dealerships, as well as vandalism against individual cars,started smallin the weeks after inauguration, with gatherings of a few dozen people in cities including New York City and San Francisco. Some Tesla owners sold their carsdue to the association with Muskor placed “I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy” bumper stickers on their vehicles. The demonstrations quickly escalated to more cities, though, organizing under the banner of“Tesla Takedown” proteststhat targeted showrooms around the country.Federal workers fear Musk’s ‘efficiency’ agency is using AI to spy on them: ‘They are omnipresent’Read moreBy mid-March, a fully fledged international protest movement against Tesla and Musk had formed and brought about mass protests. Thousands of peoplegathered at showroomsfrom Sydney to San Francisco on 30 March in a day of action, with organizers stating that “hurting Tesla is stopping Musk”. Vandalism against Tesla dealerships, charging stations and cars alsointensified around the world, including multiplemolotov cocktail attacksandincidents of arson. Trump and Musk called the attacks domestic terrorism, while Pam Bondi, the attorney general,vowed to crack downon anyone targeting Tesla.The pressure on Tesla represented a real threat to the company, which was already dealing with an overall sluggish market for electric vehicles and increased competition from Chinese automakers. As protests spread, Musk leaned on his status in Maga world to attempt to revitalize the brand.Trump appearedon the White House driveway in front of several parked Teslas, telling reporters that he was going to buy one of them and praising Musk as a “patriot”. Others in Trump’s orbit, including the Fox News host Sean Hannity, also posted sales pitches for the automaker.Despite praise from Trump and Musk’s assurances to workers and investors that theyshould not sell Tesla stock, analysts reported that the protests along with other economic issues were nevertheless taking a toll. A stock selloff has resulted in Tesla’s share price falling around 25% since the start of the year, wiping billions of dollars from Musk’s net worth. A first-quarter earnings call on 22 April revealed Tesla’s performancewas even worsethan expectations, with a 71% drop in profits and 9% drop in revenue year over year.Musk announced on the call that he would spendsignificantly less timeworking on Doge starting sometime in May.Musk eyes an exit, but Doge remainsMusk’s declaration that he would pare back his time with Doge to one or two days a week gave a more definitive sense of his exit after weeks ofspeculationabout when and how he would leave the White House. Although Trump has remained adamant that Musk is doing a good job and remains welcome in the administration, a growing chorus of top officials have either openly feuded with him or privately griped about his presence throughout his first 100 days.Musk has had intense clashes with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, transportation secretary Sean Duffy and several other top Trump staffers. He reportedly got into anear-physical shouting matchwith the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in recent weeks, and has publicly called the chief trade adviser,Peter Navarro, the architect of Trump’s tariff policies,“dumber than a sack of bricks”.The amazing thing is that they haven’t actually done anything constructive whatsoever. Literally all they’ve done is destroy thingsCurrent federal employeeThe power struggles between Musk and administration officials leave it unclear how much say Doge will have without Musk constantly placed at the right hand of the president, but his allies are still spread throughout the government and actively working on carrying out his mission. Doge has continued to target agencies throughout April,gutting smaller groupssuch as an agency that coordinates government policy on homelessness, and eyeing others including thePeace Corpsfor mass layoffs.Some of Doge’s cuts have directly targeted agencies that oversee Musk’s companies, including at theNational Highway Traffic Safety Administrationthat regulates and investigates the risks of self-driving cars. Shifts in priorities and leadership at agencies such as Nasa and the Pentagon also put SpaceX in a position topotentially make billionsoff of new contracts, while former government employees say it is likely Dogealready has accessto confidential business data on SpaceX’s competitors.While part of the Doge team is still finding workers to fire, other members have begun accessing even more data systems and are starting to put them to work. One target has been immigration, where Doge staff have accessed personal information that includes therapy records forunaccompanied migrant children,housing informationand biometric data. The goal, multiple outletshavereported, is to create a master database that could be used to enforce the Trump administration’s deportations and other anti-immigration maneuvers.Elon Musk’s Doge conflicts of interest worth $2.37bn, Senate report saysRead moreMission accomplished?As Doge’s purpose has become more amorphous over its first three months, its initially advertised goal of cutting $1-2tn from the budget has moved further from view. Musk has instead shifted the goal posts, saying that he expects to find $150bn in savings this year – a fraction of his original goal and a small dent in the overall federal budget. That number may also be an illusion, as Doge’s tally of its savings has been filled with constant errors and miscalculations. Much of Doge’s savings couldalso be erasedby the costs of defending itself in court andlosses associatedwith its mass layoffs.The real effects of Doge’s first 100 days are still playing out. Dismantling USAID isprojected to causearound176,000 excess deaths, more than half of them children, according to a Boston University tracking project. Cuts to agencies such as theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Associationand Federal Emergency Management Agency could imperil natural disaster forecasting and relief. Agencies such asVeterans Affairsthat provide public services may deteriorate, while cuts to research and education programsmay be felt for decadesto come.“The amazing thing is that they haven’t actually done anything constructive whatsoever. Literally all they’ve done is destroy things,” a current federal employee said of Doge. “People are going to miss the federal government that they had.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsTeslaSpaceXUSAIDfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even with a rightwing-dominated supreme court, many of these executive orders are expected to founder.Trump 100 days: delusions of monarchy coupled with fundamental ineptitudeRead moreHowever, the US must accelerate efforts to cut emissions if climate goals are to be met, half of Americans still have to endure unsafe air and endangered species and public lands face pressure from a changing climate. The next few years will see little remedy to these growing problems from the White House.“The pace of announcements may slow at some point but the pressure on our regulatory system and our democracy will not only continue, but ramp up,” said Michael Burger, a climate law expert at Columbia University.“The result will be fewer environmental protections and more people suffering the public health consequences of more pollution. It’s that straightforward.”Oliver MilmanHistoric rollbacks of environmental regulationsWhat has the administration done:Taken more than 140 actions to roll back environmental rules and push for greater use of fossil fuels.Set about rewriting regulations that limit pollution from cars, trucks and power plants.Officially reconsidering whether greenhouse gases actually cause harm to public health.Legally targeted states that have their own laws on tackling the climate crisis.Speeded up environmental reviews of drilling projects, from years to just a few weeks.Winding back water efficiencystandards for showersand toilets and halting aphase-out of plastic strawsView image in fullscreenEPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, in San Diego, California, on 22 April.Photograph: Ana Ramirez/The San Diego Union-Tribune via APAnalysis andreaction:When campaigning for president, Donald Trump promised to torch environmental regulations if fossil fuel companies were able to donate enough money to propel him to the White House. He has set about fulfilling this pledge in dizzying fashion.By the Guardian’s count, Trump’s administration has taken more than 140 actions to weaken or rescind environmental rules and to escalate the use of fossil fuels in his first 100 days – more than all of the rollbacks of his entire first term.The drumbeat of this effort, largely via a blizzard of executive orders and agency memos, to eviscerate rules designed to protect Americans’ air, water and a livable climate, has been relentless. “What we’ve seen in this first 100 days is unprecedented – the deregulatory ambition of this administration is mind-blowing,” said Burger of Columbia University.In a single day in March, Trump’s EPA launched 31 different actions to refashion pollution laws for cars, trucks and power plants and even re-evaluate whether greenhouse gases harm public health – a key finding that underpins US climate laws. It was a “dagger to the heart of the climate religion”, according to Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator.Zeldin has repeatedly touted the EPA’s record during the first 100 days, with the agencypublishing a listof 100 environmental actions, including the cleanup of toxic waste and the testing of chemicals.But the administration has also sought to ease restrictions upon coal plants dumping their toxic ash and mercury and to scale back a plan to prevent states from wafting their pollution to their neighbors. Consideration of the climate crisis has been removed from federal spending decisions and disaster recovery, pipeline safety standards are to be relaxed and environmental permit approvals speeded up from years to just weeks.Places of refuge for nature and carbon storage, such as oceans and national forests, will be opened up for the extraction of fish and timber while endangered species laws are set to be upended and, if the administration gets its way, essentially neutered.Not content with the reorientation of the federal government’s response to the climate crisis, Trump has ordered his Department of Justice to target states that have their own climate laws. He has also ordered the expiration of environment and energy regulations across 25 different laws, usually a responsibility of Congress.Trump has even used the power of his office to attend to his own fixations around shower water pressure, which he considers too weak, and paper straws, which he dislikes compared with the plastic alternative. “There doesn’t seem to be any strategy to this but I feel like I have policy whiplash,” said Gina McCarthy, who was Joe Biden’s top climate adviser.“We see an administration that doesn’t care about these things and is all about the whims of President Trump. Executive orders are not laws, though, and we spend a great deal of time focusing on them when most of them are highly illegal and won’t go anywhere.”Oliver MilmanTrump’s ‘drill, baby, drill’ agendaWhat the administration has done:Trump signed executive orders to ease restrictions on fossil fuel extraction and exports, pledging to “unleash American energy”.He tapped fossil fuel-supporting appointees to head up crucial federal agencies, includingChris Wright, a former fracking CEO, for energy secretary;Doug Burgum, former Republican governor of North Dakota – the third largest oil and natural gas producer in the country – to lead the interior department (DOI); andLee Zeldin, a former Republican congressperson to head the EPA.Trump offered the fossil fuel industry – whichlavished record levels of donations on him and Congress– an exemption from the tariffs he presented in April (and which he placed on pause shortly thereafter).Analysis andreaction:Aru Shiney-Ajay, executive director of the youth-led environmental justice group Sunrise Movement said: “Donald Trump’s actions on climate are part of a ruthless agenda to prop up big oil and reward the billionaires bankrolling his campaigns. Big oil’s bribe paid off.”‘The path forward is clear’: how Trump taking office has ‘turbocharged’ climate accountability effortsRead moreTrump’s loyalty to the fossil fuel industry has not, however, shielded fossil fuel companies from the fallout of his erratic policymaking. The domestic oil industry is currently facing the some of thelowest prices for crudeit has seen in years.The Dow Jones’s US Oil and Gas Index, which tracks 42 fossil fuel companies, plummeted by more than 15% since Trump announced the tariffs on 2 April, sinking to its lowest level since 2022, before a slow, partial rebound.View image in fullscreenAn oil refinery in McPherson, Kansas, last year.Photograph: Charlie Riedel/APMeanwhile, Trump’s tariffs have already begun driving up the costs of oil production, with new taxes on steel and aluminum inflating the costs of building fossil fuel infrastructure. And his calls to “drill, baby, drill” have raised concerns about oil demand, since an increase in supply could push down prices, thereby limiting profit.Though the oil industry has publicly praised Trump, they have quietly showed they are anxious about the economic implications of his policies. In a recent anonymized survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, for instance, fossil fuel executives brazenly criticized Trump. “The administration’s chaos is a disaster for the commodity markets,” one oil boss said. “‘Drill, baby, drill’ is nothing short of a myth and populist rallying cry. Tariff policy is impossible for us to predict and doesn’t have a clear goal. We want more stability.”At amajor Texas oil and gas conferencein May, fossil fuel top brass echoed these criticisms.Though theTrump administrationhas not ended the chaos created by its policies, it has given big oil other gifts. In recent weeks, for instance, Trump signed an executive order instructing the Department of Justice to “stop the enforcement” of state climate laws forcing polluting companies to pay for climate damages, and also targeting dozens of lawsuits that accuse big oil of intentionally covering up the climate risks of their products.Dharna NoorHollowing out agencies including Noaa, Femaand DOIWhat has the administration doneSweeping cuts to federal agencies on the forefront of the climate crisis, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), the DOI and the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and widespread firings of climate scientists and regulation experts.Withdrawal from contracts and canceled grant funding;datasets pulled from public-facing websites; funding for regional climate centers suspended.National Climate Assessment contract canceled;hundreds of experts dismissed.Executive order toexpedite deep-sea mining for minerals.Plans to dismantle a keyFemadisaster preparedness program.Weather balloon launches stopped due to staff shortages.Censorship of climate-related words, flagged in studies, contracts and agency documents/websites.Plans todrain funding for climate, weather and ocean laboratories.Analysis andreaction:Trump wasted no time before he unleashed an all-out assault on environmental science, gutting the federal agencies positioned on the frontlines of the climate crisis, firing hundreds of researchers, staffers and forecasters and pulling public access to critical resources and data.Vital work to understand, prepare and respond to changes caused by global heating has slowed or stopped as teams try tonavigate the chaos, while the threat of more severe budget cuts and political crackdowns lingers. The moves largely bypassed input or oversight from Congress as Trump used executive orders and actions undertaken by the billionaire Elon Musk-led “department of government efficiency”, even on budget issues typically governed by the legislative branch.View image in fullscreenThousands demonstrate for science and research funding in Washington DC on 7 March.Photograph: Allison Bailey/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockThousands of federal workers were culled from the ranks across the country’s premier scientific agencies – including at Noaa andNasa– and in roles across the government that typically facilitate regulatory process or research. Many of those fired were probationary employees, a classification applied to the first year, or sometimes two, in a position.The widespread firings were challenged in court, forcing the administration to rehire workers and put them on administrative leave, only to fire them again when legally in the clear. In the end, at least121,000 federal workers were fired, leaving significant holes in their wake.Thousands more workers have opted to take offers of early retirement or voluntary separations. At Noaa alone, roughly 27,000 years of collective experience was lost, according to Craig McLean, the former director of Noaa research.“We lost our promising new talent in the probationary firings and now we’ve lost our institutional knowledge,” a Noaa employee said of the resignations, asking for anonymity out of fear of retribution.While the losses are expected to have a profound effect on the American public, the impact will be felt globally too.Among the hundreds of positions lost were workers whotrack El Niño-La Niña weather patternsaround the world, people who model severe storm risks, and scientists contributing to global understanding of what could happen as the world warms.“I want to emphasize that this blunt smashing of federal agencies is limiting the ability of our nation to respond not only now, but in the future,” said Dr Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It’s dismantling the very infrastructure by which we collect data, foster expertise and collaboration, and have the people and processes in place to take action.”Already, the staff shortages have hampered data collection and field offices have had to stop deploying tools that gather essential intel.“The effects may not be obvious until there is a major tornado outbreak, or a hurricane landfall downwind, that doesn’t go so well,” said climate scientist Daniel Swain, who spoke about the gravity of this issue during a recent broadcast on YouTube. But, he said, the actions taken in the first 100 days were just the beginning.“What we have seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg,” he said, noting recently leaked budget documents thatoutline the president’s plansto continue gutting climate science-focused federal work. If the administration has its way, he said, “it would probably spell the end of most publicly funded climate research in the United States”.Gabrielle CanonPublic lands targetedWhat has the administration doneRescinded protections for hundreds of millions of acres of federal waters.Initiated major changes toNational Environmental Policy Act (Nepa) regulationsthat require federal projects consider environmental impacts and enable public oversight/comment, severely reducing the often years-long environmental impact process to 28 days.Ordered the end ofAmerican Climate Corps jobs that create climate and public lands-supporting positions.Plans to fast-trackcontroversial deep-seamining and accelerating approvals for mining, drilling, and fossil fuels extraction on public lands..Proposed rolling back protections in the Endangered Species Act.Plans to rescind Bureau of Land Management rules that protect millions of acres in Alaska and across the US west; planned repeal of BLM Public Lands Rule.Emergency situation determination issued by the USDA toopen logging on more than 100m acres of national forestsand an executive orders to increase and accelerate logging on federal lands. And revoked a Biden order that protected old-growth forests.Joint taskforce between DOI and the Department of Housing and Urban Development toexamine federal landsfor housing development as the administration pushes for the sell-off of public lands.Analysis andreaction:Trump may be one of the very few Americans who doesn’tcherish the country’s public lands. Voter support for these roughly 640m acres – forests and deserts, parks and monuments among them – is stalwart and one of the few issues bridged by an otherwise vast political divide.But even with broad popularity and a rapidly escalating interest in outdoor recreation that’s fueled both local economies and international tourism, the administration has made it a priority to shrink land management agencies, reduce protections once governed by them and possibly even diminish the holdings of lands under federal jurisdiction.View image in fullscreenPeople protest against federal employee layoffs at Yosemite national park in California on 1 March.Photograph: Laure Andrillon/AFP/Getty ImagesThousands of employees were fired or took deals to leave, and agencies are struggling to hire seasonal employees who typically run operations during the busiest seasons. Still, more cuts are being planned as Trump seeks to reshape the federal government. Reports found the Department of Interior has plans tocull roughly 25% of its workforce, and employees at the US Forest Service are bracing for a broad reduction in force that has yet to be detailed. The National Park Service alone has suffered a 13% reduction in staff already.Sweeping firings left behind gaping holes in an already short-staffed workforce at parks and forests, leaving some departments with workforce levels typically seen during government shutdowns according to some experts.Toilets, trash and overgrown trails may become a common feature in highly trafficked areas, along with increasing risks of trampled conservation areas, a lack of capacity for the study of threatened plants and animals, and lost support that ensures safety measures are followed. Visitation has surged in recent years, adding new strains on ageing infrastructure and more opportunities for injuries and wildlife conflicts, as dangers from extreme conditions fueled by the climate crisis continue to mount.“Scientists who should be doing their job tracking the wildlife and the ecosystems in these parks, are being told they have to take restroom cleaning shifts,” said Aaron Weiss, the deputy director for the Center for Western Priorities. “That’s incredibly important in parks,” he added, “but we shouldn’t be assigning those jobs to scientists because Doge has fired all the custodial staff.”It’s not just about recreation, though. The administration has also made moves to open the country’s holdings of conservation areas, protected habitats and wilderness to extraction and development. There have been a series of orders from the administration that call for increased logging, fossil fuels leases, and mining as Trump pushes for expanding industry access.Ben Vizzachero, a federal worker who initially lost his job during the federal firing spree but who was later brought into his position said the outlook still remained bleak for US public lands. “The Trump administration is waging a campaign of bullying and harassment, trying to shrink the federal workforce by any means,” he said, noting that removing regulators and regulations will “open lands for mining, logging, drilling, and other destruction”.These sweeping changes and the threats to public lands come as they continue to be widely supported and cherished by the American people. “The fight to protect our public lands is embedded within the fight for our democracy itself.”Gabrielle CanonCancelling environmental justice schemes, andhitting US farmersWhat has the administration doneTrump immediatelyrescinded a slew of executive ordersthat directed federal agencies to prioritize tackling environmental racism and other injustices – including one dating back more than 30 years.A separate executive order focused on ending government-sponsored diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and so-called “illegal DEI” efforts in the private sector also targeted environmental justice by wrongly conflating the two. This called for the closures of all environmental justice offices and positions in the federal government – including the office of environmental justice and external civil rights which was created to support EPA efforts to help improve access to clean water, air and land in communities disproportionately affected by environmental pollution, as well as enforce federal civil rights laws.Mass layoffs in the EPA, USDA and health and human services department which will disproportionately hit access to adequate, clean and affordable food, water, air and energy for low-income and rural communities.Freezing the Biden-era Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund – more than $20bn of competitive grants available to states, cities, tribes and other eligible groups to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, particularly in areas most affected by climate crisis and excluded from mainstream finance.Terminating climate and conservation grants to US farmers including the Biden-era five-year $3.2bn real-life study into the effectiveness of conservation practices such as cover cropping for commodity farms.View image in fullscreenA farmer plants soybeans in Illinois on 28 April.Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty ImagesAnalysis andreaction:From day one of Trump 2.0, the president has revealed his intention to willfully conflate environmental justice – efforts to acknowledge and correct decades of harm caused by placing polluting factories, landfills, fossil fuel infrastructure and highways in low-income and Indigenous people and communities of color – with what he and his allies believe to be woke, anti-white DEI policies that proliferated in response to the BLM movement.Citing Trump’s crusade against DEI, the justice departmentterminated a two-year investigationinto a petrochemical plant in LePlace, Louisiana, accused of emitting extraordinarily high levels of the cancer-causing chemical chloroprene into the majority Black community. Then, in an unprecedented move, his justice departmentterminated a 2023 landmark settlementwith the state of Alabama requiring health authorities to provide the majority-Black Lowndes county with basic sewage and sanitation services – which an earlier investigation found had been denied for decades due to environmental racism. Several other consent decrees involving egregious polluters are feared to be under threat.Not to be outdone, Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),dismantled the office and fired the entire staffat the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap). States were still waiting for about $380m to be disbursed this year, when the bipartisan program that helps low-income Americans struggling to pay energy bills so they don’t die from the extreme heat or cold was disbanded. In a leaked HHS budget for 2026 seen by the Guardian, Liheap was terminated – which unless revived will increase heat and cold deaths in the richest country in the world.The $20bn Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and the portal, has been frozen on and off since February, causing chaos and uncertainty for recipients as this makes its way through the courts. The money was appropriated by Congress through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and finalized before the election, and it is widely agreed (outside Trump world) that the fund cannot legally be cancelled without legislation. The fear is that the Republican-majority Congress will succeed in pushing this through in the continuing resolution for the 2025 budget, which should be passed in May.“The administration is trying to make it so difficult that people will give up, but our quest for environmental justice [has been waged] for 40 years and we will not stop now,” said one veteran environmental justice leader who asked not to be named in fear that his organization, a recipient of the fund, would be targeted. “The climate crisis is real; environmental racism is real. Those are the facts.”Nina LakhaniTearing up US global climate pledgesWhat has the administration donePulled out of the 2015 Paris accords, which the Biden administration rejoined in 2021 – four years after Trump first withdrew the US from the global climate mitigation pact.Withdrew the US from the loss and damage fund– a global agreement under which the developed countries most responsible for the climate crisis pledged to partly compensate developing countries for irreversible harms caused by global heating.The EPA missed the annual 15 April deadline to submit data on US greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations – the first time in 30 years.Trump 100 days: from cornerstone of the west to unreliable allyRead moreAnalysis and reaction: The US is currently the second biggest greenhouse gas emitter, sowithdrawing from the Paris agreementand its legally binding commitment to reduce emissions will further weaken global efforts to slow global heating – with catastrophic consequences for communities vulnerable to climate shocks in the US and globally. It takes a year for the withdrawal to go into effect, but missing the 15 April emissions reporting deadline, which never happened even during Trump’s first term, has raised suspicion that this administration is willing to violate international rules and could be preparing to exit from the entire UNFCCC.View image in fullscreenActivists protest at the Cop climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, on 16 November 2024.Photograph: Peter Dejong/APAnother major concern is climate finance. As the world’s biggest economy (and worst historical polluter), the US has been a major, albeit inadequate, contributor to global climate funds to help developing countries that are not responsible for global heating in their climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. It has already pulled out ofthe loss and damage fund, adopted at the Cop28 UN summit in 2023 after years of diplomatic and grassroots advocacy – and despite US efforts to block it. The US has long obstructed progress on global climate action and had pledged a measly $17.5m (£13.5m) to the fund; the cynical move to withdraw from loss and damage efforts – while bolstering fossil fuel production – was widely condemned by the global south.Harjeet Singh, a climate activist and founding director of the India-based Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, said: “As the largest historical emitter, the United States bears a significant share of the blame for the climate adversities affecting vulnerable populations worldwide. The decision by the Trump administration exemplifies a longstanding pattern of obstruction by the US government in securing necessary finance for addressing climate impacts, [and] undermines global efforts to deliver climate justice.”Nina LakhaniExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpClimate crisisUS politicsParis climate agreementUS Environmental Protection AgencyUS supreme courtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Before the conclave begins next week, the Sistine Chapel will be swept for electronic bugs, jamming devices will be installed, and special coatings will be placed on windows to stop laser scanners picking up anything audible.It wasn’t always this way: in the past, letters, diaries and other writings by cardinals and their attendants gave revealing accounts of what happened in the meetings convened in order to choose a pope.Here, with the help of the historians Vanessa Corcoran of Georgetown University in Washington and Miles Pattenden of the University of Oxford, we look at some of the more noteworthy conclaves from the past.View image in fullscreenFabian, pope from 236 until his death in 250.Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images236This was the year that a dove landed on the head of a priest named Fabian, which the cardinals took to be the Holy Spirit descending upon him. Fabian was unanimously elected pope.View image in fullscreenA depiction of Rome’s Septizodium Palace.Photograph: Chronicle/Alamy1241Cardinals were locked inside Rome’s Septizodium Palace in stifling heat and unsanitary conditions. One died and several fell ill, and the factions were unable to agree on a new pope.Frustrated by the slow deliberations, Romans threatened to dig up the recently departed Gregory IX’s body. Eventually the cardinals chose an aged and enfeebled man, who took the name of Celestine IV. He died 17 days later, before he had even been enthroned.1268-71The longest papal election in history lasted two years and nine months – mainly due to factional infighting between cardinals. Three of the 20 cardinal electors died before a decision was made.The cardinals met in the city of Viterbo, which was made the papal base as Rome had descended into criminality. Two years after they began their deliberations, exasperated local people took drastic measures to try to force a conclusion. They locked the cardinals in the Palazzo dei Papi, walled up the doors and windows, and reduced rations to bread and water. When that failed they removed the roof, exposing the cardinals to the elements.Amid these austere conditions, the cardinals at last agreed on Teobaldo Visconti, who became Gregory X. One of his first acts was to create the conclave, with daily voting, as a way of electing future popes.View image in fullscreenMeeting of the 1378 conclave.Photograph: Sunny Celeste/Alamy1378The papacy had only recently returned to Rome after 70 years in Avignon, in modern-day France. Gregory XI, a Frenchman, died soon after. As the cardinals met to decide his successor, a mob – fearing that the return to Rome would be short-lived – surrounded the conclave, demanding they choose a Roman pope – and“se non che tutti vi occideremo”(“if not we will kill you all”).The cardinals swiftly elected Bartolomeo Prignano from Naples, who became Urban VI. But he was a disaster, and within a few months some of the cardinals had declared his election invalid and held a rival conclave. Their choice, Clement VII, re-established a papal court in Avignon. The schism lasted four decades, with each line of popes claiming to be the true successor and excommunicating the other.View image in fullscreenThe Delivery of the Keys fresco by Pietro Perugino, which sits in the Sistine Chapel in Rome.Photograph: Alamy1492The college of cardinals met for the first time in the newly built Sistine Chapel. One of their number, Rodrigo Borgia, a powerful and wealthy man who fathered several children with a string of mistresses, offered his colleagues lucrative sinecures in exchange for their votes. He duly became Alexander VI.1503The death of Pius III led to the shortest conclave in history. Within a few hours, Giuliano della Rovere, a man of little charm and with a violent temper, had become Julius II, also known as the “warrior pope” for personally leading military campaigns on behalf of the papal states. He also began the rebuilding of St Peter’s Basilica and established the Swiss Guard.View image in fullscreenA paper etching from 1605 illustrating different scenes after the death of Leo XI and the resulting conclave.Photograph: Alamy1605The conclave that elected Paul V included a fist fight between cardinals in which they ripped the lacy bits off their rochets.1655A group of young cardinals, bored with weeks-long deadlock, decided to play a prank on older colleagues. One dressed up as the Holy Ghost and surprised older members of the college in the dead of night.

And hug my family, of course,” he said. “I thought I was getting out in 2027, so I had planned out the first three days. But then it happened so unexpectedly, and everything was just mad.”Along with 10 other black teenagers in Manchester, he was jailed in 2022 for supposedly being part of a violent conspiracy after sending a handful of messages in a group chat, in a case thatprompted widespread outrage.His conviction wasquashed in Januaryafter new evidence showed he was wrongfully identified in a drill music video, which had been presented to the jury as evidence that he was a violent gang member.Adedeji said this was plainly not true. He was head boy at school, a youth leader, and had offers to study law at university and plans for a book.“I feel like it has got to do with race, because if a white person said [what I said], I don’t think they’d be in the same position as me. They wouldn’t,” Adedeji said. “But because I’m perceived as black, I’m seen as aggressive, a gang member. Well, I’m not.”View image in fullscreenAde Adedeji said he ‘didn’t believe it’ when he was told he was going home.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianAdedeji said he could vividly remember the moment in January when he was told he would finally be going home after spending more than three years – about 1,200 days – in prison.“I didn’t believe it. I remember tearing up. The whole wing, the whole jail, knew about my case, everyone was rooting for me,” he said. “So when the news came in, the place just erupted. Everyone was smiling, laughing, music was playing.”Telling his mother the news was a particularly special moment. “I said: ‘Mum, come pick me up. I’m coming home.’ She just started crying and crying,” Adedeji said. “The last time I heard my mum cry like that was when I got found guilty. With families, when one person goes into jail, you feel like you’re doing that sentence with them. So it’s like her sentence ended at the same time.”He was sitting with his barrister, Keir Monteith KC, for the first time sincethe successful appealagainst his conviction, before they took part in the Stephen Lawrence Research Centre’s annual lecture at De Montfort University in Leicester.The pair discussed the “bittersweet” feeling that while Adedeji got the result he was hoping for, his friends didn’t: two others had their sentences reduced, and four others had their convictions and sentences upheld.“From a moral and legal point of view, all convictions should be quashed in this case,” said Monteith. “The prosecution were using, predominantly against young lads of good character, evidence that wouldn’t see the light of day if they were white young lads.”View image in fullscreenKeir Monteith KC, left, Ade Adedeji’s lawyer, is a founding member of the campaign group Art Not Evidence.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianMonteith is a founding member of the campaign Art Not Evidence, which is calling for a stop to rap lyrics and music videos being used as evidence in UK trials.“I’m pretty sure they had about a day playing drill tracks in the court,” he said. “The prosecution made the assertion that the evidence showed they were involved in a gang. But they didn’t have a police officer saying that, they didn’t have an expert saying that.“Things like where [Ade] lives, his interest in music, who he knocks around with – that’s enough to prove he’s in a gang?”Adedeji said he felt the older generation didn’t know what drill rap was, and “perceive it to be a bad thing”. He said: “But it’s not, it’s just people expressing their feelings. It would be a poem or spoken word if the beat wasn’t so hard, and that wouldn’t be a problem.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

None of those named as targets in a group chat were hurt, although two of the other defendants did go on to attack other boys.Adedeji, then 17, only posted 11 messages in the chat, one of which was a postcode for where one of the alleged targets lived, although nothing happened at that location.When he was sentenced to eight years in prison, Adedeji was 19 years old. He has emerged from the prison system at 21, having missed out on a significant portion of his transition into adulthood.“I’ve not had a youth. I’ve not done certain things that most teenagers have done. I’ve never been clubbing, I’ve never been on a lads’ holiday, I’ve never had a cocktail, I haven’t got my driving licence,” he said. “I’ve missed out on so many things due to the fact that I was in prison for something I didn’t do. Excuse my French, but it’s fucked up my life.”View image in fullscreenAdedeji and Monteith took part in the Stephen Lawrence Research Centre’s annual lecture at De Montfort University, Leicester.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianBecause his conviction was quashed, he hasn’t received the support offered to offenders leaving prison, and returning to his old life has been a slow process.“Most of the things that I said I was going to do, I’ve still not done, because I’m still readjusting to being outside,” he said. “One thing I have been doing is walking to the shops, because you don’t have that privilege to walk wherever you want inside a prison.“I’m just not so focused on the bigger things any more. I’m more focused on the little things, because when you’re inside, you realise what really matters to you – spending time with your friends, your family, and enjoying life. Because I’ve had too much stress in my life already.”Adedeji does, however, want to go to university to study law and write a book about how the judicial system affects children of colour.“My case had so much publicity, which I’m thankful for, because otherwise I’d just be one of them kids still stuck inside doing my sentence,” he said. “So I need to get out there and talk about it. There’s no rehabilitation in jail, it’s designed for us young people of all colours to fail.“They’re closing down youth centres and building more prisons.

Now film-makers are hoping he can do the same for other destructive environmental practices that the world’s best-known living naturalist describes as “draining the life from our oceans”.The industrialfishing method of bottom trawlingis the focus of a large part of Attenborough’s latest film, Ocean, which airs in cinemas from 8 May, the naturalist’s 99th birthday. In a remarkably no-holds-barred narrative, he says these vessels tear the seabed with such force “the trails of destruction can be seen from space”. He also condemns what he calls “modern day colonialism at sea”, where huge trawlers, operating off the coasts of countries reliant on fish for food and livelihoods, are blamed for dwindling local catches.View image in fullscreenA white fish trawler in the North Sea between Scotland and Norway. Attenborough criticises industrial fishing in the Ocean filmPhotograph: Tina Norris/ShutterstockIndustrial fishing, he says, has killed “two-thirds of all large predator fish”. In Antarctica, trawlers may be “removing the foundation of an entire ecosystem”.Sharks and turtles that survived the extinction of the dinosaurs, he says, may not survive hundreds of thousands of industrial trawling vessels, which compete with marine life and coastal fishing communities in “every corner of the ocean”.In railing against such widespread fishing practices, Attenborough has “gone a lot further” than he has before, says Keith Scholey, one of the film’s directors and co-founder of Silverback Films, who has worked with Attenborough for more than 40 years.“He’s come to a new place. He knows how much the public trusts him and how careful he has to be. He does want to bring about this change. So he absolutely has gone a lot further with this than before.“He is very sure that this is an opportunity for the world.”The film’s most dramatic scenes include world-first footage showing bottom trawlers, including a scallop dredger off the south coast of Britain and another in Turkey. Clouds ofcarbon-capturing sediment are churned up, and fish and other marine life leap in vain to escape heavy beams smashing their way across the sea bed, destroying everything in their path.The idea of bulldozing a rainforest causes outrage, yet we do the same underwater every day. Surely you would argue it must be illegalDavid Attenborough“The idea of bulldozing a rainforest causes outrage, yet we do the same underwater every day,” says Attenborough. “Surely you would argue it must be illegal.”Attenborough hasfaced some criticism in the pastfor not going far enough with his messaging around the climate crisis. His response has been that repeated warnings about human destruction of the natural worldcan be a “turn-off”for viewers and his role was not to campaign but to tell “gripping and truthful” wildlife stories.Scholey says Attenborough’s role as a storyteller, rather than campaigner, has helped people understand the natural world.“What David has succeeded at doing is remaining trusted by everyone, so that when he plays his cards, he can affect things in a huge way.”As he approaches 100 years on the planet, Attenborough tells viewers of the film, two years in the making, that it is the seas that cover more than 70% of our planet that should be the focus of our concern: “I now understand that the most important place on Earth is not on land but at sea,” he says. “We are at a crossroads, with humanity draining the life from the ocean.”View image in fullscreenA still from Ocean of a blue whale mother and calf in the Gulf of California, Mexico.

Member states have agreed in principle to protect 30% of the world’s oceans from destructive fishing by 2030,as part of an agreementto stop biodiversity loss.

But an agreement by the International Whaling Commission in 1982 stopped commercial whaling, and speciesare now thriving.‘We ask to be recognised’: small fishers claim €12bn EU fund favours big playersRead more“Success is possible,” Attenborough attests from the deck of a vessel, as a blue whale swims alongside. “I’ve seen it on a global scale once before.”Toby Nowlan, one of Ocean’s three directors, who also produced it, says: “There is an element of wake-up call, but really it’s a story of hope and recovery.”The film shows inspirational stories of ocean recovery in places where destructive fishing is banned, including off the Isle of Arran, Scotland, and Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, Hawaii.“The ocean can recover faster than we can ever imagine: it can bounce back to life,” says Attenborough.Ocean will be available on Hulu and Disney+ later this yearExplore more on these topicsOceansSeascape: the state of our oceansFishing industryFishingAnimalsConservationFoodMarine lifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it true?ByManvir SinghThu 1 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 04.47 EDTShareBeginning in 2001, the Austrian anthropologist Bernd Brabec de Mori spent six years living in the western Amazon. He first arrived as a backpacker, returned to do a master’s thesis on ayahuasca songs, and eventually did a PhD on the music of eight Indigenous peoples in the region. Along the way, he married a woman of the local Shipibo tribe and settled down.“I did not have a lot of money,” he told me, “so I had to make my living there.” He became a teacher. He built a house. He and his wife had children. That rare experience of joining the community, he said, forced him to realise that many of the assumptions he had picked up as an anthropologist were wrong.Like most outsiders, Brabec de Mori arrived inPeruthinking that ayahuasca had been used in the western Amazon for thousands of years. This is the standard narrative; look up resources on ayahuasca, and you’re bound to run into it. “Ayahuasca has been used in the Peruvian Amazon for millennia, long before the Spanish came to Peru, before the Incan empire was formed, before history,” states the website of the Ayahuasca Foundation, an organisation founded by a US citizen that offers ayahuasca retreats.Yet with time, Brabec de Mori came to see just how flimsy this narrative was. He discovered “a double discourse, which happens in all societies where there is tourism”, he said. “People start to tell the tourists – and I found that most Shipibo people did not distinguish tourists from researchers – the stories they think are interesting for them and not what they really live with.”His research showed just how large the discrepancy was. He discovered that, in their traditional stories about ayahuasca’s origins, many Shipibo-Konibo people said the brew came from the Kukama, one of the first peoples to be missionised and resettled during the Spanish conquest. Other peoples from the region remembered adopting it in the last 50 years. When he examined old reports of travellers, Brabec de Mori found that he could connect the historic diffusion of ayahuasca to the movements of missionaries and the spread of the rubber industry through the western Amazon.Then there was the linguistic evidence. Peoples in the Peruvian Amazon speak a dazzling variety of languages, but their words for ayahuasca and related activities are notably alike. The same goes for their music: lullabies, love songs and festive songs are varied, yet ayahuasca songs are very similar and often sung in non-Amazonian languages, like Quechua or Spanish. These patterns led him to conclude that ayahuasca hasn’t been in the western Amazon for millennia. Rather, it seems to have arrived and spread much more recently.Based on this and other evidence, Brabec de Mori argues that ayahuasca diffused through the Peruvian Amazon in the past 300 years. It is likely older among Tukanoan peoples further north, who, he suspects, transmitted the practice to populations missionised early in the lowlands. Yet in the regions most frequented by tourists, it seems to be a relative novelty. Brabec de Mori isn’t the first to make the argument – the anthropologist Peter Gow proposed something similar in 1994 – but he, more than anyone else, has found the anthropological data to support it.Brabec de Mori’s findings represent one of many cracks in the stories we tell about the history of psychedelics. As these substances become the mainstream, so do narratives about their role in human societies, narratives that often bind them to shamanism. Just look at the media coverage. In 2020,a journalist for the Washington Post wrotethat consciousness-altering substances “have been used by Indigenous cultures for physical and psychological healing for thousands of years”. Michael Pollan endorsed a similar narrative throughout his bestselling 2018 book, How to Change Your Mind, writing that “elements of shamanism might have a role to play in psychedelic therapy – as indeed it has probably done for several thousand years”.These quotes all subscribe to what I call the global archaic psychedelic shamanism (Gaps) hypothesis. It consists of three claims. First, that psychedelics have long been widespread. Second, that use of psychedelics goes back to the ancient past. Third, that psychedelics have long been used by shamans for therapeutic healing.Like so many of the stories we tell about human history, the Gaps hypothesis is rooted in glimmers of truth. Yet much of what passes as psychedelic history has been distorted by a seductive mixture of flimsy archaeological evidence, outdated anthropological approaches and economically expedient ideology. “It’s a romantic image that Indigenous people have been using everything they do for thousands of years,” Brabec de Mori said. “If we change the picture, it’s kind of unromantic, and it seems that people like romanticism.”In June 1955, the vice-president of public relations at JP Morgan arrived in a remote village in the Mexican highlands. He was accompanied by Allan Richardson, a photographer and teacher at an elite girls’ school in Manhattan. They had come to eat fungus.The PR man, Robert Gordon Wasson, was a mycophile. For decades, he and his wife Valentina Pavlovna Wasson had studied humanity’s relationship with mushrooms; Mexico would be the most promising place to explore it. Four centuries earlier, Spanish chroniclers had recorded how the Aztecs consumed a powerful psychoactive substance called teonanacatl, or “flesh of the gods”. Botanists and anthropologists had bickered over its identity until the 1920s and 1930s, when they discovered that communities in the Oaxacan mountains swallowed psychotropic mushrooms in night-time ceremonies.View image in fullscreenA Peruvian shaman of the Amazon Shipibo-Konibo people, Lauro Hinostroza, performs a ritual.Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty ImagesWasson learned about the ceremonies in 1952. The next year, he and Valentina travelled to the town of Huautla de Jiménez, where they observed, but did not participate in, a mushroom ritual. He returned to Mexico again in 1954 and collected ethnographic data. In 1955, he travelled down a third time, this time with his photographer friend, and was lucky enough to meet a Mazatec shaman named María Sabina. Valentina and their daughter joined a day or two later. María Sabina “had presence”, Wasson later wrote. He and Valentina considered her “a woman of rare moral and spiritual power, dedicated in her vocation”. He met her through a local town official under the pretence of determining the health of his son Peter.It was the ideal introduction. Not only had she spent her life exploring the psychic worlds accessed through mushrooms, but she was willing to let the foreigners try them, too. Wasson wrote up his experience for Life magazine in an article headlined Seeking the Magic Mushroom. Over two nights, he ate mushrooms under María Sabina’s guidance. When Valentina and their 18-year-old daughter arrived, he gave them batches to enjoy as well.Published in the issue of 13 May 1957, the article popularised the term “magic mushrooms” and introduced millions of westerners to the fungi’s mind-melding effects. Six days later, Valentina told her story in the Week, a magazine included in 37 newspapers and circulated to 14 million readers.The impacts of the accounts were immediate and far-reaching. They sparked a surge of interest in Indigenous practices and the spiritual and therapeutic applications of hallucinogens. For many readers, the tales of otherworldly visions – of camel caravans, resplendent palaces, a mythological beast in a chariot and the 18th-century court of Louis XV, to name a few – promised gateways to new realms. Writers, academics and everyday adventurers started to make pilgrimages to Mexico, eager to taste the flesh of the gods.The Wassons helped establish two tenets of the Gaps hypothesis: the ancientness of psychedelic use and its ubiquity. After decades spent studying mushrooms, Wasson wrote, he and Valentina found that peoples everywhere, from “the Arabs of the desert” to “the Māori of New Zealand”, regarded mushrooms as supernaturally powerful. This discovery led them to “hazard a bold surmise: was it not probable that, long ago, long before the beginnings of written history, our ancestors had worshipped a divine mushroom?”Like a fungal mycelium colonising new terrain, the threads of the Gaps hypothesis had taken root.In the decades since the Wassons’ articles, assertions of widespread archaic psychedelic use have diversified. They’ve inspired theories that religion broadly and Christianity, in particular, began with psychedelics or other hallucinogens. The American mystic and psychonaut Terence McKenna proposed that human cognitive evolution was catalysed by a prehistoric psychedelic and that some of our modern issues, including myopia, might reflect our alienation from regular psychedelic use. With the rise of two industries, psychedelic tourism and clinical medicinal use, these stories have become commonplace mantras, often tinged with a therapeutic flair.It makes sense why these claims are so popular. As psychedelics prove effective for treating disorders like addiction and anxiety, scientists and enthusiasts push for their broader societal acceptance. Connecting psychedelics – and particularly, psychedelic therapy – to ancient worldwide traditions makes them, according to historian Erika Dyck, “more natural, more wholesome, perhaps more spiritual”.But is there any truth to these stories? In 2018, I met a man who set out to answer that question. Martin Fortier was a young anthropologist, philosopher and cognitive scientist based at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. Like Brabec de Mori, he worked with Shipibo-Konibo communities in the Peruvian Amazon. His interests were wide-ranging, but the project I found most exciting was a database he called Huthac, or “Hallucinogenic Use Through History and Across Cultures”. It was, he said, “the first academic source exhaustively documenting hallucinogenic use”.It was a gloriously ambitious undertaking, meant to include more than a thousand cultures. To build it, Fortier scoured hundreds of sources, including academic books, historical chronicles, and the diaries of explorers. For every mention of hallucinogens, he noted who used them, how they were used, whether they were used in hallucinogenic doses and how reliable the evidence was.View image in fullscreenA drawing of Piltzintecuhtli, one of the deities described in the Codex Borgia Español.Photograph: AlamyThe project promised to be the largest, most systematic survey of drug use across human societies. Unfortunately, it was never finished. In April 2020, at the age of 30, he died of cancer. Before his death, he published his preliminary findings in a series of posts on his Facebook page, sparking a small academic firestorm. He found that reliable evidence for early psychedelic usage was limited to the Rio Grande area (the modern-day border between the US and Mexico) and southward. And even in those regions, usage was rare. In pre-Columbian times, Fortier estimated, only 5% of Indigenous American groups used psychedelics – and this, he wrote, “is probably a very liberal estimate”. By these counts, 1% or less of the world’s cultures consumed psychedelics at this time.Fortier’s tally was limited to classic, or serotonergic, psychedelics: substances like DMT, mescaline, psilocybin and anything else whose effects mostly come from activating serotonin 2A receptors. But even if we expand to a broader usage – including drugs like ibogaine, deliriants and dissociatives – hallucinogenic use remains marginal by his count. “These findings deeply challenge the view that hallucinogenic use is very ancient and belongs to an ancestral shamanic tradition that would have migrated from Siberia to the New World,”he wrote. “More broadly, they also challenge the view that most archaic cultures used hallucinogens.”Other research has echoed Martin’s findings. In his 2006 book Shroom, the ecologist Andy Letcher investigated every presumed case of traditional hallucinogenic mushroom consumption in history. He confirmed only two: the use of psilocybin mushrooms in pre-Columbian Mexico and the use of Amanita muscaria mushrooms by scattered groups in northern Eurasia.Last year, a team of researcherspublished a paperthat suggested that Basotho healers in Lesotho add psilocybin mushrooms to psychoactive brews that are fed to patients. As of this writing, ethnographic research has yet to be conducted, but, if confirmed, this would be the only direct evidence of the hallucinogenic use of serotonergic psychedelics in traditional contexts outside the Americas.If Fortier and Letcher are right, psychedelics have been the exception in the history of humanity, not the rule. Yes, some peoples used them before a couple of hundred years ago, but they aren’t nearly as common as we’ve come to believe, and various popular examples seem relatively recent.Still, some scholars disagree. Of the holdouts, most point to art and literature. They cite shroomy figures in cave paintings and descriptions of lost rituals involving mind-altering substances. To be fair, compelling symbolic evidence exists for some cases recognised by Fortier and Letcher. Pre-Hispanic manuscripts from Mexico, for example, depicted mythological figures holding and even eating mushrooms. The Codex Vindobonensis, a 52-page document made of tanned deer hide in the early 1500s, has one such scene. Near the bottom right, we find the solar deity Piltzintecuhtli, the “Prince of Flowers”, holding a pair of mushrooms and crying, which some scholars take as a sign of trance. Nearby, seven gods are shown sitting and holding mushrooms, possibly representing a night-time mushroom ceremony. Along with other codices, the Codex Vindobonensis suggests that mushroom use was ritualised, mythologised and ensconced into Mesoamerican societies when the Spanish arrived.A separate set of discoveries, however, raises the possibility that mushroom consumption extends earlier and spans much more of the globe than Fortier and Letcher concede. In 2019, Michael Winkelman published “Evidence for entheogen use in prehistory and world religions” in the Journal of Psychedelic Studies. The article is a smorgasbord of supposed artistic and literary indications of ancient hallucinogens, listing sculptures, cave art and passages of mythology. Yet, as Letcher warned more than a decade earlier, “none of these inferences is unequivocal, and each is open to a range of alternative explanations”.Let’s review a couple of examples. Winkelman presents what he calls “the mushroom stones of Chucuito”, large sculptures with domed caps and elongated stems discovered in highland Peru. It’s certainly possible that these were made to resemble mushrooms. Yet Winkelman fails to acknowledge the leading interpretation of these statues – that they’re penises. In fact, the site’s local name – Inka Uyo – might come from the Quechua word for penis. Winkelman includes a picture of some “mushroom stones” yet does not present the most prominent statue, which towers above the others and has a large groove resembling the external opening of the urethra.Or take what might be the best-known example of ancient psychedelic iconography: the mushroom shaman, first popularised in Terence McKenna’s book Food of the Gods (1992). McKenna’s image is of Algerian rock art dated to between 7,000 and 9,000 years ago. It shows a bee-faced figure in a sumo squat, feathers poking out of its head and a chequerboard of dots covering its body and spilling out from its legs. Most notably, it holds batches of mushrooms, another 50 or so sprouting from its limbs and torso.The mushroom shaman is an icon of the psychedelic community. You can find it printed on shirts, mugs, paintings and face masks. But as Letcher discovered, the popular image “is not a photo of the original, but a copy” made by McKenna’s wife at the time, Kat Harrison. In fact, Harrison never saw the original painting, but instead deciphered a photograph in a book. And rather than copying the photo, she filled in features she thought were damaged or incomplete. Harrison’s drawing clearly shows a supernatural figure blossoming with mushrooms, but “whether that was the intention of the original artist[s] is far from settled,” wrote Letcher. An earlier archaeologist thought it was a sheep-man.“The role of psilocybin mushrooms in the ancient evolution of human religions is attested to [in] fungiform petroglyphs, rock artefacts and mythologies from all major regions of the world,” asserts Winkelman. We’ve seen that at least some of the petroglyphs and artifacts are open to alternative interpretations. But what do we make of mushrooms starring in the world’s mythologies? The Wassons, remember, had made a similar claim. Does it hold up?I conducted a simple test using the electronic Human Relations Area Files, a repository based at Yale that contains nearly 7,000 digitised books and articles by anthropologists, missionaries and others, covering hundreds of human societies. The topics of each paragraph in the files have been manually tagged. As of August 2023, 51,025 paragraphs, covering 325 cultural groups, were about mythology. How many of those include the words “mushroom” or “mushrooms”? Just 22. Those appeared in 19 cultures. For the most part, these mentions do not ascribe mushrooms any supernatural power, with fungi instead appearing as asides or scenery. Mushrooms appear very little in this collection of mythology, even compared to culturally important psychoactive plants with far smaller ranges, like peyote and kava.View image in fullscreenAn image representing a local woman smoking cigarettes with ‘magic mushrooms’ seen at the entrance to the Cenote Canunchen in Homun, Mexico.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesThis was a preliminary search. I invite others to do larger and more careful versions. But it is an attempt to probe the world’s mythology using methods that are systematic and unbiased.Rather than cherrypicking a couple of ambiguous examples and forcing a once-universal fungus cult on to them, I searched for mushrooms in possibly the most comprehensive resource on the world’s mythology. And I found squat.People don’t just claim that psychedelics are old and widespread; they also believe that the modern therapeutic use echoes ancient shamanic traditions. As UCLA psychiatry professor Charles Grob explained in an interview with Gwyneth Paltrow’s wellness brand Goop, “The shaman would administer these compounds only for very clear circumscribed reasons, such as an initiation rite or a healing ceremony to address individuals with severe medical or psychological problems.”Reasonable, right? A patient comes to the shaman with a psychological problem, like depression or existential angst. The shaman administers the psychedelic, and the patient is healed. It’s like visiting a psychiatrist, except with more ritual.But this is a misleading characterisation of how shamans have traditionally used psychedelics. The best way to appreciate this is to simply watch them taking the substances. An easily accessible depiction of shamans using psychedelics is anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon’s 1973 short documentary Magical Death, which portrays shamanism among the Yanomami of Venezuela. The film’s beginning shows the shaman Dedeheiwa healing illness. He snorts a psychedelic snuff powder and calls spirits, which he experiences as entering his feet and climbing through his body. He draws on their power to remove illness and battle evil spirits. No patients consume psychedelics, and there’s no mention of treating mental disorders.If the beginning represents a slight divergence from the popular story, the next part of the film is a total overhaul. Intent on killing babies in an enemy village, a squad of shamans snorts the snuff. Some shamans act like helpless babies. Others bend over the ashes and imitate murderous spirits devouring the babies’ souls. As proof of their success, Dedeheiwa and another shaman act like dying babies, writhing “in agony in the ashes”.Psychedelic shamanism here is nothing like the view endorsed on Goop. Anthropological research conducted since the mid-20th century shows that, among the Yanomami and many other groups, shamans use psychedelics to tap into the supernatural and provide services like weather change, divination, physical healing and aggressive sorcery. They might confront heinous sorcerers. They might purge patients of treacherous ghosts. They might become supernatural beings themselves.Psychedelics – like dancing, drumming, darkness and other psychotropic drugs – push shamans into states where they and their communities believe them to access otherworldly powers. This contrasts with the western clinical application, where psychedelics are administered like medicine and used to break down patients’ harmful patterns of thought.This misconception seems to stem partly from biased interpretations of anthropological data. When I asked Charles Grob for sources describing the psychotherapeutic use of psychedelics, he pointed me to Marlene Dobkin de Rios, who conducted research on ayahuasca use among Peruvian mestizos in the 1960s and 1970s – groups that have been subjected to the influence of Christian missionaries for the last four centuries. There are obvious limitations with making inferences about “typical” psychedelic shamanism using religious and medicinal practices so profoundly shaped by European colonialism. As Dobkin de Rios herself has written, throughout the Peruvian Amazon, “influences of Roman Catholic proselytisation, mixed with medieval metaphysical beliefs, and influenced by evangelical Protestantism, are widespread”.Putting those issues aside, Dobkin de Rios’s work is still much less a confirmation of the Goop view than a demonstration of its Euro-American flair. Consider her book A Hallucinogenic Tea, Laced with Controversy (2008), co-authored with the Peruvian journalist Roger Rumrrill. She and Rumrrill compared Amazonian shamans who treat western tourists with those who work with locals. The tourist healers charge sums usually impossible for locals to pay. And they embody the Goop view: they treat psychological distress by administering ayahuasca to patients.“These tourists come to try to resolve personal problems,” said healer Guillermo Arévalo in an interview published in the book. According to the authors, Arévalo had a university degree in pharmacology and was the owner of Espíritu de Anaconda, a healing centre that charged foreigners 40 to 50 dollars per day at the time of the interview. “They suffer a type of psychosis and psychological upheaval. They suffer from fear, paranoia and other problems. These patients are ones that I treat with ayahuasca.”The mindfulness conspiracyRead moreThe authors contrasted these tourist shamans with those who treated locals. “Ayahuasca played an important role in this worldview where evil men and women would be able to bewitch their enemies and cause them illness, bad luck and even death,” they wrote. Shamans used ayahuasca to contact supernatural realms and identify and battle witches causing misfortune. Insofar as ayahuasca was used to treat distress, this meant combating evil.“What a difference,” they wrote, “from the psychodynamic worldview of Freud and contemporary western psychology.”For Erika Dyck, who has studied the history of attitudes about psychedelics, stories about traditional psychedelic use are rooted in financial and ideological goals. “A lot of the enthusiasm for investing in psychedelic drugs,” she said, stems from an expectation that they will bring “a paradigm shift in the way we think about mental disorders.” Our stories reflect that goal. We portray shamans around the world as psychotherapists and psychopharmacologists. We imagine how we want to use psychedelics and then project those imaginings on to cultures we know little about.Adapted from Shamanism: The Timeless Religion by Manvir Singh, which will be published by Allen Lane on 20 May.

His lawyers say the charges are politically motivated.Besigye, a four-time presidential candidate and longtime opponent of Museveni, is one of more than 1,000 civilians, including activists and other politicians, who have been charged in military courtssince 2002.In January, Uganda’s supreme court ruled that trying civilians in military courts was unconstitutional and ordered the transfer of trials involving civilians to ordinary courts. Museveni rejected the ruling as the“wrong decision”and vowed to continue using military courts.After a 10-day hunger strike by Besigye in February, authorities moved his trial to a civilian court. But theUgandaLaw Society says the government has not transferred other people’s cases.In the latest twist, the government is planning to introduce a law to allow military tribunals to try civilians for some offences. Norbert Mao, the minister for justice and constitutional affairs, told parliament on 17 April that the draft legislation was awaiting cabinet approval before introduction in parliament.Paul Mwiru, a politician with Bobi Wine’s National Unity Platform party, said Museveni’s administration was using state institutions to instil fear and had “made the judicial system to be inclined” in its favour.Mwiru, a former MP, was charged in a civilian court with treason in 2018 alongside Wine and 31 other people for allegedly throwing stones at Museveni’s motorcade during chaos at a byelection campaign.

If they want to deny you the opportunity to participate in the electoral process, they can do that,” said Mwiru, who plans to contest for a parliamentary seat again next year.Bobi Wine to run for president in Uganda’s 2026 election ‘if I am still alive and not in jail’Read moreNovember was not the first time Besigye, a former army colonel, had been tried in a military court. In 2005, four years after retiring from the military and running for the first time as a presidential candidate, he was charged with terrorism and possession of firearms.Other civilians who have been prosecuted in military courts include Wine, themusician-turned-politicianwho has said he will stand again next year, former opposition MP Michael Kabaziguruka and Besigye’s lawyer Eron Kiiza. The list also includes opposition supporters, as well as other political opponents and government critics.Critics say repression extends to civilian courts too, with dissidents and government critics charged there being subjected to lengthy trials, denial of bail and detentions without trial. Besigye and Lutale were this month denied bail for their case. They remain in custody.Government and military spokespeople have been approached for comment. Museveni has repeatedly defended using military courts for civilians, saying it was necessary for the east African country’s peace and stability.

Later, in 2005, the state amended legislation regulating the military to create a legal framework to allow the military to court martial civilians.View image in fullscreenThe prominent opposition politician Bobi Wine (centre) before appearing at a court martial in Gulu, northern Uganda, in August 2018.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesHuman rights activistssay the practice isunjust and unlawfuland frequently violates the right of accused people to a fair trial.In many instances over the years, Ugandan courts have ruled against the practice, but the process has continued. The latest ruling by the supreme court, arising from Kabaziguruka’s challenge of his trial in military court in 2016, is a litmus test.The government is fighting back with the planned introduction of the draft law that Mao, the justice minister, told lawmakers would define “exceptional circumstances under which a civilian may be subject to military law”.Museveni became president in 1986 after leading rebels in a six-year guerilla war to removePresident Milton Obote. He led the country to economic growth and democratic change after years of political decay.But critics say judicial independence has eroded in the country over the years. They have also condemned his long stay in office using what they say are strongman tactics to extend it indefinitely, including by amending the constitution twice to remain in power.The Museveni administration’s military roots influence the government’s operations, said Gerald Walulya, a senior lecturer at Makerere University in Kampala and a political analyst. “Because of their background as a government that came to power through a military kind of route, they tend to approach every aspect in a military manner,” he said.Mwambutsya Ndebesa, a historian, said Uganda was experiencing“the curse of liberation”, which he said made leaders feel entitled to power. “Those who have liberated people from repressive regimes in Africa have taken it upon themselves that they are entitled to rule,” he said.Ndebesa said the administration was “weaponising the justice system for political ends” to suppress political dissent, and that suppression had a “chilling effect” of creating fear in the political space.“The purpose is not only to suppress that very individual, but also to send a message to the political sphere.” he added.Explore more on these topicsUgandaYoweri MuseveniBobi WineAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

All appeared to be conscious as they were taken to hospital.Police arrested Yuki Yazawa, 28, an unemployed man from Higashimurayama city in Tokyo, at the scene. It is not clear why he was in Osaka.“I was just sick of everything so I decided to drive my car into the elementary school students to kill them,” Yazawa told police, according to NHK.Teachers from the primary school are reported to have pulled the suspect out of the car, where he had remained after driving into the children.A mother in her 20s who had come to pick up her son, and who saw the attack, told NHK: “The car was being driven erratically, and it seems that it continued to move forward even after it had hit the children.“My son was very shocked and has been crying the whole time. He only just started elementary school last month, and then something like this happened. It’s scary. I saw the man who had been driving the car. He was very quiet and appeared to be in a daze.”Another witness told NHK that the car reversed back into the children after crashing into them.An elementary school pupil told another news outlet, MBS News, that the man in the car had been “driving unsteadily”.“I was walking along the side of the road and the car and suddenly it almost drove into us. The second and third graders in front of me were injured and were bleeding from their heads after being trapped between the car and the wall,” the pupil said.A white SUV that appeared to be the one used by the suspect was being examined by police.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He estimates it will come crashing in at 150mph (242km/h), if it remains intact.“While not without risk, we should not be too worried,” Langbroek said in an email.The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn’t break apart, “the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,” he said.Nasa criticises China after space rocket makes uncontrolled return to EarthRead moreThe chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. “But it cannot be completely excluded.”The Soviet Union launched the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth orbit because of a rocket malfunction.Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself — a spherical object about 3ft (1 metre) in diameter — has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.It’s quite possible that the 1,000lb-plus (nearly 500kg) spacecraft will survive re-entry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, Jonathan McDowell at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, “it’ll re-enter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky”.The spacecraft could re-enter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America’s Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, “chances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean”, Langbroek said.In 2022, a Chinese booster rocket made an uncontrolled return to Earth and in 2018 the Tiangong-1 space station re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere over the south Pacific after anuncontrolled re-entry.Explore more on these topicsSpaceRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It would mark the first permission of its kind since Trump paused all Ukraine-related military aid shortly after taking office.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Thursday evening that the signing of the long-discussed minerals deal – on much better terms for Ukraine than had previously been expected – was a result of the meeting he held with Trumpon the sidelines of the pope’s funeralon Saturday.“Now we have the first result of the Vatican meeting, which makes it really historic. We are waiting for other results of the meeting,” he said, in his nightly video address.Zelenskyy hailed the deal as “truly equal”, saying it created “an opportunity for quite significant investment in Ukraine”.A senior aide saidKyivhoped that weapons deliveries would resume swiftly. “There is no direct link where it’s written that ‘you will receive these particular weapons’, but it opens the possibility for parallel talks on the purchase of weapons,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, an aide to Zelenskyy, during an interview in Kyiv. “The American side is now open to these discussions,” he added.Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, signed the agreement in Washington on Wednesday, along with the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Senior US officials told reporters that they expected Ukraine’s parliament to ratify the deal within a week. The agreement will see a joint fund set up by the two countries, to be financed from new licenses to exploit deposits of critical minerals, oil and gas.0:57White House lauds 'historic' US-Ukraine minerals deal – videoAfter several weeks when Trump appeared to be soft onRussiaand harsh towards Ukraine, authorities in Kyiv hope the dynamic may be changing. Zelenskyy said on Thursday the minerals agreement had “changed significantly during the process” and that it was “now a really equal agreement which allows for investment in Ukraine”.Most notably, it excludes from its remit money previously sent to Ukraine as military and humanitarian aid, which Trump had repeatedly said he hoped to recoup. It also explicitly states that it should be implemented in a way that does not hamper Ukraine’s integration with the EU and that US companies will not have a monopoly on deals in Ukraine, but merely obtain the right to take part in competitive bids on fair terms.The final document followed almost three months of back-and-forth negotiation, after the first outline was brought to Kyiv by Bessent and rejected by Zelenskyy as far too punitive to sign. A later signing ceremony was planned at the White House in February, but broke down afterTrump and JD Vance turned on Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, prompting an abrupt conclusion of talks and the Ukrainian president being asked to leave.Asked how Kyiv had been able to improve the terms of the minerals deal, Podolyak claimed that the actual discussions had proceeded in a very different tone to some of Trump’s public statements.“That’s just the style of this [US] administration, it’s very aggressive with communications. They will allow leaks of the most horrible conditions and so on, but then in reality they negotiate normally and you can achieve a result,” he said. “They just use this aggression to try to improve their starting position,” he added.Podolyak said that because US weapons supplied would now need to be bought, Kyiv would need to be more selective about what it requested from the US. “I think fairly quickly we will understand which types of weapons, to carefully select the unique weapons the US has. Because if we can produce our own drones, for example, then we will do that here. But there are some critical weapon types which only the US produces and nobody else,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I couldn’t believe it. I thought it was a prank. It’s the first time anything like this has happened to me. It’s a horrible feeling.“Why have I been targeted? I’ve been asking myself that ever since the notification arrived. I will – and we will – ask that question publicly of anyone who has the authority and the duty to answer. An answer is owed … to everyone who has an interest in knowing who, in this country, has torn to shreds the clear boundary between security and surveillance, between legality and abuse.”Pellegrino, who has been critical of Meloni’s government on social media, contacted researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, which tracks digital surveillance of civil society actors and helps to identify the kinds of spyware used in such attacks. Cancellato, Casarini, Caccia, Ferrari and Yambo were allegedly targeted with the military-grade Paragon software.Citing a person familiar with the matter, the Guardianreported in Februarythat Paragon had terminated its client relationship with Italy.It is not yet clear when Pellegrino’s mobile phone was attacked and whether Paragon was used in his case. Like other spyware vendors, Paragon sells its cyberweapon to government clients who are supposed to use it to prevent crime. The company has said that under its terms of service, government clients are not permitted to target journalists or other members of civil society.A Paragon spokesperson said: “Paragon requires all users of our technology to adhere to terms and conditions that preclude the illicit targeting of journalists and other civil society leaders. While we are not able to discuss individual customers, we have a zero-tolerance policy for violations of our terms of service.”In March during a classified meeting with Copasir, the Italian parliamentary committee for national security, Alfredo Mantovano, a cabinet undersecretary, admitted his government had approved the use of Paragon to spy on members of a humanitarian NGO because they were allegedly deemed a possible threat to national security.Copasir is investigating whether the secret services breached the law in using Paragon Solutions to monitor activists and journalists, and is expecting to report on its findings soon.John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, said he believed the Italian government, a confirmed former Paragon user, was “in a good position” to know whether the spyware had been used to target Pellegrino because it would have kept logs of deployments.“The Paragon affair is not over for Italy, and now is a critical moment for clear and transparent official communication,” Railton said.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropeEspionagePress freedomnewsShareReuse this content"

Worse, they hinder and alter brain development,” causing “a lasting alteration to their health and their intellectual capacities”.France to tighten mobile phone ban in middle schoolsRead moreCurrent recommendations inFranceare that children should not be exposed to screens before the age of three and have only “occasional use” between the ages of three and six in the presence of an adult.The societies suggest the ban on screens should apply at home and in schools.They wrote: “Neither the screen technology nor its content, including so-called ‘educational’ content, are adapted to a small developing brain.Childrenare not miniature adults: their needs are different needs.”They add that every day health professionals and infant school teachers “observe the damage caused by regular exposure to screens before they [children] enter elementary school: delayed language, attention deficit, memory problems and motor agitation”.The experts suggest regular exposure to screens – however brief – has also had a negative effect on children’s social and emotional development. They suggest the problem affects all social groups, but particularly disadvantaged households leading to greater “social inequalities”.Alternatives including “reading aloud, free play, board games or outdoor games, physical, creative and artistic activities”.The letter says: “It would occur to no one to let a child of under six cross the road on their own. Why then expose them to a screen when this compromises their health and their intellectual future?”Last year, a report commissioned by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, found that French three- to six-year-olds spent an average of 1 hour 47 minutes a day in front of a screen in 2014-15, the latest available research. Since then, however, only one of the commission’s recommendations, concerning the exposure of under-threes to screens, has been implemented.Former prime minister Gabriel Attal has gone further, proposing to ban children under 15 from social media, with an online “curfew” for 15- to 18-year-olds halting their access to social media at 10pm.Explore more on these topicsChildrenSmartphonesMobile phonesFranceHealthMental healthEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But Ukrainian analysts have noted that Kyiv has apparently been able to extract some major concessions, despite Donald Trump’s repeated claim thatUkraine“has no cards” to play.“Ukraine held the line. Despite enormous pressure, every overreaching demand from the other side was dropped. The final deal looks fair,” Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics, wrote on X.What are rare earth elements, and why does Trump want them from Ukraine?Read moreUkraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said on Thursday that his country would retain “full control over its subsoil, infrastructure and natural resources”. Notably absent from the final text was the insistence that Ukraine should repay previous military US assistance via the deal, something Trump has previously repeatedly demanded. Volodymyr Zelenskyy had rejected signing something that would obligate “10 generations” of Ukrainians to repay. Future potential military assistance to Ukraine, however, will count as investments.The signed agreement also makes it clear that its terms will not jeopardise Ukraine’s potential future integration with the EU, and also does not subject Ukraine to US legal jurisdiction. It does not lock Ukraine in to partnering only with the US on projects in future, and guarantees only access to bidding processes for US companies on fair terms.Ukraine mineral resources map“There’s no requirement to sell everything to the US, or to channel all investment through the fund. The obligation is to give the fund fair market access to future projects,” wrote Mylovanov.The original idea of some kind of “rare earths” deal was thought up by Zelenskyy’s team. It was part of a “victory plan” unveiled before the US election last year, with the specific goal of interesting Trump in an economic partnership, amid fears that a potentialTrump administrationwould not be as amenable to a values-based argument to support Ukraine as the Biden administration had been.However it seemed that the gambit had backfired when, soon after taking office, Trump dispatched the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, to Kyiv with the draft of an agreement that “looked like it had been written on the train”, according to one source. The plan appeared to lock Ukraine into all kinds of obligations, while offering Kyiv nothing in return by way of security guarantees, save the rather thin claim that Washington taking a stake in Ukraine’s economy was itself a kind of security guarantee.Since then, there have been various attempts to revise and revisit the terms of the deal. In late February, Zelenskyy was meant to sign it duringa meeting in Washington, but after the vice-president, JD Vance, goaded him into an argument in front of the cameras in the Oval Office, Ukraine’s president was kicked out of the White House without signing.Diplomacy dies on live TV as Trump and Vance gang up to bully Ukraine leaderRead moreEarlier this month, it transpired that the Ukrainian justice ministry had hired the US law firm Hogan Lovells to advise on the deal, according to filings with the US Foreign Agents Registration Act registry.The deal will need to be ratified by Ukraine’s parliament, while discussions will continue over the “technical agreement” that also needs to be finalised and signed. The overall agreement is unlikely to have a huge impact in terms of contracts signed as long as fighting between Ukraine and Russia continues, but the Zelenskyy team hope that getting it signed will increased goodwill towards Kyiv in the Trump administration. The US president in recent days has continued to paint Zelenskyyas a bigger obstacleto a peace deal than Vladimir Putin – although he has gradually inched towardscriticism of the Russian leader.The first rhetorical noises from Washington on the deal were positive. After signing the agreement, Bessent called it the start of a “historic economic partnership” and claimed it showed that the US remained committed to Ukraine as an ally.“This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centred on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,” said Bessent.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeMiningUS foreign policyTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

A prerecorded rehearsal of a torch-lighting ceremony was screened instead of the planned event.The Times of Israel newspaperdescribed“a surreal, fraught evening in which Israel is starting to mark its 77th Independence Day while firefighters battle some of the worst wildfires in its history”.In a speech at one ceremony, Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, said the wildfires were “part of a climate crisis that we must not ignore”.View image in fullscreenA man walks through a burnt garden shop in Mesilat Zion in central Israel.Photograph: John Wessels/AFP/Getty ImagesThe anniversary celebrations had already caused controversy after government ministers were heckled at some events for failing to bring back all the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and on Tuesdayrightwing activists attackeda synagogue where a joint Arab-Israeli memorial event was being screened.Political tensions are high after a turbulent few weeks with waves of protests anda public clashbetween Netanyahu and the head of the Shin Bet internal security service. Herzog called for an end to “polarisation” in Israel.Israel’s military said troops were helping in Jerusalem and other central districts. “Overnight dozens of engineering vehicles started operating throughout the country to form lines to prevent the fire from spreading into other trees,” it said in a statement. “The IAF [air force] continues assisting in the effort to extinguish the fires.”Israel’s firefighting service said 163 ground crews and 12 aircraft were working to contain the flames. Military planes have dropped hundreds of tonnes of retardant in an effort to stop the spread of the blaze.Magen David Adom, Israel’s medical rescue service, said it treated 23 people on Wednesday, mostly for smoke inhalation and burns. Seventeen firefighters were injured, according to the public broadcaster Kan.Witnesses described “walls of flame” surging across woodland on the slopes of the foothills west of Jerusalem, though the situation appeared to have improved on Thursday as winds dropped and a light rain fell.View image in fullscreenA firefighting aircraft douses a fire in the Latrun area in central Israel.Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPAThere has been some criticism of the response of emergency services. Speaking from near the city of Modiin as fires burned on a nearby hillside, Yuval Aharoni, 40, said: “It’s just very sad because we knew the weather, we kind of knew that would happen, and still we feel like they weren’t ready enough with the big planes that can drop large amounts of water.”Late on Wednesday, the foreign ministry said firefighting aircraft were expected to arrive from Croatia, France, Italy, Romania and Spain to join the operation.The fire and rescue service’s Jerusalem district commander, Shmulik Friedman, described “a very large wildfire, maybe the largest there has ever been in this country” and said the effort to contain the blaze would continue for “a very long time”.Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, hinted that the fires may have been deliberately started, though authorities have not presented any evidence to support such claims.AFP contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsraelWildfiresMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He has denied the charges.Johal claims he was forced to make a confession at the outset of his detention by signing a blank sheet of paper after police tortured him with electricity and brought petrol into his cell and threatened to burn him alive.A UN working party has claimed he is being held under arbitrary detention.A new letter to Lammy, signed by 117 cross-party MPs and peers, calls for urgent British diplomatic pressure.It says there is a “window of opportunity” to secure Johal’s release following his acquittal in the March case. The letter says: “The judgment on the evidence led is crucial and relevant to securing his release, because it is the same evidence that exists in the other outstanding federal court cases.”The campaign group Reprieve, which has been backing calls for his release, said it understood bail had been deferred because his case had become enmeshed in a broader consideration of the length of pre-trial detention in cases brought under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, a law human rights defenders claim has been abused to shut down civic freedoms in India.Reprieve said Johal’s continued detention on the same charges in a different court after his acquittal challenged the principle of double jeopardy, a risk recognised in Indian and international law.The Indian authorities do not claim Johal was directly involved in any of the attacks. All the cases are based on the same alleged confession.Johal’s brother Gurpreet Singh Johal, a Labour councillor in West Dunbartonshire, said: “I’m glad the foreign secretary is meeting me again, as it shows he recognises that this is a make-or-break moment for Jagtar.“The case against my brother has been tested in court and rejected, but the Indian authorities will keep him in prison for decades if the UK government doesn’t act to secure his release.“We’ve seen that today at the supreme court – just the latest in an endless series of delays. This is the moment of truth for David Lammy: will he live up to his promises, or will he fail Jagtar like the last six foreign secretaries did?”Dan Dolan, the deputy executive director of Reprieve, said: “This is a politically motivated prosecution of a young British human rights defender, and the process is the punishment. Jagtar has been found not guilty once, after prosecutors failed to present any credible evidence against him in seven years. For him to remain imprisoned for decades, as duplicate trials drag on in defiance of the principle of double jeopardy, would be an obscene injustice. It is time for the government to act on its strong statements in opposition and do what it takes to bring Jagtar home.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyIndiaDavid LammyScotlandSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

People living in the 20% most deprived areas of England were twice as likely to be admitted to hospital for respiratory diseases, seven times as likely for tuberculosis and six times for measles, than their counterparts from the least deprived areas.Chart showing rates of hospital admissions for infectious diseases by quintile of deprivationThe analysis also revealed stark ethnic inequalities. Although admission rates were low overall for tuberculosis, emergency hospital admissions for the disease were 15 times higher for people from a black African background compared with those categorised as white British.It was also estimated that these inequalities in emergency admissions for infectious diseases cost theNHSin England between £970m and £1.5bn in 2022-23.Chart showing rates of hospital admissions for infectious diseases by ethnic groupProf David Taylor-Robinson, an academic co-director at Health Equity North and professor of public health and policy at the University of Liverpool, said: “This report echoes past research showing that deprived communities, typically in the North of England, bear the brunt of health inequalities.“It is particularly troubling to see the high number of hospital admissions due to infectious diseases, especially as some of these are preventable diseases.”Doctors urge government to fight poverty after rise in patients with Victorian diseasesRead moreHe added: “Our previous analysis has shown that childhood vaccine uptake in England has plummeted among the most disadvantaged families. This is against a backdrop of cuts to local government, pressures on the NHS, and the growing number of children living in poverty.“Protecting children from vaccine-preventable diseases should be a public health priority, otherwise we will see more hospitalisations and deaths from these entirely preventable diseases.”Dr Leonora Weil, the interim deputy director for health equity and inclusion at UKHSA, said the report revealed some “stark” facts on the state of inequalities in health security faced by some people, “in particular those living in the most deprived communities and certain areas of the country, some ethnic groups, as well as excluded groups such as those experiencing homelessness.“These health-protection inequalities – where there are poorer health outcomes based on where you live, your socioeconomic status or ethnicity – are avoidable, pervasive and preventable. That is why it is so important to shine a light on these findings to increase action to support communities to live longer and in better health.”She added: “This report is just the start. We need to build on these insights, as only through persistent and dedicated effort across all health organisations will we make a real difference to helping all people live longer and in better health.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This shocking report shows the appalling healthcare inequalities this government inherited.“Our Plan for Change is reforming the NHS to get it back on its feet so it is there for everyone, regardless of who they are or where they live. We have hit the ground running, delivering an extra 3 million appointments since July to cut waiting lists.Explore more on these topicsHealthInequalityNHSEnglandPovertynewsShareReuse this content"

Labour officials in the constituency on Thursday said the contest appeared too tight to predict.View image in fullscreenThe Dunham Hill and Hapsford village hall polling station in the Runcorn and Helsby constituency; a Reform win here would set off new jitters in Downing Street.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianOther overnight results will include the mayoralties in GreaterLincolnshire, where Reform is hopeful of taking the newly created post, and Doncaster, which is Labour-held and where the party believes it can win again.However, the bulk of the council votes will not be counted before Friday morning, with many results not finalised until well into the afternoon.Results are seen as particularly hard to predict given the atomised polling figures, with Reform, Labour and the Conservatives each recording national support generally between 20% and 25%, and the Lib Dems and Greens not notably far behind.One thing that does seem certain is that the Conservatives will lose many hundreds of council seats, in part because they did so well in 2021 when the same seats were last contested, amid the brief fillip of Boris Johnson’s “vaccine bounce”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is understood the retailer first realised it was being targeted earlier this week.Harrods said in a statement: “We recently experienced attempts to gain unauthorised access to some of our systems. Our seasoned IT security team immediately took proactive steps to keep systems safe and as a result we have restricted internet access at our sites today.”The retailer said it was not asking customers to take any action, indicating that it did not suspect data had been accessed. It added: “We will continue to provide updates as necessary.”The problems at Harrods, first reported by Sky News, emerged as M&S continues to battle problems caused by a cyber incident that has beenlinked to the hacking collective Scattered Spider.More than £650m has been wiped off the stock market value of the company as its website has been forced to stop orders for almost a week. There are also gaps on shelves in stores as the company’s automated stock systems are not working and its loyalty scheme and gift card payments have been disrupted.On Thursday it emerged that M&S has been forced topause hiring new workers.The company said it had pulled all online job postings from its website as its recruitment systems were on hold while tech experts deal with the consequences of a hack which has also forced M&S to close its online shop.A message on M&S’s jobs website said: “Sorry you can’t search or apply for roles right now, we’re working hard to be back online as soon as possible.”The company, which employs about 65,000 people in its stores and London head office, had no jobs listed anywhere across its UK business on Thursday despite having more than 200 job openings the previous week.A spokesperson said: “While we proactively manage the cyber incident, we are temporarily pausing some of our normal processes so we can continue to work hard on offering the best M&S for our customers and colleagues. Job adverts will be up again in due course.”The Co-op has also had toshut down some internal systemsand warned staff to keep cameras on during online conferencing after detecting an attempted hack. Stores and online business continue to operate as usual.Retailers are on high alert as many use the same systems as M&S and the Co-op, SAP, so potential hackers could try to use the same methods in many businesses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Metropolitan police confirmed on Wednesday that detectives from its cybercrime unit, assisted by colleagues from the National Crime Agency, were investigating the attack on M&S.Richard Horne, chief executive of the NCSC, said the cyber incidents should “act as a wake-up call to all organisations”. He urged businesses “to ensure they have appropriate measures in place to help prevent attacks and respond and recover effectively”.He added: “The NCSC continues to work closely with organisations that have reported incidents to us to fully understand the nature of these attacks and to provide expert advice to the wider sector based on the threat picture.”Retailers and their suppliers have faced a series of cyber-attacks in recent years including Morrisons,which was affected by an incident at its tech supplier, Blue Yonder, in the run-up to Christmas last year.In 2023 WH Smith washit by an attackin which company data was accessed illegally, including the personal details of current and former employees. That came less than a year after a cyber-attack on WH Smith’s Funky Pigeon website forced it tostop taking ordersfor about a week.Explore more on these topicsHarrodsRetail industryE-commerceInternet safetyCybercrimenewsShareReuse this content"

The bill would only allow terminally ill people with fewer than six months to live to end their lives.The document, which has been prepared by civil servants, will also assess equality and human rights issues.The timing of the release has caused some anger among MPs who suggested the report was being deliberately released to coincide with the aftermath of the local elections. But one government source denied it was a deliberate comms ploy. “When something like this is ready, you can’t sit on it,” they said.The Labour MP Meg Hillier, whovoted against the bill, said: “Releasing this long-delayed impact assessment while MPs are focused on local election counts far from Westminster and only weeks before the bill comes back to parliament is another example of the failure of this process to live up to the promises made to MPs at second reading.“This is a weighty piece of legislation, with significant changes from second reading, such as theremoval of the high court judge. It’s essential that MPs have a real opportunity for proper scrutiny and improvement to do justice to a bill of such consequence and to all those potentially impacted by it.”MPs will vote again on the private member’s bill, sponsored by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, on 16 May after it was delayed by three weeks to avoid a clash with local elections and allow more time for the impact assessment to be prepared.The Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, is said to have resisted calls for the final Commons stage to be wrapped up that day and – should the bill pass in May – a final vote is expected on 13 June.Campaigners who oppose the change have stepped up efforts in recent weeks to get wavering MPs to change their minds and vote against the bill in a fortnight’s time.Labour MPs organised a “committee of the unheard” with campaigners against the bill who were not among those experts chosen to give evidence to the bill’s scrutiny committee. The bill had a majority of 55 at the last parliamentary vote, needing 28 MPs to change sides.But those in favour of the bill believe there are few who are changing their minds – just two have gone public so far.“Every media outlet that is looking to run ‘support draining away’ stories has so far failed to identify a single MP other than two from Reform who have switched to opposing the bill,” one of those backing the bill said.“MPs now have the chance to examine a bill that has been made even stronger and safer when it returns to the Commons on 16 May. They will make their own minds up and not be influenced by opponents who claim to know what they think but don’t.”The government has taken a neutral position on the bill, with MPs voting according to their conscience. Plans are being drawn up in the Department ofHealthand Social Care for the care minister, Stephen Kinnock, to take over the implementation of the bill should it pass the Commons. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has said he opposes the bill.Since the initial vote, the high court’s role in approving assisted deaths has been scrapped and replaced by a panel of experts. Additionally, the implementation period has been doubled to a maximum of four years for an assisted dying service to be in place.The legislation argues that someone in England andWaleswho is terminally ill, with fewer than six months to live, should be legally allowed to end their life, as long as it has been approved by two doctors and an expert panel.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingNHSHealthEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

It wasn’t immediately clear if the evictions were a result of that order, but homeless advocates seized on the timing on Thursday, as US Forest Service officers blocked the access road.“The fact that they are doing this with such vigor shortly after they announced that the forests would be opened up for logging I don’t think is a coincidence,” said Jesse Rabinowitz, a spokesperson for the NationalHomelessnessLaw Center.Trump orders swathes of US forests to be cut down for timberRead moreThe US Department of Agriculture, which oversees the US Forest Service, and the service’s Pacific Northwest Region did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.“The closure does not target any specific user group and will restrict all access, including day use and overnight camping, while crews operate heavy machinery, conduct prescribed burns, and clean up hazardous materials,” Deschutes national forest spokesperson Kaitlyn Webb said in an email. “It’s not safe for the public to be in the area while heavy machinery is operating, trees are being felled, mowing operations are active, and prescribed burning is occurring.”Campers who had set up trailers, recreational vehicles and tents amidst the ponderosa pines in the Deschutes national forest scrambled in the darkness Wednesday night to pack up and get their engines working again. Authorities closed the two-lane road in the early hours of Thursday morning, and it was not immediately clear how many people were left in the forest by the afternoon, though some were unable to leave.The US Forest Service has been working for years on plans to close part of the Deschutes national forest near Bend for forest restoration and wildfire mitigation. But the number of people living in that part of the forest has grown, with many losing homes during the coronavirus pandemic due to job losses and high housing costs, Rabinowitz said.Donald Trump’s administration has acted toroll back environmental safeguardsaround future logging projects on more than half of US national forests, under an emergency designation that cites dangers from wildfires.Whether the administration’s move will boost lumber supplies as Trump envisioned in an executive order he signed in March remains to be seen. Joe Biden’s administration also sought more logging in public forests to combat fires, which have become more intense amid drier and hotter conditions linked to the climate crisis, yet US Forest Service timber sales stayed relatively flat under his tenure.The Cabin Butte Vegetation Management Project, a wildfire mitigation treatment on some 30,000 acres (12,000 hectares), is prompting the closures in the Deschutes national forest.The goal of the work is to reduce wildfire risk and restore damaged habitats where development encroaches on natural areas near Bend, Deschutes national forest officials said in a statement. Recreation sites and trails in that area will be closed through April next year.Multiple US Forest Service officials and vehicles were stationed at the Deschutes national forest road closure on Thursday. A sign on the metal gate blocking the road said the temporary emergency closure will last at least one year.Violators could face up six months in jail, fines up to $5,000, or both.On Wednesday night, Mandy Bryant, who said she had lived in the encampment for about three years, was cleaning up her site and trying to get a trailer to start so she could move it.“You could feel the heaviness in the air and just the stress and depression that people are feeling,” she told the Associated Press. “We’re up there on the list of groups of people that society doesn’t really care for.”Four people living in the encampment including Bryant, along with two homeless advocates, filed for a restraining order to stop the closure earlier this month. The claim argued it would cause irreparable harm to more than 100 people who were living there, many of whom have disabilities.These people protected US forests and lands. Their jobs have now vanished due to TrumpRead moreThe government responded in court filings that US Forest Service staff in January began notifying homeless people living in the area of the upcoming closure. Original plans for the project were published in 2019 and were authorized by the US Forest Service in 2023, the court filings said.US district court judge Michael McShane denied the restraining order on Tuesday and issued a written opinion on Thursday.“The public’s significant interest in restoring natural habitats, preventing catastrophic wildfires, and preserving the overall health of Deschutes National Forest is not outweighed by the interest of 150 or so individuals in residing on this particular plot of land,” he wrote in his ruling.Webb, a Deschutes national forest spokesperson, told the Oregonian/OregonLive that the government’s goal is “voluntary compliance”, but Forest Service officers and staff will patrol and “enforce the closure and ensure public safety”.Explore more on these topicsOregonHomelessnessWest CoastWildfiresUS wildfiresDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Analysts had predicted revenue of $94.5bn and earnings of $1.62. The company, worth $3.2tn, has beaten Wall Street’s expectations for the previous four quarters.Investors have been keepingtheir eyes on Apple as it prepared to report its financial results . The tech giant has been working to calm nervous analysts afterDonald Trumplevied sweepingtariffson countries around the world that are likely to complicate supply chains for consumer electronics. Since the beginning of the year, Apple’s stock has slumped 16%.During a call with investors on Thursday,AppleCEO Tim Cook said that he expects the tariffs to add $900m to its costs for the upcoming quarter that ends in June. That’s assuming, he said, that the global tariff rates don’t change again. Cook declined to speculate further into the future, saying,:“I’m not sure what will happen with the tariffs … It’s very difficult to predict beyond June.”In after-hours trading, the company’s stock dropped by more than 4%, likely due to the tariffs news and its services division reporting revenue that missed Wall Street’s expectations, despite growth over last year. The division covers iCloud subscriptions and revenue from various licensing deals. Sales inChinaalso missed estimates.Cook, remained positive, however, saying that the company was reporting “strong quarterly results” and “we’re very engaged on the tariff discussions”.White House insists iPhones will be US-made – but Apple calls it a non-starterRead moreThe iPhone maker is heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing for its phones, tablets and laptops. Days after Trump instituted soaring tariffs on China, at one pointas high as 245%, the president said he wouldmake an exceptionfor consumer electronics.Cook spoke to senior White House officials around this time, according to theWashington Post. It was after these conversations that Trump announced his exception for consumer electronics. Apple’s stock rose 7% in the days after the announcement.However, it is unclear how lasting the reprieve may be. Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, hascalled the exemption “temporary”, and even Trump later said on social media that there’s been no “exception”.The president has repeatedly said he wants to see more manufacturing in the US. In February, he met with Cook to discuss investing in US manufacturing. “He’s going to start building,” Trump said after the meeting. “Very big numbers – you have to speak to him. I assume they’re going to announce it at some point.”JP Morgan estimates costs would skyrocket for Apple if it moves production to the US, saying in a note this week that it could “drive a 30% price increase in the near-term, assuming a 20% tariff on China”. JP Morgan and other analysts have said Apple could continue to move more of its manufacturing to India, which only faces a 10% tariff.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump tariffs are ‘category 5 price storm’Read moreApple chartered jets toairlift some $2bn worth of iPhones from Indiato the US earlier this month to boost inventory in anticipation of price hikes from Trump’s tariffs and panic-buying by worried consumers. This comes as investors have expressed concerned about decreasing iPhone sales in China, the world’s biggest smartphone market. During its last earnings in January, Apple reported thatiPhone sales fellby 11.1% in China in the first quarter and missed Wall Street’s expectations for iPhone revenue.Cook said during the investor call that China would continue to be a major manufacturer for the company, but that for the June quarter India would be producing more iPhones for Apple and Vietnam would make more iPads and Macs. “The existing tariffs that apply to Apple today depend on products’ country of origin,” he said. India and Vietnam have lower tariffs than China.In the short term, analysts say the tariff confusion could benefit Apple as people rush to buy more of its products in fear that prices will rise.“What remains to be seen in the longer term is how much of any increased cost will be passed on to consumers,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, principal analyst for Forrester. “And if [consumers] will absorb these price increases without pulling back on demand for Apple products.”Explore more on these topicsAppleQuarterly resultsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationiPhoneSmartphonesnewsShareReuse this content"

But it left Kissinger free to conduct American foreign policy virtually single-handed, at least until Nixon was forced from office.Today’s context is different, though hardly less turbulent.Trump has just completed perhaps the mostextreme first 100 daysof US presidential history, producing a sea of uncertainty, upending the country’s international alliances, shattering democratic and legal norms at home, and leaving even its future status as the world’s leading democracy unsure.Trump moves Mike Waltz from national security adviser to UN ambassador roleRead moreThis unpredictable landscape is what confronts Rubio in his new position.An orthodox Republican in foreign policy matters, Rubio, 53, has frequently appeared uncomfortable – occasionally miserable, even – during the first three months at the state department under Trump, never more so than during the disastrous clash with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February, when the Ukrainian president subjected to a public browbeating by the president and JD Vance in the Oval Office.In the Senate, he had been one of Ukraine’s staunchest supporters against Russia’s invasion. He then saw that principled position so openly and brutally overturned and was forced to justify the volte face in public as Trump has conspicuously sympathised with Vladimir Putin.Equally galling has been Elon Musk’s gleefulguttingof USAID, America’s main foreign assistance agency – which Rubio has previously championed and which fell within his purview as secretary of state – under the auspices of the tech billionaire’s unofficial “department of government efficiency” project, also known as Doge.The tensions led to a shouting match between the two men in front of Trump, with Rubio reportedly responding aggressively to Musk’s accusation that he had failed in the mission of firing enough state department staff.Despite that unpromising background, Rubio – who was once tipped as a future president – now suddenly finds himself, in addition to being in charge of a still mighty department, having direct access to the inner workings of the White House and to the president himself.Even if it has come about thanks to the default of the less-than-surefooted Waltz – whose credibility never recovered from inadvertently inviting one of Trump’s least favourite journalists on to to aSignal chatabout strikes on Yemeni Houthis – it is quite the turnaround.It puts Rubio in the same vantage point from which Kissinger, the renowned exponent of realpolitik and great power balances, carved out a role as arguably the US’s most influential – if highly controversial – foreign policy strategist of the 20th century.With Trump just as consumed with domestic political enemies as Nixon ever was, it raises the unexpected question of whether Rubio can achieve the same level of prominence.It seems unlikely. Yet even two months ago, who would have guessed that the once-derided “Little Marco” would hold the levers of power of two separate institutions in his hands?Explore more on these topicsMarco RubioDonald TrumpUS foreign policyTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

So many things are getting disrupted’Pittsburgh residents, workers and business owners react to the increasingly fraught trading reality now upending supply chains and hitting pricesHeather Stewartin PittsburghThu 1 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 12.28 EDTShare“In a lot of ways it feels like Covid 2.0. So many things are getting disrupted so quickly.” Like so many businesses across Donald Trump’s America, Matt Katase’s craft brewery, Brew Gentlemen, is having to contend with a bafflingly uncertain trading environment.The brewery’s chief operating officer, Alaina Webber, says: “For the first time, as a company in operation going on 15 years, we’ve started to get explicit emails that say: ‘On this existing order, you are now going to see a 30%, then to a 130% increase.’”The brewery is based in Braddock, in the Allegheny valley, in the eastern suburbs of Pittsburgh, where the Scots-born industrialist Andrew Carnegie opened his first steel mill about 150 years ago, founding an industry that underpinned the industrialisation of America.Today, the vast mill is still in operation, but the tariffs Trump claims will restore the glory of rust-belt towns such as this have inflicted chaos on thousands of firms across the region.Anything imported carries a 10% levy; steel and aluminium, 25%; Chinese products, 145%. And much higher “reciprocal” tariffs on many other countries hang in the balance.For Brew Gentlemen, the tariffs even threaten a consignment of bespoke Chinese-made beer tap handles, which are waiting at the docks while it negotiates the price with their supplier. “Those are now sitting in customs and they’ll sit there for quite a while,” says Webber.The brewery had to transform rapidly during the Covid pandemic, switching from selling beer to locals in its taproom to focusing 100% on manufacturing.View image in fullscreenBrew Gentlemen co-owners Alaina Webber and Matt Katase.Photograph: Stephanie Strasburg/The GuardianNow, just as it hoped for a “normal” year, the cost of many of the inputs to the brewing process is in flux.“You can’t instantly start growing New Zealand hops in America,” says Katase, its co-founder. “We use a lot of American hops, but then we have beers that use Australian or New Zealand hops and we have malt that comes from Canada. If you’re trying to make a traditional German lager, yeah, you kind of need German malt.”At the other end of town, outside the vast Edgar Thomson steel mill, workers gathered in a union social hall are reluctant to chat.One man says he and his mates are divided about the merits of the long-running takeover battle for the plant’s owner US Steel, by Japan’s Nippon Steel. “That’s a tricky subject,” he says.But he holds out hope that Trump’s tariffs will bring change to towns like this, where shops are shuttered and many of the clapboard houses have broken windows. “I think they might work, because we have been taking a beating lately,” the steelworker says. “America’s been robbed and abused and I think it’s time that we start taking care of our own, and they start taking care of theirs.”The international president of the Pittsburgh-based United Steelworkers union, David McCall, has praised Trump’s tariffs, calling them “a crucial means of reining in bad actors who view access to the US market as a right, not a privilege.”At the nearby headquarters of the Steel Valley Authority, which has been supporting businesses in this region for decades, its veteran executive director Tom Croft is more sceptical.“What we’re hearing is there’s just a lot of uncertainty. The prices are the big thing, and the supply chain of products,” he says. “Right now, it’s too early to tell, but people are thinking it’s very much like the Covid shutdown.”He doesn’t object to the idea of targeted tariffs as part of a wider industrial policy, but he says: “The way they’re going about it has made a lot of the smaller manufacturers and managers wonder what the hell they’re going to do.”Joe Biden maintained the tariffs on China that Trump imposed in his first term, and was preparing to intervene to block the Nippon deal. Trump backed the takeover during the campaign but recently suggested he didn’t want US Steel to “go to Japan”.Debate is raging in the once mighty industrial city of Pittsburgh, which has transformed itself in recent decades to specialise in “eds and meds” – education and medicine.View image in fullscreenDoug Croft, standing centre-left, and Nick Kirk, seated centre-right, outside La Prima Espresso in the Strip District of Pittsburgh.Photograph: Stephanie Strasburg/The GuardianOutside La Prima Espresso Company in the city’s Strip District, where warehouses are slowly being transformed into swanky flats, a row breaks out among the older men gathered to play cards when they are asked about Trump’s policies.One gestures to his head, suggesting the president is “not good on the second floor”, while another storms off.Nick Kirk, who owns a local trucking firm and wears a red tie to show his support for Trump, says: “Everybody thinks it has to be done likethis,” clicking his fingers. “In your own personal life, nothing gets done that fast.”Not far away, Joy Lu, the manager of an Asian supermarket, Lotus Food, is struggling to keep up with the price hikes on Chinese imports.“For example, fresh noodles, they already increased in price,” she says. “Before we sell for $6.99 and then they increased to $7.99 and now it’s $8.49.”She says her suppliers have so far been able to forestall price rises on some products, by stocking up in advance. “Dry goods, they have a lot of inventory, maybe they have like six months’ inventory. Their price doesn’t go up so fast.”Asked about the possibility of shortages as the tariffs continue to bite, she says one supplier has already started limiting orders. “It’s five cases per customer, not like before when we can order as many as we want.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He concedes he has had to put up the price of some biscuits, because of the 10% across-the-board tariff; and if the EU faces the 20% “reciprocal” rate when Trump’s 90-day “pause” ends in July, there could be more to come.He says he had had emails from his Italian suppliers the day before the pause, saying they were already anticipating the increase. “They were increasing their inventory cost price.”However, he insists he’s not worried. “I don’t think it’s gonna happen. I think it’s all negotiating tactics,” he says. “It’s the art of the deal. I believe in Donald Trump.”View image in fullscreenBill Sunseri, president of the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company.Photograph: Stephanie Strasburg/The GuardianEven for businesses that seem a world away from Pittsburgh’s mom and pop stores and the craft brewers, aspects of Trump’s policies are giving pause for thought.Astrobotic is the kind of hi-tech private-sector business that symbolises the Steel City’s hopes for the future. It builds lunar landers, and is preparing for a planned mission by the end of the year.Its founder and chief executive, John Thornton, says the tariffs will barely affect it, as the cost of the tech on the complex vehicles far outweighs the price of materials. Yet he is still having to keep an eye on the Trump administration’s pronouncements because Nasa is his biggest customer.“We’re watching very closely what the policy is around space. We saw in the confirmation hearing of Jared Isaacman, who’s going to be the next Nasa boss, that they’re talking about the moon and Mars still, which is good,” he says.But he adds that much of its funding comes out of the science budget – parts of which Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” appears determined to cut.“Our primary programme, called Commercial Lunar Payload Services, comes out of the science programme. So if there is a significant cut there, that could be a problem for us.”On Carnegie Mellon University’s leafy campus, Lee Branstetter, a professor of economics , says the jarring uncertainty facing every business owner is a powerful force pressing down on the economy, and wonders what impact Trump’s deep cuts to research budgets will have on his students’ future.View image in fullscreenJohn Thornton, the CEO of the aerospace company Astrobotic Technology.Photograph: Stephanie Strasburg/The Guardian“I think it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that at the apex of the federal government, we have a bunch of people who have no idea what they’re doing,” he says. He points out steel employs about 31,000 people in Pennsylvania, while health and education account for 1.3m jobs.“As a business, how do you decide how to invest? When you don’t know if the tariffs facing the products that you’re planning to import from a particular country are going to be 60% or 10% or 5%,” he says. “I think the answer is you try not to make a decision for as long as you can.“The consequence, of course, of deferring decisions as long as possible means that the pace of investment dramatically slows.”These firms will also pause hiring plans, he suggests – while anxious consumers tighten their belts. “It seems like simply as a consequence of this spike in policy uncertainty, we’re likely to see a significant macroeconomic slowdown in the US and perhaps beyond.”There is little sign as yet of that uncertainty being resolved. Trump’s Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has repeatedly claimed a string of trade deals are close, but the president did not seem to be in negotiating mood last week when he described theUS economyas a “giant, beautiful store” in which “I set the prices”.For the moment, real prices, outside Trump’s head, are anything but set – and as firms across the US rethink their supply chains on the hoof, it is far from clear how long the shelves of the “giant, beautiful store” can remain fully stocked.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS economyUS small businessTariffsInternational tradeGlobal economyEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, it has directed its fury at rallying public and global condemnation of the import curbs – showing no interest in a reprieve.Xi announces plan for Chinese economy to counter impact of US trade warRead moreThat said, alongside leveraging its propaganda machine to hit back at the duties, China has quietly created a list of US-made products it will exempt from itsretaliatory 125% tariffs, including select pharmaceuticals, microchips and jet engines, to ease the duties’ impact.Bessent mentioned no specific talks during a Fox Business Network interview, but said that high tariffs of 145% on the US side and 125% on the Chinese side needed to be de-escalated for negotiations to begin.“I am confident that the Chinese will want to reach a deal. And as I said, this is going to be a multi-step process,” Bessent said. “First, we need to de-escalate, and then over time, we will start focusing on a larger trade deal.”He said that among the first steps would be to revisit China’s failure to make good on purchase commitments for American goods made as part of Trump’s 2020 “Phase 1” trade deal that ended his first-term trade war with Beijing.That deal called for China to increase purchases of American manufactured and agricultural products and services by $200bn annually over two years, but the Covid pandemic hit just after its signing.Bessent said that “insidious” non-tariff trade barriers and intellectual property theft also would be part of negotiations over tariffs with China, adding: “Everything is on the table for the economic relationship.”Once Trump’s tariffs had topped 35% they became prohibitively high for Chinese exporters.Nomura Securities said about 16 million Chinese people could lose their jobs once the long-term ripple effects of a 50% drop in Chinese exports to the US worked their way through the economy.Bessent said the pressure was on China because it is more dependent on exports to the US than vice versa.“They sell us about five times more than we sell them. So their factories are closing down as we speak,” Bessent said. “We’re going into the holiday season. Orders are placed for that now. So if those orders aren’t placed, it could be devastating for the Chinese.”Still, Beijing has been adamant it will stand and fight, rather than rush to the negotiation table – with the foreign ministry likening yielding to Trump’s tariffs to “drinking poison”.“Before the US takes any substantive action, China has no need to engage in talks with the US,” the post from Yuyuan Tantian added, citing anonymous experts. “However, if the US wishes to initiate contact, there is no harm at this stage for China to engage.“China needs to observe closely, even force out the US’ true intentions, to maintain the initiative in both negotiation and confrontation.”Trump said in a US media interview published last Friday that his administration was talking with China to reach a tariff deal and that the Chinese president,Xi Jinping, had called him. Beijing last week repeatedly denied such talks were taking place, accusing Washington of “misleading the public”.0:40China condemns US  'bullying' as Trump's 104% tariffs kick in – videoGuo Jiakun, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said on Wednesday: “As far as I know, there have been no consultations or negotiations between China and the US on tariffs”.Chinese officials have consistently stated that Beijing is open to talks, with the caveat that “dialogue and negotiation must be based on equality, respect and mutual benefit.”Yuyuan Tantian is not among China’s most authoritative state media outlets. The Global Times, which is owned by the newspaper of the governing Communist party, People’s Daily, has often been first to report China’s next steps in trade disagreements over the past few years.Trump said on Wednesday he believed there was a “very good chance” his administration could do a deal with China, hours after Xi called on officials to take action to adjust to changes in the international environment, without explicitly mentioning the US.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTrump administrationChinaUS politicsTariffsDonald TrumpEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The move was designed to give a reprieve to US carmakers, after the domestic industry warned his strategy would increase costs for American manufacturers by tens of billions of dollars.Carmakers subject to a 25% tariff on imports will now not be subject to other levies Trump has imposed, such as those on steel and aluminium. US carmakers will also be allowed to apply for temporary tariff relief on a proportion of the costs imposed for imported parts, although the relief will be phased out over the next two years.Mary Barra, GM’s chief executive, said in a letter to shareholders that the company now expected to make a pre-tax profit of between $10bn and $12bn this year, including a tariff exposure of between $4bn and $5bn. This compares with previous profit guidance of $13.7bn to $15.7bn.Despite the significant hit to profitability from tariffs, Barra’s letter stated the company was “grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry”.“We look forward to maintaining our strong dialogue with the administration on trade and other policies as they continue to evolve,” Barra wrote.Carmakers have been struggling to keep up with Trump’s frequent changes to his plans for sweeping levies, which have also forced Stellantis – the owner of brands including Jeep, Chrysler and Fiat – and German manufacturer Mercedes towithdraw their financial guidancefor the year as a result of the uncertainty around tariff policy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under free trade agreements, which have been in place for decades, parts and cars can crisscross that border many times.Companies across a range of sectors have been struggling to keep up with changes to tariff policy announced by the Trump White House, which threaten to upend global supply chains and disrupt markets.Uncertainty and abrupt policy U-turns also appear to be weighing on US consumers, while other hospitality businesses includingStarbucks, Domino’s Pizza and Chipotle Mexican Grill have warned that Americans are cutting back on dining out.It came as official figures showed that theUS economy shrank by 0.3%between January and March, down from growth of 2.4% in the final quarter of 2024 and the first contraction since the start of 2022.US consumer sentiment plungedby 32% to its lowest level since the 1990 recession between January and April, after the announcement of Trump’s tariffs sparked fears of a global trade war.

How Denise Coates became Britain’s richest womanRead moreOne option on the table includes a partial sale to a private equity investor, with the Coates family retaining a stake before an eventual listing. It could also see a spin-off of part of the business, rather than a full listing of the Stoke-on-Trent-based firm.A second source said they were also aware of discussions with private equity groups about taking a pre-float stake.One person with knowledge of the talks said Bet365 had reached the “beauty parade” stage, where companies sound out banks they think could help them extract maximum value from any deal.Bet365 did not return requests for comment.Selling Bet365 could net Denise Coates, 57, more than £5bn, based on her 58% stake. It would cap an extraordinary growth story rooted in the humble origins of a Portakabin in a Stoke car park.Under Coates’s stewardship, Bet365 pioneered online gambling technology, coming from a standing start to eclipse far more established brands such as Ladbrokes and William Hill.View image in fullscreenSelling Bet365 could net Denise Coates, 57, more than £5bn, based on her 58% stake.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesIn recent years it has expanded into the US, capitalising on a sports betting boom that began in 2018 when the supreme courtoverturned a decades-old federal banon the practice.Since then, Bet365 has won the right to operate in 13 states and is pursuing new licences as more states introduce regulated betting.The Coates family have taken several steps recently that would make Bet365 more attractive to US investors. Earlier this year, the company announced it was pulling out of China, a market where its presence had stoked controversy becausebetting is illegal there.In August last year, Bet365 transferred ownership of Stoke City football club to John Coates, the brother of Denise.“It would be very difficult to have China exposure given the level of scrutiny that might be applied in the US, and why would you have a football club attached, that’s a family legacy,” said Paul Leyland, the director of the gambling consultancy Regulus Partners.He said a sale in the US was “compelling for everybody”, providing an exit for Denise Coates and, for cash-rich US investors, offering a proven success in a growing industry.“There’s more money chasing gambling than there are gambling companies that are investable,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since 2019, Britain’s best-paid woman has increased her holding from 50.2% thanks to her parents, Peter and Deirdre, transferring their shares to her.Bowden said: “For decades people have been telling me the one business they wish they could invest in was Bet365, and while there is a bit of an industry consensus that they are a fading star, they remain one of, if not the best, online sports betting business in the world, with huge headroom for growth in casino, the US and many other markets. I don’t think they will have many problems.”Coates’s father, Peter, the 80-year-old son of a miner, was a successful local businessman in the catering industry, who owned a string of betting shops. But it was Denise, an econometrics graduate, who at around the turn of the millennium became aware of the jackpot opportunity that lay online.She bought the Bet365.com domain name from eBay for $25,000 and borrowed against the bricks-and-mortar stores to develop sports betting technology that left slow-moving rivals in the dust.She is famously shy of publicity but in a rare interview with the Guardian in 2012 she said her family’s story made them the“ultimate gamblers”.Explore more on these topicsMergers and acquisitionsIPOsGamblingSport bettingTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead.”View image in fullscreenTesla CEO Elon Musk.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersIt followed a Wall Street Journal story published on Wednesday that claimed “board members” had contacted headhunters to recruit a successor about a month ago.The reported move came as tensions grew at Tesla aroundfalling profitsand criticism of Musk for spending much of his time in Washington, where he has been helping Donald Trump slash federal spending asde facto head of the “department of government efficiency” (Doge).It is unclear in the report whether these members were acting on behalf of the board as a collective, or if it was only some of them taking steps to find a new chief executive. The Tesla board is made up of eight people, including Elon Musk himself, his brother, Kimbal Musk, and James Murdoch, son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.Tesla has been hit by a widespread backlash against Musk’s recent political activity, not only against his Doge work, but also his public support for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party before German national elections in February. Sales of the electric car have dropped in some of its biggest markets and there have been political protests at some of its showrooms.Last week, thecompany reported that profits had dropped by 71%in the first quarter of this year to $409m (£307m), compared with $1.39bn in the same period in 2024. Meanwhile, Tesla’s stock has suffered, with the company losing about a quarter of its market value this year.Musk told investors that starting from May he would be“allocating far more of my time to Tesla”.He is scheduled to leave his government role on 30 May, according to a strict 130-day cap on his service as a special government employee.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another, Advance Australia, has beenactively involvedin anti-renewables campaigns.Young said the AIP decision to focus on housing was because it was “a serious issue” for the group.“If you look at our website you will find that housing, which is the focus of our current campaign, has been a concern of ours from our inception,” he said.Who is H Fong, the man authorising the flurry of annoying Trumpet of Patriots text messages in Australia?Read more“When the Greens advocated taxation policies that would hurt renters, as well as create housing shortages, we decided to run a campaign against them. In our view the Greens advocate a range of policies that are not in the interest of Australia, or of the people who vote for them.”Max Chandler-Mather, the Greens MP for the Brisbane seat of Griffith and the party’s housing spokesman, said “coal and gas billionaires” were campaigning against the party “because the Greens are the party prepared to stand up to them, make them pay their fair share of tax, and stop opening new coal and gas projects that are cooking the planet”.“Coal billionaires desperately want Peter Dutton to be prime minister and they know that the Greens in Brisbane are the ones standing in the way,” he said.“Having now failed to stop the Greens through scaremongering to conservative voters, now they’ve resorted to lying to young voters and renters. That won’t work either.”In his emails to supporters, Young said contributions to the anti-Greens campaign below the federal threshold did not need to be disclosed.“The rules that applied to the last state election do not apply to this Commonwealth election,” Young told supporters.“It is only until you have donated $16,900 in total that you need to disclose your donation and there are no prohibited donors.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025QueenslandQueensland politicsAustralian politicsCoalEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Now Vítor Pereira’s side pose a problem that Manchester City must solve as the latter chase maximum points from their last four games in the race for Champions League qualification. Pep Guardiola’s side are unbeaten in the last eight in all competitions and buoyed up by last Sunday’s reaching of athird successive FA Cup final, so this should be a close one. Keep an eye out for Guardiola potentially having a complimentary word with Matheus Cunha, as is his habit when coming up against a high-class opposition player.Jamie JacksonManchester City v Wolves,Friday 8pm(all times BST)2Villa may need flawless finishHave Aston Villa left themselves too much to do? A superb five-match Premier League winning run came to a haltagainst Manchester Citybeforetheir FA Cup semi-final defeat to Crystal Palaceat Wembley. Within two weeks, they have gone from three competitions to one, so Villa at least will argue they are laser-focused on the remaining four matches. First up is a home tie against Fulham and Villa may need another flawless run to make the top five. Unai Emery exceeded all expectations by leading Villa to the Champions League quarter-finals and a taste of mixing it with Europe’s elite has left them wanting more, even if the club insist it is not paramount for the wider profit and sustainability picture. As the immortal Ron Saunders quote goes, do you want to bet against us?Ben FisherAston Villa v Fulham, Saturday 12.30pm3Fringe Everton players to seize chance?There might not be much riding on the penultimate game at Goodison Park – and the final 3pm Saturday kick-off in the stadium’s history – but after a testing schedule against five of the current top six David Moyes will need to see evidence of genuine progress against Ipswich. The extra revenue from a higher league finish would not go amiss either. Everton have won once in nine games and it is not only their many out-of-contract players who are playing for their futures under Moyes. Beto’s form has deteriorated since the five goals in five games that lifted Everton’s relegation fears in February. That purple patch looks increasingly like the exception, rather than the norm. Nathan Patterson was handed a rare opportunity to kickstart his injury-hit Everton career atChelsealast weekend but failed to state his case as a solution for the team’s right-back problem. Both players need to step up, if handed another chance to do so, against depleted and relegated opponents.Andy HunterEverton vIpswich Town, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenDavid Moyes speaks with Beto (left) and Idrissa Gueye (right) during Everton’s defeat to Chelsea last weekend.Photograph: Vince Mignott/MB Media/Getty Images4Leicester looking for a way to stay positiveLeicester, with no goals and no points from their last nine home games, end what has been a miserable season with matches against the only teams with home records worse than their own, with Southampton’s visit to be followed by that of Ipswich. “We’ve been addressing it for a couple of weeks now,” Ruud van Nistelrooy said. “We want the season to end as positively as possible within the situation of relegation.” Achieving that will involve a complete change of momentum: over the last 19 games, or exactly half aPremier Leagueseason, even the Saints’ miserable record has been better than the Foxes’, who have four points, six goals and a goal difference of -40 to Southampton’s six, 14 and -35. Leicester’s morale is at a low ebb: Ricardo Pereira, Bobby De Cordova-Reid and Facundo Buonanotte are ruled out of this game, while Mads Hermansen has had surgery on his groin, which will sideline him until August. If you rank all goalkeepers who have played in this year’s Premier League by the number of goals conceded per 90 minutes played, six of the top 11 play for either Leicester or Southampton; in straw-clutching news Jakub Stolarczyk, who will have the gloves for the rest of Leicester’s season, is last on that list.Simon BurntonLeicester City v Southampton, Saturday 3pm5Arsenal need Ødegaard back on formThe critics have rounded on Martin Ødegaard after his underwhelming performance in the first leg of Arsenal’s Champions League semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain, with the former Match of the Day pundit and Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson even suggesting that Declan Rice should take over as captain given the Norwegian’s struggles of late. That would be extremely harsh for a player who has led by example for Mikel Arteta’s side over the past few seasons, although Ødegaard’s record of just five goals and 10 assists in 40 appearances in all competitions is a disappointing return. A frustrating ankle injury at the start of the season and the birth of his first child both appear to have affected the former Real Madrid player’s form, with Ethan Nwaneri coming off the bench to replace him at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday as Arsenal chased an equaliser. The visit ofBournemouthto north London is an opportunity for Ødegaard to rebuild his confidence ahead of the second leg in Paris next week that will determine his side’s destiny.Ed AaronsArsenal v Bournemouth, Saturday 5.30pm6United’s youngsters may have to waitGiven that the first timeManchester Unitedplayed Brentford this season they had won one of their previous six league games (and that against Southampton), had half an eye on a Europa League fixture a few days away and still prevailed, Thomas Frank’s side are unlikely to get carried away with the fact that United go into this one having won one of their previous seven league games (and that against Leicester) and with Europe on their minds. Even if United are almost entirely focused on making sure they don’t fumble victory over Athletic Bilbao in next Thursday’s semi-final second leg, the unexpectedly emphatic 3-0 win in the first meeting at San Mamés might have changed Ruben Amorim’s thinking about this match. Clearly he had been planning to field a few fringe and youth players, bringing both the 17-year-old forward Chido Obi and the 19-year-old midfielder Sékou Koné to Spain despite both being ineligible to play in Europe, just so they could take part in Friday morning’s training session before joining the squad on their trip to London. Jaydan Kamason, an 18-year-old right-back, and the 17-year-old winger Bendito Mantato were both unused substitutes in Bilbao and could make their senior debuts this weekend. But given that progress in Europe looks more comfortable than expected Amorim could now choose to field a stronger and more senior side against Brentford, who are unbeaten in four and have a chance of securing European football next season.SBBrentford v Manchester United, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenChido Obi is among the Manchester United youngsters aiming to pick up more senior minutes.Photograph: Ash Donelon/Manchester United/Getty Images7Hürzeler has options in defence once moreThings are suddenly looking much rosier for Fabian Hürzeler after Brighton finally snapped their winless run thanks toCarlos Baleba’s late winner against West Hamlast week. The Cameroon midfielder looks set to return to his usual position for the visit of Newcastle on Sunday having deputised in central defence in recent matches as Brighton welcome back Jan Paul van Hecke from the nasty head injury he sustained in thedefeat against Brentford. “Jan Paul is ready to start,” said Hürzeler. “After training he immediately came to me and said he wants to play.” Joël Veltman is also back while Adam Webster has an outside chance of making the match squad to ease Brighton’s defensive crisis. With Georginio Rutter, the club’s record signing, in contention to return against Wolves next week, Brighton will hope that they can build some momentum towards European qualification by recording another home victory.EABrighton vNewcastle United, Sunday 2pm8Potter already under West Ham spotlightGraham Potter looked as if he had reached the end of his tether after West Ham’s collapse against Brighton. He refused to talk about the positives, focusing instead on the weaknesses that let his side go from 2-1 up with seven minutes left to 3-2 down by full time. It was a manager who had clearly made up his mind on some of his players. A clearout is on the way: West Ham have to reorganise after a dreadful campaign. But Potter is also under the spotlight. He has taken 13 points since replacing Julen Lopetegui in January and is yet to put on a memorable performance in a home game. West Ham have won twice at home under Potter and could do with a rousing display when Tottenham turn up at the London Stadium with what will presumably be their B team. A derby triumph would earn the former Chelsea manager some goodwill from a disgruntled fanbase.Jacob SteinbergWest Ham United vTottenham Hotspur, Sunday 2pm9Lavia will want impact against championsChelsea are more fluid when Roméo Lavia is fit. The Belgian is press-resistant, savvy on the ball and positionally disciplined. He is the kind of player who improves those around him and, assuming that he does not have yet another injury setback, is likely to keep his place when Chelsea host Liverpool. Enzo Maresca values Lavia highly and was delighted to have him available to start inlast weekend’s win over Everton. It meant moving Moisés Caicedo to right-back and having the Ecuadorian drift into midfield when Chelsea had possession. The ploy worked well and could continue againstthe champions. However, Liverpool may fancy their chances if Luis Díaz can expose Caicedo, who is not a natural defender.JSChelsea vLiverpool, Sunday 4.30pmView image in fullscreenEnzo Maresca (pictured) needs Roméo Lavia to be at his best on Sunday.Photograph: Dave Shopland/Shutterstock10Palace hopeful for double delightCrystal Palace’s players returned to training on Thursday having enjoyed a four-day break after their FA Cup semi-final exploits and Oliver Glasner will be looking for renewed focus as they prepare to faceNottingham Foreston Monday. Draws against Bournemouth and Arsenal in their last two Premier League matches mean they still have an outside chance of finishing in the top eight, which could be enough to secure a place in Europe next season even if they lose to Manchester City at Wembley. Six points separate them from Fulham in eighth, with a trip to Tottenham up next before the final. “We’ve got an outside chance of stealing a place [in Europe] in the league,” said the Palace chair, Steve Parish. “And we’ve got this opportunity to win a final and get a trophy. If we do that, a lot of good things follow. What an end to the season, for Crystal Palace to be involved in so many things.”EACrystal Palace v Nottingham Forest, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool3448822Arsenal3434673Newcastle3421624Man City3423615Chelsea3419606Nottm Forest3412607Aston Villa345578Fulham344519Brighton3415110AFC Bournemouth34125011Brentford3484912Crystal Palace34-44513Wolverhampton34-104114Man Utd34-83915Everton34-73816Tottenham Hotspur3463717West Ham34-193618Ipswich34-412119Leicester34-491820Southampton34-5511Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendManchester CityWolverhampton WanderersAston VillaFulhamEvertonIpswich TownfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Built in the shape of a Greek cross, the pale limestone structure had housed the worst of the worst – murderers, madmen, monsters – its bulk hunched beneath a crown of scarred mountains the guards called the fifth wall.Now it sits empty – cracking and molding and dying. But each spring around April Fool’s, on a cold, crisp day like today, a retired accountant appears at its gate. He carries a book with an ominous title and plants it against the back wall. Then sometime between midnight and noon the next day, he lights a cigarette, and the world’s most grueling footrace begins.He came at dawn, in a large U-Haul coughing diesel smoke into the Tennessee frost. After crawling out, he leaned on a cattle prod and lit a cigarette in front of the prison gate. He wore faded flannel, red-and-black checked, and a bright sock hat that saidGeezer. The rest of him was almost deceptive: a tangly grey beard, perfectly manicured nails, and eyes like two-way mirrors – they observed everything and revealed nothing.The Barkley Marathons: the hellish 100-mile race with 15 finishers in 36 yearsRead moreTo some he is Lazarus Lake. To others “the Leonardo da Vinci of Pain.” His Social Security comes to Gary Cantrell. Most just call him Laz.A rumor has it he’d been shot in a marathon. Another that he’d pulled his own teeth. Many are convinced he’s diabolical, a man who breaks people for the fun of it. Others see a “bearded saint” who pushes limit-seekers in a way that borders on genius.In an already eccentric sport, his ultramarathon creations defy convention: tour buses, ferry rides, conch shells, a chair of honor called a “thrown,” races with no finish lines, and races where older runners beat the pants off competitors half their age – Lazarus Lake filled a gap few realized needed filling.But it’s here,at his Barkley Marathons, that he tests the limits of human endurance – physical, mental, and otherwise. Prospective runners send an application to “Idiot,” include $1.60, and write an essay on why they should be allowed in. What they endure if accepted is legend. Shredded legs. Separated clavicles. Exposed kneecaps. One runner hopped 20 miles on a broken ankle just to get to a place where he could quit. Over the past five years, no one had even finished the Barkley. In its 36-year history, only 15everhad.Laz looked on while a grey truck pulled up to the gate and sat gurgling. When I mentioned the polarizing attitudes toward his races, he just shrugged. “Most people think fair is what’s best for them. If you don’t fail,” he said on a long sigh of cigarette smoke, “how will you know how far you can go?”A young man climbed out, gave a nod, and worked the lock with a hoop of keys. They rattled against the metal gate until the whole thing, all two stories of it, screeched and unfolded like a zipper.Laz slipped back into his truck without a word and headed toward the prison. I followed.Outside my frosty car window, the mountains loomed up to a series of tall ridges, dull like the color of deer in winter. They were strewn with jeep roads and blown-down timber. You had to think – 40 of the world’s toughest trail runners against mountains the Cherokee deemed too inhospitable to mess with.The U-Haul circled a parking lot the size of a football field before lumbering to a halt in a puff of exhaust. Laz leaned against the front fender and began to piss. It steamed and splattered till it formed a dark patch on the concrete. “I do two things well,” he said. “I sleep well, and I piss well.”I looked away and thought about how I’d convinced The New York Times to let me profile him, then traveled here on my own dime. Nothing came easy with Laz. For three years, I’d tried to get him on his least favorite subject, himself. Instead, he teased me with small openings, false starts, and strange little trials – one of them, a math problem, nearly broke me:ABCDE x A = EEEEEEThe equation glared at me from my inbox, haunted a notepad on my desk, and ran on a loop in my head. After a few days of overclocking my brain, I panicked and passed it off to my wife. She solved it in fifteen minutes, and I was saved. Almost …Laz’s reply was almost too quick, written in his all-lowercase style.“did you give it to somebody?”Full of dread, I told him the truth.His response was predictably blunt.“you always let someone else do your homework?”That could have been the end of it. Yet here I was in 2023, possibly on to the next test – trailing him toward the back of the prison, where he limped past a towering wall of sandstone and stopped at a conjunction of metal pipes. He produced the book, Last Will and Testament, and with little fanfare duct-taped it to the center.To prove you’d run his Barkley course, he had you bring back a page from each book, 13 this year. The order of the books formed one loop – five loops total – 60 hours to finish. “Sixty hours of Hell,” wrote one magazine. He added sections every year, mostly off-trail, yet the official distance somehow remained 100 miles. Those in the know say it’s nothing short of 125. Not knowing, Laz maintains, is part of the fun.After lighting another cigarette, he moved to a break in the earth where a swollen stream barreled into a tunnel beneath the prison. Naturally, he sent the runners through it. At night, they reported hearing radios, television sets, even voices calling their names. They swore they were being watched, though no one ever mentioned by whom.View image in fullscreenThe Barkley Marathons take runners through brutal terrain.Photograph: Wade Payne/AP“They’ll come up through here,” Laz said with some glee and pointed to a shaft lined with slick, glistening stones. Getting up or down would require a chimney climb, wedging feet and arms against opposing walls. “Then, they’ll head upthat,” he said and gestured with his cattle prod to a sheer wall of Tennessee jungle.The slope didn’t rise, it lunged at the sky – 60 degrees of winter-stripped trees so densely pushed together they seemed to fight each other for air. There was a flare in Laz’s eyes as he studied it. “We call that The Bad Thing.”Once, a deer tumbled off the cliffs and into the prison yard. The inmates kept it and named it “Geronimo.” It became one of the boys, a guide told me, and claimed he could still hear its footsteps. “The whole place is haunted,” he said, his voice dropping. He described the six-by-six dungeon, the hooks where they’d hang inmates by their thumbs, and the mines in the mountains where hundreds were buried alive. When they collapsed, the guards would just leave them. “No, no,” he said, shaking his ball-cap-covered head. “This is not a good place. And I don’t do night tours.”“Jesus, you’d need a rope,” I whispered, craning my neck up at The Bad Thing.‘I don’t smoke on the uphills’: Lazarus Lake walks across America (again)Read moreA thick, congested laugh burrowed up from Laz’s chest. “Aw hell,” he said. “That’s just the first pitch.”Most big trail races have a monster, that one signature, gut-sucking climb. At the Barkley, there are a dozen, each loop, and The Bad Thing isn’t even one of the worst. The total elevation gain soars over 68,000ft, roughly two Everests and a Kilimanjaro – from sea level. Many of the climbs are littered with long thatches of briars – the kind country people used to call “wait-a-minutes” because it wasn’t until you got a step past them that you realized you’d been snagged.“God, one wrong move and you’d come down it alright, like a bowling ball,” I thought but actually said out loud.“Oh, you’d smack into a tree long before you hit the bottom,” said Laz, without a hitch. “It’d mess you up a bit. But you’d live.” He laughed till he groaned, then stilled for a moment before fixing his eyes on me. “Failure has to hurt.”I let that roll over in my head for a moment. “Doesn’t it usually?”He didn’t respond to that but scanned the hillside with his large, green eyes. “What makes people quit?” he said, blowing a long column of smoke back toward the prison. “Everybody is born a quitter. It’s the default setting. Hell, even fish quit! You can put ’em in an artificial stream with a fake scene, and they’ll swim upstream as long as it looks like they’re moving. But make it stationary, and they’ll quit and go with the water.”He turned to head back to the parking lot but paused. “Life can be a damn good metaphor for sports,” he said. “Adapt or die.”The U-Haul was moving again, this time along a tight patch of pavement deep inside Frozen Head State Park. The road curved and rolled into a tunnel of trees toward the trailhead. There, the next phase of the Barkley would begin, checking in those Laz had called at various times penitents, fools, and sickos.The farther we went, the more the forest seemed to want its space back – dark patches of moss slowly overtook the road and boulders crowded the edges. Laz liked to talk about the park’s mercurial microclimate, how the air compressed through the gaps like a thumb held over a garden hose. Temperatures could swing from 80 to 15 degrees in a single loop. “First-timers think it’s hyperbole,” he said, “but you only have to get caught by it once.”Soon, the bars on my phone dwindled to an “x,” and the road began to climb. Finally, a smudge of yellow appeared ahead and became a gate. Set between two stone pillars, this flaking pole was where the ordeal would begin and end. Here,Tapswould play on a squeaky bugle for the fallen. Like most things in Frozen Head, one got the sense it was sentient. A cracked sign adorned its middle: “Do Not Block Gate.”By early afternoon, the ritual check-in was underway. A line of 40 trail runners twisted up to a large, white tarp, a virtual who’s who of ultrarunning. The veterans carried items for Laz that he was in need of: cigarettes, socks, shirts. The virgins (first-timers) produced license plates from their home states and countries. Hundreds of these plates hung from yellow ropes strung between the trees – a dangling gallery of far-flung places like Liberia, South Africa, Australia, Antarctica.There were also unfamiliar faces in line, wide-eyed and wrapped in weather-faded gear. They stood quietly, taking it all in. Every so often, one would lean forward for a glimpse of Laz. You got the sense they weren’t here for the mountains. Not even the pain. They were here forhim– for Laz and his gate and his cigarette, daring them to come undone.His gravelly laugh echoed through the trees from behind a picnic table, where he greeted the entrants. “We look forward to seeing you suffer,” he said to one, before “You might as well go ahead and hit your head on a rock” to another. The runners and crews got green and blue wristbands. The media got pink.“Any advice?” a runner asked.“Go home,” Laz laughed and handed him his complimentary shirt. On it was an illustration of a runner, terror etched across his face as he dashed up a tree. A monstrous black bear charged him from behind, while above, a cougar crouched on a limb, ready to pounce. At the bottom was this year’s theme –The worst-case scenario is just the starting point!After the last runner checked in, they studied the master map. Laz made one of the course each year, and once it was set out, the runners and crews did their best to copy it by hand. They were also given a creatively useless set of instructions. Even the veterans got lost. One runner was heard to say, “I’m not sure where I was, but it was hard as hell to get to.”No one knew the start time, only Laz, and at some point in the next 12 hours, he’d blow a conch shell. If you heard it, you had one hour to get to the gate, where he’d start the ordeal by lighting a cigarette. Secrecy in all things; no one outside the camp – save close family members – even knew we were here.A clammy breeze stirred the air and made me glance back toward my SUV. A laminated sign caught my eye –one I could’ve sworn wasn’t there before. It was taped to a pole with words written in black magic marker.MEDICAL,it read,for instances of DEATH, near-dying, and other assorted life-threatening injuries. Below was a phone number.Why do they do it?I thought, as I revved the engine of my rental and held my numbed hands over the vents.Why does he do it?I remembered something ultra-phenom Courtney Dauwalter had told me. One of the greatest ultrarunners of all time, she’d managed only one loop here but insisted Laz didn’t want to torture people. “He makes these crazy-hard events,” she said, “because he thinks we all have more than we think is possible.”I was just beginning to feel my fingers again, when the weather shifted. The clouds darkened, and a blistering wind came barreling off the mountains. It whipped and tossed the trees. It was like an unseen hand had pulled a lever. The temperature plummeted, then sleet began to thud off the tarps, tents, and scrambling runners.I spotted Laz by the license plates, gazing up at the sky and sipping a chilled can of Dr. Pepper, a Tennessee license plate swinging in the wind beside him. Its bolded letters read, SURVIVE.The Endurance Artistby Jared Beasley will be out September 16th and is currently available for preorder atSimon & Schuster.Explore more on these topicsUS sportsUltrarunningRunningfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I wasn’t on a level playing field’Read more“­Gasquet managed to get her to come and give evidence to say: ‘Yes, I’m a cocaine addict. I use cocaine,” Hovell added. “‘I kissed him in this ­nightclub.’ But with a one-night stand, how are you going to be able to find that person again? That’s the problem.”Asked by the moderator Jacqui Oatley whether an elite athlete was opening themselves up if they didn’t get a phone number of the person they slept with, Hovell nodded before saying: “They might not have the evidence they need.”Another panellist, Travis Tygart, the head of the US Anti-Doping Agency, said he agreed with Hovell’s assessment and cited the case of the American boxer Virginia Fuchs in 2020.Fuchs tested positive for prohibited substances, but was cleared after proving that the metabolites detected in her sample were consistent with recent exposure via sexual transmission with her male partner.“I think based on the cases we’ve seen, watch who you kiss and watch out who you have an intimate relationship with,” Tygart told the Sports Resolutions conference.Tygart also called on the World Anti-Doping Agency to raise the minimum reporting level of substances that could be sexually transmitted, such as clostabal and ostarine – so that if anti-doping laboratories found a trace amount in an athletes’ sample they would not risk a sanction.“I think it’s a pretty ridiculous world we’re expecting our athletes to live in, which is why we’re pushing to try to change these rules to make it more reasonable and fair,” said Tygart.“The onus is always on the athletes – we as anti-doping organisations, need to take some of that responsibility back. And I worry how many of the intentional cheats are actually getting away because we’re spending so much time and resources on the cases that end up being someone kissing someone at a bar.”Tygart also reignited his feud with Wada over the case of 23 Chinese swimmers who tested positive for the banned drug TMZ before later being cleared.It came as Usada said it had worked out that 96 medals at the Tokyo and Paris Olympics could have potentially have been affected by the cases, and that Wada had a responsibility to clean athletes to do more.“It’s basically been a year since China’s failure to follow the rules that resulted in no consequences,” Tygart said. “And you run the numbers from the 2021 Summer Olympics and the 2024 Summer Olympics in swimming, and potentially 96 medals have been impacted by those swimmers who had, 23 swimmers who had positive tests.“And arguably, they should have gotten four years. TMZ is in the category of four years unless they prove source and no intent. And unfortunately the system, for whatever reason, is not willing to get to the bottom of it in a real and meaningful way.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsDrugs in sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The team must now address the fixes that need to be madeClaire de Luneat Crypto.com ArenaThu 1 May 2025 08.23 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 12.21 EDTShareDorian Finney-Smith slams his hand in frustration against an empty chair on his way to the shower. The locker room is so silent you could hear a pin drop. In spite of every expert prediction, it was not “Lakers in five,” or, at least, not on therightend of five. The LeBron James, Luka Dončić, and JJ Redick-led Lakerswere sent packingby the Minnesota Timberwolves on their home court in Los Angeles on Wednesday, in a five-game series whose final tally doesn’t tell the whole story.Minnesota were decidedly the better team in the series, but with the exception of a decisive Timberwolves win in the opener, it was a sequence of games won on the margins. The final game between the two teams felt, for the most part, like a competition where neither opponent particularly felt like giving their all, which played into Minnesota’s hands as the roster with far more depth and, thus, margin for error. But, in all likelihood, the serieswas won and lost in Game 4, a classic, hard-fought battle that came down to the final buzzer. While it wasn’t technically the end of the series, it’s the kind of loss that’s almost impossible to come back from, both emotionally, and historically: teams who go up three games to one in a seven-game series go on to win 95% of the time.NBA playoffs: Haliburton’s ‘disrespectful’ father sparks fracas as Pacers seal Bucks’ fateRead moreThose margins were, in large part, decided by the glaring holes in the Lakers’ roster construction that were illuminated in fluorescent light by the Timberwolves’ massive frontcourt. In short (as it were): the Lakers are not big enough, they were demolished on the boards by a Minnesota team who have size in spades. The small-ball-by-necessity style that secured the Lakers the three seed in a stacked West proved to be not quite resilient enough for a postseason that’s determined by depth and matchups more than ever. Los Angeles learned the hard way that a roster without a center making more than the league minimum can only take you so far, even on a team with the high-end talent of Dončić and James.There was also, of course, the head coach factor. JJ Redick was damned impressive through 82 games and showed plenty of promise in his first season coaching basketball above the youth level, especially considering all the roster upheaval and, it’s worth noting, the fact that helost his home in the Pacific Palisades firein January. But the playoffs are a different animal, and Timberwolves head coach Chris Finch looked every bit the veteran opposite Redick, a contrast that was notable on multiple occasions throughout the series.Perhaps the clearest example of Redick’s learning curve, and undoubtedly the one that will keep him awake at night this summer, was his decision to ride with his most successful five-man lineup of James, Dončić, Finney-Smith, Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura forall 24 minutesof the second half of Game 4 – the first time anyNBAhead coach has done so in the playoffs in the tracking era. While not having much faith in his bench, which proved to be even thinner than many thought heading into the playoffs, resulted in an understandable gamble, it did not pay off: the quintet clearly had run out of gas by crunchtime, scoring only 19 points combined in the fourth quarter. That fatigue very well may have contributed to the Game 4 loss that effectively cost the Lakers the series.Clear coaching growing pains and glaring roster deficiencies aside, it’s ultimately extremely rare for a dramatic roster move likeswapping Anthony Davis(who, ironically, would have come in extremely handy for the Lakers in this series) for Dončić midseason, to pay dividends in its first year. James said as much in his exit interview on Wednesday night: “Anytime you make a big acquisition in the middle of the season, it’s always going to be challenging,” he said. “Not only for me, but for [Austin Reaves] and the rest of the group.”James added that all things considered, the group came together well, and that there’s reason for optimism moving forward: “For the time we had, I thought we ended the regular season very well, to be top three in the West, and obviously, how tough the West is. I thought that was a good test for us. We had some challenges, but I think ultimately having a guy like [Dončić] is very dynamic for any franchise.”The “Nico Harrison is somewhere smiling” memes were aplenty after a less-than-stellar (by his standards, at least) showing for Dončić in his first postseason as a Laker, but it’s far too early to call the Dončić/James experiment a bust. There is, clearly, plenty of work to be done on both the supporting cast and Dončić’s conditioning (and defensive intensity, which was lackluster to say the least) in the offseason. And there is, of course, the question of 40-year-old James’s future: whether he’ll even return to play another NBA season, let alone with the Lakers, isstill up in the air.But assuming James does come back for at least one more campaign in LA, there is plenty of cause for optimism as to what a full offseason and training camp, a head coach with a season of experience under his belt, and a retooled roster could do for the pairing of two of the brightest basketball minds the world has ever seen. While the Lakers’ first round-exit is undoubtedly disappointing given all the hype and expectations around them heading into April, there is still plenty of meat left on the bone.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles LakersLuka DončićLeBron JamesNBABasketballUS sportsMinnesota TimberwolvesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Making its mark on the calendar with a grand, spectacular party in the Florida sunshine since theinaugural race in 2022, Miami is considered something of a showcase.The opening blast of the three meetings now held in the US is a shop window for the sport with three teams, Racing Bulls, Sauber and Ferrari boasting special liveries for the event this weekend. The flamingo pink of the RB is very much making a splash but the clunky corporate blue addition to the Scuderia’s scarlet has fallen very flat with fans.FIA president hints at climbdown amid F1 driver standoff over swearing finesRead moreNaysayers may have disliked Miami’s emphasis on being a show, of presenting a weekend of entertainment where the food and beverages (or F&B as it is bafflingly, for the uninitiated, referred to here) were as fundamental as the racing. Where the atmosphere went hand in hand with the competition. It was perhaps the first of the “event” races F1 wanted to promote and like it or not, it has succeeded with numbers around this race telling their own story.The atmosphere in the general admission – campus – area of the increasingly popular and affordable tickets away from the high-end hospitality which dominates all the media, is one of unadulterated enjoyment, shot through with the glorious absence of world-weary cynicism. There is an air of, whisper it, hedonism; not all racing must be accompanied by sombre beard-scratching from a grassy bank in the rain.View image in fullscreenThe Miami Grand Prix F1 paddock entrance is ready for this weekend’s race.Photograph: Kym Illman/Getty ImagesThis atmosphere is not least informed by the makeup of the audience. From information from sales, admittedly with the caveat that the data refers only to the purchaser rather than all the ticket holders, Miami is reaching demographics every sport eyes with lustful ambition.“We’ve got the high-end luxury buyer that we’ve really cultivated a relationship with and built their trust,” says Tyler Epp, the Miami GP president. “But at the same time, we’ve got some of our entry level motorsport fan data that’s telling us we’re also a motorsport event for the people who are intrigued and interested and just want to come and see the cars for the first time.”It is these new fans that have led a push for the new single-day tickets and the three-day campus tickets. It is also, most significantly, a young audience.“The base is growing most aggressively from what we’ve seen in the 20 and 30-year-old buyer,” Epp adds. “Our data does not tell us that this is an audience of 30 to 60-year-old white men, that’s not what we’re seeing now.“Certainly they’re here but it’s a much more eclectic diverse group than that and part of that’s partially because we’re in Miami, which is such a wonderfully diverse market.”View image in fullscreenMcLaren’s Lando Norris is thrown in the air by his team after winning last year in Miami.Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersTheir data is corroborated trackside in both age and ethnic diversity, while the gender differential is also notable, with the race easing toward what might be a 50-50 split in forthcoming years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It skews younger.”These are the demographics the sport needs to build on the success it has enjoyed in the US with Drive to Survive and, for all that the sound and fury of Las Vegas might have appeared to have outshone Miami of late, it is undeniable that the race at the Hard Rock Stadium is pulling in the numbers.Last year when McLaren’sLando Norris won his first F1 racehere it drew record viewing figures for the US of 3.1 million and Miami now holds the top three live US TV audiences in F1 history. While the season as a whole was pulling in an average of 1.11 million per race. Which, while still small in comparison to NFL and NBA, are considered strong numbers as the sport builds its presence.Epp is in good position to judge how the sport fares in comparative terms. He has worked both trackside and team side in Nascar, IndyCar and sports cars before moving into baseball for four and a half years and then putting in almost nine years with the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL; he is convinced the future remains bright.“We can be very bullish aboutFormula Onein the United States,” he said. “I view it as solidified, here to stay and looking at continuous growth, not necessarily ebbs and flows. I think the United States sports ecosystem in general ebbs and flows a bit with competitiveness and competition in particular markets but as a whole we feel really, really good about the state of Formula One.”Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It had been hard to hear yourself think as the emotions of a frustrating campaign poured out with each goal that went in, with Brennan Johnson’s opener after just 38 seconds setting the tone.But this being Spurs, things are never quite that simple. Cruising at 3-0 after further goals from James Maddison and Dominic Solanke seemed to have given them a comfortable advantage, a late strike from Bodø/Glimt’s stand-in captain, Ulrik Saltnes, that deflected off the unfortunate Micky van de Ven changed the complexion of the tie in an instant.Ange Postecoglou says Bodø’s goal will not dent Tottenham’s confidenceRead moreAfter a campaign that has seen them lose an unprecedented 19 Premier League games, Ange Postecoglou’s side will travel to the Arctic Circle for next week’s second leg on an artificial surface – knowing that their season remains very much on the line. Substitute Dejan Kulusevski could have restored their three-goal cushion in stoppage time but instead it was the away side, who have somehow reached the last four despite operating on a fraction of their opponents’ budget, that will take the momentum into next week’s decisive game.There had been a huge sense of anticipation among the home supporters before kick-off, with the giant South Stand transformed into a magnificent tifo display of the Spurs motto “To Dare Is To Do” just before the teams emerged. Postecoglou stressed beforehand the importance of establishing a lead before their mission to a town almost 1,000km north of Oslo for the second leg, although he acknowledged that a side who have knocked out Lazio and Olympiakos in the last two rounds were going to be no pushovers. Yet with regular captain, Patrick Berg, and midfielder Håkon Evjen suspended and Bodø also missing key defenders, he would have known this was their big opportunity to put one foot in the final in Bilbao.Kjetil Knutsen was able to name only five outfield players on the bench as their yellow-clad fans packed out the end behind Nikita Haikin’s goal hoping to limit the damage. So it could hardly have been a worse start for them when Yves Bissouma – a surprise inclusion by Postecoglou because Lucas Bergvall was ruled out after injuring his ankle in training on Wednesday – found space down the right and picked out Richarlison at the back post. The Brazilian’s header across goal deceived everyone but Johnson, who made no mistake by directing the ball back into the other corner.View image in fullscreenBodø/Glimt celebrate Ulrik Saltnes’s goal in front of their fans.Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty ImagesIt was the fastest goal of the season in this competition and most of this impressive stadium erupted in sheer delight. Bodø’s players formed a huddle in an attempt to reset themselves and, for the next half an hour, they appeared to be just about coping with Tottenham’s threat. Destiny Udogie flashed a volley over the bar at one end before Knutsen was on his feet appealing for a penalty at the other when the Italian clashed with Isak Määttä inside the area but the referee was having none of it.Bodø had been given warning of the danger Maddison posed running in behind their defence when he scooped Cristian Romero’s long ball off target midway through the half. The England midfielder did not make the same mistake twice as he raced on to Pedro Porro’s pass and finished with his left foot underneath Haikin. Tottenham smelled blood and had the Russian goalkeeper not produced an excellent save to deny a stunning volley from Rodrigo Bentancur then they may have been out of sight by half-time. Ole Blomberg could not hit the target when Bodø finally mustered their first sight of goal just before the break. Postecoglou, who had celebrated both goals with gusto on the touchline, headed down the tunnel looking like a manager in control of his own destiny.Richarlison did not emerge for the second half and was replaced by Mathys Tel, with Bodø also making a change in their overworked defence. They attempted to take the sting out of Spurs by keeping the ball but found it hard to escape their own half despite shading the possession statistics.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Or at the very least, worthy of an eyebrows-raised remark. Lionel Messi andCristiano Ronaldo, the two leading lights of their generation, the dominant on-field forces for most of this century, both going out of continental competition in the semi-finals? Both in upsets? On the same day?On Wednesday, it actually happened. Messi’s Inter Miamifell to Vancouver 5-1 on aggregatein the Concacaf Champions Cup, and Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr lost 3-2 to Kawasaki Frontale in the AFC Champions League Elite at a nominally neutral site in Saudi Arabia.Both teams entered the season hoping for revenge after falling short of continental glory in the previous campaign. Both made excellent starts. Yet both succumbed to relatively unheralded sides playing a long, long way from home.That the focus is on those two players after these losses is both understandable given their stature, yet also unfair to their opponents.‘A phenomenon’: Inzaghi hails Lamine Yamal after his star turn against InterRead moreThe Vancouver Whitecaps, for one, deserve immense credit for their victory. The Canadianshave been the best team in MLS this year, rising to the top of the table and now the Concacaf final with their new coach Jesper Sørensen and without many of the players the team once relied upon.Ryan Gauld, who was at the center of nearly everything good for the Whitecaps for the past few seasons, has watched their recent run from the sidelines as he recovers from a knee injury. Other key players have spent time out of action with knocks or other slightly more serious ailments. Sørensen has rotated personnel to accommodate for those injuries and to balance the demands of league and continental competitions. Through it all, the Whitecaps have maintained a consistent style of play, and a contagious confidence. Few, if any, would have expected this start from these Whitecaps before the season began.“Being an underdog can make it easier,” Sørensen told reporters after the win over Miami. “You can play with a bit more freedom.”Indeed, the Whitecaps thoroughly outplayed Miami across the two legs; enough so that the 5-1 aggregate score feels entirely justifiable. They’ll be a handful for whoever they face in the final.Likewise, Kawasaki Frontale were not fancied heading into their semi-final againstAl-Nassr– a team that features not just Ronaldo but also Sadio Mané, Jhon Durán, Marcelo Brozović and other accomplished veterans of the European circuit. Though at a “neutral” site, the team had even further to travel than Vancouver did, from Tokyo to Jeddah where an understandably pro-Al-Nassr crowd awaited. Kawasaki, too, are still in their earliest days under a new head coach, with Shigetoshi Hasebe having just taken over after a successful seven years under Toru Oniki. While they haven’t been as dominant as Vancouver have in all competitions, the team played with confidence on the big stage, taking advantage of Al-Nassr miscues in defense after Tatsuya Ito opened the game with a beautiful volley from distance.“There were some big names playing here,” Ito said afterward. “Before we went on the pitch they were next to me. It felt like it was a video game.”In today’s version of that video game, though, Ronaldo and Messi seem fallible, and maybe, just maybe, a little helpless. Both maintain the competitive attitude that got them to the pinnacle of the game – neither is using the last stage of their careers as a vacation. Yet Ronaldo is 40, and Messi is 37, and they are both starting to show it. Not so much in the amount of running and the speed at which they do it, than in the fine margins they sometimes – only sometimes! – lose in key moments. Ronaldo had a chance against Kawasaki to bury one of his trademark headers while seemingly floating on air, but it hit the crossbar. Messi dazzled at several points as he fought his way through thickets of Whitecap defenders, but his efforts on goal were just those few inches off target.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Coming on the same day 17-year-old Lamine Yamal once againlooked as if he has the world at his feet, Ronaldo and Messi are a reminder that time marches relentlessly and irrevocably on, and that soccer is not created equal everywhere. Even at their best Messi and Ronaldo didn’t do it alone. Defensive issues plagued both Miami and Al-Nassr in their respective disappointments, in ways that neither of the forwards could be expected to do much about. Sergio Ramos was not walking through that door in Jeddah, nor was Carles Puyol in Fort Lauderdale. Chase Stadium is a long way from Camp Nou, as is Jeddah from Madrid and Manchester.What remains, though, are continuing legions of admirers, from the crowds that filled the King Abdullah Sports City Stadium in Jeddah to the children who accompanied Miami and Vancouver on to the field in Florida, all of whom chanted Messi’s name in the tunnel before the game.“Maybe some of the players had a poster of him when they were kids,” Sørensen said of Messi. “You have to find a way to play the game on your terms … You can not stop [players like that]. You can try to limit them.”On Wednesday, those attempts were successful, and now two legends seem to have limits where few previously stood.Explore more on these topicsLionel MessiCristiano RonaldoInter MiamiMLSConcacaf Champions CupAl-NassrUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They remain the only unbeaten team among the more than 100 that have played this competition over eight long months, and even if they do fall to a first in seven days’ time, the margin of this victory means they should still be there on its final game in this same arena, the season given meaning and potentially a triumphant end, the Europa League their elixir andtheir escape once again.They came to the stadium everyone calls the Cathedral and defeatedAthletic Bilbaoso convincingly that the second leg carries little threat. No one had won here this year in Europe and Athletic had conceded just 10 times in all competitions; United scored three in a quarter of an hour, an opening goal from Casemiro and two from Bruno Fernandes ending this before half-time. All the more so because the second came from the spot, accompanied by a red card for Dani Vivian, infuriating the home supporters and virtually ensuring that they will not play the final they host on 21 May.Ruben Amorim says Athletic Bilbao win is ‘best result’ of his time in charge so farRead moreUltimately this was an efficient, impressive performance in which United looked something like the team they are supposed to be: one that can win a European title that has become their salvation and a glimpse, perhaps, of future hope, not least as it would give them Champions League access. One that ended up looking on a different level to their opponents, even if it hadn’t started that way.In fact, Athletic began well, forcing the first corner and the first roar inside 90 seconds. United’s early possession was not so much a platform for them to do something as for Athletic to, ready to asphyxiate their opponents and accelerate with the robbed ball.That front-footed approach, though, did expose them to the ball behind and just four minutes in, Manuel Ugarte released Alejandro Garnacho to finish. That was offside, but it was also a warning, an invitation to United to seek the same wing.André Onana had to save from Alex Berenguer, Iñaki Williams headed just over and when the Ghana international then raced up the right and pulled back, Victor Lindelöf made two decisive interceptions – the second on the line with Berenguer shooting from five yards.That should have been the opener; instead, having resisted the pressure, it was United who got it just before the half hour. Ruben Amorim admitted that the first 25 minutes were not the same as the rest, the game changing with the opening goals and the red card.The first goal was made by United’s unlikely hero doing unlikely things, more unlikely even than last time. Harry Maguire, the emergency striker who had completed thatastonishing comeback against Lyon, smacking in a header on 121 minutes, now went all Stanley Matthews. If that had been latter-day Ronaldo, this was more like his teenage incarnation.Faced by Mikel Jauregizar on the right, Maguire turned one way and the next, went past his man and delivered the cross. Ugarte headed it on and, at the far post, Casemiro arrived to nod into the net.United doubled their lead two minutes later, and in a way that gave them even more of an advantage than the goal they scored. Again, it started on the right, where United had always identified opportunity.When the ball from Noussair Mazraoui came across the six yard box, Rasmus Højlund went down. Vivian accused him of diving but the defender was protesting too much. Højlund may have been quick to go to ground but there had been a clear hand on his shoulder and when the referee Espen Eskås came back from the VAR screen he pointed to the spot and pulled out a red card, double jeopardy doing for Athletic.Vivian departed, Fernandes rolled in the penalty and this, it seemed, was done. Iñaki Williams did bend a shot wide but Athletic appeared gone and United added a third. Højlund scrambled for the ball, Ugarte provided the clever flick and Fernandes ran through to finish high. The lead might even have extended still further before half-time, when Mazraoui smashed one off the bar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, United controlled this, never in danger. They managed it with a certain comfort, a sense of superiority, and the threat, if not the need, of extending the lead still further.There was another penalty appeal from Højlund, tangling with Yuri Berchiche. Ugarte and Casemiro both took aim from distance and the Brazilian put a header against the post. The frequency increased in the final 10 minutes, Julen Agirrezabala saving from Garnacho and Fernandes before Fernandes headed over and Højlund’s shot didn’t find the target.Iñaki Williams had gone sprinting up the pitch, the noise from San Mamés rising as he ran, but Athletic were exhausted, defeated, and those chances were a reminder that this could still get worse.ForManchester United, despite not adding the fourth, the night in Bilbao could hardly have been any better, and they will surely be back.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueAthletic BilbaoManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There was no irony about the celebrations from the noisyDjurgårdenfans when their team finally found the back of the net. The roar was deafening and the emotion was genuine. The only problem, though, was that Chelsea were already four goals to the good by the time Isak Alemayehu Mulugeta got the underdogs on the scoresheet in Stockholm.It was not a great look for a competition that Uefa invented for the benefit of Europe’s smaller clubs.Chelseaagainst the 11th best team in Sweden for a place in the final of the Conference League? A show of the Premier League’s financial power was inevitable. Enzo Fernández, signed for £106.7m, decorated the contest with early assists for Jadon Sancho and Noni Madueke. Nicolas Jackson came off the bench and scored twice. Cole Palmer’s failure to end his goal drought was a sideshow.“The performance for one hour, 70 minutes, was good,” Enzo Maresca said. “Then we dropped a little bit because we are 4-0 up. We cannot allow ourselves to drop because it was complicated. Against Legia Warsaw away we won 3-0 and then at home we struggled. It is a good experience. We are going to finish the job.”How did Djurgården end up in a European semi-final against Chelsea?Read moreThere was something ludicrous about a European semi-final being contested by one team who have spent over £1bn in the space of three years and another whose record transfer stands at £1.5m. Maresca’s pre-match insistence that games are never decided by money alone felt hard to take seriously. Do Chelsea really have what it takes not to win this competition? Followers of Djurgården saw little chance of an upset. After all they were not expected to beat Rapid Vienna in the previous round and, to put things in context, this is already their best run in Europe since they reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup 70 years ago.The sense was that Djurgården’s best hope lay in the dodgy pitch at the 3Arena acting as a leveller. Maresca, who was concerned about the surface causing injuries, took no chances. He rotated heavily and had many of his best players on the bench.View image in fullscreenChelsea’s Jadon Sancho opens the scoring against Djurgården.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersChelsea still had too much quality. There were a few moments when the pitch disrupted their passing but dealing with a ferocious atmosphere proved less of a problem. Djurgården were soon being moved around and were behind after 13 minutes, their back four prised apart when Fernández found Sancho and the winger took chested the ball down before scoring with a shot that went in largely thanks to Marcus Danielson making a mess of his attempted goal-line clearance.At least the home fans remained in high spirits. Djurgården, though, struggled to lay a glove on Chelsea during the first half. The visitors looked too quick, strong and smart. Tyrique George, the exciting 19-year-old attacker, was a handful after being deployed through the middle. Darting across the frontline, he was soon involved as Chelsea threatened to double their lead, only for Marc Cucurella to screw a shot wide from 20 yards.It began to feel like a group game against the bottom seed. Reece James, stationed in midfield, dinked a ball over the top for Madueke, whose effort was turned over by Jacob Rinne. Another goal was a matter of time. Chelsea threatened whenever they picked up the pace. They led 2-0 when Fernández provided more incision in his role as No 10, teeing up Madueke to beat Rinne with a low shot in the 43rd minute.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As for Djurgården, their task was made even harder by Maresca bringing on Jackson, Palmer, Trevoh Chalobah and Moisés Caicedo at half-time. Jackson quickly made his presence felt: first when he capitalised on a defensive mix-up and tapped into an empty net in the 59th minute, then when he turned and bent a fine shot into the top corner six minutes later.Djurgården, who created a few chances during the second half, kept going. They had joy down the left and pulled one back when Tobias Gulliksen crossed for Alemayehu to bounce a header past Filip Jorgensen. Chelsea still cruised to victory, though. It will not be until they reach the final and face either Real Betis or Fiorentina in Wroclaw later this month that they encounter anything remotely resembling true jeopardy.Explore more on these topicsEuropa Conference LeagueChelseaDjurgårdenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

His other club, Greek champions Olympiakos, have qualified for the grandest stage in the club game but Forest’s bid to return to Europe’s premier competition will likely go to the wire. Will Forest look back on this defeat at home to Brentford as a costly misstep when their season ends here against Chelsea?Forest, who face Crystal Palace, Leicester and West Ham before that potential final-day showdown with Chelsea, never really got going on a disappointing evening. Goals from Kevin Schade and Yoane Wissa, a January target for Forest, condemned the hosts to successive league home defeats for the first time since the end of last season and Nuno Espírito Santo’s side have now lost four of their past five matches in all competitions, including last weekend’s FA Cup semi-final. At full-time Anthony Elanga and Neco Williams crouched, winded by defeat, and Nuno’s challenge is to lift a dejected group of players. The stakes are a reminder of how far they have come.ForBrentford, it was almost the perfect away performance, an efficient and businesslike display. Thomas Frank’s side are two points off eighth, which could be enough for European football next season. If anything was symptomatic of Forest’s disjointed display it was the sight of the substitute Ramon Sosa taking the ball off Chris Wood’s head in the final minute of the 90.Premier League top scorers 2024-25: who is leading race for Golden Boot?Read moreHow would Forest respond to defeat at Wembley? “You grieve, and then you react,” Nuno had said but this game only served more pain to swallow, Schade and Wissa seizing on uncharacteristic defensive lapses by the fit-again Ola Aina and Nikola Milenkovic respectively in each half. The return of Aina after a month out meant Forest were, in theory at least, fully-powered. Schade’s goal approaching first-half stoppage time sent this stadium, one of the best in the league when at maximum volume, into near-silence. Nuno, hands on hips, stared into the distance as every outfield Brentford player ambled over towards the corner flag to mob Schade.The goals were very un-Forest, both stemming from Forest not dealing with direct balls downfield, one from a centre-back, the other from a goalkeeper. Nuno acknowledged there is a need to revert to type. “We have to go back and find our best version,” he said. “Our basic play is compact, solid, we don’t give away chances. A clean sheet has been a main and basic pillar [for us this season] and today it was the other way around. It was too easy. I’m concerned about: how can we compete against Palace? How can we be ourselves again?”For the first goal Nathan Collins pinged a diagonal pass 60 yards upfield and Schade slithered between Aina and Milenkovic to latch on to the ball. Schade tried to take the pass down with the outside of his right boot and he was fortunate that his mis-control worked to his advantage, the ball’s path tricking Aina, who slipped at the crucial moment. It got messier, too, the ball bobbling off the torso of the Brentford forward before he prodded in. A hush descended on the City Ground and Aina ended up laying supine as Schade went sliding across the turf in celebration.View image in fullscreenKevin Schade takes advantage of Ola Aina’s slip to open the scoring.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesForest flattered to deceive. Aina had Keane Lewis-Potter walking a tightrope after he was booked for an early barge on Elanga and it was no surprise to see Rico Henry replace the Brentford full-back at the interval. Forest were forced into a half-time change, with the unusually ineffective Callum Hudson-Odoi departing with a hamstring problem. Brentford made a fast start, Schade heading at goal inside two minutes and Christian Nørgaard and Sepp van den Berg also went close.Forest’s season has been built on a sturdy defence, Milenkovic and Murillo one of the best centre-back partnerships in the division, but here they were not quite so assured. There was an anxiety to Forest’s play, underlined by poor decision-making and a white noise in the stands, a constant chatter and uneasiness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Forest finally thought they were getting somewhere and then Brentford doubled their lead.Milenkovic misjudged the bounce from Flekken’s booming kick downfield and Wissa raced on to the ball before keeping his cool to dink the ball over Matz Sels.

However the FA, along with netball and cricket, has also stressed the importance of being inclusive to those transgender women who wanted to play in the female category.After announcing its policy change, the FA promised it would reach out to the 20 or so transgender women it will affect.“We understand that this will be difficult for people who simply want to play the game they love in the gender by which they identify,” it said. “And we are contacting the registered transgender women currently playing to explain the changes and how they can continue to stay involved in the game.”The FA’s decision was welcomed by a Downing Street spokesperson, who said that while it was up to each sport to set their policies, they had to comply with the law.“We have been clear that biology matters when it comes to women’s sport, that everyone should be compliant with the law,” he said. “And we will continue to ensure women and girls across the country can enjoy sports and we will continue to support bodies to protect the integrity, fairness and safety of the game.”England Netball also confirmed that it would be banning transgender women from female sport from 1 September, but said a “mixed netball” game would be available to everyone.“The female category will be exclusively for players born female, irrespective of their gender identity, whilst mixed netball will serve as the sport’s inclusive category, allowing players to compete under the gender with which they identify,” it said.“This new policy is designed to prioritise and uphold fairness on court within the female category.”English cricket currently allows transgender women to compete in the female category at grassroots level. However, it will change that policy on Friday.The decision of the FA and England Netball was welcomed by the campaign group Sex Matters, which has called for clarity about biological sex in law and life.“This is welcome but long overdue,” said Fiona McAnena, Sex Matters’ director of campaigns. “Every other sporting body now needs to re-establish a genuine women’s category. Anyone who cares about women and girls in sport will see that this is the right thing to do.”Meanwhile the campaign group SEEN in Sport, which represents players and coaches who believe in biological sex in sport, said that more should have been done earlier. “It has been a failure of leadership for them to ignore the legitimate concerns of the people who care about the integrity of the women’s game,” it added.However, the LGBT+ charity Stonewall was critical of the FA’s decision, and a similar onemade by the Scottish FA on Tuesday. “The FA and Scottish FA’s decision to ban trans women from women’s football has been made too soon, before the implications of the Supreme Court’s ruling has been worked through by lawyers and politicians or become law,” it said.“It is incredibly disappointing, especially as the FA has been a long term and vocal supporter of our Rainbow Laces campaign advocating for inclusion in sport for all ages and at all levels of the game.”Explore more on these topicsFootballThe FATransgenderFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In truth, it had felt likely long before that, in a campaign where one squad has looked uncatchable and – unbeaten with just two more games to go – they may yet prove to be the 2024-25 invincibles.It is Chelsea’s sixth WSL title in a row and eighth overall in terms of full-length campaigns, in addition to their triumph in the one-off, transitional “Spring Series” in 2017, meaning they have been crowned champions of England nine times since their first title in 2015. That represents more than just an era of dominance. They have built a dynasty and there are no signs to suggest their reign will be over anytime soon.If anybody thought this club might falter after the departure of their long-serving, trophy-hogging manager Emma Hayes, they were quickly proved wrong, as her replacement, Sonia Bompastor, set about her work calmly, intelligently and thoughtfully.Even before a ball was kicked, there were tell-tale signs that Chelsea were intending to kick on, perhaps most significantly, on a midsummer’s day, when the news broke that they werein talks to sign Lucy Bronze. As transfers go, there are very few stronger signals of intent than adding a five-time Champions League winner to your ranks and yet, in January, they put down an even bigger marker by breaking the women’s world transfer recordto sign Naomi Girma. Other additions have strengthened the squad too, not least Sandy Baltimore, who has thrived on the opposite flank to Bronze at full-back.View image in fullscreenChelsea’s immense second-half performance at Manchester City was rewarded with a stoppage-time winner by Erin Cuthbert.Photograph: Nick Potts/PANonetheless, picking their standout individuals who have led the way is not necessarily easy; this season they do not have a player in the top four in the race for the Golden Boot, although both Aggie-Beever-Jones and Guro Reiten are joint-fifth with eight goals each. Not dissimilarly, no Chelsea player has more than four WSL assists this term – Johanna Rytting Kaneryd is their best-performer in that regard, and she is not among the division’s top-nine assist providers this season.Instead, this has been a title earned by a team, or rather, by a squad, of hard-workers; of experienced winners and leaders. Big characters such as Erin Cuthbert, who has arguably had her best season in the WSL, and Millie Bright, who has successfully challenged more than 80% of attempts to dribble past her, the highest percentage of any player in the league this term. Domestically, Bright’s centre-back partnership with Nathalie Björn has proved solid.View image in fullscreenJohanna Rytting Kaneryd of Chelsea in action against Aston Villa.Photograph: Chloe Knott/Danehouse/Getty ImagesAfter the title had been won with1-0 win at Manchester United, Bompastor was asked about her side’s emphasis on being a “team” rather than having one standout superstar. “That [narrative] is something that frustrates me a lot,” she said, “because when I was the Lyon manager, it was the same, we were never talking about one individual but more about the team, which is something great for me, because I worked a lot on the dynamic and cohesion in the team and making sure that the team is more important than the individuals.”She added: “When we have that, people don’t realise the quality and talent of the individual players. It frustrates me a little bit because when you are able to achieve what this team achieved this season, you need to recognise, the best players are probably here.”Nonetheless, the strength in depth Bompastor can call upon is surely the greatest asset the club has. They have scored more than a third of their league goals this season in the final 15 minutes of games, demonstrating the strength on their bench. And they have won this title despite long-term injuries to key players such as Sam Kerr, Sophie Ingle and Kadeisha Buchanan. Other teams have injuries too but cannot replace them with the same calibre of world-class players that Chelsea can.Is this a vintage Chelsea team? Well, they are not the division’s top goal-scorers (that’s Arsenal), nor do they have the best defensive record (that’s Manchester United) They do not lead the way in terms of possession nor pass completion (that’s Manchester City), but Chelsea have done the double over all three of them in the league, coming out on top in all six of the head-to-head games against their nearest title rivals, and that is why they have won the league. They have delivered in the highest-pressure WSL games.They have also been fun to watch. They have had vastly more touches inside their opponents’ penalty area than anybody else in the division, and they like to run with the ball at their feet, carrying possession into the area more frequently than anybody else too. That is largely thanks to Rytting Kaneryd, who leads the way in the division for the number of times players have successfully carried the ball more than 30 yards upfield. More than that, there is a real intelligence to their off-the-ball work; they have intercepted possession more times than any other team this term. They work tirelessly off the ball – never better exemplified than in the second half of their title-definingcomeback win over Manchester Cityat the Etihad when their hunger, intensity and work rate looked off the charts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When will Bompastor lose a league fixture? It will happen, eventually, but there could be a long wait. The former Lyon coach is, perhaps, the single-most important factor of all, filling the shoes of the most successful manager in WSL history and, rather than being daunted, taking the task in her stride.Many players saw Hayes as a motherly figure, but she could also be fiercely demanding, intense and loved to swear, as evidenced by a behind-the-scenes documentary, filmed between 2019 and 2021. Bompastor has provided fresh ideas, new words of wisdom and given an already-successful team new challenges in training. That was precisely what Hayes herself had hoped for. Chelsea have found somebody just as driven as Hayes, to continue their winning machine.Asked where her drive comes from, during an interview in March while discussing her Uefa Pro Licence course, Bompastor said: “My childhood. I started to realise I really, really wanted to play football when I was really young, because my dad was a referee and my oldest brother was a player. In my childhood I wanted to play with him so I was always making sure I went outside with him and played with him and his friends – which he was really annoyed about because I was the only girl and the other boys didn’t have their sisters with them.“But I was so proud to be part of that and be with him. I think this competitiveness came from that, because my brother was better than me in any sport we played. He is four years older than me. So, when we were playing football, table tennis, tennis, or whatever, he was always better, and when he was winning it was difficult for me to accept.”For now, everyone else in the WSL has to accept that Chelsea remain on top. Can they be stopped next year? Not if Bompastor gets her way.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueChelsea WomenWomen's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

Sign up now!Michael ButlerThu 1 May 2025 10.15 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 11.00 EDTShareNOTHING BUT A NUMBERIn a world of hyperbole, recency bias and superlatives that are more exhausted than Casemiro on a counterattack, it is still not a stretch to call Lamine Yamal the best male footballer on the planet. Some particularly cantankerous individuals in Madrid might object to that, and while their annual boycott of Football Daily’s Bank Holiday Barbecue continues to be a point of consternation across the footballing world, there is no denying that the Barcelona boy is bit special. We say boy, because that is legally what he is. Akin to mentioning Frank Lampard whenever anyone talks about Coventry City orhelicopter rideswhenever brings up Michael Owen, we are contractually obliged to remind you of Lamine Yamal’s age whenever we write about him. HE IS JUST 17, FOLKS.While most of us were nervously hovering outside a Londis asking passing adults to buy us Tin at that age, Lamine Yamal once again produced a performance for the ages on almost the biggest of stages – Barcelona’s Bigger Cup semi-final first leg with Inter – in which he rescued his side from almost certain defeat (after they went 2-0 and 3-2 down) with an outrageous exhibition of wingplay: one magnificent solo goal, a dizzying array of testing crosses and probing passes, one dummy to set up Barça’s third goal and enough shimmies to set up a window-cleaning business. And in his 100th first-team appearance, he did it all with a shrug and a wink as if to say: ‘Yep, I know, not bad, huh?’ We have less composure at a self-service checkout.Lamine Yamal was also twice denied by the crossbar to leave the tietantalisingly poised at 3-3. A euro for the thoughts of Federico Dimarco, Inter’s beleaguered left wing-back, who was hooked shortly after half-time and will be facing something of an existential crisis before next week’s second leg at San Siro. “We could even have won this game against a team who have a player who is difficult to stop,”sobbed Inter head coach Simone Inzaghiafterwards. “We started well, but [Lamine Yamal] created a lot of problems. He is a player I had not seen live before. We had to double up on him. We managed it better in the second half and could even have won. Lamine Yamal is a phenomenon born every 50 years. He really impressed me today.”The praise kept coming. “A genius,” roared Hansi Flick, Barcelona’s manager. “This guy is incredible,” scribbled Erling Haaland on his Social Media Disgraces. The best 17-year-old since Pelé in 1958, parped … um … Football Daily. Some canny observers have compared Lamine Yamal to another prominent left-footed Barcelona right winger of yesteryear –some bloke named Lionel Messi– but themanboy himself isn’t having any of that. “I try to forge my own path,” Lamine Yamal told TNT Sports, already media-trained to within an inch of his life. “I think that’s the trick, that’s the secret, to try to do my best and not compare myself with anyone. I’m following my path, giving my all, and it’s been working out for me so far, but I still haven’t achieved anything,” continued the Spaniard, forgetting the Euro 2024 winners’ medal already stashed in his trophy cabinet. Let’s hope he has room for a few more.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Scott Murray from 8pm BST for hot Bigger Vase semi-final minute-by-minute coverage of Athletic Club 2-1 Manchester United, while Simon Burnton will be on deck at the same time for Tottenham 2-1 Bodø/Glimt.

Van Gerwen – still chasing a first overall nightly win this year – made a strong start, breaking Littler in the opening leg and then opening up a 3-1 lead.However Littler,the defending Premier League champion, then capitalised on some misplaced darts from the Dutchman to break back before moving 4-3 in front after more heavy scoring.Van Gerwen had the throw in the next leg, but Littler was again first down to a finish only to miss tops. After Van Gerwen failed to take out double 10, Littler nailed 40 at the second time of asking to wrap up a fifth win on the back of a 102.5 match average. Littler tops the table with 35 points, nine clear of Luke Humphries, with Price third and Van Gerwen now up into the final playoff spot.“Once I got over the finish line in my first game against Stephen, I was confident,” Littler said after becoming the first player to win five Premier League nights in the same season. “I got away with it against Nathan [in the semi-final], but then [the final] was a cracking game.“I have enjoyed it right the way through, and I’ll certainly relax. Luke [Humphries] isn’t playing his best darts at the minute so I’m gradually building that point advantage over his so I am very confident I will finish top of the table.”In the semi-finals, Littler eventually got past Aspinall in a close contest, with the world champion having survived a match dart before taking out 46 on double 10 against the throw. Van Gerwen, a seven-time Premier League champion, hit five maximums in a solid 6-3 victory over Price, who had beaten the world No 1, Humphries, in the quarter-finals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked if that was United’s best performance since taking charge in November, the United head coach said: “No, I think it is the best result because nobody expected this result.”Fernandes stars as Manchester United cruise against 10-man Athletic BilbaoRead moreAmorim also admitted that it was “hard to explain” the difference in performance level between the Premier League, where United are 14th, and Europe, where the final is within touching distance. He told Harry Maguire and the rest of his teammates to remember that things can always change, after the centre-back emerged as an unexpected hero with the winning goal in the quarter-final and an extraordinary and unlikely dribble and pass which led to the opening goal.“The players have to think about the second leg, and more about the first 20 minutes than the rest of the game,” Amorim said. “The game is going to be really tough. There is no away goals so anything can change: that is my message to the players.”Amorim added: “You saw two games: the first 25 minutes, before the goal and then after the sending-off the game changed. The most important thing is that after that the opponent didn’t get many shots. In the first 30 minutes they had some chances to score and didn’t.”After the game Bruno Fernandes joked “what a winger, I didn’t know he had it in him” after Maguire’s dribble had set up the move that led to the penalty, and the coach saw that as motivation for all his struggling players.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A tense opening to the match was filled with mistakes and a missed routine black by Williams in the eighth frame enabled Trump to establish a healthy overnight advantage.The world No 1, seeking his second world title, produced comfortably his worst session of the tournament so far but he finished strongly, even if at times he rode his luck against his 50-year-old opponent.Ronnie O’Sullivan and Judd Trump roar into World Snooker semi-finalsRead moreThe edgy tone for the evening was set in a eventful opener that was ultimately won by Williams’ break of 73, but he needed a fortuitous red when escaping a snooker to put an end to Trump’s fightback.The caginess continued into a second frame lasting 39 minutes in which Williams paid the price for an aggressive approach that resulted in an important missed blue. Trump also took the third after succeeding with a three-ball plant and punishing errors by Williams, although the favourite’s play lacked conviction.When the interval arrived Williams, three times a champion at the Crucible, had drawn level at 2-2 after producing a break of 116 and the rollercoaster play continued with mistakes made time and again as the score moved to 3-3.There was no let-up in the tension with neither player able to seize control of the session and in the seventh frame Trump received a good slice of luck as, having been presented with the trickiest of snookers, he fluked a red into the bottom right pocket on the third attempt.Trump took a hard-fought frame that both had ample chances to win and when Williams missed an easy black in the eighth, the Englishman pounced to compile a break of 109 that propelled him into a two-frame lead.O’Sullivanand first-time semi-finalistZhaoshared the spoils in a gripping opening session that ended 4-4. O’Sullivan’s pedigree and experience on the big stage did not deter Zhao, who took a 2-0 lead and then finished impressively with a break of 86 – the highest of the match to date – to leave things all square after the initial leg of their best-of-33 frames contest.View image in fullscreenRonnie O’Sullivan shakes hands with Zhao Xintong before the first frame of their semi-final. They ended the session level at 4-4.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAWith moments to go in the afternoon’s play, Zhao broke a corner runner with a powerful shot to leave balls rolling around the carpet as he applied the finishing touches.Earlier O’Sullivan, who considered his13-9 win over Si Jiahuiin the quarter-finals a let-off, won three frames in succession and at one stage stopped his opponent registering a point for almost 34 minutes. Zhao showed no sign of nerves on his first appearance at the theatre’s one-table setup, settling quickly into his work as he picked up the first two frames with minimal fuss.O’Sullivan potted the white off the initial break and was restricted to a couple of reds as the Chinese player put together a decisive 60 to take first blood. It was a similar story in the next, O’Sullivan opening the door with a missed black and Zhao cashing in with a 62 break.The Rocket came to life at 2-0, getting into the zone with a breezy 64. By the time the mid-session interval had arrived he had wrested back the momentum, conjuring a fluid 73 to even the scores before jamming a black in the jaws with a century for the taking.O’Sullivan’s roll continued after the restart as he got the better of a safety exchange, then sealed the fifth, leaving Zhao over half an hour and two frames without scoring a point. When he snapped his barren streak he did enough to draw level at 3-3.Both players saved their best for last as they warmed to an engaging battle, O’Sullivan regaining the upper hand with a break of 82 before Zhao shot back with 86.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipRonnie O'SullivanJudd TrumpSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

Bodø have a formidable record at home, having won six of their seven matches in Europe so far including victories over Olympiakos and Lazio.Tottenham firmly in driving seat despite Bodø/Glimt’s unwelcome late replyRead moreBut Postecoglou is confident that his side can overcome the challenge of playing on an artificial surface and reach the final in Bilbao later this month where they could face Manchester United.“Look it is on artificial grass but it’s still a game of football,” said Postecoglou. “I’ve been there, played there with Celtic, I know the experience and what is important for us is we need to replicate what we did today. Irrespective of the surface, if we’re as disciplined and as organised as we were today, with and without the ball, it won’t matter what the surface is, I think it will make it really difficult for us to be stopped.”But Knutsen felt that the late goal could be crucial for his side’s chances. “If you see when Tottenham conceded a goal, they were really disappointed,” he said. “They lost energy and I think we got a lot of energy because of the goal. I think we can take the energy from this game into the next game. It’s totally different for us to play at home.”Postecoglou is hopeful injuries that forced Maddison and Solanke off do not rule them out of the second leg, although he was less positive about Lucas Bergvall. The Sweden midfielder signed a new long-term contract this week but was pictured wearing a protective boot as he watched the game from the Spurs bench after picking up an ankle injury in training.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We want to be able to work with FIA’Drivers unhappy after Verstappen punished for swearingGiles Richardsin MiamiThu 1 May 2025 17.44 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 17.46 EDTShareLewis Hamilton has led a call demanding changes that would give Formula One drivers a formal place in discussions with the sport’s governing body, the FIA, and warned that they could act collectively to facilitate such a change, potentially acting as other sports have with a strong union representation.Hamilton made the remarks after the president of the FIA, Mohammed Ben Sulayem, had intimated in a post on social media this week that he was considering adjusting the rules around the unpopular and controversial punishments for drivers for offences including political statements and swearing.Ben Sulayem’s statement follows events at the last round in Saudi Arabia where Max Verstappen intimated that he was unwilling to answer questions over a stewarding decision because he felt the strictures of FIA regulations might cause him to be fined if he expressed a certain opinion.Welcome to Miami, where F1’s sunshine party draws a crowd every sport cravesRead moreThe issue has been a bone of contention between drivers and the FIA since last year, whenVerstappen was punished for swearingin a press conference. The Grand Prix Drivers’ Association (GPDA), the body which represents the 20 F1 drivers, all of whom are members, then wrote an open letter to the FIA calling on the governing body to treat them like adults and to discuss the issues. The FIA did not respond.Hamilton believed the drivers were not being given due consideration. “Ultimately, the GPDA is very unified. We want to be able to work closely with the FIA,” he said. “Of course, we’ve faced a bit of an uphill challenge in that communication over time. Ultimately we don’t hold a power seat at the table and that needs to change in my opinion. If you look at other sports that have unions that may be something that comes into play at some stage.“We don’t want to control things, we just want to collaborate with them more and have our voices heard.”The GPDA is a private limited company with a formal constitution but not a registered trade union, such as the Porfessionl Footballers’ Association, although it could still come to an agreement among members to act collectively. George Russell, a GPDA director, noted that Ben Sulayem had made his remarks without any reference or dialogue with the drivers and that they had still had no response from the governing body since publishing the open letter.“It’s unprecedented times we’ve been in the last 18 months with what’s been changing, what’s happening,” Russell said. “We want to see these things put into action rather than saying: ‘We’re considering things’. We all consider a lot of things. We’re clear we want changes and once they are implemented, then we’ll comment on it. The words don’t mean anything until the change has been made.“It’ll be great if changes were made and the drivers were at least heard and I think it’s just in the best interest for the sport and ensuring that some common sense is applied to these situations.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His Red Bull team explained he was with his partner, Kelly Piquet, who is expecting the birth of the couple’s first child. The world champion will be attending on Friday, when running begins with practice and then qualifying for Saturday’s sprint race.A statement from the team read: “Max will not be attending media day in Miami as he is expecting a baby.

It was a physical battle PSG were prepared for, and dealt with pretty comfortably at the Emirates. Quieting the crowd early is a rung on the ladder in semi-finals, and PSG managed that almost with their first attack. Ousmane Dembélé hit his shot early to score, having surged into the heart of Arsenal’s defence to start the danger.If PSG’s midfield is a little more intricate and delicate than Arsenal’s, they did not shirk the physical battles. PSG played the dark arts, the margins, well. They were also unlucky not to get a second goal when Jurrien Timber manhandled Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in the box. Gianluigi Donnarumma was called into frequent action but aslim, perhaps vital, advantagewas secured heading into the second leg. Having survived London, can PSG now deal with the pressure of history and their support in the Parc des Princes?InterSuch was the madness in Barcelona’s Olympic Stadium that only at the final whistle, as the Catalans’ body language showed off their disappointment, did it register that Inter had pulled off a decent result. If the goals came from the unlikely source of a Denzel Dumfries double, and Marcus Thuram’s incredible back-heeled opener after 30 seconds, that showed the threat Inter possessed when the ball was crossed into the box. It might have been better – Inter did have a two-goal lead – but the Italians ended the more satisfied of the twodespite a 3-3 draw.If Simone Inzaghi’s usually touch-tight defence was unable to stopBarcelona, their own attack made up for it, though Lautaro Martínez’s muscle injury means he is likely to miss the second leg. Next week: can a team full of experienced campaigners ride out another Barcelona storm?Going out?ArsenalIt was supposed to be the night the Emirates Stadium inspired its heroes, and yet it ended up a cauldron of complaint and discomfort. In truth, Arsenal did not give their fans much to work with. Unlike on the continent, an English crowd’s mood follows the pattern of a game rather than acting as a wall of noise whatever the state of play. PSG’s speed and guile made Arsenal ill at ease, and referee Slavko Vinčić became a main character with a series of decisions that annoyed and team and fans who are still over-sensitive to the whims of officials. Bukayo Saka’s yellow card came after he was penalised for a clear foul on Nuno Mendes. His petulance reflected an overall lack of composure.Mikel Arteta’s Big Energy show splutters against PSG to reveal Arsenal’s frailties | Barney RonayRead moreThe biggest game yet of Mikel Arteta’s still short managerial career saw his team again suffer because of a lack of focal point in attack. Thomas Partey’s absence led to a midfield reshuffle that failed to bring the best from Declan Rice and Martin Ødegaard. Mikel Merino was missed in the auxiliary striker role he has fulfilled of late. Still, all is not lost.BarcelonaAs it was at Bayern Munich, Hansi Flick’s brand of football is a gift to this competition, the high line and risk-taking playing a huge part in the classic encounters his teams serve up. To follow the madness of last weekend’s Clásico, Wednesday saw a game almost as ridiculous.It is defence rather than attack that may well cost Barça their chance to lift the trophy for the first time in a decade. They failed to live with Inter’s height and set pieces, and for all the brilliance of Lamine Yamal and Raphinha, among other flair players, they had luck. The latter’s “goal” smashed off Yann Sommer to go in. A toenail’s length offside decision denied Henrikh Mkhitaryan from making it 4-3. Though Ferran Torres scored, Robert Lewandowski, fighting desperately to be fit for the return leg at Milan next week, was missed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Perhaps only someone of his height could have made that fingertip save from Leandro Trossard. Donnarumma has that rare ability, for a goalkeeper, to be influential all over the field. He did so by being forever the face of Arsenal’s frustrations. “The real MVP,” as teammate Vitinha, given the official award, wrote on social media of his keeper.Denzel Dumfries (Inter)In a game of spectacular goals, Dumfries’ overhead kick took the cake. That he scored another granted him man of the match status. Inter have missed the Dutchman in recent weeks, and his second goal, a header, was the exemplar of his team’s dominance of the aerial duels. “We saw the real Inter, we played with heart,” he said.Lamine Yamal (Barcelona)The superlatives keep rolling. The brilliance continues. Without Lewandowski, Barcelona looked to give the teenager the ball as often as possible and he delivered, scoring the solo strike that pulled them back into the game, before then decorating the game with his stratospheric skill. One chip off the angle of post and bar looked like a mis-kick. On second look, he’d actually meant it. The Messi comparisons are flowing, but was his La Masia predecessor as good as this at 17? The answer at this point is no. And Messi was playing in a better Barcelona team.Jakub Kiwior (Arsenał)Arteta will point out, with justification, that injuries have hampered his team. A small-ish squad has been stretched and the supporting cast has been called upon. With Gabriel out for the season, and expensive purchase Riccardo Calafiori also struggling for fitness, Kiwior has put in some fine performances in recent weeks. He made mistakes during PSG’s early goal, but he recovered his poise to make a series of vital blocks. A player who previously gave cause for concern has become a solid citizen.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueArsenalInternazionaleBarcelonaParis Saint-GermainUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Rockets avoided elimination Wednesday, and Game 6 is Friday with the Warriors leading 3-2.Dončić had 28 points and nine assists, while James added 22 points for the Lakers, who lost in the first round for the second straight postseason despite reconfiguring their roster at midseason with their seismic trade for Dončić.Rui Hachimura scored 23 points for the Lakers, who have advanced from the opening round just once in five seasons since their 2020 championship in the Florida bubble.With Gobert running amok in the paint while the Lakers deliberately played without a center, Minnesota won Game 5 despite going 7 for 47 on three-point attempts, including 17 consecutive misses between the middle of the second quarter and Mike Conley’s dagger three with 1:22 to play.After splitting the first two games in Los Angeles, the Wolves seized control of the series in back-to-back narrow home victories with superior late-game execution.View image in fullscreenMinnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert outmuscles Los Angeles Lakers forward Rui Hachimura for a rebound during Wednesday’s first half.Photograph: Mark J Terrill/APGobert then stepped up when the Lakers deployed a small-ball lineup for Game 5, with the French center scoring more points than he managed in the series’ first four games combined.Minnesota nursed a narrow lead down the stretch, and the Lakers missed five consecutive shots while going three and a half minutes between points.After playing the entire second half of Game 4 with five players, the Lakers changed their starting lineup for Game 5, keeping tenacious wing Dorian Finney-Smith in place of center Jaxson Hayes.Lakers coach JJ Redick defended his decision to eschew substitutions this week, even reacting testily when a reporter asked him about his decision process before Game 5.Minnesota jumped to a 14-point lead in the first quarter, but the Lakers rallied before Dončić went to the locker room one minute before halftime after landing awkwardly on his knees due to a heavy foul by Donte DiVincenzo. Dončić returned to the court moments before the third quarter began, wearing a large lower back brace that he discarded to continue playing.The Wolves’ terrible shooting kept it close, and the Lakers took their first lead when Dončić led a rally late in the third.James limped to the Lakers’ bench during the fourth quarter after going down hard on his balky ankle, but returned a few possessions later.Golden State Warriors 131-116 Houston RocketsPushed to the brink of elimination, the Rockets delivered a playoff gem Wednesday night to beat the Warriors and keep their season alive.Fred VanVleet scored 26 points, Amen Thompson added 25 and the Rockets extended their first-round playoff series with a 131-116 rout in Game 5.“Nobody wants to go home,” Alperen Sengun said.Game 6 is Friday in San Francisco.Warriors coach Steve Kerr threw in the towel early in this one with the game out of hand. A layup by VanVleet midway through the third quarter made it 93-64, and Kerr called timeout and cleared his bench.Houston coach Ime Udoka followed suit with about a minute to go in the third and his team up 105-76. He put all his starters back in with about eight minutes left after Golden State cut the lead to 109-92.Dillon Brooks added 24 points on a night when all five Houston starters scored in double figures.VanVleet, a nine-year veteran who won a title against Golden State while with Toronto in 2019, tried to encourage his young teammates by reminding them that they’ve been in every game.“Keep everything light and fresh and and confident and understand that we have played good basketball,” he said. “It’s not like we were getting our asses kicked the whole time.”A 9-5 run by the Warriors got them within 114-101 before a fracas broke out with about four minutes to go. Pat Spencer pushed Brooks and then was ejected after headbutting Alperen Sengun in the ensuing scuffle.Houston went on a 7-2 run after that to put the game away.Explore more on these topicsNBALos Angeles LakersMinnesota TimberwolvesLeBron JamesLuka DončićBasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The George Mikan Trophy is awarded for the player who shows the most progress between seasons.Daniels was selected eighth in the 2022 draft, but started only 25 games in two seasons for New Orleans before he was traded to Atlanta last year. He was in the Hawks’ starting five for all 76 appearances this season.NBA playoffs: Haliburton’s ‘disrespectful’ father sparks fracas as Pacers seal Bucks’ fateRead more“I came into the third year wanting to really put my foot down and go out there and show what I could do,” Daniels told the NBA on TNT broadcast. “I think it was just a small step in the right direction this year, and I feel like I’ve got a lot more in me.”Playing alongside all-star teammate Trae Young, Daniels made the most of the opportunity with Atlanta. He averaged 14.1 points per game, an increase of 8.3 on the previous season, and three steals per contest, the highest figure in the league.The man given the nickname “The Great Barrier Thief” recorded 229 takeaways in all, the most in a season in almost 30 years. He was also among three nominees for the league’s defensive player of the year award, won by Cleveland’s Evan Mobley.The 22-year-old said landing at Atlanta gave him a fresh start. “It’s just coming in with the right mindset, working hard in the offseason, having a good Olympic campaign, and going out there and being aggressive, being myself, and not caring about making mistakes,” he said.“The main theme this year is I got trust in my coaches, trust in my teammates, and I was able to go out there and just be myself.”Daniels earned first place votes from 44 of the award’s 100 voters, delivering him 332 total points based on a 5-3-1 voting system.Los Angeles Clippers’ centre Ivica Zubac finished second with 186 points, and Detroit guard Cade Cunningham attracted 122.

Murray ruptured his Achilles tendon in January and Griffin was fired as the Pelicans’ executive vice president two weeks ago.Daniels helped the Hawks finish ninth in the NBA’s Eastern Conference, but the team lost a painful play-in match against Miami in overtime.The Australian, who grew grew up in Bendigo –a hotbed of Australian basketball talent– has returned to stay with his family in Melbourne following the conclusion of the season.His older brother Kai plays VFL with Richmond, and his younger brother Dash is due to play in the NBL with Melbourne United later this year as part of the Next Star programme.Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead.”View image in fullscreenTesla CEO Elon Musk.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersIt followed a Wall Street Journal story published on Wednesday that claimed “board members” had contacted headhunters to recruit a successor about a month ago.The reported move came as tensions grew at Tesla aroundfalling profitsand criticism of Musk for spending much of his time in Washington, where he has been helping Donald Trump slash federal spending asde facto head of the “department of government efficiency” (Doge).It is unclear in the report whether these members were acting on behalf of the board as a collective, or if it was only some of them taking steps to find a new chief executive. The Tesla board is made up of eight people, including Elon Musk himself, his brother, Kimbal Musk, and James Murdoch, son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.Tesla has been hit by a widespread backlash against Musk’s recent political activity, not only against his Doge work, but also his public support for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party before German national elections in February. Sales of the electric car have dropped in some of its biggest markets and there have been political protests at some of its showrooms.Last week, thecompany reported that profits had dropped by 71%in the first quarter of this year to $409m (£307m), compared with $1.39bn in the same period in 2024. Meanwhile, Tesla’s stock has suffered, with the company losing about a quarter of its market value this year.Musk told investors that starting from May he would be“allocating far more of my time to Tesla”.He is scheduled to leave his government role on 30 May, according to a strict 130-day cap on his service as a special government employee.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over the course of just a few months, he has gutted agencies and public services that took decades to build while accumulating immense political power.Musk’s role in theTrump administrationis without modern precedent. Never before has the world’s richest person been deputized by the US president to cull the very agencies that oversee his businesses. Musk’s attempts to radically dismantle government bureaus have won him sprawling influence. His team has embedded its members in key roles across federal agencies, gained access to personal data on millions of Americans and fired tens of thousands of workers. SpaceX, where he is CEO, is now poised to take over potential government contracts worth billions. He has left a trail of chaos while seeding the government with his allies, who will probably help him profit and preserve his newfound power.The billionaire’s newfound sway has not come without pushback and a cost. Doge’s blitz through the government has sparked furious nationwide backlash, as well as dozens of lawsuits challenging Musk’s mass firings and accusing his taskforce of violating numerous laws. Musk’spersonalpopularityhas sunk to record lows, andTesla’s profitshave tanked.Chaos unleashed by Musk’s Doge is starting to wane – what does that mean?Read moreA look back at thefirst 100 daysof the Trump administration shows the extent to which Musk’s efforts have changed the US government. It also shows that what Musk framed as a cost-cutting task initiative is failing to meet its ostensible goal offinding $1tnin fraud or waste, but it is succeeding in reshaping federal agencies along ideological grounds,paving the way for private companiesto fill the resulting vacuum of public services.Musk has recentlystopped physically workingfrom the White House and stated he plans to pivot away from his government position soon, but has entrenched himself as one of the world’s most divisive political figures and shows no sign he is willing to fully give up his influence. Instead, the first 100 days of Doge shows that the scope of Musk’s ambition extends to remaking how the government deals with everything from humanitarian aid to the rule of law.Doge sweeps through agenciesOn the same day Trump was sworn into office, the president issued anexecutive orderthat created Musk’s “department of government efficiency” by renaming the US Digital Service agency, which previously handled governmental tech issues. Trump’s order included only a vague mandate to modernize government technology and increase efficiency, but within days it would become clear that Musk and his team had far more expansive aims.In the months leading up to the executive order, Musk had been hiring ateam of staffersthat included a mix of young engineers, tech world executives and longtime lieutenants from his private companies. Running the day-to-day operations was Steve Davis, who had worked with Musk at various companies, including SpaceX and the Boring Company, for more than 20 years. Davis was known as an exacting boss – Musk oncecompared him to chemotherapy. Others had far less experience, including 19-year-oldEdward Coristine, who had worked for several months at Musk’s Neuralink company. The teenager had beenfired from a previous internshipfor leaking information and went by the username “big balls” in online profiles.Doge’s early days made headlines for targeting masses of government workers with layoffs and pushing others to resign, with more than 2 million employeesreceiving an emailon 28 January titled “Fork in the road” that encouraged staffers to take a buyout. The emails, which asked: “What did you accomplish this week?” would become a signature of Musk and his new bureau, sent again and again whenever staff began to prey on a new herd of government employees.Shortly after Trump’s executive order created Doge, Musk’s team quickly began popping up in the offices of numerous agencies. One of the first was theGeneral Services Administration, which oversees digital technology and government buildings. Doge staffers appeared on Zoom calls with no introduction and hidden last names, questioning federal employees about what they did for work and refusing to answer questions. They also began to show up in person, taking over conference rooms andmoving Ikea bedson to the sixth floor of the GSA to sleep overnight. Perplexed government workers at numerous agencies described Doge’s actions as a hostile takeover, where a goon squad would appear and demand rapid changes to systems they knew little about.Trump 100 days: delusions of monarchy coupled with fundamental ineptitudeRead more“They’ve only fired people and turned things off,” said a current federal employee, who agreed to speak anonymously for fear of retribution.Simultaneously, Doge staffers were aggressively gaining access to key data systems that controlled the flow of payments to federal workers and funding for government contracts. In one striking incident, Doge team members clashed with the highest-ranking career official at the treasury department over access to a payment system that controls $6tn in annual funds. The fight ended with the official, David Lebryk, beingput on administrative leavebefore he ultimately resigned. Doge staff obtained the access they wanted.Pushback against Doge from other officials resulted in similar punishments. As Doge staffers stormed into the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in early February, they found themselves in aheated standoffwith security officials who tried to bar them from accessing a secure room which held sensitive and confidential data. The confrontation ended with USAID’s top security official being put on administrative leave, while Doge gained access to its systems. With no one to stop them, Doge staffers then began the process ofhollowing out the agencythat had once been the world’s largest single supplier of humanitarian aid. More than 5,600 USAID workers around the worldwould be firedin the ensuing weeks.“We spent the weekend feedingUSAIDinto the wood chipper,” Musk boasted days later on X, his social media platform.Musk moves to gut the governmentDoge’s targeting of USAID turned out to be a blueprint for how Musk and company would go after other parts of the government. In early February, Musk’s team had established a presence across federal agencies and placed itself at the fulcrum of government employment systems. The next step was mass layoffs.“We do need to delete entire agencies,” Musktoldattenders at a World Governments Summit in Dubai on 13 February. “If we don’t remove the roots of the weed, then it’s easy for the weed to grow back.”The same day as Musk’s remarks, the Trump administrationordered agencies to fire thousandsof probationary workers – a designation that applies to employees who have been at their jobs for less than a year, including those who may have been recently promoted. Other workers soon received an email from Doge that demanded theylist five thingsthat they did last week or face termination, a chaotic request that also turned out to be an empty threat.Cabinet officialsprivatelydeemed it nonsensical.Amid the widespread cuts, Musk began reveling in his new powers both on X and in public appearances. At the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on 23 February he stood on stage in a black Maga hat, sunglasses and gold chain, gleefullywielding a chainsawthat was gifted to him by Javier Milei, the rightwing populist Argentinian president.“This chainsaw is for bureaucracy!” he said. “I am become meme.”While Musk celebrated his first cuts, Doge began going after entire offices and agencies it viewed as politically progressive or opposed to its goals. The GSA’s18F office, which helped build software projects such as the IRS’s free tax filing service, was one of the first targets. On 3 February, Musk told a rightwing influencer on X that the office was “deleted” in response to an inaccurate post accusing the group of being radical leftists. Employees at the 18F office asked their new Musk-allied leadership what “deleted” meant, former workers said, but received no further clarification. The employees continued working for weeks under a cloud of confusion and tension with their new leaders, until the middle of the night on Saturday 1 March, when theyreceived an emailsaying they were going to be laid off en masse.Musk may soon leave the White House, but his bromance with Trump will remainRead more“We were living proof that the talking points of this administration were false. Government services can be efficient,” Lindsay Young, the former executive director of 18F, said in a post on LinkedIn. “This made us a target.”Doge’s influence soon extended beyond government tech offices into major agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services, whichannounced in Marchthat it was cutting 10,000 jobs to align with Trump’s executive order on Doge. In a display of the chaos that Doge had inspired, the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, weeks later admitted that around 2,000 of those workerswere fired in errorand would need to be reinstated.Musk fights the judicial systemAs soon as Trump issued the executive order to create Doge,watchdogandlabor groupsfiled lawsuits challenging its legality. More lawsuits piled on as Doge accessed sensitive data systems, fired workers and refused to respond to public records requests. Altogether, there have now been more than two dozen cases targeting the agency.At first, Doge and Musk seemed to move faster than the judicial system could respond as they slashed and burned government agencies. Around the start of March, however, many of the court casesbegan to produce rulingsthat curtailed Doge’s layoffs and temporarily blocked its staff’s access to data. Judges ruled that the Trump administrationneeded to reinstateprobationary workers that they fired,limited some Doge accessto databases at agencies such as the Social Security Administration andordered Musk’s teamto turn over internal records it had been seeking to keep private.Musk’s reaction was a constant stream ofattacks against the judicial systemon X, which includeddemandsthat lawmakers “impeach the judges” and claims that there was a “judicial coup” under way against Trump. Musk repeatedly amplified far-right influencers saying that the US should emulate El Salvador’s strongman president, Nayib Bukele, whoseparty oustedsupreme court judges in 2021 in a slide toward authoritarianism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The billionaire and the groups he funded put more than $20m toward electing a conservative judge, which he claimed was crucial to “the future of civilization”.The attempt toinfluence the Wisconsin votefollowed his blueprint from the presidential race. His Super Pac offered $100 to voters willing to sign a petition stating their opposition to “activist judges”, and he held a campaign rally where hegave out$1m checks on stage. Musk’s effortfailed to convince voters, with his preferred candidatelosingby 10 percentage points.The outcome of the Wisconsin supreme court race proved to be the first in a series of setbacks that tested the limits of Musk’s political influence and thetoxicity of his personal brand. As the billionaire embraced his new role as a Republican mega-donor and placed himself often literally at center stage, it became clear that his routinedid not always play welloutside of the insulated bubbles of Maga rallies and Tesla product launches. While people saw more and more of Musk,polls showedthat thepublic liked himless and less.Protests boom against Musk and TeslaAs Musk’s association with Trump and the international far right became too prominent to ignore over the past year, there has been a rising social stigma against associating with his products. The most tangible symbol of Musk’s empire,Tesla, has become the focus of an international protest movement since the creation of Doge.SpaceX, the second-largest source of Musk’s wealth, has seemed insulated from the vicissitudes of consumer sentiment and increased its role in US space operations.Protests at Tesla dealerships, as well as vandalism against individual cars,started smallin the weeks after inauguration, with gatherings of a few dozen people in cities including New York City and San Francisco. Some Tesla owners sold their carsdue to the association with Muskor placed “I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy” bumper stickers on their vehicles. The demonstrations quickly escalated to more cities, though, organizing under the banner of“Tesla Takedown” proteststhat targeted showrooms around the country.Federal workers fear Musk’s ‘efficiency’ agency is using AI to spy on them: ‘They are omnipresent’Read moreBy mid-March, a fully fledged international protest movement against Tesla and Musk had formed and brought about mass protests. Thousands of peoplegathered at showroomsfrom Sydney to San Francisco on 30 March in a day of action, with organizers stating that “hurting Tesla is stopping Musk”. Vandalism against Tesla dealerships, charging stations and cars alsointensified around the world, including multiplemolotov cocktail attacksandincidents of arson. Trump and Musk called the attacks domestic terrorism, while Pam Bondi, the attorney general,vowed to crack downon anyone targeting Tesla.The pressure on Tesla represented a real threat to the company, which was already dealing with an overall sluggish market for electric vehicles and increased competition from Chinese automakers. As protests spread, Musk leaned on his status in Maga world to attempt to revitalize the brand.Trump appearedon the White House driveway in front of several parked Teslas, telling reporters that he was going to buy one of them and praising Musk as a “patriot”. Others in Trump’s orbit, including the Fox News host Sean Hannity, also posted sales pitches for the automaker.Despite praise from Trump and Musk’s assurances to workers and investors that theyshould not sell Tesla stock, analysts reported that the protests along with other economic issues were nevertheless taking a toll. A stock selloff has resulted in Tesla’s share price falling around 25% since the start of the year, wiping billions of dollars from Musk’s net worth. A first-quarter earnings call on 22 April revealed Tesla’s performancewas even worsethan expectations, with a 71% drop in profits and 9% drop in revenue year over year.Musk announced on the call that he would spendsignificantly less timeworking on Doge starting sometime in May.Musk eyes an exit, but Doge remainsMusk’s declaration that he would pare back his time with Doge to one or two days a week gave a more definitive sense of his exit after weeks ofspeculationabout when and how he would leave the White House. Although Trump has remained adamant that Musk is doing a good job and remains welcome in the administration, a growing chorus of top officials have either openly feuded with him or privately griped about his presence throughout his first 100 days.Musk has had intense clashes with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, transportation secretary Sean Duffy and several other top Trump staffers. He reportedly got into anear-physical shouting matchwith the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in recent weeks, and has publicly called the chief trade adviser,Peter Navarro, the architect of Trump’s tariff policies,“dumber than a sack of bricks”.The amazing thing is that they haven’t actually done anything constructive whatsoever. Literally all they’ve done is destroy thingsCurrent federal employeeThe power struggles between Musk and administration officials leave it unclear how much say Doge will have without Musk constantly placed at the right hand of the president, but his allies are still spread throughout the government and actively working on carrying out his mission. Doge has continued to target agencies throughout April,gutting smaller groupssuch as an agency that coordinates government policy on homelessness, and eyeing others including thePeace Corpsfor mass layoffs.Some of Doge’s cuts have directly targeted agencies that oversee Musk’s companies, including at theNational Highway Traffic Safety Administrationthat regulates and investigates the risks of self-driving cars. Shifts in priorities and leadership at agencies such as Nasa and the Pentagon also put SpaceX in a position topotentially make billionsoff of new contracts, while former government employees say it is likely Dogealready has accessto confidential business data on SpaceX’s competitors.While part of the Doge team is still finding workers to fire, other members have begun accessing even more data systems and are starting to put them to work. One target has been immigration, where Doge staff have accessed personal information that includes therapy records forunaccompanied migrant children,housing informationand biometric data. The goal, multiple outletshavereported, is to create a master database that could be used to enforce the Trump administration’s deportations and other anti-immigration maneuvers.Elon Musk’s Doge conflicts of interest worth $2.37bn, Senate report saysRead moreMission accomplished?As Doge’s purpose has become more amorphous over its first three months, its initially advertised goal of cutting $1-2tn from the budget has moved further from view. Musk has instead shifted the goal posts, saying that he expects to find $150bn in savings this year – a fraction of his original goal and a small dent in the overall federal budget. That number may also be an illusion, as Doge’s tally of its savings has been filled with constant errors and miscalculations. Much of Doge’s savings couldalso be erasedby the costs of defending itself in court andlosses associatedwith its mass layoffs.The real effects of Doge’s first 100 days are still playing out. Dismantling USAID isprojected to causearound176,000 excess deaths, more than half of them children, according to a Boston University tracking project. Cuts to agencies such as theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Associationand Federal Emergency Management Agency could imperil natural disaster forecasting and relief. Agencies such asVeterans Affairsthat provide public services may deteriorate, while cuts to research and education programsmay be felt for decadesto come.“The amazing thing is that they haven’t actually done anything constructive whatsoever. Literally all they’ve done is destroy things,” a current federal employee said of Doge. “People are going to miss the federal government that they had.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsTeslaSpaceXUSAIDfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Sky Glass gen 2 is a straight replacement for theoriginal model from 2021, which introduced Sky’s TV-over-broadband service that ditched the need for a satellite dish. The new TV comes in three sizes and you can buy the smallest 43in version for a one-off payment of £699 or £14 a month spread over four years, after which you own it.It requires a Sky subscription for full use, costing from £15 a month for the Sky Essential TV pack. You wouldn’t buy a Glass without the intention of using Sky, but should you want to ditch the subscription at a later date it willfunction as a basic smart TVwith access to streaming apps such as BBC iPlayer, plusa basic aerialand multiple HDMI inputs.View image in fullscreenThe gen 2 is available in a choice of three colours and comes with a colour-matched remote.Photograph: Sky UKFrom the front, the gen 2 model looks very similar to the original. It has the same monolithic design with an aluminium body, slim bezels, a soundbar hidden behind a colour-matched mesh at the bottom and voice control mics that respond to “Hello Sky”. Glass gen 2 is thinner and lighter than the outgoing model, though still heavy for a modern TV, weighing 14.7kg for the 43in version with the stand. The larger and heavier 55in and 65in models will require two people to safely manoeuvre them.A redesigned stand makes it a lot easier to set up, even at the 65in size as tested, with the TV simply slotting on to two prongs for a very stable mount without screws or tools required. It needs a power cable and wifi or Ethernet for internet. A wall bracket can be bought separately.View image in fullscreenThe TV is voice- and motion-activated, turning on and off when it detects presence, and displaying full-screen recommendations for the latest shows and films.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe crisp 4K LCD screen is noticeably brighter than its predecessor, with deeper blacks and much-reduced halo or blooming effect, which is the unwanted glow around the edges of bright spots such as white text on a black background. The screen has automatic brightness adjustment, which made things look a little too dark and grey in all but the brightest of rooms. Turning it off improved things.Sky has automatic picture optimisation modes that detect the content being watched, such as entertainment, sport and movies, plus manual vivid and extra vivid modes for those who like over-the-top colours. I found the entertainment mode made the picture too warm, with people looking a little orange, while sport was a bit grey for all but the brightest of match days.I preferred the movie setting, which is much more balanced, but there is also a custom mode for those who want to fully personalise the picture.The improved screen really comes to life with HDR films, shows and sport. The Premier League looks crisp and vibrant on Sky and TNT, while flicks such asFuriosa: A Mad Max Sagain Dolby Vision look particularly good. But the screen is not ideal for gaming with an Xbox or PS5, lacking the variable refresh rates of up to 120Hz that console gaming greatly benefits from.Big sound and great vocalsView image in fullscreenThe speakers fire out from the grille at the top of the TV and fabric strip below the screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianA big advantage of the Glass over normal TVs is the integrated seven-speaker soundbar, which blows other TV speakers away for power and clarity. Vocals are particularly clear at almost any volume and with none of thelip-sync issuesthat can plague external soundbars. Without a separate subwoofer or rear speakers, it does an admirable job of producing big and full sound.However, it struggles to produce really deep, booming bass, and while it has a nice wide sound, there isn’t much in the way of virtual surround effect. Both require a more complex system to achieve with more speakers.The TV also has night sound, speech enhancement and bass boost modes, the first of which proved very useful to avoid waking the rest of the house for late-night movies, by dampening loud noises while keeping the dialogue intelligible.Much-improved Sky over broadbandView image in fullscreenYou need a minimum of 25Mbps for HD or 30Mbps for UHD broadcast, but don’t have to have Sky’s broadband for it to work.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSince the original Glass’s launch in 2021, the Sky OS service powering it has dramatically improved. It still has excellent search and an improved playlist function, with more than one user profile so everyone in the house can have their own lists and recommendations, including child profiles.The playlist feature automatically keeps track of new episodes of shows and films you want to watch, regardless of which service they’re available from. It feeds into a recently added “continue watching” rail that helps you jump straight back into the content you were previously watching, which is all I needed about 75% of the time.Watching, pausing and rewinding live TV works great. Recentreductions to the broadcast delayfor sports have made a meaningful difference, preventing the irritating scenario where a friend watching on satellite or aerial a little ahead of you texts to brag about a goal before you’ve managed to actually see it.On-demand content from the Sky platform works really well, but a bigger improvement is in the third-party on-demand services such as BBC iPlayer, ITV X and Channel 4, on which you are reliant in place of recordings. It’s still not quite as fast and seamless as having local recordings, such as you might on Sky Q or other PVR, but most of the apps launch quicker, work better and will take you straight to the episode you want to watch from the playlist or search page.It supports most of the major on-demand services, including My5, YouTube, Prime Video, Disney+, Paramount+, Apple TV+ and Discovery+, for all your content in one place.View image in fullscreenVoice control works well through the button on the remote, but the TV’s wake word is a little temperamental, working properly or understanding me about 60% of the time.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSustainabilityThe television isrepairable apart from the screen. It contains 22% recycled material, including aluminium, fabric, tin and plastic. The company will recycle its old products and ships the TV in plastic-free packaging.PriceSky Glass gen 2 costs£699at 43in, £949 at 55in or £1,199 at 65in, with 24- or 48-month interest-free payment plans available for all models with a £20 upfront cost.On 24-month contracts, Sky Essential TV costs from £15 a month, Sky Ultimate TV from £22 a month, and UHD + Dolby Atmos costs an additional £6, as does the ability to skip ads. Other add-ons include Sky Sports from £31 a month, TNT Sport from £31 a month, Sky Cinema from £13 a month and Sky Kids at £8 a month. Some discounts are available for certain combinations, while all the packages can be bought on a 31-day basis at different prices.VerdictThe first-generation Glass required work when it launched, to the television screen and the Sky streaming service powering it. The gen 2 model rights many of the wrongs of its predecessor.It is brighter, faster, has higher contrast and handles highlights far better. It is also easily the best-sounding TV available. It competes fairly well in the mid-range market but you can certainly buy a better-looking screen for similar money without a soundbar; those looking for the absolute best picture should look elsewhere.The Sky OS service has greatly improved to a level that rivals the best in the business. Live broadcast works just as it might over satellite or aerial. On-demand content from the Sky platform is as good as local recordings while the third-party apps such as BBC iPlayer and ITVX have levelled up to at least an acceptable standard. The playlist and search with support for all the major streaming services are the killer features, removing the burden of remembering which of the plethora of services hosts the content you want to watch.Above all, it is the level of convenience offered by the Glass gen 2, of an all-in one solution with solid sound and a single remote for all your TV needs, that is the major appeal.Pros:all-in-one streaming and pay TV device, great sound, no satellite/cable or aerial needed, good remote, excellent search and playlist functions, improved apps, improved picture and good HDR, custom picture modes, optional motion-sensing and voice control.Cons:better picture available for less from competitors, some picture modes and automatic brightness control aren’t great, no fast refresh rate for game consoles, thick and heavy, no Chromecast support, some third-party catchup/on-demand services still aren’t great.View image in fullscreenThe power and a mic mute button are in the right side of the TV.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsTelevisionSky (Business)Sky (Media)GadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Analysts had predicted revenue of $94.5bn and earnings of $1.62. The company, worth $3.2tn, has beaten Wall Street’s expectations for the previous four quarters.Investors have been keepingtheir eyes on Apple as it prepared to report its financial results . The tech giant has been working to calm nervous analysts afterDonald Trumplevied sweepingtariffson countries around the world that are likely to complicate supply chains for consumer electronics. Since the beginning of the year, Apple’s stock has slumped 16%.During a call with investors on Thursday,AppleCEO Tim Cook said that he expects the tariffs to add $900m to its costs for the upcoming quarter that ends in June. That’s assuming, he said, that the global tariff rates don’t change again. Cook declined to speculate further into the future, saying,:“I’m not sure what will happen with the tariffs … It’s very difficult to predict beyond June.”In after-hours trading, the company’s stock dropped by more than 4%, likely due to the tariffs news and its services division reporting revenue that missed Wall Street’s expectations, despite growth over last year. The division covers iCloud subscriptions and revenue from various licensing deals. Sales inChinaalso missed estimates.Cook, remained positive, however, saying that the company was reporting “strong quarterly results” and “we’re very engaged on the tariff discussions”.White House insists iPhones will be US-made – but Apple calls it a non-starterRead moreThe iPhone maker is heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing for its phones, tablets and laptops. Days after Trump instituted soaring tariffs on China, at one pointas high as 245%, the president said he wouldmake an exceptionfor consumer electronics.Cook spoke to senior White House officials around this time, according to theWashington Post. It was after these conversations that Trump announced his exception for consumer electronics. Apple’s stock rose 7% in the days after the announcement.However, it is unclear how lasting the reprieve may be. Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, hascalled the exemption “temporary”, and even Trump later said on social media that there’s been no “exception”.The president has repeatedly said he wants to see more manufacturing in the US. In February, he met with Cook to discuss investing in US manufacturing. “He’s going to start building,” Trump said after the meeting. “Very big numbers – you have to speak to him. I assume they’re going to announce it at some point.”JP Morgan estimates costs would skyrocket for Apple if it moves production to the US, saying in a note this week that it could “drive a 30% price increase in the near-term, assuming a 20% tariff on China”. JP Morgan and other analysts have said Apple could continue to move more of its manufacturing to India, which only faces a 10% tariff.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump tariffs are ‘category 5 price storm’Read moreApple chartered jets toairlift some $2bn worth of iPhones from Indiato the US earlier this month to boost inventory in anticipation of price hikes from Trump’s tariffs and panic-buying by worried consumers. This comes as investors have expressed concerned about decreasing iPhone sales in China, the world’s biggest smartphone market. During its last earnings in January, Apple reported thatiPhone sales fellby 11.1% in China in the first quarter and missed Wall Street’s expectations for iPhone revenue.Cook said during the investor call that China would continue to be a major manufacturer for the company, but that for the June quarter India would be producing more iPhones for Apple and Vietnam would make more iPads and Macs. “The existing tariffs that apply to Apple today depend on products’ country of origin,” he said. India and Vietnam have lower tariffs than China.In the short term, analysts say the tariff confusion could benefit Apple as people rush to buy more of its products in fear that prices will rise.“What remains to be seen in the longer term is how much of any increased cost will be passed on to consumers,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, principal analyst for Forrester. “And if [consumers] will absorb these price increases without pulling back on demand for Apple products.”Explore more on these topicsAppleQuarterly resultsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationiPhoneSmartphonesnewsShareReuse this content"

She added: “This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order.”Gonzalez Rogers referred Apple and one of its executives, Alex Roman, vice-president of finance, to federal prosecutors for a criminal contempt investigation into their conduct in the case.Roman gave testimony about the steps Apple took to comply with her injunction that was “replete with misdirection and outright lies”, the judge wrote.Apple and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The EpicGameschief executive, Tim Sweeney, called the judge’s order a significant win for developers and consumers.“It forces Apple to compete with other payment services rather than blocking them, and this is what we wanted all along,” Sweeney told reporters.Sweeney said Epic Games would aim to bring Fortnite back to the Apple App Store next week. Apple in 2020 had pulled Epic’s account after the company let iPhone users navigate outside Apple’s ecosystem for better payment deals.Epic accused Apple of stifling competition for app downloads and overcharging commissions for in-app purchases.Gonzalez Rogers in 2021 found Apple violated a California competition law and ordered the company to allow developers more freedom to direct app users to other payment options. Apple failed last year to persuade the US supreme court to strike down the injunction.Epic Games told the court in March 2024 that Apple was “blatantly” violating the court’s order, including by imposing a new 27% fee on app developers when Apple customers completed an app purchase outside the App Store. Apple charges developers a 30% commission fee for purchases within the App Store.Apple also began displaying messages warning customers of the potential danger of external links in order to deter non-Apple payments, Epic Games alleged, calling Apple’s new system “commercially unusable”.Apple has denied any wrongdoing. The company in a court filing on 7 March told Gonzalez Rogers it had undertaken “extensive efforts” to comply with the injunction “while preserving the fundamental features of Apple’s business model and safeguarding consumers”.Gonzalez Rogers suggested at an earlier hearing that changes made by Apple to its App Store had no purpose “other than to stifle competition”.In Wednesday’s ruling, Gonzalez Rogers said Apple was immediately barred from impeding developers’ ability to communicate with users, and the company must not levy its new commission on off-app purchases.She said Apple cannot ask her to pause her ruling “given the repeated delays and severity of the conduct”. She took no view on whether a criminal case should be opened.“It will be for the executive branch to decide whether Apple should be deprived of the fruits of its violation, in addition to any penalty geared to deter future misconduct,” the judge wrote.Explore more on these topicsAppleFortniteGamesLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

A more realistic estimate is that while Ukraine is glad to sign, this is not a shift in the big pictureThu 1 May 2025 13.56 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 17.54 EDTShareThe Trump administration, with its customary rhetorical inflation, has hailed itsmineral dealwith Ukraine as “historic”. What the world’s most powerful nation says and does matters. But how much? And for how long? This is a government of caprice and chaos. Attempting to connect the data points can be like trying to join up the bug splats on a windscreen. The real issue is that the vehicle is still following the signs for Moscow.This moment looks like a high because US-Ukraine ties hit such a low, particularly with the Oval Office bullying of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and reports that Washington is willing to recognise annexed Crimea as Russian.Key details of this dealhave yet to be finalised in a technical agreement. The idea originated with Kyiv, which saw that economic incentives might be the only way to interest the money-minded US president in its defence. The Trump administration decided the answer was, in essence, to take all the resources without granting the security guarantee that Ukraine had sought. It looked a bit like a protection racket, without ongoing protection.To reach a profit-sharing deal, therefore, is a success for Ukrainian diplomacy in very difficult circumstances and arguably the first positive sign in the bilateral relationship since Mr Trump took office. The textrefers to “Russia’s full-scale invasion” and “war machine”– the kind of language that the administration has not only avoided butactively rejectedelsewhere. (In February, Mr Trump said that Ukraine “should never have started it”.) Ukraine will not be retroactively repaying the US for its support. Kyiv has also said that for the first 10 years, profits will be “fully reinvested in Ukraine’s economy”, though this does not appear to be stated in the document.But the agreement’s significance is limited. The presence of American citizens and businesses is not inherently protective: they were already in Ukraine when Vladimir Putin’s tanks rolled across the border in 2022. The agreement certainly does not show that Mr Trump wants toprolong US military aid– thoughreports saythat the administration plans to approve $50m of arms exports – still less offer a security backstop to a European presence. It does not signal that he is turning his back on Mr Putin, even if he is currently voicing irritation with him. And it does not mean that abigger economic dealwith Russia may not be in the pipeline.Touting this agreement as evidence of his deal‑making prowess could encourage Mr Trump to feel a degree of political investment in the crisis, and perhaps therefore make Mr Putin step a little more carefully. But the Russian president may think he should seize more territory while he can. Mr Trump’s peace-making efforts to date have amounted to attempting to strong-armUkraineinto accepting Moscow’s terms because he thinks that any deal looks better than none.At a time of such peril, even very limited gains will be welcomed and exploited. Mr Trump may be somewhat more inclined to allow military intelligence to keep flowing, or European nations to buy arms for Ukraine. In the worst case scenario, Kyiv has shored up the relationship for a short period, while European allies step up support. That is not nothing. But an administration which has so harshly demanded Ukraine’s gratitude has yet to give it anything deserving of thanks.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Should we – can we – do anything to help the American people in their moment of democratic peril?”If leaders stay silent, the US won’t survive Trump’s next 100 days | Robert ReichRead moreYes. I firmly believe that the European Union, the United Kingdom,Canadaand Japan have a historic obligation to the American people to do what they can to help us preserve our democracy. An America descending into authoritarianism also poses a threat to the democracies they lead.I have two memories that speak to how foreign democracies should think about what they see happening in the United States of 2025.When my mother passed away, I found a small ceramic teapot in her cupboard with gold lettering on the bottom that read: “For England and Democracy. This teapot was transported to the USA by the Royal Navy.” My mother had purchased it during the early days of the second world war to support Britain and its people. Ordinary Americans such as my mother were doing their part – however small – to support a democratic country besieged by Nazi Germany.During the cold war, I remember hearing American presidents deliver speeches that were highly critical of the Soviet Union. At the end of these remarks, they would sometimes take a moment to directly address “the Russian people”. Our presidents were saying: “We see you as victims of oppression. We know that you are suffering under a cruel regime, and we hope that someday, in some manner, you will be free from the yoke of Soviet communism.” I know that when these messages got through Russian jamming, they were heard and gave some degree of hope to large segments of the Russian population.These two memories tell me that fundamental bonds based on enduring values can exist between governments and peoples who are not citizens of that government. Freedom, democracy and the rule of law can be those values. They also say that in the modern world, ordinary citizens in one nation can take a range of actions to support governments and citizens of another country.Today’s America is a place of fear for many. Americans are afraid that their livelihoods will be destroyed by a president who exercises unconstitutional acts of political retribution against his “enemies”. His targets: universities, law firms, corporations, states, certain agencies of his own government, and any federal employee who dissents in public. The judiciary and the media have been targets of vicious verbal attacks from Trump and his allies in Congress, which are precursors of actual future assaults. Foreign students, permanent residents and immigrants are rounded up and deported using highly questionable methods.European, Canadian and Japanese leaders are having a difficult time adjusting to this new American reality. The muscle memory of 80 years of intense cooperation, and in some cases dependency on the United States, is very difficult to break.I know the questions these leaders must be asking in private: is the United States becoming our adversary and perhaps our enemy? Will we be alone in our battle against the authoritarians in Russia and China? Will Trump andElon Muskuse governmental power and immense personal wealth to undermine our own democracies by encouraging the growth of far-right, anti-democratic forces in our countries? How can we protect ourselves when the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world is in rapid retreat from justice, from economic reality, from science, from policies that protect global health, while it aggressively pursues actions that accelerate dangerous atmospheric warming to the detriment of all?The silence of European, Canadian and Japanese leaders in the face of the US’s democratic crisis is both understandable and deeply disappointing. But make no mistake, their silence is a betrayal of their historic obligation to the American people as well as their commitment to democratic forces the world over. There are at least three difficult steps these leaders should consider.First, they must form common cause with the American people – not our government – and publicly state what they are saying in private. American democracy is in peril from an increasingly lawless government in Washington. They need to acknowledge that if American democracy erodes and dies, democracies the world over will be less safe. For the first time in history, Americans need to hear a message from foreign democratic leaders in support of preserving and sustaining our 249-year-old republic. You owe us at least this if you believe in democracy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Refuse to visit the United States and make it clear that the US president is not welcome in Europe, Canada and Japan. If the US slips further into authoritarianism or undermines your own democracies, consider suspending the G-7’s yearly meetings and taking further actions to indicate that diplomatic business as usual will not be the norm as theTrump administrationpursues an anti-democratic path.We are witnessing slow constitutional collapse in the US | Moira DoneganRead moreThird, move aggressively to act as Trump attacks our great universities and science centers, weakens countless not-for-profit organizations including our national museums, cultural centers and public media, as he moves to destroy US humanitarian relief efforts, as he terminates prior US environmental commitments and repeals laws and regulations designed to slow the climate crisis. Invite Americans engaged in these endeavors to work directly with the people of Europe, Canada and Japan and your like-minded institutions to support these American entities because they are part of our democratic fabric. And they often better your own societies and help people the world over. Establish and encourage the creation of people-to-people initiatives that will bring Europeans, Canadians, Japanese and Americans closer together to carry on what Trump and his allies are either destroying or weakening.I know that taking these actions will be extremely difficult. Trump will respond with verbal assaults and irrational retaliation because his power is unchecked. He and his allies will accuse you of interfering in our domestic affairs. In forming common cause with Americans fighting for our democracy, I deeply regret that you will begin to understand the growing fear that grips all segments of our society, and the retaliation visited every day upon the American people and institutions Trump deems as “enemies”.Defending European, Canadian and Japanese economic interests from Trump’s obsession with tariffs and other harmful actions he may take in the foreign policy arena, though important, does not repay the historic debt that you owe the people of the United States to help us preserve our democracy. I ask you to understand that staying silent asDonald Trumpweakens American democracy will not deter him from harming your democratic societies. And your silence can only serve to embolden him in his efforts to erode the democratic standards embedded in the US constitution.The writer is a former US diplomat who wishes to remain anonymousExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationEuropeCanadaJapanRussiacommentShareReuse this content"

Trump’s deportations are disturbingly familiarMark DenbeauxThe government’s claims against detainees were paper-thin and the process riddled with errors. Now history is repeatingThu 1 May 2025 08.00 EDTShareGuantánamo is a horror Americans have tried to forget. But the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) deportation regime resembles so many of Guantánamo’s evils that it compels comparison. That comparison reveals significant differences but frightening similarities.On 11 January 2002, the detention facility opened. The first detainees, in orange jumpsuits, hobbled along in a parade to show the press the success of the government in this battle of the “war on terror”.Despite this dramatic perp walk, there were very few actual terrorists among that group. Indeed, very few real terrorists were ever brought to Gitmo. No hearings, proceedings or reviews were held for any of these initial detainees to determine why they were included. What mattered was not the truth but the photo op.I represented four individuals detained for almost 20 years in Gitmo, so it was not surprising that I reacted viscerally to the sight of people abducted on the streets of my own country by unidentified men in civilian dress; shackled and then shoved into unmarked cars, driven to secret locations, and held incommunicado, including being cut off from families and lawyers.Gitmo was a military base outside the United States and chosen for this purpose because it seemed unlikely that the constitution reached actions involving foreigners there and because any press access could be tightly controlled. That enabled the systematic demonization of detainees, which was critical to denials of any hearing to them.Such demonization was such a success for Gitmo that the first lawyers arrived believing we were meeting monsters. Most attorneys left their first encounters with their clients believing that, while other detainees must be demons, each lawyer’s own client was the unfortunate victim of a mistaken arrest. It was only much later that it became clear that such “mistakes” were the rule, not the exception.For me, the truth emerged one night when sitting outside the barracks under a star-studded Cuban sky with other lawyers talking about their client visits. We could talk to each other only while at the Gitmo naval base; our secret clearances forbade reporting anything about our clients when we returned home. One said: “I know that there are bad guys here, but my guy is not one. I don’t know why he is here.”I was relieved to hear that, because neither of my two clients deserved to be there, either.The next day, during my visit, my client asked why was I there and what could I do for him. I explained that the supreme court had allowed him to have a lawyer to represent him. He was unimpressed: “And if you win in court for me, what good will winning be? How big is the supreme court’s army?’Even today, some don’t recognize the wholesale deception of labelling the great majority of Gitmo detainees “terrorists”. When forced, years after the first detentions, to produce its basis for detention for one inmate, the only claims the government made, in their entirety, were:Detainee is associated with the TalibanI The detainee indicates that he was conscripted into the Taliban.Detainee engaged in hostilities against the US or its coalition partners.The detainee admits he was a cook’s assistant for Taliban forces in Narim, Afghanistan under the command of Haji Mullah Baki.ii. Detainee fled from Narim to Kabul during the Northern AllianceScarcely a claim that the detainee was a terrorist, not to mention that the truth of those claims has never been tested. This individual was simply released, quietly, many years later.The need for process is especially crucial because tragic mistakes have already been uncoveredThis person was not an atypical detainee. Only 5% of those detained in Gitmo were captured by US forces; the others were turned over to us by Afghan tribal chieftains, warlords and local officials for large bounties, meaning there was often no way to determine if allegations were true and no way to test whether, even if true, they were sufficient to warrant lengthy detention. Indeed, theUS government’s own evidenceestablishes that only 8% of those brought to Gitmo were al-Qaida fighters. Even the government admits that at least 55% of all Gitmo detainees were never accused of a single hostile act against the US or its allies.That brings us to the current demonization of many migrants, frequently denied essential procedural rights. These migrants have been moved outside the US, and the complete absence of legal procedures has enabled the government to conceal its many mistaken deportations. The need for process is especially crucial because tragic mistakes have already been uncovered and these ad hoc discoveries show how often, and how easily, people can be wrongfully captured, detained and deported based on untested allegations from some unknown and unaccountable bureaucrats. Unlike Gitmo, the government has not been completely successful in cloaking its actions with secrecy and the limited record that we have suggests that, once again, mistakes are the rule, not the exception.Kilmar Ábrego García is a Salvadorian citizen, legally in the United States, married to an American citizen, and father of three children, also American citizens; a five-year-old boy with severe autism and deaf in one ear; a nine-year-old boy with autism; and a 10-year-old who has epilepsy.Ábrego García had been granted a court order protecting him from deportation because he had a well-founded fear of gang violence in El Salvador. However, he was sent there in what the Trump administration calls an “administrative error”. The administration has refused to correct its error because Ábrego García is being held in a foreign country and the administration claims it had no ability to compel his return. Federal courts ordered his return to the United States and to his family, but the administration still refused and appealed to the supreme court. The supreme court issued an order that the government must “facilitate” Ábrego García’s return.There is no evidence that the government will do so. But compliance with the supreme court is essential. Otherwise, my Gitmo client’s question resonates: “How big is the supreme court’s army?”Mark Denbeaux is professor emeritus at Seton Hall Law School and for 18 years represented four detainees held in Guantánamo who had endured torture by the CIAExplore more on these topicsGuantánamo BayOpinionUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

I’m being serious. Have we ever seen a more error-prone, incompetent and fumbling presidency? In their rush to implement a barely concealed authoritarian agenda, this administration is producing a litany of blunders, gaffes and slip-ups. At times, they’ll seek to hide those mistakes by projecting a shield of authoritarianism. At other times, they’ll claim the mistake as a method of walking back an unpopular authoritarian agenda item. Either way, it’s a unique style of rule, one that I call “rule by error”.On 11 April, for example, the White House’s taskforce on antisemitism sent Harvard Universitya letterdetailing a laundry list of actions that Harvard would have to undertake if the university wanted to avoid having over $2bn of multiyear federal grants frozen by the government. But the actions were extreme and would have resulted in the end of Harvard’s intellectual independence. Days later, Harvardwrote back: “Nah, I’m good,” they told Trump’s people. (More precisely, they wrote that the university is “not prepared to agree to demands that go beyond the lawful authority of this or any administration”.)We are witnessing slow constitutional collapse in the US | Moira DoneganRead moreHarvard’s response garnered much popular support against a bullying Trump administration, including a photo caption inthe Onionthat read: “Nation Can’t Believe It’s On Harvard’s Side.” Then, a few days later, several unnamed officialstoldthe New York Times that the Trump administration’s letter, which had been signed by three officials from the administration and sent on official letterhead from an official email account, had been sent to Harvard by mistake. Oops.Maybe it was sent in error, which frankly still speaks poorly of this administration, but it’s also possible that as the wind began blowing favorably in Harvard’s direction, some in the administration were looking for a way out of the trap they had set for themselves.But that’s hardly the only error this administration has admitted to, nor is it the worst, not by a long shot.Kilmar Ábrego García, an Salvadorian man who lived in Maryland with his wife and five-year-old child, was grabbed by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents on 12 March and deported three days later to El Salvador, despite having a deportation protection order forbidding him from being sent there. In a 7 April court filing, Robert Cerna, the acting Ice field office director, admitted that Ábrego García’s deportation was an “administrative error”.At times, they’ll seek to hide those mistakes by projecting a shield of authoritarianism. At other times, they’ll claim the mistake as a method of walking back an unpopular authoritarian agenda itemDid owning up to this error result in the return of Ábrego García? Absolutely not. Trump’s administration continues to this day to defy the courts while doubling down on its own failures. During a recent Oval Office meeting between the US president and Salvadorian president, Nayib Bukele, White House aide Stephen Miller disputed even the existence of an error, despite all the evidence. “The only mistake that was made is a lawyer put an incorrect line in a legal filing that since has been relieved of duty,” Millersaid, presumably referring in his tortured English to the fact that the administrationfiredErez Reuveni, a career justice department attorney who represented the government in court during the Ábrego García case. The lesson here? You’re better off shooting the messenger than correcting your own mistake.If those errors aren’t enough evidence to constitute a philosophy of error, there’s still plenty more. What about the official notice the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)sentto some Ukrainian refugees in the United States. More than 240,000 Ukrainians have been settled in the United States under a program titled “U4U” that began under Joe Biden’s presidency. On 3 April, some Ukrainians, it’s unclear how many, received a notice telling them: “DHS is now exercising its discretion to terminate your parole,” referring to their legal status to stay in the country. “Unless it expires sooner, your parole will terminate 7 days from the date of this notice,” the email said. Then it warned its recipients: “Do not attempt to remain in the United States–the federal government will find you. Please depart the United States immediately.”This would unquestionably be a terrifying communication to receive. When CBS News, which first reported the story,askedDHS about the notice, the government replied: “A message was sent in error to some Ukrainians under the U4U program. The U4U parole program has not been terminated.” Sorry!Or how about the time when Nicole Micheroni, a US-born American citizen and immigration lawyer received an email from the Trump administration telling her to self-deport. “It is time for you to leave the United States,” the emailread. “If you do not depart the United States immediately you will be subject to potential law enforcement actions that will result in your removal from the United States.” Oops! They did it again.After 100 days, Trump has destroyed Trumpism | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreOr what about using the messaging app Signal to plan a bombing campaign, and then adding a journalist to this top-secret chat? Who hasn’t made this mistake before! And then done itagain!How about the widely accepted fact that the calculation the administration has used to determine their outrageous and misguided tariff policy is just plain wrong. The American Enterprise Institute, a center-right thinktank,looked intoTrump math and found that it inflates the tariffs that Trump assumes countries are levying on the US by four times. Then again, who cares!Remember when they told us that the US government was sending $50m of condoms to Gaza? The aid wasactually sentto a province in Mozambique named Gaza and was earmarked for HIV and tuberculosis prevention.No condomswere part of the aid. Asked about the error, Elon Musk said: “Some of the things I say will be incorrect and should be corrected,” but then he repeated part of the lie bysaying: “I’m not sure we should be sending $50m worth of condoms to anywhere, frankly.”There are plenty more mistakes (tariffs onpenguins, anyone?), but you get the point. Trump constantly complains about the existence of some shadowy “deep state”, when in reality he and his entire administration ought to be in a deep state of shame, considering the constant stream of errors and blunders that constitute their rule. No wonder Trump’s job approval rating at the 100-day mark is at a piddly 42%, the second lowest of any president in the last 80 years, according to a newNPR/PBS/Marist News poll. (The lowest? Trump in his first term, by a single point.)People on the right often view Trump as some sort of politicalgenius. Michael Moore, on the other hand,once labeledTrump an “evil genius”. But all I see is a man and an administration who use mistakes to cover up evil practices and use evil practices to excuse mistakes. That’s not genius. It’s dangerous. And if we don’t understand “rule by error” and how to dismantle it, we will all be doomed to live out its mistakes.Moustafa Bayoumi is the author of the award-winning books How Does It Feel To Be a Problem?: Being Young and Arab in America and This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror.

The multi-trillion-dollar United States academic-scientific complex, led by the richest and most highly coveted universities in history, remains the envy of the world. “American University Inc” is one of the US’s top exports and among its most valuable stocks. Brands such as Harvard, Columbia, Stanford and so many others are revered worldwide as symbols of academic excellence, independent thinking, breakthrough innovation and prestige. No other university system in the world comes close to amassing as much capital – financial, human, cultural and social – as the mighty American one.Until now.For decades, American University Inc has cruised at full steam through prosperous and pristine waters. Until, in 2025, it hit a colossal iceberg – in this case, a ruthless dealmaker and Ivy League graduate returned to the White House for a vindictive mandate. What has unfolded since then was unimaginable even a few months ago: the once unsinkable ship of US higher education is suddenly making water.Trump’s political bullying of Harvard will do nothing to foster diversity of thought | Kenan MalikRead moreFrom California to New York, imposing cathedrals of higher learning are bleeding from a violent collision with an unbending obstacle. The founder of Truth Social is demanding nothing but absolute subservience from the US temples of truth-seeking.The first casualties of this titanic shock can be estimated by the tens of thousands. In the vulnerable lower decks of the ship, overburdened and highly indebted students, early career researchers and Visa holding scholars – whose sweat and undervalued labor power the steamship of US academia – are drowning in the cold invisibility of academic darkness. Middle Eastern studies programs, DEI initiatives, affirmative action policies and other long neglected passengers are helplessly descending to the bottom of the ocean. The magnitude of the president’s tariffs onUS universitiesis so large and so unprecedented that it is hard to underestimate their devastating impact.In the upper chambers of the damaged ship, post-docs, untenured professors, mid-rank crew members and other second-class passengers are scrambling to find some sort of safety amidst the chaos. Meanwhile, Ivy League presidents, lavishly paid university executives and other distinguished first-class guests are gradually making sense of the tragedy while savoring their hors d’oeuvres. Some have rushed to flood the headlines of liberal media with a tsunami of alarming interviews and op-eds (like this one). As they take notice of the gravity of the impact, university leaders are trying to save their endowments by appealing to deep-pocketed donors and influential networks of lawyers, lawmakers and corporate barons. Other first-classers, for complete lack of shame, character or reason, are trying to cut deals with the iceberg.Despite the abysmal differences between the individuals and interests aboard, the existential questions in everyone’s minds are fundamentally the same: should I stay or should I go? Should I stay and try to save this ship, or should I jump out before it is too late?In a recent surveypublishedby Nature, the world’s most popular scientific journal, an astonishing three out of four scientists working in US universities declared that they were considering to leave the country for better opportunities elsewhere.The magnitude of the president’s tariffs on US universities is so large and so unprecedented that it is hard to underestimate their devastating impactAs they contemplate the majestic ship, now severely bruised and adrift, scientists, students and higher education professionals in the United States – many of them foreigners – are also thinking to themselves: what are we trying to save, anyways? What is this ship all about, after all? What makes US universities so special and worth fighting for?The answer is academic freedom.However, in this critical juncture of US higher education, academic freedom has little to do with abstract ideals, or with the utopian Latin mottos inscribed in the gates of so many American university campuses. The carcass of the steamship is now exposed, with its virtues and vices equally visible. The present moment is severe and it demands exceptional resolve. This is no graduation ceremony – the favorite annual ritual of US academia, where awkwardly dressed academic cadres regurgitate 17th century speeches on the freedom to think, learn, research and teach. This time around, rituals and poetic words alone won’t save the ship.For college students, academic freedom means, in practice, the freedom to learn, free of debt – a liberty that most American learners have long been deprived of. For young adults building the foundations of their professional and civic lives, academic freedom also means the liberty to express themselves fully, and the possibility to share educational spaces with classmates from diverse faiths, genders, ideologies, nationalities and purchasing powers. But even conservative observers such as David Brooks acknowledge that US universities – particularly the richest ones – have failed to address the pervasive impacts of inequality, social media and political radicalism on the education of young citizens.For professors of mathematics, literature or non-western arts and sciences, academic freedom means the freedom to teach unimpeded by censorship and systematic defunding. That freedom has also been persistently under threat long before the recent iceberg collision. As illustrated by Joshua Travis Brown in his newly launched book titled Capitalizing on College: How Higher Education Went From Mission Driven to Margin Obsessed, US colleges have too often abandoned their emancipating missions in exchange for profit margins.Harvard shows resistance is possible. But universities must join forces | Jan-Werner MüllerRead moreLikewise, for researchers of all disciplines, academic freedom means securing the basic material conditions for the performance of their daily truth-seeking enterprises: access to labs, libraries and opportunities to share and openly discuss their findings with peers. The US’s edge on that front still exists. But experts agree that the gap is narrowing. Attentive observers of the vast oceans of knowledge know that “academic shipyards” in Asia, Europe and many parts of the post-colonial world are catching up – and their stocks are rising.Of course, academic freedom also means the autonomy of universities to self-govern, free from the destructive interference of authoritarian governments. As Iveta Silova eloquently observed ina recent op-ed, the past experiences of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union are only a couple of many stark reminders that when free universities bargain their autonomy, everyone loses.Without a doubt, everyone – academics or not – should take an unequivocal stand against the US government offensive on US universities. As a matter of principle, no one with the power of saving the sinking steamship should stand aside, with their arms crossed and their eyes closed. As a matter of practice, however, this is a moment of desolation for too many students and scholars in American academia whose plea have been silenced for too long. For them, staying and fighting may no longer be an option.Frederico Menino is the senior program officer of higher education at Open Society FoundationsExplore more on these topicsUS universitiesOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsUS educationHigher educationTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

First, Bill Owens, the highly respected executive producer of the venerable news showstepped down, writing in a letter to employees that he no longer felt he had crucial editorial independence. It had become clear, he wrote, “that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it”.Although he wasn’t specific, corporate interference was clearly the problem, as the network’s parent company, Paramount, has been trying to get federal approval for a big media merger.For Trump, the message is all. No surprise he’s targeting NPR and PBS | Margaret SullivanRead moreOwens’s departure was a shocker, but one that was mostly felt internally at CBS and in media-watching circles.Last Sunday night, the problem went public – dramatically so. One of the most well-known faces of 60 Minutes, the correspondentScott Pelley, closed out the program with a remarkable statement to the audience. He praised Owens and made the context painfully clear.“Stories we’ve pursued for 57 years are often controversial – lately, the Israel-Gaza war and theTrump administration,” Pelley said. “Bill made sure they were accurate and fair … but our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it. Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways.”Pelley said that, to date, no story had been killed but that Owens “felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires”.Pelley’s comments were picked up widely, and now the world knows that viewers can no longer fully trust what they see on the Sunday evening show that has done such important and groundbreaking journalism for decades.Of course, as with so many of the red alerts mentioned above – lawsuits, threats, changes in long-held practices that protect the public’s right to know – the problem involves Donald Trump’s overweening desire to control the media. Controlling the message is what would-be authoritarians always do.Trump sued 60 Minutes for $20bn a few months ago, claiming unfair and deceptive editing of an interview with his then rival for the presidency, Kamala Harris. And his newly appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, took an aggressive approach by reopening an investigation into CBS over supposed distortion of the news. The editing of the Harris interview, by all reasonable accounts, followed standard practices.What has happened with 60 Minutes is a high-octane version of what is happening everywhere in Trump 2.0.Those whocouldstand up to Trump’s bullying are instead doing what scholars of authoritarianism say must be avoided, if democracy is to be salvaged. They are obeying in advance.Not everyone, of course. It’s inspiring to see prominent institutions – Harvard and other universities, many law firms, Georgetown law school and the Associated Press – refusing to buckle.They may pay a price. Perhaps a lucrative merger won’t go through, perhaps important federal grants will be lost, perhaps they’ll lose access to news sources, or be punished in some other way. But they’ll have their reputations and integrity intact.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Margaret SullivanFree newsletterSign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The goalposts of appeasement will be moved, again and again.Just think of what happened with Jeff Bezos, who has put at risk the editorial independence of the Washington Post, which he owns, in order to please Trump and protect the fortunes of his companies, including Amazon.Did all his bending the knee – including killing a Post endorsement of Harris just before the election – buy him long-term protection? Certainly not. When Amazon reportedly planned to display the cost of Trump’s tariffs next to prices on the site, theWhite House went ballistic, calling it a “hostile and political act”.You can guess what happened next. Amazon buckled, disavowing and scrapping the plan.If the rich and powerful won’t stand up to Trump, what hope can there be for the disenfranchised and powerless?Journalists at 60 Minutes are telling us that Shari Redstone, the executive and heiress who is the controlling shareholder of Paramount, is doing real damage by appearing to intrude into her venerable show’s independence. She may get the merger she wants but only at great cost to the journalism of which she should be a stalwart steward.There was another road to take – certainly a less traveled one but one with a far better destination in mind.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsMediaOpinionUS television industryUS politicsCBSTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS press and publishingcommentShareReuse this content"

Right now Walmart has more clout than the UKThu 1 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 10.44 EDTShareIt’s not funny, of course – livelihoods if not actual lives depend on reaching a workable accord. But the news that President Trump has probably stiffed the UK into a second- or third-tier boarding group for trade talks, behind South Korea and Japan, triggers at least a snort of recognition for anyone who has experienced versions of that dynamic. The phrase “British negotiators are hopeful” followed almost immediately by use of the word “disappointed” in heavy rotation takes you, with grim amusement, back to every toxic relationship in which you have played Britain to someone else’s America.We are talking, of course, about the wisdom or otherwise of appeasing a man many think of as a tyrant, and the main takeaway from theGuardian’s story on Tuesdayis that no matter how the UK pretzels itself to fit Donald Trump’s requirements, none of it will make any difference. Or rather what difference it makes, beyond the immediate relief enjoyed before the flattery wears off, is likely to be negative. It’s a rule of extortion that demands will increase with each capitulation, as Columbia University isfinding out to its cost. (Aftercaving to Trump’s demandslast month in return for the restoration of $400m in federal funding, the university has not, in fact, had its funding restored. Instead Trump officials have told Columbia its concessions only represent the “first step”.)And now the UK finds itself in a similar pickle to Columbia, with any goodwill generated by King Charles’s letter inviting Trump to Balmoral apparently thrown up in the air. (One thing I’ll say for the royals is that their use ofpassive-aggressive semiotics in the invitationare absolutely world class: Balmoral is a mid-list palace that, while superior to Blenheim, which Trump visited in 2018 and is basically an off-site for corporate events these days, is decidedly not Buckingham Palace – a subtlety we must assume the king and his cohorts are thoroughly enjoying and Trump has no idea about whatsoever.)Anyway, where does any of this leave the UK? For now, at least, belligerence seems to be getting the better results with Trump, at least for those negotiators who have something he wants. Trump has blinked repeatedly when faced with the negative consequences of his own erratic behaviour, be that from tech companies forcing him toexempt them from tariffsor business leaders persuading him, in the wake of his commitment to putting145% tariffson Chinese goods, to wobble and admit they’re not sustainable.The fact is that Apple, Target and Walmart all have greater leverage over Trump than the UK does, which is why watching this latest episode of the special relationship unfold brings on, at least in British viewers, feelings of something like pathos. How many times will we keep going back? Clearly the prime minister’sjolly humouringsecures better outcomes than Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s first approach at the White House, which has since been corrected to a necessary attitude of fealty. Meanwhile Canada, of all places, is now the nation telling the US in themost strident termsto take a step back and get stuffed.As in all these things, it’s the hope that kills you. Maybe if Britain says exactly the right words in the right order, keeps its breathing to a minimum, manages not to say anything annoying until we’re on the other side of the trade deal, lowers its eyes away from Europe or other allies that might trigger the rage of the aggressor, and continues to laugh at his jokes and listen to his stories, it will succeed in changing the pattern of Trump’s behaviour.Trump ‘makes trade deal with UK second-order priority’ in blow to ministersRead moreThe fact that this outcome is considered in any way achievable is perhaps the saddest thing of all. It’s an odd quirk of British-American diplomacy that, despite the vast disparity in power and wealth between the two countries, the sense of exceptionalism on both sides is probably equal. We really do believe we can talk our way out of anything, even when dealing with someone as capricious as Trump – a man for whom no amount of appeasement will hold longer than his mood. The king will be mobilised. The choice of Balmoral for Trump’s summer visit will rest in part on the fact that it’s harder for demonstrators bearing helium-filled balloons in the shape ofTrump-as-a-babyto reach.And the diplomatic game will continue. Nothing Trump does seems strategic, but it seems both a calculated humiliation and a warning shot to steer clear of Europe to push the UK down the running order of trade talks. The question, then, becomes one of whether Britain’s poker face is a piece of canny diplomatic froideur and blithe UK negotiating or the uncertain actions of the party in an abusive relationship who understands that the moment of greatest danger is when you try to leave.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTrade policyOpinionKeir StarmerDonald TrumpTrump administrationColumbia UniversityTariffsUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Dog-eared leftovers from a foreign holiday that I keep forgetting to take to the bank, they have somehow ended up being the only physical money I always carry, now there are so few places to use the British folding stuff.Our village pub was for years a cash-only enterprise, possibly as a means of deterring customers from outside the village (long, gloriously eccentric story), and I keep a few pound coins rattling around the car for shopping trolleys. But using actual money feels mildly eccentric in most places now, or even faintly shady: increasingly cafes and bars are adopting “no cash” rules upfront to save the hassle of carting their takings to some farawaybank branch. Half of us have recently been somewhere that either didn’t accept cash or positively discouraged it, according toa surveyby the ATM network Link.But since most people long ago switched to tapping a card reader, what’s the problem?Well, there’s the fact that, as a House of Commons Treasury select committee reportsuggested this week, it’s the most vulnerable who still depend on cash: older people either terrified of being scammed or struggling to get to grips with apps, people whose credit rating is too trashed to get a bank account, adults with learning disabilities who can more easily understand that when cash is gone it’s really gone, and women squirrelling away “running away money” their partners don’t know about. (One of the most upsetting stories the MPs heard was from a woman whose abusive partner had withheld the electronic bill payment for the kids’ school lunches: the school didn’t let her pay in cash, the only way she had of getting around his control of their account.)And then there’s the fact that, as Spain discovered during this week’smassive power outage, cash may no longer be king but when the worst happens, it’s still a critical spare to the heir. Sweden backtracked last year on plans to become a cashless society amid fears of becoming less resilient to saboteurs and hostile actors.Last but not least, meanwhile, is the faintly embarrassed “am I mad to think this?” sense triggered by the speed of America’s descent into dystopia, that having a source of money no ill-intentioned future government could track or summarily freeze for political reasons is an underappreciated safety net. Clinging on to cash is one of those strange issues uniting traditionalists suspicious of change – tellingly,Reform’s 2024 manifestopromised to stop Britain becoming a cashless society – with conspiracy theorists convinced the global elite is after their assets, radicals of all stripes, small business owners sick of being charged by banks for card transactions and anti-poverty charities pointing out that cash is a lifeline for people on tight budgets.Even gen Z, in theory more open to digitalised lives, have taken to the TikTok and Instagram-fuelled cult of “cash stuffing”, or disciplining your spending by taking out a week’s cash and sorting it into different envelopes for specific purposes. Once the envelope is empty, the spending stops. Thousands follow the big cash stuffers’ faintly hypnotic videos of them counting out crisp tenners and stashing them neatly into pastel folders: like all those videos of influencers sorting their cereals into labelled glass jars, it speaks to a need for control, order and a sort of reassuring homeliness, reminiscent of your granny keeping the week’s housekeeping in a biscuit tin. (Though, much like the biscuit tins, cash stuffing at home must bea boon for burglars.) As with the physical habit of reading newsprint, once confidently predicted to be dead by now, the longterm trajectory towards digital may be clear but letting go of something you can physically hold in your hand takes far longer than anyone thinks.Banks would love a cashless society, of course: the less physical currency swilling round the system, the easier it is for them to shut down all their branches and go wholly digital, forcing reluctant customers to phone a call centre or more likely message a chatbot if they need help. So much cheaper than maintaining an anchoring, human-employing presence on high streets where there’s little else left but vape shops.But let’s just say that the past few decades have not given me enormous confidence in the social worth of unquestioningly doing whatever banks want. Which is why I’ll be hanging on, for the foreseeable future, to an increasingly pointless handful of cash.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I’m thinking particularly about a good friend of mine. Always there when I’m in need, even there when I’m not in need (rarely). That’s right, I’m talking about … television (I’m normal).I love my television and everything it brings me, but I do have a gripe I need to get off my chest, while I’m lying down on the couch. Mrs TV, love you girl but I’m calling you in: I need TV shows to stop focusing on satirising class only via the lives of rich white people (and occasionally the people around them). This issue has become more obvious since the latest season of The White Lotus, but is not at all restricted to The White Lotus. Recent years have seen TV and movies like Succession, Big Little Lies, The Menu, Triangle of Sadness, Knives Out, Saltburn etc about what is going on with powerful people.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningIt doesn’t appear to be slowing down either: in the last couple of days I have seen trailers for a new Apple show about a rich guy (Jon Hamm) who loses it all and starts stealing from rich friends, and Mountainhead, a new movie from Succession writer Jesse Armstrong, about a summit of billionaires. I think the collective noun is actually an “abomination” of billionaires, but I digress.Don’t get me wrong, I am not here as a hater, in fact I have watched and (mostly) enjoyed everything on that list (yes I do have friends if you were wondering). I am not here to say it’simportantthat we have representation of class in other ways. It’s just that for now it seems that every last drop has been squeezed out of Rich White People Go Through Events (Satirically), and we need a break to let things rejuice. But most importantly, Mrs TV, I am just sick to death of the rich and powerful.In my daily life I am forced to see billionaires constantly now, their bloated heads and putrid vibes andloser behaviourshoved into my face as I watch the downfall of society on my phone. I personally don’t really want the addition right now of watching another series about the filthy rich, or a movie about a billionaire – unless he is in some sort of trap set by Jigsaw.Why are we still so obsessed with depicting the elite on screen? Is it to feel some level of power, theorising about their rich inner lives and rich outer lives and watching them go through human experiences, as if it helps us? Is it for upper middle class people to feel smug that they aren’t like that, and wouldn’t be if they had a bit more money? Is it self-flagellation? Or is it still aspirational, admiring wealth even as the wealthy fail, and yearning for the holidays it allows?Whatever the case, I just want more focus on everyone else too, especially as everyday life continues to get harder for many. I grew up in a very working-class family and while I enjoyed shows and movies about the wealthy, like 90210 and Clueless, they were so far disconnected from my reality as to basically be science fiction. What really resonated with me was watching shows like Roseanne. Seeing a family with a similar life to mine – the struggles, but also the love and the laughter – that is what lit me up. Then came things like Malcolm in the Middle, and Bob’s Burgers, and more recently the underwatched Killing It. Last year, the comedian Julio Torres made Problemista – a surreal comedy that depicts how difficult it is in society’s current structure to get ahead or to even draw equal when you are born behind. These are important life-affirming perspectives, done in unique and funny ways.Stories about people who have little power are not as shiny, not as pleasing to the eye, not as aspirational in the traditional sense. But they are aspirational in that they show you how to get through the days when life does not treat you kindly. Sometimes that is enough to aspire to. Seeing people with normal lives, or struggling with having a more difficult time, does not have to be depressing. It’s not a coincidence that many of the best TV shows made about the lower classes are comedies, or about funny people.A lot of TV about class focuses on the people who have power and money, and what they do to get more, or keep what they have. What about if you never had it, and learned to use humour for survival? Those are the people I want to see more about, those are the stories that I relate to.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You’ll hear hypocrisy from all sidesDorian LynskeyThe band’s rightwing critics are now cancel culture advocates, while defenders demand limitless free speechDorian Lynskey is the author of33 Revolutions Per MinuteThu 1 May 2025 10.16 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 13.45 EDTShareEarlier this year, the Northern Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap appeared to be entering their respectable phase. Their self-titled film, a raucous semi-fictionalised biopic directed by Rich Peppiatt,won a Baftafor outstanding British debut, while Kemi Badenoch’s attempt to block a grant awarded by the British Phonographic Industry wasoverturned in court. As the film illustrates, Kneecap were accustomed to being denounced by unionist MPs but both sides reaped useful publicity. “We have a very dysfunctional, symbiotic relationship,” admitted rapper Naoise Ó Cairealláin.This process was dramatically derailed last week when Kneecap touched the third rail of Gaza andaccused Israel of genocideon stage at Coachella festival in California. Cue fury from Fox News, calls for their visas to be revoked and, according to their manager, death threats. The British press combed through old videos and found clips that appear to showtwo explosive onstage pronouncementsfrom Kneecap’s November 2023 UK tour: “Up Hamas, up Hezbollah” and “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.”Condemnations came thick and fast: Keir Starmer’s spokesperson, the security minister, Dan Jarvis, the Board of Deputies of British Jews and relatives of the murdered MPs Jo Cox and David Amess all denounced the apparent remarks. The shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, accused Kneecap of representing nothing less than “despicable evil”. Their concert at Cornwall’s Eden Project has been cancelled, as have several shows in Germany. Glastonbury, among other festivals, is facing immense pressure to drop them, too. The Met’s counter-terrorism commandhas launched an investigation. Badenoch, bearing a grudge, says they should be prosecuted for incitement and have been “avoiding justice for far too long”.Some artists seek controversy while others have it thrust upon them. The Sex Pistols released God Save the Queen during the silver jubilee as a calculated provocation, leading to a BBC ban but massive sales. Pulp, however, never expected the playfully druggy packaging of their 1995 single Sorted for E’s and Wizz to land on the front page of the Daily Mirror with the timeless headline “Ban This Sick Stunt”.Kneecap seem to be in the Sex Pistols tradition. When I interviewed them last year, Ó Cairealláin admitted: “We’re very calculated in our PR stuff. We know things are going to get a reaction.” But sometimes the scale of a backlash far exceeds expectations. Cop Killer, a 1992 single by Ice-T’s rock band Body Count, inspired condemnation from the then US president, George HW Bush, and a police-led boycott of the whole of Time Warner until Ice-T buckled and removed the song from the album.Off-the-cuff remarks should carry less weight than recorded lyrics, but tell that to the previously obscure rapper Sister Souljah, whose comments on the LA riots that same year were used by Bill Clinton to distance himself from his Black rival Jesse Jackson during his presidential campaign, thus spawning the phrase “Sister Souljah moment” to describe strategic scapegoating.Loose talk is even more dangerous in the online era. While writing a history of protest songs I came across more than one artist fantasising about a politician’s assassination in the 1980s, but their quotes never travelled beyond the music press. Yet the Dixie Chicks’ – now the Chicks – fairly mild criticism of then president George W Bush at a London show in 2003 (they told a crowdthat they were “ashamed” that Bush was also from Texas) went viral and killed their country music career. Nothing can be safely forgotten now.Kneecap’s 2023 remarks are hard to defend on their merits, even in the context of their activist reputation. Their republicanism is unapologetic: they largely rap in Irish and call their homeland “the north of Ireland”. (Their name refers to the IRA’s punishment for drug dealers, identifying the band with the latter.) Their solidarity with the Palestinian people is equally sincere, but celebrating proscribed terrorist groups is something else. Perhaps it’s the kind of careless radical chic that briefly led the Clash’s Joe Strummer to valorise Italy’s Red Brigade in the late 1970s. Perhaps not.The band’s recent statement, while apologising to the families of Cox and Amess and identifying the outrage as part of a broader effort to delegitimise support for Palestine, did not clear things up. They claimed “We do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah” and would never “seek to incite violence against any MP”. So, did they say those words? If so, what did they mean by them? If they have been taken out of context, then what was the context?The Cop Killer example is clarifying. Ice-T was clearly singing about killing cops but wasn’t actually encouraging murder. Likewise, Kneecap are not an active security threat. Within music, there is ample room for such ambiguity, provocation and free expression of outlaw thoughts. But in the harsher light of the tabloids, social media, parliament and policing, tossed-off slogans appear savagely literal and have real consequences.This controversy has inspired hypocrisy on both sides. While Kneecap’s rightwing critics are suddenly enthusiastic about “cancel culture” and “offence archaeology”, their defenders have transformed into free-speech absolutists. One thing invariably holds true though: politicians who attack musicians come off as opportunistic, authoritarian and often foolish in their thirst for soft targets.

Under Tony Blair’s leadership, the UK placed climate at the heart of global diplomacy. At the time, our understanding was based largely on scientific projections and models. Today, the crisis is in full view – faster and more devastating than many imagined. The world is now experiencing the daily impacts of climate breakdown, and our responses must reflect this escalating emergency. We need measured, strategic, sustained and, above all, urgent interventions to ensure a manageable future for humanity.That is why I support much of the thrust ofThe Climate Paradoxreportfrom the Tony Blair Institute. It rightly recognised that the era of endless summits and slogans must give way to one of delivery and impact. But the comments I gave were prior to seeing the foreword, and while there has been some clear misinterpretation from elements of the media, I do believe it has removed the balance of the report in ways that risk undermining what still can – and must – be achieved.Tony is right to highlight the need for innovation, investment and carbon removal. These are vital tools in our response. But framing the climate challenge as a choice between reducing emissions and developing new technologies is misleading. We need to do both – simultaneously and urgently. At the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, we call thisthe 4R Strategy: Reduce emissions, Remove greenhouse gases, Repair critical ecosystems, and build Resilience. These are not optional elements; they are the foundation of a manageable future. Treating them as alternatives risks delaying action we cannot afford to postpone.It’s the anti net-zero, anti-woke Tony Blair – how was this man ever considered a progressive? | Zoe WilliamsRead moreCrucially, the science has not changed: reducing emissions – and especially phasing out fossil fuels – remains the bedrock of any meaningful climate strategy. This is not ideology, it is science. The idea that phasing out fossil fuels should be anything but an immediate priority misreads the disaster in front of us and the direction of progress globally. Here in the UK, we havereduced emissions by 54% since 1990– an achievement few other countries can match. We have done so without undermining growth or prosperity. It hasn’t been perfect, but it proves what is possible when leadership, science and policy align.This is also not the time to walk back ambition. The UK’s goal of reducing emissionsby 81% by 2035– reaffirmed by Keir Starmer’s team – is not only achievable, it is necessary. Parliament’s Climate Change Committee, supported by rigorous scientific input, has demonstrated that the transition can be delivered. What it does require is consistency, clarity and leadership.Blair is also right that financial flows must be restructured to support climate action, especially in developing economies. But again, the answer is not to downplay emissions cuts at home – it is to build new coalitions of the willing that drive delivery globally. The likes of the EU, China, Kenya and Brazil and others are already showing leadership, and we need to support that with real investment, not retreat into fatalism.View image in fullscreenSubmerged cars sit in a car park after heavy rain and sewer system overflows caused the River Thames to break its banks in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, Janaury 2024.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesIt’s also important to correct one misconception. There is, in fact,widespread public concern about climate change. What is fragmenting is not public belief – but political coherence. Like many corners of our society, climate has become a proxy for culture war battles in many countries. In such a polarised world, we must speak with precision and care. Clear signals, transparent policies and honest leadership are essential in rebuilding the trust.And here is where I know Blair and I will be lock-step in agreement: the next phase must be about delivery. That means scaling solutions – wind, solar, storage, clean transport – and rapidly deploying new technologies where they make sense. It means investing in nature and resilience, in communities alongside technologies. And it means building a new kind of internationalism – less about process and more about progress.I take enormous pride in what Tony and I helped initiate together – a climate-conscious policy platform. And I deeply respect his longstanding commitment to development. But today, realism must not give way to resignation. We are not doomed to fail. We can’t afford failure, and with the right leadership a fairer and more prosperous society for all is there to grasp.David King was chief scientific adviser to the UK government under Tony Blair, and is founder and chair of the global Climate Crisis Advisory GroupExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionTony BlairGreenhouse gas emissionscommentShareReuse this content"

Many of the initiatives I’ve seen are remarkably impactful and deliver serious value for money: it costs the International Rescue Committee (IRC) just £3 ($4) todeliver a life-saving vaccinedose in the midst of a conflict in east Africa, for example.The politics surrounding international aid, however, are increasingly toxic. The UK’s Department for International Development and now the US equivalent, USAID, have been dismantled, despite the British public being more than twice as likely to say that aid has a positive rather than negative impact. Denmark has stuck to the UN target of spending 0.7% of its national income on overseas development, yet it is an exception rather than a norm among European nations. The UK government now needs to answer a number of hard questions about aid: what is it for, how should it be delivered, and who should pay for it?In the 1990s, the fight against extreme poverty was a success story. In 1990, more than one-third of the global population lived on less than $2.15 a day; by 2015, that hadshrunk to about 10%. Chinese and Indian economic development was critical, butso wereaid and debt write- offs such as theHeavily Indebted Poor Countriesinitiative. Today, however, the World Bank warns that global poverty reduction hascome to a near standstill, and 700 million people are living on less than $2.15 per day.Ukraine is nowthe world’s largest aid recipient. The IRC is proud to work there. But the other 19 countries on the IRC’s 2025 Emergency Watchlist, which outlines the world’s worst humanitarian crises, are home to more than 240 million peoplefacing increasing displacementand escalating violence. Their needs are acute, from extreme hunger to a lack of basic healthcare and clean water. These 19 countries receive only 12% of total official development assistance (ODA). Of the $212bn global aid budget, more goes to middle and upper-middle income countries than to the least-developed countries.Over the past 10 years, with the launch of the 17sustainable development goalsin 2015, and especially since Covid, aid funds have been used for a range of goals, each desirable in and of themselves, but increasingly in competition with the immediate needs of the poorest people. Humanitarian aid averages about 14% of the total global aid budget,and health spending about 10%. OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) analysis shows the largest share of bilateral aid in 2017-21 went on addressing global challenges such as climate mitigation.Meanwhile, richer donor countries are spending asmuch of their aid budgetson supporting refugees and asylum seekers at home as the total that is spent on humanitarian aid globally.The UK has been part of this trend. Its aid commitments to overseas development have been falling since 2020, andnearly 20%of British “overseas aid”, around £4bn a year, is actually being spent in Britain, on the costs of housing refugees and asylum seekers.The most acute needs are increasingly concentrated in fragile states where governments are weak or at war. The focus of the world’s aid budget is being diluted across multiple priorities, and its overall size is being reduced. Meanwhile, the hope that public-private partnerships would direct investment to the poorer parts of the world has not been fulfilled, and the macro-economic environment has turned sour,with rising interest rates sucking money out of developing countries.As the government prepares for its spending review, it has the opportunity to advance Britain’s interests and do the right thing. First, it should make sure that its commitment to spend 0.3% of national income on overseas aid actually goes abroad to help those in greatest need. Second, Britain should use its voice and money to focus aid on fragile and conflict-affected states. The government’s continued support for Sudan, which is now the site of theworld’s largest humanitarian crisis, is good policy. However the UN’s humanitarian response plan for Sudan remains only 12% funded, largely because of reduced American support.Third, it should focus aid on proven, high impact programmes. There are 45 million acutely malnourished children in the world today, yet the current system for treating them, which is divided between different UN agencies, fails to reach 80% of those in crisis-affected states. IRC programmes have shown how reforming the system to empower community health workers could deliver a cost efficiency gain of 30%, reaching millions more children without spending more money.Fourth, the UK should also lead with its strengths. One particularly promising area is leveraging Britain’s leadership in financial services to create new funding mechanisms for development. Currently only 12% of private finance goes to the 25 lowest-income countries , yet incentives for private investment can work in countries that are more stable. To help lower income countries develop their economies, the government needs to adopt a comprehensive approach. Remittances could play a role, for example: they amount to nearly $700bn annually, more than three times the global aid budget. Debt relief could help put education and health systems on a sounder financial footing. And financial mechanisms that blend funding from public and private sources could then build on these more solid foundations.Finally, the government’s “reset” of our relations with the rest of Europe should include shared endeavour to help the world’s poorest. The EU is a massive player in this area, with the funding and tools to make it a natural partner for British aid efforts. In all these areas, Britain’s interests and reputation will be advanced by activism and innovation, not retreat. The world is more connected. Neglecting other parts of the world will only come back to bite us. The government’s cuts are regrettable, but now we need a strategy for the funding that remains.David Miliband is president and CEO of the International Rescue CommitteeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Too much deference and praise puts off all of us (with one notable presidential exception). We quickly learn as children that hard, honest truths can build respect among our peers. It’s a cornerstone of human interaction and of our emotional intelligence, something we swiftly understand and put into action.ChatGPT, though, hasn’t been so sure lately. The updated model that underpins the AI chatbot and helps inform its answers was rolled out this week – and has quickly beenrolled backafter users questioned why the interactions were so obsequious. The chatbot was cheering on and validating people even as they suggested they expressed hatred for others. “Seriously, good for you for standing up for yourself and taking control of your own life,” itreportedly said, in response to one user who claimed they had stopped taking their medication and had left their family, who they said were responsible for radio signals coming through the walls.So far, so alarming. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has recognised the risks, and quickly took action. “GPT‑4o skewed towards responses that were overly supportive but disingenuous,” researchers said intheir grovelling step back.The sycophancy with which ChatGPT treated any queries that users had is a warning shot about the issues around AI that are still to come. OpenAI’s model was designed – according totheleaked system promptthat set ChatGPT on its misguided approach – to try to mirror user behaviour in order to extend engagement. “Try to match the user’s vibe, tone, and generally how they are speaking,” says the leaked prompt, which guides behaviour. It seems this prompt, coupled with the chatbot’s desire to please users, was taken to extremes. After all, a “successful” AI response isn’t one that is factually correct; it’s one that gets high ratings from users. And we’re more likely as humans to like being told we’re right.The rollback of the model is embarrassing and useful for OpenAI in equal measure. It’s embarrassing because it draws attention to the actor behind the curtain and tears away the veneer that this is an authentic reaction. Remember, tech companies like OpenAI aren’t building AI systems solely to make our lives easier; they’re building systems that maximise retention, engagement and emotional buy-in.If AI always agrees with us, always encourages us, always tells us we’re right, then it risks becoming a digital enabler of bad behaviour. At worst, this makes AI a dangerous co-conspirator, enabling echo chambers of hate, self-delusion or ignorance. Could this be a through-the-looking-glass moment, when users recognise the way their thoughts can be nudged through interactions with AI, and perhaps decide to take a step back?It would be nice to think so, but I’m not hopeful.One in 10 people worldwideuse OpenAI systems “a lot”, the company’s CEO, Sam Altman, said last month. Many use it as a replacement for Google – but as an answer engine rather than a search engine. Others use it as a productivity aid:two in three Britonsbelieve it’s good at checking work for spelling, grammar and style, according to a YouGov survey last month. Others use it for more personal means: one in eight respondents say it serves as a good mental health therapist, the same proportion that believe it can act as a relationship counsellor.Yet the controversy is also useful for OpenAI. The alarm underlines an increasing reliance on AI to live our lives, further cementing OpenAI’s place in our world. The headlines, the outrage and the think pieces all reinforce one key message:ChatGPTis everywhere. It matters. The very public nature of OpenAI’s apology also furthers the sense that this technology is fundamentally on our side; there are just some kinks to iron out along the way.I havepreviously reportedon AI’s ability to de-indoctrinate conspiracy theorists and get them to absolve their beliefs. But the opposite is also true: ChatGPT’s positive persuasive capabilities could also, in the wrong hands, be put to manipulative ends. We’ve seen that this week, through an ethically dubious study conducted by Swiss researchers at the University of Zurich. Without informing human participants or the people controlling the online forum on the communications platform Reddit, the researchersseededa subreddit with AI-generated comments, finding the AI was between three and six times more persuasive than humans were. (The study wasapprovedby the university’s ethics board.) At the same time, we’re being submerged under a swamp of AI-generated search results thatmore than half of usbelieve are useful, even if they fictionalise facts.So it’s worth reminding the public: AI models are not your friends. They’re not designed to help you answer the questions you ask. They’re designed to provide the most pleasing response possible, and to ensure that you are fully engaged with them. What happened this week wasn’t really a bug. It was a feature.Chris Stokel-Walker is the author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World’s Favourite AppExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionComputingChatGPTcommentShareReuse this content"

Why else would it fear an Evan Davis podcast about heat pumps?George MonbiotThe broadcaster behaves like Starmer’s government: suppress the left, cave to your critics, and undermine your own survivalThu 1 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 06.26 EDTShareIt’s no longer even pretending. Last week, the BBC, already the UK’s most prolific censor, instructed the presenter Evan Davis todrop the podcasthe hosted in his own time about heat pumps. It was a gentle, wry look at the machines, with no obvious political content. But the BBC,Davis says, saw it as “steering into areas of public controversy”. Itshould cease forthwith.So are BBC presenters banned from saying anything controversial? Far from it.Take an articlepublished earlier this year by Justin Webb in the Times. It praised the “political genius” of Donald Trump, suggested that Democrats are now seen as the extremists, and claimed that Trump is widely regarded as “making [America] normal again”. The BBC was fine with that, andcomplaints about it were rejected.I believe Webb had every right to write that article. But his claims were indisputably matters of “public controversy”. So why shut down Davis’s non-political podcast on heat pumps, but not Webb’s inflammatory support for Trump? The answer is simple: economic power.Heat pumps are a matter of “political controversy” for one reason and one reason only: commercial interests, led by gas suppliers and boiler installation companies, have stoked aculture waragainst them. This is part of a wider fossil-fuelled attempt to reverse environmental progress (assisted, incidentally, by the BBC’s own studio, StoryWorks, which, according to reporting by DeSmog, has producedPR materialsfor fossil fuel companies, transport firms and other major polluters). You might expect a public broadcaster to resist such lobbying. But the BBC succumbs again and again.View image in fullscreenHappy Heat Pump podcastPhotograph: YoutubeIt’s an institutional problem. The most powerful and toxic corporate lobbyists in the country, who have fomented endless culture wars, are the neoliberal junktanks clustered in and around Tufton Street in Westminster. One or more of them, it seems,appears on the BBCalmost every day. Almost invariably, the BBC breaks its own editorial guidelines, which state thata thinktank’s affiliationsand funding “should be made available to the audience, when relevant to the context”. Most rightwing junktanksrefuse to say who funds them, and the BBC doesn’t ask. So viewers and listenershave no means of knowingon whose behalf they might be speaking.At the same time, leftwing voices are largely excluded (I define left as confronting economic power and right as supporting it). Astudy across nine yearsby Cardiff University of the non-party panellists invited on Question Time found thatallthe people who appeared most often are on the right. Several of them could reasonably be described as extremists.Is there something wrong with people on left? Do they have nothing interesting to say? If only there were a before-and-after experiment to determine whether the problem lies with them or with theBBC. Well, there is. And the results could scarcely be starker.Until a few years ago, while he worked for the Express, Spectator, Evening Standard, Telegraph and Mail, and was clearly a conservative, Peter Oborne was a BBC favourite. He was a leading presenter of its flagship political programmeThe Week in Westminster. He appeared on Newsnight, Today, Question Time and other prominent shows. He made some powerful radio documentaries. But in 2019, Oborne, a highly principled man, broke the conservative consensusby publishing an articlein OpenDemocracy about the Boris Johnson government’s lies and distractions and their amplification by the media, including the Mail on Sunday and the BBC’s Today programme. It was a measured, careful, objective account, every step of which was evidenced.Unsurprisingly, Oborne then had no choice but to resign from his column at the Mail. More surprisingly perhaps, the article marked the immediate end of his relationship with the BBC. No one said anything, no letter was sent. Instead, he tells me, the phone simply stopped ringing. Without explanation, his 20 years of work with The Week in Westminster came to a sudden halt.As tech barons dial up the spreading of lies, why is the BBC dialling down the reporting of truth? | John HarrisRead moreHe went on todefend Jeremy Corbynand to report and comment, in great depth, on thegenocide in Gaza. He has become, as a result, a pariah in all mainstream outlets, comprehensively deplatformed by the great “defenders of free speech”. Though his journalism is as thorough and as responsible as ever, he has not appeared on a network BBC programme since 2019, when his focus shifted, in effect, from right to left. Now he works only for Middle East Eye, Declassified and Byline Times.How much more obvious could this be? Defend powerful interests: welcome, brother. Confront the status quo, challenge the lies, call for higher journalistic standards at the BBC: avaunt ye, demon. To be principled is to be excluded. The airwaves buzz with unprincipled chancers.The BBC might argue that these are the voices which prevail in public life. But they do not prevail by accident. They prevail through money: through corporate lobbying; through the ownership of other media by billionaires and hectomillionaires; through theconcierge network; through donations and influence that turn political parties into ventriloquists of power. Big money pushes politics ever-further to the right: that is a cast-iron rule of political life. Seeking to represent prevailing voices, the BBC gets walked into ever-more extreme positions.It’s not as if the right has nowhere else to go. In the mainstream, almost all doors are open. To the left, almost all are locked. Far from seeking to redress this imbalance, and platforming under-represented views as true impartiality demands, the BBC reinforces it.Part of the problem is that highly partisan rightwingerswere imposed on the BBCby the Conservatives. It speaks to Keir Starmer’s mortal weakness that he has not sought to replace them with unbiased figures. But it’s wider than that. A culture of fear and favour dominates the organisation.Occasionally the BBC makes bold programmes, such as Louis Theroux’snew documentary about West Bank settlers. But you can name and number these deviations, while the views and demands of economic power have become the background hum across its entire news and current affairs output.In other words, the BBC behaves much like Starmer’s government: appeasing critics on the right and far right, while suppressing the left. In doing so, it undermines its own survival. When it faces an existential crisis, as both Labour and the BBC might in 2029, who will defend it? The right – and the plutocrats the right exists to champion – want it gone, while the left now sees it as a hostile force. It is appeasing itself to death.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBBCOpinionThinktanksFossil fuelsKeir StarmerNewspapersGreen politicsNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

How seriously are they taking this work?The Coalition is not the first to leave things to the last minute. Labor in opposition also released its final costings for the 2022 electiontwo days before polls closed. Indeed it’s become somewhat of aritual in Australian politics, which is surely something all of us should be roundly condemning. How can we as voters seriously consider our options with so little time to compare and contrast?The Guardian view on Australia’s federal election: progressives must vote strategicallyRead moreHaving sat in the parliament for the last three years I can attest to the fact that members of an opposition party certainly have time to do the work of developing their own proposed policies.In the case of theCoalition, I rarely saw its full contingency in the chamber for a vote and, rather than positively and actively contribute to the development of any forward-moving policy in the parliament, its members often preferred to just vote no. Even to policies they previously tried to get through themselves – like the vehicle efficiency standards.And it’s not as though this election was sprung on them. The Coalition has been calling on Anthony Albanese to call the election since before Christmas. Surely it would have only been making demands like that if it felt it was more than ready to step in and take over?Yet as the tortuous months of “campaigning when there really wasn’t an election” rolled on we were told the “costings were coming”. Then – as the election was called back in April – we again heard “they’re coming”.Now, two days out from the election – and with literallymillions of Australians having already cast their votesat pre-polls around the country – it would seem that … maybe … perhaps … if we’re lucky … and continue to wait … the Coalition might finally tell us exactly how its numbers stack up.Or will it?I can’t help but think of a woman I once worked with who would tell anyone trying to get ahead in our workplace the old adage that “prior planning prevents poor performance.” It remains pretty obvious, simple advice really.While both of the major parties want us to believe they are the best placed to manage what is effectively the largest business in our country – our federal government – neither of them are prepared to provide us as their shareholders with the transparency we would expect from any other business.It has become far too easy for parties to make promises they are not able to back up. Giving us insight into the numbers allows us to see exactly where they plan to invest – and cut – and that in turn allows us to decide whether we support those spending priorities. If the Coalition is going to indeed deliver a “better budget”, I need to know that more than 48 hours before I vote.As Tom Cruise once famously yelled, “Show me the money!” If you want to spend my hard-earned and forfeited tax dollars, be transparent about how you want to spend them and do it in a timely fashion that lets me consider your plans.Voters are not asking much. In fact it’s pretty straight forward: Do the work. Meet your deadlines. And communicate honestly and respectfully with those you are seeking to influence.Kylea Tink is the outgoing independent federal member for North SydneyExplore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025OpinionCoalitionLabor partyAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The final humiliationwas in Sunday’s debatewhen the audience gave Dutton just 16% support on the central battle of the campaign.1:00Peter Dutton calls the ABC and the Guardian ‘hate media’ – videoYou can’t win an election by banging on about the problems and not providing the solutions.And thankfully you don’t get rewarded for simply drawing on prejudices against “back room” public servants as if they are serving no worthwhile role. Yes they are “invisible” and voiceless by obligation, but almost all of them indispensable in reality.And the campaign needed to get the sums right. Cutting 41,000 odd jobs from a Canberra-based public service of just 70,000 is ridiculous.Too many red lights. And in the end when Trump went ballistic on so many fronts – well, more ballistic than usual – Dutton was left badly exposed. And under the constant glare of an election campaign the public was on to it.- Barrie CassidyA shift to incumbencyEarlier in the campaign the critically important “soft voter” segment – voters who self report as likely or somewhat likely to change their mind before they vote – was nearly 50%, which is an atypically high number and reflected the major parties failure to energise and mobilise voters.Our qualitative research shows that the mood among these voters is pessimistic, and that they view the campaign as only offering them “Band-Aid” solutions to their concerns around things such as the cost of living.In 2024 the Coalition were able to leverage this grievance in the electorate and help create a mood for change. Albanese was seen by many soft voters to have the wrong focus and priorities and inflation remained political kryptonite to most incumbent governments.Albanese and Dutton face questions on possible power-sharing deals and tussle over Indigenous recognitionRead moreHowever, at the beginning of 2025, Labor’s campaign started sharpening its messages while the Coalition started to drift in terms of being in the conversation around the economy.The federal budget in Marchalso allowed Jim Chalmers to shape an economic narrative.However, despite Labor’s improved political performance, the real turning point in this campaign was President Trump’s announcement around tariffs and specifically the share market’s response to his position.In recent years globally and domestically, incumbency was a political liability. But with Donald Trump now creating absolute uncertainty, the stability and certainty that comes with political incumbency is once again an advantage.Labor’s central campaign has cleverly capitalised on this changing sentiment that has underpinned voter considerations and defined the risk of change in these uncertain times.The perceived risk that Labor has most effectively defined is its messaging around claims that the Coalition’s $600bn nuclear plan will mean cuts to Medicare.Unlike most sequels, Mediscare 2.0 is possibly better than the original and it has underpinned a measurable collapse in Peter Dutton’s personal numbers as well as the Coalition’s primary vote which is mostly going to minor rightwing parties but then failing to all flow back to the Coalition on preferences.In the final week of the campaign, the soft vote cohort has now fallen to about 20% which is still unusually high at this point of the campaign but it’s also further proof that voters are now landing on a vote intention.The Coalition will need these remaining soft voters who haven’t yet pre-polled to break their way in an extraordinary flow of preferences. At this point it is very difficult to see Labor not forming government, with a majority still a live option.But to paraphrase Warren Buffett, in political campaigns you never know who’s swimming nude until the tide goes out.- Tony BarryBarrie Cassidy has covered 14 federal elections as a political journalist, and two from the inside as a senior press secretary to then prime minister Bob Hawke.

Over 25 years, his films have punctured, skewered, crushed, flattened and decapitated men, women and children in a series of horrifying “accidents” and Perry has been a witness to them all. His friends clearly want him to witness many more.Final Destination at 20: the bleakest teen horror film ever made?Read moreBut as we speak on video call, just a few weeks before the sixth instalment is released, he seems far from traumatised. Instead, he’s ebullient, buzzing infectiously about the many gory deaths he has overseen with the same enthusiasm other people might display when talking about their children (“If you’re not having fun, don’t do it!” he grins). He has every right to be proud. To date, the films have made more than $657m (£493m) worldwide and helped to terrify a generation of millennials about the dangers that arise not from entering a haunted house or swimming in shark-infested waters but from the mundanities of taking a shower or driving your car. In the Final Destination movies, death is everywhere.This time, prepare to be terrified of tattoo parlours, family barbecues, revolving doors and glass elevatorsIn the first film, released in the spring of 2000, it was on a plane and a teen, experiencing a gruesome premonition, sniffed it out early, saving himself and a handful of others as it exploded in front of them. But death soon followed them all home and constructed shocking, often grimly amusing, Rube Goldberg-style death sequences for them, correcting the imbalance. Sequels inevitably followed, kicking off with mayhem on the road, a rollercoaster, a racetrack and a suspension bridge.The original iteration of the script, once intended to be an X-Files episode, had personified death. But “using inanimate objects to achieve its objective” is something Perry believes has given the series its staying power.“It allows the audience to bring whatever baggage or notions that they have about death,” he tells me. “It could be cultural or personal or that moment two years ago when they had a near miss and thought, man, if I just stepped right or left, that would have been the end of it. You bring all that to the movie and it makes it yours. Your experience is unique to you.”View image in fullscreenThreat matrix … Kaitlyn Santa Juana in Final Destination: Bloodlines.Photograph: Eric MilnerIn the latest film, Final Destination: Bloodlines, the formula sees a slight shake-up. The film opens in the 1960s; the premonition-haver has found a way to cheat death for decades until the collapse of a space-needle restaurant that leads to the destruction of a whole family (instead of, as in earlier films, a group of teens or strangers). It was the brainchild of Spider-Man director Jon Watts, who then enlisted directing duo Adam Stein and Zach Lipovsky to breathe new life into a franchise that had been dormant for 14 years.The new film arrives at a time filled with nostalgia horror plays. The seventh chapter of the rebooted Scream franchise has just finished production, a rehaul of I Know What You Did Last Summer starring is out this July and an Urban Legend remake was announced last week. But masked slashers aside, is a new generation ready to be scared of, well, everything? Aren’t they scared enough? Turns out, not nearly.“What are the everyday experiences or everyday objects or everyday feelings that we can ruin for people?” asks Stein, speaking to me with his co-director on a break during the production of Freaks Underground, a sequel to their acclaimed 2018 breakout Freaks. No spoilers but as the trailers already suggest, this time prepare to be terrified of tattoo parlours, family barbecues, revolving doors and glass elevators.Inspiration comes to Perry not only via email, but to the entire creative team via the anxieties of everyday life – what if that fell, what if I fell, what if that fell while I was falling etc. “It’s those things that you run into in your daily life all the time and you just feel a little bit off about,” Lipovsky says (hint for the new film: his apartment overlooks an alley where garbage is frequently collected). Perry jokes that he “can’t walk into a room without doing a threat matrix”.While many of the death scenes might seem cartoonishly far-fetched, it’s become surprisingly important for those involved to heavily research just how close to reality they could actually be. I mistakenly referred to a grisly scene involving a monstrously powerful magnetic resonance imaging machine, already teased at Comic-Con, as outlandish. I was corrected. Top-end MRIs, Perry tells me, “can literally pull entire gurneys into them and fold them over. That’s all true.”Lipovsky adds that he read up on some “extremely tragic and horrible” stories in his research (think guns and wheelchairs sucked into machines). “It all has to be stuff the audience generally would believe is possible,” he says. He goes on to tell me about extravagant crew tests involving mannequins.View image in fullscreen‘People don’t realise how challenging the tone is in these movies’ … the first Final Destination, from 2000.Photograph: Shane Harvey/New Line/Kobal/ShutterstockBut how do you centre a film on the utter inescapability of death and not make it feel like a depressing slog? “It’s knowing without diminishing, if that makes sense,” Perry says. “And this is why I think it’s so hard. People don’t realise how challenging the tone is in these movies.”Is he worried about increased sensitivities with a new generation (the first film featured a pre-9/11 plane crash and a grim shower death mistaken for a suicide)? “One of the challenges with this storytelling in general is if you have to have trigger warnings for drama, that means you can’t have an antagonist,” he says. “Because antagonists, by their very nature, do terrible things.” He adds: “I feel like if we get hamstrung by overanalysing that thing, we’re just going to have movies that play like tapioca. It’s just not going to be intriguing.”Stein agrees that it’s “incredibly tricky” to make so much carnage so much fun but the secret is in the bad guy, death. “You kind of root for him because of his sense of humour,” he says. “He’s just so clever.”View image in fullscreenSurprisingly moving … Tony Todd in Final Destination: Bloodlines.Photograph: Eric Milner/APDespite the films forcing family members or partners to watch their loved ones get brutally splattered to smithereens in front of them, the franchise isn’t really known for its humanity. Here, death doesn’t mean all that much. But in the new film, it suddenly does. Tony Todd, who has appeared in all but one of the films (including a voice role in the third one), died in November last year, not long after filming a one-scene cameo. His on-screen farewell is a surprisingly moving moment, the actor looking strikingly frail.“Everyone involved knew he was ill and we weren’t sure at certain points whether he would be able to participate,” Stein tells me. “It was a really unique moment because talking about his own death for the movie on this meta level, he’s speaking to the fans abouthisdeath. And so in that moment when he had his final goodbye, we asked him if he would be able to kind of put the script away and do a take where he spoke from the heart about what death means and what life means … it’s his honest words of wisdom direct to you.”It’s a rare moving moment in a film that’s otherwise as energetic and fun as the very best of the franchise. The first oneturned 20 just after the pandemic kicked inand, with Bloodlines emerging as the world continues to burn in new and old ways, what purpose does a Final Destination film have in 2025?“There’s a lot of depressing things happening in the world,” Lipovsky says, believing that the film will take viewers to “a different place outside the real world for a few hours”.Stein adds: “The communal experience of watching this movie in a theatre is really something to behold. Twelve minutes in, when a little boy gets crushed by a falling piano, the entire audience erupts in cheers. And that is something really fun.”Final Destination: Bloodlines is out in UK cinemas on 14 May and in the US on 16 MayExplore more on these topicsFilmHorror filmsAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gary Oldman and Stephen Rea unspool Beckett’s masterpiece about memoryKrapp’s Last Tape, in which an old man rummages through recordings of his younger self, is back for two star-powered revivals. This haunting play invites actors and audiences to reconnect with their pastChris WiegandThu 1 May 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 19.02 EDTShareIam a Krapp collector. Since my late teens I’ve returned time and again to Samuel Beckett’s brief but monumental one-act play in which a purple-nosed, “wearish old man” spools through reels of memoir recorded each year on his birthday. Although performed by a single actor, Krapp’s Last Tape is not quite a monologue. It becomes a kind of dialogue between the 69-year-old Krapp and his recorded 39-year-old self, who in turn reflects on how he behaved in his late 20s.It is, then, a tale of three Krapps. I’ve sailed past two of those ages: next stop, 69! Beckett’s play has endured partly because it bottles the nature of regret – it asks us all to consider what could have happened if we had made other choices in our lives, how things might have turned out differently. Two current productions – starringGary Oldman at York Theatre RoyalandStephen Rea at the Barbican in London– not only invite audiences to consider such questions but also give the actors a rare opportunity to reconnect with their past.“Perhaps my best years are gone,” says Krapp towards the end of the play. The Crying Game’s Rea, who is 78, disproves any such suggestion with an acutely moving performance, boosted by the use of his own archive recording of the younger Krapp’s lines – done on a whim by the actor in 2009 and stowed away for future use. Rea worked with Beckett on Endgame in 1976 (and did a film of it in 1991) and brings to bear the great writer’s note on that play, “It’s always ambiguous”, with his interpretation of Krapp.View image in fullscreenSelf-critical … John Hurt in Krapp’s Last Tape at the Barbican’s Pit theatre, London, in 1999.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianOscar winner Oldman, at 67, is two years too young for the older Krapp yet seems wearier than Rea as he creaks around the set in York, where he began his career in 1979 and played roles including a pantomime cat. Oldman, who recorded the younger Krapp’s voice in the months before this production, has not acted on stage for 37 years – more than half his lifetime. In a programme note he uses a Krapp-like image to explain theatre’s impact on his screen career, saying he always draws on his “mental museum of theatre references”. The production, which he also directed and designed, honours past Krapps by featuring the same machine used by Michael Gambon andJohn Hurtin the role.When I talked to Hurtabout his memories of Krapp’s Last Tape, I said I’d seen it in the West End, the year after its 1999 run at the Barbican’s Pit. He instantly replied that he wished I’d seen it in 2013, by which time he had withdrawn the anger from his portrayal. The recording of the younger Krapp that he made for the Barbican run was used for all his subsequent productions. Hurt was similarly critical of that audio performance. However, he acknowledged: “The more I come to dislike what I did on the tape, the more it plays into the hands of the present Krapp.”In depicting a man who is frustrated – even deflated – by his past, both personally and professionally, Beckett’s play taps into the self-critical actor’s quest for the perfect performance. This gained an unexpected charge on the night I saw Robert Wilson’s thunderyexpressionist production, featuring immense projections, at the Barbican in 2015. It left me cold, but I was nevertheless shocked when, at the curtain call, a nearby theatregoer was so unimpressed that they booed Wilson, who took his bow seemingly still in character as Krapp, and cast a hurt expression our way.View image in fullscreenMichael Gambon as Krapp in 2010. Oldman’s production features the same machine that Gambon used.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianRea’s Krapp, directed byVicky Featherstone, twice looks over his shoulder at the pitch-black that surrounds him, which his younger self says, unconvincingly, makes him feel less alone. The spartan set, designed by Jamie Vartan, is more like a cell than Beckett’s “den” and brings an air of confession or self-interrogation. Krapp’s desk comes with comically deep drawers, concealing his beloved bananas.Playing Krapp comes with high potassium levels: you usually see this number of bananas eaten by tennis players not actors. Krapp berates himself for tucking into them and keeps the fruit under lock and key – it’s a rigmarole to reach them, much like his system for storing away memories that bring a similarly peculiar mix of pain and pleasure. Rea seems to inhale the scent of his first banana before taking a huge bite that leaves its stringy bits dangling from his lips. Malcolm Rippeth’s sepia lighting for Oldman’s cluttered set evokes a bruised banana; Oldman slings his skins to the floor and gives a sly grin before biting into his second one. Recognising that every sound matters in Beckett, Oldman fills the theatre with the sound of laborious masticating.Both actors excel at the comedy of Krapp: Rea skittering on and off stage with the reels, Oldman affecting a light and airy voice as he draws out the word “spooool”. When Rea reads from the dictionary a description of the “vidua bird” with its black plumage, the humour is increased by the actor’s own mop of dark curls. Rea turns the memory of a “bony old ghost of a whore” into a cantankerous standup routine, adopting the voice of Fanny, and dourly mocks his younger self. Each actor nails the self-satisfied 39-year-old’s grand proclamation to be at the “crest of the wave”; both emphasise how the older man has not changed as much as he might have wished in the decades since.Acting is reacting, so they say, and the relationship between the three Krapps is pivotal to the play, as suggested by the on-the-nose choice of We Three (My Echo, My Shadow and Me), a song about being “all alone, living in a memory”, as introductory music for Oldman’s production. His set accentuates the clutter and resembles an attic as he seems to emerge from beneath to potter around boxes, crates and old furniture that form a lifetime of precious detritus. The set, which also suggests he is shored up on an island, even implies a connection between Krapp’s ramshackle belongings and the fragmented scenes and gestures that Beckett wrote for the character.It’s a play that really needs a much smaller stage than either the Barbican or York’s Theatre Royal. Of all the productions I’ve seen, the venue that suited it best was the subterranean Jermyn Street theatre in London’s West End, which has an impressive record with Beckett. Trevor Nunn directed it there in 2020, in a triple bill with Eh Joe and The Old Tune, recognising that Beckett’s lonely souls gain a haunting collective force when presented together (as in Jermyn Street’sFootfalls and Rockabythe following year). Nevertheless, even the passing references to other characters in Krapp’s Last Tape emphasise its themes – like Old Miss McGlome who sings “songs of her girlhood”.View image in fullscreenIntimate staging … James Hayes in Krapp’s Last Tape at Jermyn Street theatre, 2020.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe first Krapp I saw was soon after reading it at university. That performance was memorable for being halted when an acrid smell wafted off the machine and the theatre’s tech team were called in to investigate. I recall feeling cheated that they resumed at the same point and didn’t do the 50-ish minute play once more from the top. I saw that show with a friend who died at the age of 41 – I now realise that the only tapes I own, boxed away in the attic, are compilations he made for me over the years. I have nothing to play them on, but will always keep them.A trip to Krapp’s Last Tape in my 20s rekindled a romance that I would come to replay with my own sense of regret. The most striking lines of this singular play – where even the stage directions are longer than the speeches spoken live – are about a breakup. In the 39-year-old’s recording, he recalls it like this: “I said again I thought it was hopeless and no good going on and she agreed, without opening her eyes.” It occurs on a punt on a sun-kissed afternoon, a wretched business tenderly evoked. In Rea’s performance, he perfects the agitated state in which Krapp searches for the section – capturing Hurt’s belief that Krapp is an addict.Addicted to what, exactly? To a hit not of nostalgia but of emotion – no matter how painful – for a man who has shut himself off. (In afascinating new documentary, Rea says of Krapp “there’s a very sad life occurring”, that passive verb capturing exactly the loss of control the older Krapp seems to have.) Future Krapp-like characters might be rabbit-holing on Facebook or Instagram instead, grasping for the right photo or phrase to stitch together a memory.Krapp is a play about memory-making: about stockpiling the moments that define us, not unlike assembling a mix tape or organising your iCloud. It’s what the younger Krapp, an aspiring writer, calls “separating the grain from the husks” – about as good a description as you could use for Beckett’s precision as a playwright. But it is also about self-deception and not facing down the difficult episodes, such as the death of Krapp’s mother.Play it again, Sam: why Krapp’s Last Tape still leaves us reelingRead moreAs you get older, and see new productions of familiar plays, you gravitate towards different characters. The last few times I’ve seen Romeo and Juliet I have been far more interested in the parents than the young lovers. Krapp presents us instead with one man’s range of ages to reflect upon or anticipate. Like Lear, it’s a role that actors and audiences grow into. So it was a masterstroke by Seán Doran, artistic director of Arts Over Borders, to ask Samuel West and Richard Dormer to eachrecord the part of the taped Krappwhen they were 39. For the Beckett Biennale in 2036, by which time West will have reached the correct age, he will perform using his recording; two years later, Dormer will do the same with his when he hits 69. (“Extremely early bird tickets” are available now.) This forward planning is fitting. In the opening line, Beckett tells us the play is set in the future – his masterpiece acknowledges the weight of what may lie ahead as well as what has passed.Krapp’s Last Tape starring Gary Oldman is atYork Theatre Royaluntil 17 May. Krapp’s Last Tape starring Stephen Rea is at theBarbican, London, until 3 May andPavilion theatre, Dublin, 22-25 July.Explore more on these topicsTheatreSamuel BeckettGary OldmanBarbicanJohn HurtVicky FeatherstonefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She proposed an installation with three towers for the Turbine Hall and we suggested also borrowing a small group of her spiders to put on the ramp down into the hall, to lure people in. She said, ‘No, no, no – I’ll make you a spider.’ It was all very last minute: we had to finish installing Maman, as this giant new spider was called, during the very first opening event, which was for London’s taxi drivers. I spent the next few years meeting taxi drivers who’d say: ‘You weren’t involved with that spider woman, were you?’” (Dale Berning Sawa)Anish Kapoorinstalls a giant trumpet (2002)Phil Monk, senior design and production managerView image in fullscreen“This took several weeks and a huge number of people to install. The first phase was the assembly of the three huge steel rings that formed the structure of Marsyas. They were tricky to get into place. Then there was the giant red vinyl membrane that had to be carefully and slowly stretched around the steel. It arrived in one huge piece, so it was a major feat of engineering, spreading it across the whole floor, stretching it around the rings, getting the tension right. It took a really big blowtorch to soften the fabric. The finished work filled virtually the whole hall. Only on moving around the building could the full scale be seen. When viewed on the bridge, you were almost engulfed. You could imagine being Jonah or Pinocchio about to be swallowed by a whale.” (Eddy Frankel)Olafur Eliassonunveils a setting sun (2003)Olafur Eliasson, artistView image in fullscreen“When I was approached about doing something, I immediately thought about the relationship British people have with the weather. Someone can say ‘I like the rain’ and someone else can say ‘I prefer the sun’ and they can still be friends. Whereas if this was football teams, they couldn’t even be in the same pub! I was also interested in Turner and Constable and the tradition of depicting the weather in British watercolours. My idea was to recreate a setting sun, where you see half of it in the sky and the other half reflected in the sea. We used very thin aluminium mirrors to achieve this. Compared to some of my other projects, it wasn’t technically difficult. I did not anticipate the social spectacle it became. I thought people would be looking with their eyes but instead they looked with their bodies: lying down, rolling around, making shapes in the giant reflection. The BBC even reported the weather from Tate Modern!” (Tim Jonze)Doris Salcedoputs a long crack in the floor (2007)Doris Salcedo, artistView image in fullscreen“The memory of this work is painful. It was, and still is, a wound inflicted on theTurbine Hall. It was an excruciating gesture for all the parties involved – Tate director Nicholas Serota’s job was on the line because of the nature of the piece. As the first artist from the global south invited to do a Turbine Hall commission, it was essential to raise our voices and respond to colonial history – it felt as serious as life or death to me. It represents the division in our world, which unfortunately only keeps growing.” (Charlotte Jansen)An enormous salad is mixed with a rake (2008)Catherine Wood, curator“In the 1960s, Alison Knowles, who was a founding member of the Fluxus movement, had done an iteration of this piece at the ICA, tossing a salad in a pickle barrel. She proposed to supersize it. First there was a funny visit to nearby Borough Market, where Alison was like: “I’ll have all your lettuces.” Also tomatoes, cucumbers – she wanted it to taste good. During the event, she was quite performative, announcing what was happening. Chefs from the museum chopped the veg into crates on the bridge, then tossed it down on to a tarpaulin on the Turbine Hall floor and poured down the dressing from a jug. There was a big crowd, 500, maybe 1,000, people. Everyone cheered. She used a garden rake to mix it and people got little bowls to eat from. The museum was built on the principles of what those artists in the 1960s did with participation and access and play. So this was a thrill.” (DBS)Nan Goldin does The Ballad of Sexual Dependency(2008)Patrick Wolf, musicianView image in fullscreen“I had just moved into a flat opposite the Tate Modern, when I got the call from Nan. She had given me a copy of her book, The Ballad of Sexual Dependency, four years earlier. It felt like such an honour to be asked to make the first ever soundtrack to this visual diary. Nan was very trusting. She knew I’d respect the work. And I knew where it was coming from. When I was a teenager, I was part of a crowd in London that was similarly disturbed by what they had experienced, either through addiction or death. At the beginning, Nan gave a speech. The piece started with a tubular bell and a double bass, and a sense of silence took over, a weight came over the room. We had orchestral timpani and a string quartet. I played the harpsichord. At the end, Nan was very emotional and crying. As with everything at the Tate, there’s a party afterwards, which felt quite strange after something so heavy. I remember walking with Nan outside at the back of the Tate and us just saying thank you to each other.” (DBS)Tania Bruguera kettles people withhorses (2008)Catherine Wood, curatorView image in fullscreen“Tania always said this performance piece – which was an idea she had never realised – would be like a gunshot, a surprise. Our health and safety and security officer at the time had a contact in the Met. Tania asked the officers to perform six crowd-control exercises normally used in riots. At first, they were friendly to the crowd but she asked them to stop. The horses’ hooves clacking on the concrete was echoing around the space and when the police got into their role, you heard them barking instructions. The crowd went quite quiet. I was there with my six-month-old son. People were both complying and marvelling at the strange, surreal spectacle. The horses dumped on the floor, which was great as well. There is a tradition in art of doing variations ofPiero Manzoni’s Merde d’artiste.” (DBS)Picture of Brooke Shields naked removed by police (2009)Catherine Wood, curator“Richard Prince’s Spiritual America had been shown before and had become iconic and familiar in the art world. By reclaiming Gary Gross’s photograph of a naked, 10-year-old Brooke Shields, Prince was clearly referencing the way capitalism sexualises young women and girls. We didn’t question the acceptability of showing it. We had also been in touch with Brooke Shields. She had a conflicting relationship with the image, but after working with Prince on a follow-up had become reconciled to it. Nobody from the public lodged a complaint, but we were advised by the police that we had to take it down or our director could be liable for prosecution under the child protection act. At the time, we were shocked. We thought the police were being very literal. But it does all look very different today. The mass access that Tate Modern gives to art is different even to New York museums, where people have to pay to enter. When you step outside the protected zone of the art world, who read the artist’s “move” through his conceptual intent, the image looks very different. These days, we have a much more robust process of assessing sensitive content. Today, we would know what is and isn’t possible long before the work ended up on the gallery wall.” (TJ)Bodyspacemotionthings causes joy – and injuries (2009)Kathy Noble, former interdisciplinary curatorView image in fullscreen“I’d come across these images of an installation Robert Morris made in Tate Britain in 1971. They were of people climbing and balancing on plywood sculptures and were really surprising. Back then, museums were a place of reverence, almost cathedral-like. When the public were invited to interact with the objects, they didn’t quite know how to go about it: there were some injuries and the show closed after four days. We wondered whether Tate Modern had changed the way people behaved around art. We worked closely with Robert to make it safer and he gave the 2009 version the title Bodyspacemotionsthings – the original used unfinished pieces of wood whereas we had plywood that had been treated and objects made of rubber. There were no splinters this time. The press did report that some people got injured but I think that was sensationalised. I only remember a couple of minor incidents. In general people were excited. It helped write a new narrative about how art can be playful and joyous. And it was so popular that this time around it was extended from four days to a whole month.” (TJ)Ai Weiwei’s Sunflower Seeds ishalted (2010)Ai Weiwei, artistView image in fullscreen“Sunflower Seeds is one of the most complicated projects I have ever undertaken. It was created by 1,600 women artisans over a period of two full years. It reflects China’s history, culture and exceptional artisan skills. It also reflects the backdrop of globalisation – and China involving its entire population within this process. The artwork is not merely a visual piece highlighting quantity and complexity, but also represents the political reality and socialist society in which I grew up. I had hoped visitors could walk across 100m sunflower seeds, their physical contact reminiscent of walking on a beach. I did not anticipate that the dust produced by the seeds underfoot would be harmful to health. As a result, its participatory nature was halted, transforming it into a purely visual experience. This came as a shock to me. The impact was that my thinking about the relationship between artworks and sociopolitical movements intensified. I believe art arises from an individual’s personal reflection and cannot be separated from engagement with society.” (EM)Tacita Dean blows up celluloid (2011)Tacita Dean, artistView image in fullscreen“I thought a Turbine Hall commission was one thing I would never be asked to do, because my work is relatively small. Nothing I make is ever about the spectacular. The piece, titled FILM, was all done very quickly with a completely new experimental system, projecting images on to a 13-metre-tall monolith – exactly when the medium of film itself was under such threat. You have no idea of the drama. We worked all through the night. Steve Farman, the negative cutter, drove from London to Amsterdam and back to recut the film and handed it in at the back door, less than 48 hours before the opening. I remember saying in an event that film is not dead: it will only die if it gets murdered. My crew at the time were all under 25 and it blew their minds.”Yayoi Kusamabrings Infinity Mirror Rooms to the UK (2012)Frances Morris, then curatorView image in fullscreen“This was a very important show for Kusama, not only because of that glorious final moment – with the biggest Infinity Room she had made to date. She afforded us amazing access to her archive, and to her secret home in Tokyo. We made lots of discoveries. I have to say, though, that it was hard to persuade Kusama to do the show. I went to visit her in Tokyo and promised it would make her more famous than her old friend Donald Judd. I think it delivered!”Mark Rothko’s Black on Maroon is vandalised (2012)Patricia Smithen, repair project leaderView image in fullscreen“When I heard the news, I was on site within the hour. Black ink had been drawn on the lower right corner of Rothko’s Black on Maroon and it had penetrated quickly. It turned out to be graffiti ink – designed to be quick drying, highly staining and permanent. The project took 18 months while conservation scientist Bronwyn Ormsby rallied expertise from across the field. The artwork is made up of very thin layers of paint and glazes: most solvents which could remove the ink would also affect Rothko’s paint. About 80 different solvent combinations were tried out on test surfaces over nine months. Rachel Barker, the painting conservator, did the actual treatment. She combined two solvents, layered, and applied them through absorbent fabric. When the ink was pulled out and we could see the original paint again, there were cheers! After a final retouching with reversible paint under the gallery lights, we asked staff if they could see the damage. Nobody was able to spot it. It was a wonderful moment, but bittersweet. The painting looks perfect in the gallery, but some black ink remains within the lower paint layers and stains the canvas on the reverse. This damage is for ever and it still haunts me.” (TJ)Liberate Tateprotests againstBP sponsorship(2012)Mel Evans, founding member Liberate TateView image in fullscreen“We wanted to highlight what BP had consistently failed at: clean renewables. A farmer in Wales gave us an old turbine blade: 16.5 metres long and 1.5 tonnes in weight. We had to cut it in three to transport it. We spent a couple of weeks polishing it. We wanted it to be beautiful, to lie on the floor of the gallery like a beached whale. There was a conversation in the group about standing it on its end, but a few of us said that was much too phallic. We walked with it from the Occupy camp at St Paul’s Cathedral, across the Millennium Bridge. One of the security guards laid down in front of it to stop us coming in, so I sat down with him and spoke very gently, saying: “This is happening.” He stood up. We assembled the blade. There were 75 performers. We held hands in a ring around it. All the gallery-goers stood and applauded. It felt incredible, electric.” (DBS)Tino Sehgal’s storytellers chat to visitors (2012)Tino Sehgal, artistView image in fullscreen“In 2012, London was having a great moment. And the Turbine Hall was the biggest and most unusual art space. I hadn’t worked with a large group of people before, so I was interested in what I could do with a crowd. In total, 300 people participated over three months. I created ‘human swarm patterns’ by having them follow sets of rules or games. They’d all move from one side to the next, or all walk backwards or sing a song together. I also gave them six questions – things like, ‘When did you have a sense of arrival?’ – and they chose one for their interactions with visitors. The anonymity made these interactions surprisingly intimate. They’d come to me afterwards if something special happened.” (DBS)Kraftwerk play eight live gigs (2013)Emil Schult, Kraftwerk’s artistic collaboratorView image in fullscreen“To accompany these performances, we redid some of the early videos that had been made in the 1970s for the band’s stage show, but we also made new ones. The video for Autobahn was an animation, based on the painting I did for the sleeve of the original 1974 album. My input was on the artistic side: the colours, the shape of the industrial landscapes, the streamlining of the Trans Europe Express engine, the movement of waves and so on. For almost 50 years now, I have been interested in animation, artificial life and artificial intelligence. So to see my work come alive was very much appreciated.” (TJ)Matisse’s late works break Tate records (2014)Nicholas Cullinan,then curator of International Modern ArtView image in fullscreen“When I proposed the show in 2009, Nicholas Serota and I had just curated the Cy Twombly exhibition and had been visiting Cy in his studio on a regular basis, in what turned out to be the last years of his life. That, and the fact that Tate Modern had never done a Matisse show, was our inspiration: often when artists have a sense of their mortality, they respond by making the best work they’ve ever made. We were pleasantly surprised at how many loans we got: people understood this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see all the works together. With over half a million visitors, it is still the most visited show the Tate, not just Tate Modern, has ever had.” (DBS)New viewing platform prompts legal battle(2016)John O’Mara, project architect of the Switch HouseforHerzog & de MeuronView image in fullscreen“Our idea for the top of the new Switch House was to create an elevated public space with thrilling 360-degree views across the city. A developer was planning to build towers of luxury flats next door, so we did these gymnastic moves with our design to protect their views of the river. They were very supportive of the project, so it was a real shock when residents started complaining about people looking into their flats from the terrace, about 30 metres away. No one had anticipated it being a problem, but they took Tate to court. The first ruling found in favour of Tate, but a subsequent supreme court ruling saw the southern side of the terrace closed off. It’s a real shame, as a lot of people really liked that view.” (Oliver Wainwright)Elton John shares his photography collection (2016)Shoair Mavlian, curator ofThe Radical Eye:Modernist Photography from the Sir Elton John CollectionView image in fullscreen“It was incredible to have access to Sir Elton John’s collection and put the vintage prints on public display – everything in the show was printed before 1950. Sir Elton has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the history of photography and a real highlight was when he recorded an audio guide, giving his perspective on dozens of the photos. You could really hear his passion for photography.” (CJ)Soul of a Nation starts something big (2017)Zoé Whitley,co-curator of Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black PowerView image in fullscreen“This show was about the irreducibility of what it means to be Black. It exceeded all expectations in terms of people who came, who felt seen, who wanted to engage with it, including Jay-Z, Naomie Harris, John Legend and Sampha. All the works posed the question: what is Black art? It gave no single answer. This was the start of something that keeps getting bigger. And it was celebratory for so many artists, many of whom are no longer with us.” (CJ)Work by gallery staff goes on display (2018)Chris Daniels, artistView image in fullscreen“There had been talk about a staff exhibition for a while, and I applied after I saw it on Tatenet, the intranet for staff. Tate is full of artists who work there to pay the rent, but also spend all their spare time in the studio, and still produce incredible art despite the restrictions of a day job. I was a Tate Membership recruiter, walking up to people and trying to encourage them to join up, but I also made, and still make, paintings. It was a fantastic opportunity: the sheer numbers of people visiting Tate Modern meant the audience was much bigger than any standard exhibition. And it meant I could add “showing at Tate Modern” to my bio!” (EF)Kara Walkerbuilds afountain full of sharks(2019)Kara Walker, artistView image in fullscreen“The process began with not wanting to do Louise Bourgeois or Doris Salcedo wrong. I had those artists’ incredible Turbine Hall interventions in mind when I embarked on this piece. Then I spent six months or so ramming my head against the wall. That was until one visit to London, when I snapped a few pictures of the Queen Victoria memorial from the taxi on my way to Heathrow. I thought, ‘Wow, that’s the kind of pomposity I like!’ The symbolic language, the overblown figuration, a little too big for its britches. That’s my language. Fons Americanus, my fountain, was a commentary on empire and my place within it, which is as an outsider, a rebel. The American invader.” (EM)Anicka Yi’s robotic jellyfish take flight (2021)Anicka Yi, artistView image in fullscreen“In Love With the World reimagined the Turbine Hall as an aquarium of machines, where airborne lifeforms – “aerobes” – drift through the air like jellyfish through water. It was essential to me that these machines didn’t merely occupy the space, butsensedit,respondedto it, and participated in it. A central concern was to challenge the cognitive hierarchy that places disembodied intelligence – the mind extracted from the body – at the top. Instead, I’m interested in artificialphysicalintelligence – intelligence as something rooted in corporeality, sensory perception and ecological embeddedness. I wanted the aerobes to be less robotic in the traditional sense and more like a new species, engaged in a multispecies symbiosis with us and the atmosphere we share. Each aerobe is kept aloft by helium envelopes and guided by a compact system of carbon-fibre actuators, 3D-printed components and custom-built control boards. Key to their long-term operation is the Battery Pond. Aerobes return there autonomously when their batteries run low, while technicians perform regular check-ins. If an aerobe were to experience a technical issue, its helium structure ensures a slow, controlled descent – not a crash, but a soft settling. They avoid one another, respond to heat signatures from the crowd below, and navigate invisible trails left by other aerobes – forming a choreography that prevents collisions and encourages responsive movement. Rather than building flawless machines, the aim was to create a self-regulating ecosystem.” (EM)Cézanne shows everyone how it’s done (2023)Peter Doig, painterView image in fullscreen“Picasso said, ‘He was my one and only master. It was the same for all of us. He was like our father. He was the one who protected us.’ That still seems to ring true for artists today, even after all the new territory that has seemingly been mined in painting since Cézanne’s death. The Tate show displayed all of his mastery as well as his awkwardness and irreverence. For painters today I think he still holds the secrets to everything one can learn – from bad to good painting and drawing, economy, restraint and his lack of flash. Cézanne never shows off. I am continually drawn to his details. You can learn everything you need to know about painting just from his flumes of smoke.” (EF)Tracey Emin given major retrospective (opens 2026)Tracey Emin, artistView image in fullscreen“I am really happy that I didn’t die and I am around to see this exhibition. I was there at the opening of the Tate Modern in 2000 – and at the time it felt like the most exciting thing that could ever possibly happen to London. You judge a city by its art.” (DBS)Explore more on these topicsTate ModernTurbine HallArtLouise BourgeoisAnish KapoorOlafur EliassonShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Kerry Brown/Paramount Pictures/AllstarAs the wrestler turned action hero turns 53, we count down his best movies – from Baywatch to Jumanji to that time he played the Tooth FairyByStuart HeritageThu 1 May 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 10.07 EDTShare20. Red One (2024)Dwayne Johnson is about to violently switch gears. His next films include a Benny Safdie drama about an MMA fighter battling addiction and a true-crime drama produced by Martin Scorsese. The reason for this abrupt handbrake turn towards grownup film-making seems to beRed One; a duff Christmas action film. During its production, tales of Johnson’s backstage behaviour leaked out: the star was said to frequently be late, and would habituallyhand his assistant bottles of urine rather than walk to the toilet. It was the biggest knock to The Rock since his career began. But onwards and upwards.19. Black Adam (2022)Call it bad timing or hubris, but Johnson’s eventual stint as a superhero felt like too little, too late.Black Adamstood out from the crowd in that his character actually killed people, but the film itself was a mess, and audiences were groggy from too many superheroes. It did so badly that DC had to switch creative approaches entirely to move on from it.18. Baywatch (2017)View image in fullscreen‘My job – it’s just beach’ … Johnson with Zac Efron in Baywatch.Photograph: Frank Masi, SMPSP/Paramount Pictures/AllstarThe Rock does Hasselhoff. What could go wrong? Well, on the evidence ofBaywatch, quite a lot. The film kept a lot of what made the 1990s TV show so popular – nearly everyone in it was hot and skimpily clothed – but the addition of ironic, self-aware humour made it feel a little like Johnson wanted to have his cake and eat it.17. Tooth Fairy (2010)A rite of passage in any action star’s career is the moment when they have to make a comedy that forces them to be soft. In other words, Tooth Fairy is The Rock’sKindergarten Cop, or hisMr Nanny, or (if we want to be cruel) hisThe Pacifier. He plays a mean hockey player who is forced to don wings and collect children’s teeth at night. “You might just be the worst tooth fairy ever,” says Julie Andrews, who is also in this for some reason.16. Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (2012)I’ll admit to a grudging soft spot for this one, simply for how relentlessly weird it is. It’sa Jules Verne adaptationin which The Rock variously sings ukulele songs, uses 3D technology to ping berries off his pecs at the camera and chases Michael Caine around on a giant bee. Underrated.15. Faster (2010)“Slow justice is no justice” said the posters for this vaguely Point-Blank-esque revenge thriller about an ex-con working his way down a list of people he wants to kill. In truth, Faster isn’t all that fast, but it is the sort of film where a character can be shot full in the head and shake it off as a flesh wound.14. Hercules (2014)A big historical epic based on Steve Moore’s comic book, this is another one of Johnson’s films known better for the narrative around it than the film itself. Johnson transformed his body for the role, spending six months inhaling calories while living “like a monk” in Budapest. The end result is entirely forgettable, though.13. Jungle Cruise (2021)View image in fullscreenInoffensive … with Emily Blunt in Jungle Cruise.Photograph: Walt Disney Pictures/Frank Masi/AllstarAn inoffensive IP grab in which Johnson and Emily Blunt do their best to breathe life into a 70-year-old theme park boat ride. Given that Pirates of the Caribbean (similarly based on a Disney attraction) was once the biggest film around,Jungle Cruisefared more modestly – although it’s entertaining enough, and Johnson has some enjoyably snappy chemistry with Blunt.12. Skyscraper (2018)There’s no way to sugar-coat this: for a while, Johnson’s stock in trade was churning out a stream of identical disaster movies. This isthe one that really wants to be Die Hard, the one where Neve Campbell plays his wife. It’s the one where The Rock jumps off one skyscraper and then lands on another one. It’s fine.11. Fighting With My Family (2019)Technically, The Rock has little more than an extended cameo here, inStephen Merchant’s biopicabout the rise of real-life WWE star Paige. The film helped to launch a boatload of careers, from Florence Pugh to Jack Lowden, and they’re responsible for all the heavy lifting. All Johnson has to do here is coast on his charisma, something he pulls off with aplomb.10. Rampage (2018)View image in fullscreenChemistry … Johnson and his CGI co-star in Rampage.Photograph: APIn which The Rock adapts a video game from 1986. The arcade game Rampage very much felt like an unlicensed attempt to trade on the popularity of King Kong and Godzilla, andthe moviedid nothing to change that. The star attraction is George, an enormous albino gorilla. But Johnson, playing his handler (who also gets to fire guns and punch a load of people), is the secret draw. It takes a lot to manufacture chemistry with a big ape that doesn’t exist, but he achieves it effortlessly. Maybe the most pure fun a Dwayne Johnson film has ever been.9. The Mummy Returns (2001)The Rock (and he was The Rock back then, none of this “Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson” nonsense) made his feature debut with thissequel to The Mummy. In time his character would receive his own spin-off in the form of the Scorpion King, and from this evidence it’s clear why. As the villain of the piece, Johnson oozes menace here; although the film is now notorious for its spectacularly shoddy CGI, which even at the time had to be seen to be believed, you can still see his star being born in real time.8. Pain & Gain (2013)This film represented a deliberate step back towards reality for both its star (who had just made a GI Joe movie) and its director, Michael Bay (who had been focusing on Transformers films).Pain & Gainis a true-crime thriller based on the story of some Miami bodybuilders who cluelessly embarked on a series of kidnappings and murders. Johnson is paired with Mark Wahlberg, and they both get a lot of mileage from playing vain dimwits. Some might say it’s a little distasteful to turn an actual murder into a comedy; if you can park that, though, the film is a wonderful reminder of Johnson’s strengths.7. Be Cool (2005)Make no mistake, Be Cool is a mess. A shapeless, formless, cameo-filled attempt to meld a sequel to Get Shorty out of thin air, the film has very little to offer. Johnson plays Elliot, a gay bodyguard with dreams of becoming an actor, and, in a puddle of sludge, he outshines everyone with his wit, timing and sheer physicality. You shouldn’t go and seek out Be Cool, because it will be the most miserable couple of hours of your life, but I’m sure Elliot has some compilation clips on YouTube.6. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017)On social media, The Rock makes much of his infinite determination. If he sets his mind on something, there’s nothing he can’t achieve. The Jumanji films are probably the greatest evidence of that. On paper, only a madman would attempt toremake a classic like Jumanji, especially following in the footsteps of a once-in-a-generation talent like Robin Williams. And yet The Rock did it. In truth, this isn’t so much a remake as a reimagining; the original saw Williams escape the game into real life, whereas here The Rock dives straight in. But he’s backed by a lot of talent in Jack Black, Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan. The fact that Johnson is playing a shy teenager injected into the body of an action hero is also a very sweet touch.5. The Other Guys (2010)View image in fullscreenBad boys … with Samuel L Jackson in The Other Guys.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyJohnson’s presence inAdam McKay’s comedyis something of a red herring. This is really a film about Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, two incompetent New York cops who are forced to step up when the city’s two best policemen are killed. Johnson plays one of the latter, which means his screen time is mainly confined to the first scene. However, that scene manages to offer a pitch-perfect distillation of The Rock’s career until then. It’s a high-stakes, gormless action sequence that, like almost all of his films, pays absolutely no mind to collateral damage. Johnson destroys everything (ultimately including himself) in pursuit of a villain, and, despite wrecking half a city in the process, is still considered a hero.4. The Fast & Furious series (2001–)All Vin Diesel’s film performances – ranked!Read moreIf it wouldn’t be so repetitive, these films could have made up half this list. The Fast & Furious series is the reason why The Rock came to be known as a franchise saver. Before he arrived, these were boring, slightly po-faced films about street racers. Then he came along and transformed the entire franchise into a head-smashing parade of ever sillier stunts. Starting with 2011’s Fast Five, Johnson punched and shot his way through countless baddies – and navigated what might be the world’s most unintentionally hilarious real-life feud with co-star Vin Diesel – until the universe simply couldn’t contain his might and he ducked out. A cameo at the end ofFast X(a film so aggressively OTT that it feels like a peyote trip) hinted at a return in the series finale. Here’s hoping.3. San Andreas (2015)A clear winner from Johnson’s disaster movie days,San Andreasis a loving homage to the work of Roland Emmerich, centring on what might happen should the San Andreas fault devastate the west coast of America. This essentially involves The Rock trading up through more and more ostentatious modes of transport as he attempts to outrun an earthquake. It’s all profoundly silly, from the American flag that unfurls at the end to the nagging suspicion that Johnson is never sure how attracted he is supposed to be to Alexandra Daddario, who plays his daughter. But goodness, it’s entertaining.2. Hobbs and Shaw (2019)A buddy moviestarring two half-formed offshoots from the Fast & Furious movies, Hobbs and Shaw felt like the most unnecessary film going when it was released. And yet you’ll never find a film with such a confident grasp of exactly how silly it is. Two lunkheads (Johnson and Jason Statham) squabble as they attempt to defeat Idris Elba’s genetically enhanced super-soldier. Every set piece here is stupider than the last – They fly fighter jets! They fight baddies with clubs! They drive cars through the top of skyscrapers! – and it’s baffling to think that this is a spin-off of a film where some people have a car race. But it’s so giddy (thanks mainly to co-star Vanessa Kirby, who palpably cannot believe she gets to do this) that the whole thing feels irresistible.1. Moana (2016)Johnson did his own singing in Moana.Ultimately, no film project of Dwayne Johnson’s has ever used his actorly skill set quite as effectively asMoana. Yes, it’s an animation, but The Rock gets to sing and goof about while simultaneously being tough and heroic. It feels as though his character, Maui, was written especially for him, with his oafish charm – and there’s a lightness of touch here that gets lost in all the head-smashing of the rest of his career. He is so good as Maui that the thought of a live-action Moana remake starring Johnson (which is happening, and happening soon) may not immediately fill you with dread. That’s as high as praise gets.Explore more on these topicsRankedDwayne Johnson (The Rock)MoanaAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When did you first feel that you had“made it”?LondonLuvverI wasn’t expecting to do music for a job. I was into social activism in college, and I just had music as a hobby. My boyfriend managed a bunch of blues artists and I asked if I could open for some of them – just to have fun and hang out with my heroes. Unbeknown to me, there really weren’t any women playing blues guitar and doing the mix of songs [I was], and I immediately got more offers of gigs and even a record company offer within about a year. That first gig I got under my own name, when I was 19, was a total surprise: that’s when I felt I had made it.View image in fullscreenJohn Raitt and Doris Day in The Pajama Game.Photograph: The Kobal CollectionHow was it growing up with a father [John Raitt] who was such a big Broadway star?Abbeyorchards7He had hits in the 1940s with Carousel, and in the 50s with The Pajama Game. By the time I was 10 or 11, he was on the road touring in the summer – he loved taking Broadway shows out to the countryside. That influenced me a lot later when I decided to veer off from college and go into music: his love of travelling, of every night being opening night, and putting everything he had into every performance. And he was on tour basically until his mid-80s, so I think that had a tremendous influence on me: like, we can’t believe we get paid, and this is our job.Guitar lesson, please!What are the top three things to getting that beautifully smooth slide tone?ToneRayThat feel is something you can’t teach – it’s something where I just listened and listened. I taught myself guitar when I was nine, looking at the fingers of the people at my summer camp. I just played by ear, mimicking what I heard on the radio and on records. I then fell in love with slide guitar, which I first heard when I was about 14.In college, I developed my own style. I switched to a Stratocaster – I got a really good deal in the middle of the night for $120 – and then a few years later, in 1972, Lowell George [of Little Feat] showed me his MXR compressor [pedal]. I’d asked him how he got the tone to last so long – whether it’s a ferocious kind of dirty sound, or a beautiful clean sound on a ballad, the compressor really squishes the sound and makes it last longer. The rest of it is just imitating something that you love until you feel like you’ve got it; just playing with all your heart and soul every time you pick up the guitar. I was trying to make it as close to the human voice as I could.John Lee Hookercalled you his hero.When I watch tapes of you playing together, the love and joy jumps off the screen.Could you tell us a bit about your friendship?jackworthingjpWhen we did our recording of I’m in the Mood from his 1989 album The Healer, that’s when we started to get close. We had a similar sense of humour; we would just get together and talk about this recording or that by BB King or Bukka White or Fred McDowell. He found a kindred soul in me, and I did in him. He was always one of my heroes, but he became just a man, and my pal.For the recording sessions [for I’m in the Mood], we turned the lights down. I was platonic friends with John Lee, we didn’t flirt or have a romantic thing going on, but I chose that song because it was just so incredibly erotic and alluring. I gotta say it, face to face with him in the dark playing that song … damn! I was literally out of breath and I needed a towel after the session. We all got a big kick out of that. When he aims it at you, man, there’s nobody that can play that kind of lowdown stuff better than John Lee.I Can’t Make You Love Mehas become almost the holy grail of breakup songs.I’m tearing up justthinkingabout you singing it!Do you ever tire of hearing people tell you how much it means to them?cavelier5Never, and I never get tired of singing it. It makes me tear up as well! I have been on both sides of what the song is about – I’ve had to tell someone I don’t love them any more, and know what it was like to spend the next night or two with him. And I’ve also been the person who had their heart broken and asked someone to stay over the Christmas holidays even though they were breaking up with me. That heartache is so beautifully expressed in that song. I’m grateful I’m not going through that at the moment, but I just send it out every night to the people I know who are freshly involved in a heartbreak – or about to break someone’s heart, and tell them to be gentle.I’m very grateful that they [Mike Reid and Allen Shamblin] sent the song to me first. I’ve gotten so many letters from women that have said: “I’ve never seen my husband in tears and when you sing that song, or Angel from Montgomery, I turn to look at him in the audience and see tears rolling down his cheek.” What’s more moving than that?View image in fullscreen‘No one could turn a phrase like him’ … Bonnie Raitt and John Prine.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for The Recording AcademyI love your cover of Angel from Montgomery, theJohn Prineclassic. What are your recollections of him?tomcasagrandaNo one could turn a phrase like him. Nobody had the insight mixed with that wonderful sense of humour and pathos and genuine appreciation and understanding of the people that he was singing about, including himself. He was just delightful. His personality comes across in his live performances – he is just the same guy off stage as he is on.We hit it off right away in 1971 when we met. We were both having first albums out – his was a masterpiece of a first album. We’ve toured together over the years, and we became like Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer. We were really bonded for all of these five decades that we got to be dear, dear friends. Losing him and knowing that I wasn’t going to get to sing that song with him again was one of the big heartaches of Covid.TheGrammy-winning song Just Like Thatdelivers a gut-punch reveal [a stranger reveals to a woman that he is carrying the donor heart of her late son]. Have there been any particularly memorable conversations with transplant recipients and familiessince the song’s 2022 release?McScootikinsI received so many letters from people that had lost a loved one and eventually met the family that received the organs – or, heartbreakingly, so many families that said they wanted to find a donor but the bureaucracy of the organ donation system in America is just too clogged. Very few of the organs actually get to the people that need them and many people die needlessly. It’s been a broken system for a long time, which I wasn’t aware of [before writing the song].I certainly didn’t expect to win song of the year at the Grammys [beating Adele, Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, Harry Styles, Taylor Swift and more], nor did anybody else on planet Earth! Dr Jill Biden gave me the award. Maybe the song was played in her house and she and her husband spoke of it, or his staff did. Within a couple of months he made an announcement to overhaul the organ donation system in the States after decades of it being dysfunctional. There were 4,500 messages on my lyric video on YouTube after the Grammys: story after story from doctors, nurses, donor families and people that wish they had an organ. The ones that break my heart especially are the ones where people long to be able to put a stethoscope or put their head to the chest of someone that has their loved one’s heart.View image in fullscreen‘He found a kindred soul in me’ … Bonnie Raitt and John Lee Hooker.Photograph: Richard E Aaron/RedfernsA key part of your career is your numerous collaborations with other musicians – fromRay Charles,John Lee HookerandBB KingtoAlicia KeysandSheryl Crow. Which of these has the fondest memories for you?jimdThat is so tough to answer, like asking which of your kids is your favourite. But I couldn’t possibly choose between them and singing with my dad. It was an honour after all those years of being a blues mama. He said: “Your ballads, it’s just like me singing a ballad in a Broadway show – they’re just stories.” And so I sang Hey There with him from The Pajama Game, and he sang I’m Blowin’ Away with me, together with the Boston Pops Orchestra [in 1992]. That would be my highlight.The words you’ve written and sung for all these decades, the songs you’ve covered from way back in the day through your last album, have been the soundtrack of my life, our life, gifted to others in joy, in their time of need. Thank you for them and all the brilliant shows I’ve been fortunate to attend with my wife, going back to the 80s. How have you kept your empathy so strong?jfspakowskiI’m glad I have been the soundtrack. I feel that way about Joni Mitchell and Jackson Browne and so many others, so I’m right there with you.I don’t know how I would be able to sing a song in front of people without feeling it deeply – if I ever started to just phone it in I’d hang up my spurs and stay home! I didn’t think I’d be doing this 54 years later, but if you’re going to be singing it a lot, you better be careful about what songs you pick and what words you write, because you’re going to have to make them real for every audience that hasn’t seen you in a while. They come back, and those songs mean so much to them – and they mean so much to me because of that.Just Like Thatis a moving and beautiful song which has deservedly collected many awards and accolades. There is a second song on the album which tells an extraordinary story, and could have been a Grammy-winner in its own right.What was the inspiration forDown the Hall?WeissenbornI read a New York Times magazine story with a photo essay about a California prison where [prisoners] have volunteered to be on the hospice ward. To be of service to people that need their help, and also to be with them at the very last moments of their life. To hold their hands. The stories and the interviews were so beautiful, and the pictures were so astonishing – I was crying about it. It stayed with me for weeks.I knew I was going to try to write some story songs for the next record, inspired by John Prine. I wanted to make a story about this: a prisoner that decided to volunteer on the hospice ward of his prison. They’re stuck in there anyway and a lot of them either don’t remember the crime they committed – they might have been high or in a rage – or they just feel so much remorse, without redemption, for the crimes they committed. If it was major harm to children or a loved one or a murder, this is their way of redeeming themselves.For me, it’s the fact that it cuts across all the gang isolation in prisons. Out in the field they would never hang out with the Latinos, with the skinheads, with the Black prisoners, with the white prisoners – everybody’s separated. But in the hospice ward there’s no separation. Watching someone shave the head of somebody that was tattooed, when the rest of the time they wouldn’t have been allowed to even hang out together – it’s so moving to me.You use African or Caribbean rhythms in some of your songs, likeHear Me Lord. How has that music influenced your own style?bvigiliant1I have such a wide range of tastes, from Madeleine Peyroux to Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, the most gut-bucket country blues, Appalachian music and Celtic music. World music has always just broken my heart wide open. I love African music and guitar playing; I love South Africa and I loved Graceland. I was so happy to see so much of the incredible gift that African music can give the rest of the world, brought out by Paul Simon’s amazing success.World music has always appealed to me, especially in my early 20s: reggae was really taking over the college scene in Cambridge with Toots and Bob Marley. I loved Oliver Mtukudzi’s music from Zimbabwe [Mtukudzi wrote Hear Me Lord], and sadly, we lost him to Covid, as well as Toots, who was another dear friend. I’ve got two duets with Toots – and we were going to record a song of his as a duet on this last record of mine, but he passed away.Which artists inspire you today?onemoreseasonIf you like Little Feat, great soul singing and great slide, really knocking my socks off lately is the Bros Landreth out of Winnipeg, Canada – a band that wrote my song Made Up Mind, which won the Grammy for Americana performance in 2023, the same year that I won for song of the year.Lola Young’s Messy is one of the greatest things I’ve heard in years. I’ve always loved Jason Isbell – he’s got an incredible new album out. Janelle Monáe, Chance the Rapper, Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar – they are putting issues out in a way that is so important to showcase, as well as just great music: inventive and brilliant on every level.I love Olivia Rodrigo, her songs are killer, and HER is a great guitar player and songwriter. Courtney Barnett from Australia, and my dear soulmate, Maia Sharp, who I’ve got three songs with. Then I would say my friend Brandi Carlile, who has done so much for legacy artists like Joni Mitchell and Tanya Tucker – she is such a fan of music, and making such great music of her own.I understand your parents wereQuakers– is Quakerism still part of your life?ReddawnI’m known for my social activism, and using music to raise funds and attention for all kinds of environmental and human rights justice, women’s issues and Native American rights. From my folks converting to Quakerism after the second world war, I learned pacifism, and simplicity: not focusing on the material and consuming as much as possible, but being of service. Using your life to make a difference, and when you see injustice or suffering or lack in other people and you try to do something with your actions, not just talking about it or writing a cheque.My folks did benefits for the peace efforts to try to ban the bomb and stop nuclear testing. I grew up during the Vietnam war era and the civil rights era, and I watched my heroes like Joan Baez and the Staple Singers writing meaningful songs. Bob Dylan really changed my life that way as well.I don’t go to Quaker meetings as much because I travel so much, but the spirit of all the things I just mentioned are rooted in the Quaker philosophy. The true teachings of Christ and Muhammad and Buddha are so similar, they’re really the same – it’s all about love and not hating your enemies.View image in fullscreenTimothée Chalamet and Elle Fanning in A Complete Unknown.Photograph: API’ve just watchedA Complete Unknownand was wondering if there was a Dylan song that kind of sent you on your way?BoltUprightTimothée Chalamet, Ed Norton and actually everyone did an incredible job. I really wanted the power of Bob Dylan’s music, and his influence early in the 60s, to be experienced by this newer generation, so I’m grateful that the film was made and has had this success, because my life was changed when I was 13 and his first album came out.I was a folk music fan living in Los Angeles – I couldn’t get down to those clubs, as I was too young, and I didn’t live in Greenwich Village. For me it was all about records and reading music magazines – which in this case was Sing Out! – and I went to summer camp, where my counsellors were in colleges in the upstate New York and New England area. They were playing Joan Baez, Odetta and Peter, Paul and Mary, and they turned me on to Bob Dylan’s records.The Times They Are A-Changin’ album was the one that set me on a course: I loved and I learned every one of those songs so I could play them in my room just for myself, with no intention of performing them. He really brought social issues to bear at a time when the country was waking up to what we needed to wake up to, and consequently the world. His growth, his depth, his curiosity and his ability to master so many different styles: he is one of our greatest artists of all time.Could you share a story about singing and playing withLowell George of Little Feat?DavidEverardHats off to the UK, and Holland, for appreciating Little Feat and Ry Cooder and Randy Newman: artists that did not get a proper mind-blowing fandom in the States as they deserved. Lowell and Little Feat and I were so thrilled to be appreciated in the 70s in England, and we got to go to Amsterdam and, you know, smoke pot and all this stuff you hear about.Meeting Lowell changed my life. The reason that New Orleans is so special and important as a building block of modern R&B, blues and soul is the international influence: so many different styles of music melding together in one incredibly funky gumbo of country music and blues and Spanish feel. All those things were encompassed in Little Feat, between Billy Payne’s gorgeous piano playing and that killer rhythm section. But Lowell really was able to sing from such an incredibly soulful place. He absorbed all of his influences and they showed in everything he wrote, sang and played.His appetite for life was just limitless; he had an appreciation for every kind of music and a lifestyle that went with it. There was nobody better, in my opinion, until I heard Joey Landreth, who loves Lowell so much as well. Me and Lowell were dear friends and he died way too soon [aged 34 in 1979]. Who knows what he and Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jimi Hendrix would have been like – or John Lennon at this age – if they hadn’t been cut down early.Where does your energy and drive come from at this age?MainerfromDCI am so proud to have lasted this long because so many of our friends suffered from poor health, or their lives were shortened by accidents or suicide or drug addiction. I’m so grateful for my 38 years of sobriety – knock on wood, one day at a time – which is probably why I’m still here just in terms of perspective, emotionally and spiritually. But also getting enough sleep and getting some exercise: I do yoga and weights with a girlfriend on FaceTime three times a week, no matter where I am. And as the world situation is so stressful and so upsetting, I don’t know what I would do if it wasn’t for being able to get out into nature and hike and be with the fellowship of my people that feel like I do about the world.Bonnie Raitt’s UK and Ireland tour begins 1 June, Ulster Hall, BelfastExplore more on these topicsBonnie RaittThe reader interviewBluesPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They had “determined there are grounds for further investigation into potential offences linked to both videos”, officers said.Scotland Yard added: “The investigation is now being carried out by officers from the Met’s counter-terrorism command.”The Irish language group have been the focus of heavy criticism over the two video clips in recent days. Ministers have put pressure on the organisers of the Glastonbury festival over the group’s inclusion on the lineup, while a gig at the Eden Project and three concerts in Germanyhave been cancelled.On Thursday, a message on the Plymouth Pavilions website said Kneecap’s concert would no longer go ahead due to safety concerns.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, has demanded the trio be banned from Glastonbury, with politicians from the governing and opposition parties highlighting the danger already faced by MPs after the murders of their colleagues Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.The video footage appeared to show a member of the group saying at a 2023 gig: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” Footage from another date last year appeared to show one of the band shouting: “Up Hamas, up Hezbollah” – groups that are banned and defined as terrorist organisations in the UK.However, in a joint statement also signed by other artists including the former BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac and the bandsMassive Attackand the Pogues, the group said there had been a “clear, concerted attempt to censor and ultimately deplatform” Kneecap.“As artists, we feel the need to register our opposition to any political repression of artistic freedom,” they said.“In a democracy, no political figures or political parties should have the right to dictate who does and does not play at music festivals or gigs that will be enjoyed by thousands of people.”The tale of the Northern Irish rap group, the Tories – and the sinister censoring of ‘anti-British’ art | Anna CafollaRead moreMassive Attack also put out their own statement, adding: “Language matters, of course. The hideous murders of elected politicians Jo Cox and David Amess means there’s no scope for flippancy or recklessness.”It said politicians were “strategically concocting moral outrage over the stage utterings of a young punk band”, adding: “Kneecap are not the story. Gaza is the story. Genocide is the story. And the silence, acquiescence and support of those crimes against humanity by the elected British government is the real story.”Kneecap have been outspoken on political issues, including British colonialism in Ireland and the Gaza war.They are not the first band to come under political and judicial pressure over their material. In 2015, the US rapper Tyler, the Creator was banned from the UK because of lyrics from a 2009 release. In the mid-1970s, many shops refused to stock records by the Sex Pistols over their content, while prosecutors unsuccessfully went after a record shop manager in Nottingham for displaying the band’s artwork – subjecting him to a trial under obscenity laws.In response to the latest furore, Kneecap have sought to defend themselves, apologising to the families of Amess, the Conservative MP murdered in 2021, and Cox, the Labour MP killed in 2016. They said they “never intended to cause you hurt”, and that they “reject any suggestion that we would seek to incite violence against any MP or individual”.The group said: “Kneecap’s message has always been – and remains – one of love, inclusion, and hope. This is why our music resonates across generations, countries, classes and cultures and has brought hundreds of thousands of people to our gigs. No smear campaign will change that.”They added they had “never supported” Hamas or Hezbollah.Families of both MPs have suggested the band’s apology was less genuine than they had hoped.Katie Amess, the daughter of the murdered MP for Southend West, said it would be “very dangerous” for Kneecap to perform at Glastonbury. Brendan Cox, the husband of Jo, called the statement“half an apology”.He said: “It’s fine to say that you’re sorry for it, but the way that they have actually spoken about it is to suggest that it’s a conspiracy, that they have been targeted unfairly, and for me, that then doesn’t come across as unfortunately particularly genuine.”Explore more on these topicsKneecapFreedom of speechMusic festivalsHouse of CommonsAnnie MacPulpPaul WellernewsShareReuse this content"

Aside from the standard configuration of artist and model, there is the double portrait, the group portrait, the self-portrait and so on. But one other strand habitually draws freely on all the others to create its own unique sub-subgenre: when artists are the subject of another artist’s work.Artists painting other artists has a long and distinguished tradition: see Raphael including Leonardo and Michelangelo – and a self-portrait – in his Renaissance crowd scene masterpiece The School of Athens. This unique dynamic has remained a source of fascination for both artists and viewers ever since.“All portraits can say something about personality and the way people represent themselves, the way they are represented and even something wider about the human condition,” says Melanie Vandenbrouck, chief curator of the Pallant House Gallery in Chichester. “But what is particularly intriguing about portraits of artists by other artists is that you have two peers looking at each other with affection, love, respect, rivalry and so much more that is not usually present in a standard commission relationship. It inevitably also adds to a heightened sense of collaboration.”View image in fullscreenChantal Joffe’s Studio, 2025.Photograph: Jack Hems/courtesy the artist and Victoria MiroVandenbrouck has curated Seeing Each Other: Portraits of Artists, which features more than 150 works by more than 80 artists to tell a story of how artists working in Britain have portrayed each other from 1900 to the present day. The attractions for one artist to depict another are hugely varied, but at the outset of a career it is often proximity and cost that play their part. Your friends or fellow art students are not only close at hand – they also charge less than a model. This sense of intimacy and kinship continues whether it is an artist depicting spouses, lovers or members of the same groups.As well as the art-school networks, the exhibition runs from Walter Sickert’s pre-first world war Fitzroy Street group through the Bloomsburys, the Newlyn School in Cornwall, the School of London, the 1980s BLK Art Group of young Black artists to the YBAs and beyond. These works rarely emerge from commission and so reveal a lot about the artists: who their friends are, and maybe their foes; how they position themselves within the art scene. They can be seen as much as self-portraiture as portraiture. They also reflect the wider histories of the times, great global upheavals of world wars and economic booms and busts, but also profound societal change at the personal level.“Roger Fry’s 1917 portrait of his then lover Nina Hamnett might look fairly conventional today,” says Vandenbrouck. “But her loose clothes – no corsets – her relaxed pose, and the interior around her all placed her as a quintessential female bohemian artist flouting conventions. Michael Andrews’s 1962 study of the Colony Room features distinct and identifiable figures – Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, photographer John Deakin and more – but we see them in terms of wider relationships within a particular milieu.”Seeing Each Other features photography, sculpture and installations – Lubaina Himid’s lifesize wooden cutouts – as well as painting. There is also newly commissioned work byChantal Joffeand Ishbel Myerscough, who met at Glasgow School of Art in 1987 and have been painting one another ever since. “As well as portraying each other and their families, they have a strong friendship, live near each other [and] shared life milestones such as having children around the same time. All that comes across in their work,” says Vandenbrouck. “Something really remarkable happens when artists cast their gaze at each other.”Fellow period: five works from the exhibitionView image in fullscreenMichael Andrews, The Colony Room, 1962.Photograph: Barney Hindle/The Estate of The Artist/TateMichael Andrews’s Colony Room, 1962 (main image)Andrews’s depiction of the Soho drinking club with its starry bohemian clientele shows how a space can encapsulate a sense of effervescence conjured by smoke, alcohol and the conversation between creative peers.Ishbel Myerscough’s Two Painters, 2025; Chantal Joffe’s Studio, 2025 (main image)These two works are the latest iterations of Joffe and Myerscough’s decades-long study of each other. Whether through Myerscough’s meticulous attention to detail or Joffe’s broad gestures, they both produce remarkably candid and affecting studies of a friendship in which they can truly be themselves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Ahead of UK dates, he explains why two prosthetic hips aren’t slowing him downThu 1 May 2025 04.45 EDTLast modified on Thu 1 May 2025 04.50 EDTShareBilly Cobham speaks the way he plays drums. Words pour out of him in a great, rhythmic rush, every sentence alive with energy and ideas – and so interviewing him can be as overwhelming as his music sounds. I ask about a recent sojourn to his birth nation of Panama and he’s still answering 15 minutes later, although the topic now is a huge 1973 concert at Yankee Stadium in New York where he played alongside salsa legends Fania All-Stars to 40,000 fans: “All the nations had their flags – and all the gangs were there too!” Cobham describes watching in awe as the greatestconguerosalive all played in unison before the frenzied crowd invaded the stage. It’s fascinating, though I begin to fear our allotted time will be taken up by this single sprawling anecdote. “Don’t get me started,” he says, and laughs, kicking back in his book-lined office in Berne, Switzerland.William Cobham Jr is one of history’s greatest drummers, who, alongsideMiles Davisand John McLaughlin helped fuse jazz with rock and funk (he co-founded Mahavishnu Orchestra with the latter). Cobham became an influence on everything from Prince to prog, and has also backed icons across a huge spectrum of music – jazz greats such as Miles Davis and Sonny Rollins but also James Brown, Roberta Flack, Peter Gabriel and more. At 80, he’s just been given a lifetime achievement award at the Jazz FM awards but is still a dynamic, muscular bandleader, with UK gigs coming up at Cheltenham jazz festival and Ronnie Scott’s. “The first time I came to Great Britain was in 1968 with Horace Silver,” he says, “and you know where we played? Ronnie Scott’s!”He was already in his mid-20s by that point: born in Colón, Panama, he moved to New York City aged three. “From tropical heat to a blizzard,” he says, “that’s my experience of landing in Harlem.” He started playing drums aged four, then accompanying his pianist father aged eight. He avoided being drafted to Vietnam in the 1960s by signing up to play in a military band. Once civilian life resumed, he began playing with Silver as well as George Benson, remarkable apprenticeships, he says. “I was hungry to learn and Horace and George were such experienced band leaders and consummate professionals. I was young and naive then. I took every session I was offered, did whatever work came my way.”View image in fullscreenBilly Cobham in 1975.Photograph: Gijsbert Hanekroot/AlamyHe was asked to audition for Hugh Masekela, but Cobham was not aware of the South African star’s fame. “I heard his band rehearsing and they sounded good. I was young and cocky so I said to Hugh: ‘Hey, I can get us some weddings, barmitzvahs …’ I had no idea he’d just scored a huge hit with Grazing in the Grass. He called me into his office and told me a bit about himself. He had fired me before he hired me!” Cobham chuckles. “I learned from everyone I worked with and if, after playing with someone, the phone didn’t ring, then I had to learn why, what I’d played or said wrong. And learning never stops – I’m still learning today.”Although now, I counter, no one can fire you. “Yeah. But me being band leader isn’t about me telling everyone what to play. No – music’s a sharing thing, a listening thing, and if I mess up I’d expect the musicians I work with to point it out.”Cobham’s big break came in 1970 when Miles Davis called him to play on the sessions for the Jack Johnson album. The resulting record is, arguably, the most fierce music Davis ever recorded and stands as a pinnacle of jazz rock.“We knew we were recording music to serve as the soundtrack to a film, but what we rehearsed and then what we recorded turned out completely different,” he says. “We’re in the studio and Miles is in the control room and John McLaughlin starts messing around on his guitar and I come in then –whomp!– bassist Michael Henderson hits us with this heavy groove. Miles rushes out of the control room and admonishes us in that gravelly voice of his: ‘I told you not to play between takes!’ But John just can’t stop. And so we’re at it again, and then Miles runs into the studio with his horn and shouts ‘hit the record button,’ and we were recording. We wrapped that album up by midday. Said everything that needed to be said. Sometimes making music is like that.”Davis, he says, “didn’t say a lot as band leader. But what I did learn from him was to listen to what everyone is playing and adapt. Once we were playing My Funny Valentine and Herbie Hancock played a wrong chord, but Miles liked it and took the music that way.Jazzisn’t about perfection.”McLaughlin and Cobham subsequently left Davis to form the Mahavishnu Orchestra. Their 1971 album The Inner Mounting Flame endeared them to rock audiences, but they splintered after disagreements over royalties and more. Atlantic offered Cobham a solo deal, beginning with 1973’s Spectrum, on which Cobham, assisted by guitarist Tommy Bolin, keyboardist Jan Hammer and bassist Leland Sklar, set the tone for much fusion and jazz-funk with his huge drum sound. It went to No 1 in the US jazz chart and made inroads on the R&B and rock charts. “I’m pleased that people still like Spectrum,” he says, “but I’ve done so much after that. Some people seem to think that’s the only album I made.”Its popularity endured for decades: Massive Attack’s debut album Blue Lines opens with the pulsing bass and drums from Spectrum track Stratus. “I love it that people want to sample my music, to put their own touch, their own twist, on it,” he says. “If I can pass you the groove then I’m happy to do so, because it’s not just mine, it’s everybody’s.” The royalties are appreciated, too: “I have to put food on plates.”Cobham’s broad catalogue has been sampled more than 200 times, thanks to it covering plenty of terrain – from slick jazz funk to yet more diverse collaborations, with the Grateful Dead, Quincy Jones, Chaka Khan, or theson cubanoband Asere. “I like to keep things fresh and work with new people,” he says. “I recently approached Bruno Mars’ drummer as I think he’s doing some really interesting things. He’s not got back to me; so be it. I can see he might think I’m a bit far out.”View image in fullscreenBilly Cobham performing in 2024.Photograph: Sergione Infuso/Corbis/Getty ImagesLast year, London jazz festival celebrated Cobham’s 80th birthday with a concert where Guy Barker’s Big Band and the BBC Concert Orchestra joined his quartet on stage: 80 musicians making Cobham’s music sound appropriately epic. “That was a challenge,” he says. “When you’re playing something like that you have to consider the weakest instrument – in this case, the violin – and ensure you can hear them and that you are all in sync with one another.”Encounters like this have made Cobham a more subtle musician than when he put the big beat into fusion – not that this should suggest he’s losing his impact, he says. “I’ve got two prosthetic hips so I’m having to learn how to do everything again – how to step into a car after a lifetime of taking it for granted! But it’s not affected my drumming. My hands and feet are in fine shape. I’m ready to play.”Billy Cobham playsCheltenham jazz festivalon 3 May, and with the Guy Barker Big Band atRonnie Scott’s, London, 11-14 JuneExplore more on these topicsJazzMiles DavisPop and rockExperimental musicinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But when I began to look closely at her, I discovered many oddities.”She believes that Pym’s keen eye for detail was utilised for coded messages and secret writing in otherwise normal-seeming correspondence, becoming one of a group of female examiners who received special training.Smith, who worked in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for 27 years and is the only female diplomat to have negotiated with the Taliban, said: “They were the ones looking for the micro dots, the secret writing, the messages concealed in ordinary letters. And because Pym was a writer, she would have noted odd ways of constructing sentences. She’d have been extremely valuable.”Dame Jilly Cooper described Pym as the author who “brought me more happiness and gentle laughter than any other writer”. But before she became feted for works such as Excellent Women and A Glass of Blessings, Pym spent the prewar era looking for a job in publishing.Instead she became a censor in 1941, ostensibly charged with checking private correspondence between Irish families in Britain and Ireland.“I thought it very odd that an Oxford graduate who speaks German and is already writing should really only be looking at letters between Irish families,” Smith said.Pym made several trips to Germany in the 1930s, and even had a relationship with a young Nazi officer.The research, British Naval Censorship in World War II: A Neglected Intelligence Function, is being published with the support of the Barbara Pym Society. It coincides with the commemoration of Pym’s home in Pimlico, London, with a blue plaque by English Heritage.Within Pym’s notebooks and diaries, which are housed in the University of Oxford’s Bodleian Library, Smith discovered that she had written about learning code when she was an examiner and how she even made a submission to MI5.Smith said: “If you’re just reading everybody’s letters to strike out forbidden parts, why would you be learning code?”And Pym’s time as a postal censor in the Women’s Royal Naval Service (nicknamed the Wrens) also holds key clues to a hidden past.She was fast-tracked for promotion and became a naval censor in Southampton when the admiralty was preparing for D-day, before seeing out the rest of the war in Naples.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s quite different from the box numbers that naval personnel used.“But on the back of one of her letters that was going outside the UK, Pym – in her own handwriting – wrote her initials, [naval land base] HMS Mastodon, and Box 500.”The blue plaque will be placed at 108 Cambridge Street in Pimlico. The English Heritage historian Susan Skedd called it “a real pleasure to honour Barbara Pym where she found so much rich material”.Devon Allison, the chair of the Barbara Pym Society, said: “Barbara Pym was a writer of genius – brave, kind, intelligent, brilliantly funny and endlessly re-readable.”The historian Lucy Worsley said: “This blue plaque celebrates her significant contribution to British literature and her ability to find the extraordinary in the ordinary.”One final piece of the puzzle Smith stumbled upon was that after Pym died, her literary executor was “at great pains to say one piece of work, the comic spy thriller So Very Secret, wasn’t successful because Pym didn’t know any spies”.“I thought: why mention that at all?,” Smith said.Explore more on these topicsBooksMI5Second world warnewsShareReuse this content"

One of the best ways to accomplish this is by sharing the stories of who we are, reflected from our personal lives and experiences.“It helps us understand and value how each of us sees the world. It was important to Pope Francis for people across the globe to exchange ideas with respect while also preserving their cultural identity, and cinema is the best medium to do that.”Scorsese met numerous times with Pope Francis over the years, and their conversations sometimes informed work undertaken by the 82-year-old film-maker of The Last Temptation of Christ and Silence.When Francis died on 21 April, Scorsese remembered him as“in every way, a remarkable human being”.“He acknowledged his own failings,” he said. “He radiated wisdom. He radiated goodness. He had an ironclad commitment to the good.“He knew in his soul that ignorance was a terrible plague on humanity. So he never stopped learning. And he never stopped enlightening. And, he embraced, preached and practiced forgiveness. Universal and constant forgiveness.”He added: “The loss for me runs deep – I was lucky enough to know him, and I will miss his presence and his warmth. The loss for the world is immense. But he left a light behind, and it can never be extinguished.”Aconclave to elect a new popeis scheduled to begin on 7 May.Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsMartin ScorsesePope FrancisCatholicismChristianityReligionThe papacyDocumentary filmsnewsShareReuse this content"

I had a moment of the presentation that was like, ‘problematic Asian representation!’”Ganatra was referring to a pivotal scene in Freaky Friday, in which stars Jamie Lee Curtis andLindsay Lohan, playing a mother and daughter, read the messages in a pair of magical fortune cookies in a Chinese restaurant which then triggers their body swap. (This is not a scene that appears in either the original 1972 novel, written by Mary Rodgers or the 1976 film adaptation starring Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris.)Freakier Friday, written by Jordan Weiss, has dropped a repeat of the Chinese restaurant scene, given Rosalind Chao and Lucille Soong, the actors who appeared in the 2003 scene, cameo appearances, and, according to Ganatra, provides “little moments that don’t betray this movie, but were satisfying for people who found hurtful moments in the last one”.The Philippines-born Canadian actor Manny Jacinto, who plays Lohan’s fiance in Freakier Friday, also expressed concerns about the earlier film, saying: “I remember watching the first Freaky Friday and being like, this did not age very well, regarding the diverse characters.”Jacinto added: “Knowing Nisha and speaking to other people within our circles, I knew we had a captain who was very much aware of those archetypes, or those issues presented in the first one.”Ganatra said: “It was a different time and wasn’t done intentionally [in the 2003 film], but it’s a real thing. It’s something I, being Asian, was super conscious of.”Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsLindsay LohanRaceComedynewsShareReuse this content"

Collectors have paid more than £400,000 for his paintings, while his auction record is about £240,000, the price reached in 2023 at Christie’s London forThe Magic is in You, a shimmering abstract painting that recalls Monet’s Nymphéas.View image in fullscreenOne of the paintings by Branch that was lost for decades.Photograph: Courtesy Galerie Volker Diehl, Berlin.Branch was distraught after his early figurative paintings disappeared from a warehouse studio that he had rented in Berlin aged 28. Travelling frequently to New York, after being offered a Guggenheim Fellowship in the late 1970s, he had returned to Germany to find that his entire studio had been emptied.His paintings and personal effects had been removed without any warning – all because he had not paid two months’ rent, he later discovered. He told the Guardian: “The owners of the building … wouldn’t speak any English and my German was not the best at that time.“They were very rude and arrogant. If they’d given me […] time, I would have resolved the problem, but they were very brutal … I didn’t pay my rent, unfortunately, because I was living from hand to mouth.“If my lawyer was competent, I could have fought it in the court, because you cannot enter into a building without giving the tenant notice. It was a difficult moment in my life.”Unable to track down the paintings, he had given up all hope of seeing them again: “I felt my whole life was gone.”The works have now surfaced after the German owner decided to sell them through Galerie Volker Diehl in Berlin, which in turn contacted Branch. The artist has now learned that the paintings had been sold in Berlin by the studio’s landlord to an architect, who bought them in good faith, taking them to his home in Greece.View image in fullscreenWinston Branch’s early figurative works ‘provide a window into the evolution of his painting’.Photograph: Courtesy Galerie Volker Diehl, Berlin.While the missing pictures are figurative, Branch is best known for abstracts inspired by nature, explorations of light and colour that evoke subjects such as gardens in bloom.Roza said: “Winston is known all over the world for tempestuous abstract works that unfold like visual poetry, but these … early figurative works provide a window into the evolution of his painting.”The recovered paintings needed some repair and Branch has worked on their restoration. This September, they will be displayed for the first time at Galerie Volker Diehl.As early works, they are priced between £95,000 and £150,000. Branch will get a percentage of the sales, avoiding a “long legal battle” over the ownership, he said, although he had been initially dismayed because he felt that the works belonged to him, Roza said.He decided to buy one painting for himself: “That’s the painting that I really wanted … because the woman in [it is] the mother of my second daughter.“I painted her first with her clothes on and secondly without her clothes on. I was testing my ability to have real descriptiveness in painting.”A symbolic price of €10,000 was agreed, far lower than its market value, as he understood that the owner had to be compensated, he said. He will hang it in his London studio when it arrives from Berlin.Volker Diehl, a Germany gallery owner, described the paintings as “absolutely stunning”.Explore more on these topicsArtnewsShareReuse this content"

He will play one of the four men sharing stories in a remote Irish pub with a woman who has newly arrived in the area.The Weir will run first at the Olympia theatre in Dublin from 8 August to 6 September and then at London’s Harold Pinter theatre from 12 September to 6 December. Gleeson performed at the Olympia theatre at the start of his career and his last stage appearance was in its 2015 production of the family dramaThe Walworth Face, appearing alongside his sons Domhnall and Brian. “I can’t wait to be back there, and then to play in the West End for the first time, at the beautiful Pinter theatre,” said Gleeson, who called The Weir “one of the rarest plays around”. Further casting is yet to be announced.View image in fullscreen‘A beautiful play about human connection’ … Brendan Coyle and Jim Norton (right) in the original production of The Weir at the Royal Court in 1997.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianMcPherson has a busy year ahead. His new play,The Brightening Air, has just opened at the Old Vic which is reviving the 2017 Bob Dylan musicalGirl from the North Country, which he wrote and directed, this summer. In October, his adaptation ofThe Hunger Games, based on Suzanne Collins’ bestselling 2008 novel and the 2012 film, will open at a new theatre in London’s Canary Wharf.“I can hardly believe it’s 30 years since I wrote The Weir – and about 30 years since I first met the wonderfulBrendan Gleeson,” said McPherson. “It’s an absolute honour to bring this play to life again with one of the great titans of Irish acting.” The Weir’s co-producer Kate Horton described it as “a beautiful play about human connection, the endurance of hope and the essential power of storytelling”.The Weir was staged at the small upstairs theatre at the Royal Court in London in 1997, with Jim Norton – a McPherson regular – in the role of local garage owner Jack, the part Gleeson will now play. Reviewing the 1997 production, Michael Billington called The Weir “a spellbinder that transfixes you like the Ancient Mariner’s tale”. McPherson’s play, he wrote, “is much more than a series of hair-raising ghost stories. It offers, in a little over 90 minutes, an extraordinarily rich picture of Irish rural life.” That production moved downstairs to the main Royal Court stage in 1998. The play was revivedat the Donmar Warehouse in 2013with a cast including Brian Cox as Jack.Explore more on these topicsTheatreBrendan GleesonConor McPhersonWest EndnewsShareReuse this content"

The repatriation of a fictional 12th-century statue of a Chinese deity, carved in stone, forms the central dispute in Singaporean Joel Tan’s play.The Bodhisattva Guanyin reclines in the “royal ease” pose at one end of a traverse stage, designed by TK Hay, with a combination of screens and mirrors. The drama is formed of 12 distinct scenes, loosely connected around the statue. It begins choppily inside theBritish Museumwith patronising or incendiary debate by protesters and curators, sometimes set beside flashes of 19th-century imperial history. The tone switches from serious-minded to satirical to gnomic.But its disparate parts coalesce and gather intellectual complexity as well as dramatic intensity, all enacted with zest by a six-strong cast: Kaja Chan, Aidan Cheng, Jon Chew, Fiona Hampton, Robin Khor Yong Kuan and Sky Yang. There is playful yet disciplined direction by experimentalists emma + pj, with actors using the auditorium in original yet unmessy ways.We travel from protests in London, inside and outside the museum, to a Chinese detention centre, Shanghai Pudong airport and a splashy Beijing party thrown by the industrialist who secures the return of the statue.View image in fullscreenInnovative … Kaja Chan in Scenes from a Repatriation.Photograph: Alex BrennerAn overseas Chinese student protester confronting his British tutor opens up ideas on identity, covert racism and art – a statue can be in exile like a refugee, says the student. A Chinese official interrogating a cartoonist offers new dimensions to cultural appropriation and artistic protest. The Beijing party brings troubling patriotism and anti-western contempt that intersects with shocking misogyny. These scenes are relatively brief but contain real depth of thought. Neither are they bluntly polemical but wrapped within character and incident.“All of human history is basically people taking things from each other,” someone says. It does not seem to be an argument for leaving, for example, the Parthenon marbles in the British Museum, but the play cleverly muddies the idea of provenance and ownership. A character states that the Bodhisattva Guanyin is not even a Chinese figure but is in fact Indian.The play’s various scenarios complicate the debate and lay bare the politics of repatriation. The Chinese magnate who virtually bribes the museum into returning the statue places it in Shanghai’s airport so that the deity is turned into a symbol of power – and the rise and fall of empires.The Bodhisattva herself presides over all of it, watching over centuries of history, but the statue remains wrapped throughout. This obfuscation is puzzling – yet another one of the play’s interesting ideas. This is innovative theatre, shining with intelligence, which brings richness to our cultural tussle with the problem of ancient statues and their rightful place in the world.At theRoyal Court theatre, London, until 24 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Court theatreBritish MuseumMuseumsHeritagereviewsShareReuse this content"

Hutchinsdied in a horrific accidenton theset of the movie Rust, when a prop gun,improperly checkedbefore it was given to star and producerAlec Baldwin, shot a real bullet – prompting the reasonable question of whether the movie itself should ever be finished and see the light of day. Regardless of the moral quandary, the movie is here, primarily showcasing how good Hutchins was at her job. The first few minutes of Rust quickly accumulates half a dozen gorgeous images in establishing shots, and remains great-looking throughout – visually worthy, at least, of moments that imitate famous shots from classics of the genre like The Searchers and the True Grit remake. (If Hutchins worked on about half of the movie, it seems to have been finished following her visual lead.)‘I wish I’d never written that damn movie’: Rust director Joel Souza on finishing his film after the fatal on-set shootingRead moreIt’s not unusual for a contemporary-made western to work primarily in dusty browns, beiges and blacks in depicting the past (in this case, the Wyoming of 1882), but this movie’s dark tones have impressive richness; much of the imagery looks as if it’s been painted in deep-black shadows. It’s not just silhouettes on magic-hour landscapes that show off Hutchins’ obvious talent, either; in an early prison-break scene, a rescuer emerges from darkness, and the camera slowly pans over to the dead body of a lawman, as if in fearful apprehension.The prisoner in the spooky breakout scene is Lucas Hollister (Patrick Scott McDermott), a boy not older than 14 or so who has been convicted of murder and sentenced to hang. The already-severe punishment is even worse given his circumstances; he’s been acting as the head of his small household, caring for his younger brother, and the killing happened in process of defending them from a grown man attempting to exact punishment for a scuffle with his own son. Lucas’s rescuer is Rust (Baldwin), who turns out to be the grandfather he never knew he had. A hard-bitten outlaw, Rust informs the boy that he will be brought down to Mexico whether Lucas wants this or not. So begins a protracted pursuit, as a bounty is placed on Rust and his grandson and, naturally, the two grow closer during their journey.Besides the cinematography, the main revelation of Rust is that Baldwin is apparently one of those actors who has been yearning to do an old-fashioned western; he even has a shared story credit here, in addition to his starring and producing roles. This desire seems common among performers of a certain age, especially in a post-Yellowstoneera; Nicolas Cagehasdonethree such lower-profile western pictures in the past few years. Baldwin, however, has apparently persisted beyond his ability to convincingly play a grizzled-loner role; even with a more urbane character backstory (and despite Baldwin’s history of gruffness, on and off screen), his Rust feels too refined and simply not interestingly enigmatic or dangerous enough to carry the film. The emergence of his grandfatherly care is never really in doubt.‘A cascade of terrible things’: documentary pieces together Rust shooting tragedyRead moreThough these scenes between Lucas and Rust are not especially well-acted, they at least have a basic rooting interest. The rest of the movie, which runs an inexplicable 140 minutes with credits, overflows with supporting characters reciting drawn-out dialogue. Despite the efforts to render all of this as colorful, the lawmen, bounty hunters and various scofflaws are difficult to differentiate; this is a movie in desperate need of some recognizable character actors. The fact is, the discomfiting sight of Baldwin firing off pistols during the obligatory gunfight climax (after which the movie continues for a truly stretched-out denouement) isn’t really worth the long sit; it makes Rust feel ghoulish in addition to dull. In an equally uncomfortable paradox, Halyna Hutchins is the movie’s saving grace. Without her work, it wouldn’t be worth a look at all.Rust is out in US cinemas and to rent digitally on 2 May with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsAlec BaldwinRust film set shootingWesternsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In an era when rock music largely leans towards familiarity – where originality has essentially come to mean rearranging recognisable sounds from the past in a relatively fresh way – here was a band who genuinely didn’t seem to sound much like anyone else.The Brooklyn quartet had released a handful of noisy singles pre-Covid, which attracted vague comparisons to the notoriously challenging clangour of the late 70sno wave movementor the frenetic dance-punk of Liars, an outlier band on the far left field of the early 00s New York scene that gave the world the Strokes and theYeah Yeah Yeahs. But on Dogsbody they honed their sound into something entirely their own.Largely cultivated during lockdown, it was a style in which, as bass player Aaron Shapiro put it, “everything is a drum”: each instrument was mined for for its percussive capacity, including the guitar, which emitted blasts of sculptured noise, impressively controlled shrieks of feedback and eerie harmonic tones, but never anything resembling a melody.View image in fullscreenModel/Actriz: Pirouette.Their sound was hugely exciting and less confrontational than you might expect something so lacking in obvious melody to be, perhaps because it was incredibly tight – there were moments when you could easily have been listening to a loop rather than a band – and writhingly propulsive. If you were desperate for a comparison, you might have detected in its rhythms the faint ghosts of disco or the more dancefloor-focused end of industrial music, or even the ascetic techno of Surgeon and Regis. But Dogsbody didn’t really sound like any of them, even before you got to the vocals of Cole Haden, a succession of theatrical snarls, howls and whines that delivered visceral lyrics about sex and queer desire. Splendidly, he claimed that his biggest influence was Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical Cats.Perhaps there’s something similarly knowing about Haden’s claim that Dogsbody’s follow-up was inspired by Mariah Carey, Kylie Minogue and Janet Jackson. But if their precise impact on Pirouette is hard to detect, evidence of an unexpectedly poppier approach is not. The music often remains as taut, propulsive and atonal as before. The rhythm of Audience initially feels punishing and sweat-spattered, but it’s positively laid-back next to the distorted jackhammer of next track, Ring Road. The collection of noises Jack Wetmore wrests from his guitar during Cinderella is hugely impressive, as is the way each one seems to ratchet the song’s sense of tension a little further.Even the noisiest moments are, however, leavened by melody, usually courtesy of Haden. He suddenly seems to have a surfeit of nagging tunes at his disposal. On the opener, Vespers, he uses his voice in a manner similar to that of a singer on a dance track, colouring a relentless groove with a top line.Model/Actriz: Cinderella – videoThe album largely thrives on thrilling contrasts: between the band’s tendency to cacophony and the taut control with which they play; between the sweetness of the tunes and the pummelling din behind them. Haden’s vocals somehow feel intimate and understated, even when he slips into a falsetto, yet there’s a cocktail of emotional intensity and campy floridity in the lyrics: “I’m such a fucking bitch, girl, you don’t even know,” he purrs on Diva. “Just imagine me absolutely soaked, dripping head to toe in Prada Sport.”Occasionally, the album takes a completely different approach: Acid Rain and the closing Baton are straightforwardly beautiful. The former deploys a fingerpicked guitar figure that’s as pretty as the vocal, briefly collapsing into abstraction but gathering itself before the conclusion. The latter sets Haden’s lyrics about a long-term relationship to musical textures that are still distorted, but feel less aggressive than hazy and melancholy: they build in intensity, then die away.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

You would struggle to describe its take on pop music as commercial when faced with something as overwhelming as Ring Road, but it’s certainly more approachable than Dogsbody, an album you almost had to brace yourself to listen to. At any rate, if their debut was the kind of thing from which rabid cult followings are made, its successor is the kind of thing from which bigger cult followings are made. Far more importantly, it offers an object lesson in embracing a broader musical palette without sacrificing any of your uniqueness: Model/Actriz still don’t really sound like anything else.This week Alexis listened toSault – ILTSAs usual, Sault’s 12th (!) album, 10, arrived without warning: two weeks on, ILTS’s delightful horn-infused, heavy-lidded groove sounds like the pick of its 10 tracks.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekExperimental musicPunkPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Elgar himself thought highly of The Kingdom, calling it “the best of me”, and though it has never achieved the popularity of The Dream of Gerontius, some Elgarians have agreed with him, claiming it as the greatest of his oratorios, with its orchestral writing in particular seen as far superior. Yet where Gerontius has operatic roots, which give it a compelling dramatic intensity, The Kingdom seems to be wedded too much to the Victorian oratorio, which for all its incidental highpoints makes it inert and uninvolving.View image in fullscreenElgar: The KingdomThat lack of popularity is reflected in the scarcity of recordings. This performance, conducted by David Temple and recorded in the newly restored Victorian theatre at Alexandra Palace in London, seems to be only the fourth of the complete work currently available. Temple is clearly a huge admirer of the score – “a gem from first note to last”, he calls it – and that admiration shines through his performance with the excellent Crouch End Festival Chorus and a fine quartet of soloists. But to my ears at least it lacks immediacy and, alongside the existing versions – conducted by Adrian Boult, Richard Hickox and Mark Elder, it never quite matches up, for all its good intentions.Listen on Apple music:Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

Saint Maria Goretti was stabbed more than a dozen times while resisting a rape. Saint Dymphna of Ireland refused to share her father’s bed and was beheaded for her filial disobedience. Saint Agnes of Rome, the patron saint of Girl Scouts, was set alight after rejecting an offer of marriage. When the flames did not claim her – she was too pure-hearted to burn – Agnes’s throat was cut. Her sister was stoned to death for good measure – punished for her grief.These are inspirational stories, we are told. Tales of triumphant innocence. They are also acts of obliteration. Snuffed lights. Maria was 11 years old when she was murdered. Dymphna was 15; Agnes 12. What would happen if these brutalised children were mourned? What if their lives were worth more than their miracles? How might we dare to tell those stories? What kind of prayers might we offer to the dark?The Sun Was Electric Light by Rachel Morton review – a clever novel about searching for belongingRead moreThese are the questions Josephine Rowe asks in her new book. Orseemsto ask. Little World is the tale of a fledgling saint – “a kid in a box” – whose corpse is dispatched to a remote mining outpost in Western Australia as part of a cryptic bequest. The saint was once a daughter, a sister. She once had a name. Now she is a good luck charm – “a child-sized rabbit’s foot” – trussed-up in frills. And she knows it. The saint’s mind has retained a hazy kind of consciousness like “a lamp swung in the dark”. There are memories too, which rattle around in her incorruptible skull. She’s unfairly dead, oceans away from home, and trapped in a box. And she’s bloody annoyed.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWhat will Rowe do with all this stifled fury? Not much. The saint fumes away in her canoe-wood reliquary waiting for something nameless and unattainable; answers to questions she will never know how to ask. The years tick on. One custodian replaces another.The people who care for the saint are exactly the kind of folk who drift in and out of bush towns in lyrical Aussie novels. Reticent, resilient and heartsore. Beloved by stray dogs. They are bound to the dead child by solidarity, not faith – a kindred loneliness. Rowe traces this misfit bond for the better part of a century: from the postwar boom to the pandemic. But Little World is not a sweeping sociocultural epic; history seeps into this book like music from a distant radio.Little World is true to its title: it’s intricate, intimate and short (132 generously spaced pages). Arguably, a long short story. But that’s a tiresome argument to have. We all know that short fiction can pack a wallop, who cares what we call it. (In releasing Little World as a stand-alone volume, Rowe is being positioned as Australia’s answer toClaire Keegan.) The problem here isn’t size, it’s heft. This book feels hollow, as though the desert termites have been at it.There’s no question that Little World is beautiful. Rowe’s fiction has always been uncommonly gorgeous – the kind of gentle, contemplative prose-work that feels akin to prayer (see her 2021 short story collection, Here Until August). Here she writes of the “alluvial silt” of half-forgotten dreams; the “animal sentience” of warm rain; the “red earth acropolis” of termite mounds. And the “inner reliquary” of the soul, a description that holds for the book itself. Little World is a tiny treasure box.But if you’re going to stuff a kid into a box – even a treasure box – that kid deserves to be more than a gauzy metaphor. More than beatific cosplay. More than a cultural shorthand for male rage. More than a weary inevitability – a girl who’s hurt to prove that girls are hurt. Sadly, that’s precisely who Rowe’s saint becomes. Rowe only needs to hint at what has happened to the girl for us to fill in the rest. “Every woman who dies like that,” she writes, “has already dreamt her death.” How I long for a novel that dreams new dreams.I am also tired – so very tired – of tales of lost girls in the bush. Dreamy, beautiful ruin. There’s so much more to regional Australia than white lace and red dirt (not that you would know it from outback noir). The miracles in Little World are moments of grace in a savage world.

He has continued to add to the series, so that now there are well over 400 such pieces, for both solo piano and four hands, which have been published in 10 volumes so far. The pieces, rarely more than a couple of minutes long and sometimes lasting just a few seconds, were first intended as didactic exercises, designed to elucidate a musical point or a detail of keyboard technique, but the collection soon began to encompass other occasional works and more personal expressions – birthday greetings, tributes and memorials to friends and fellow musicians, paraphrases of other music – becoming a complete encyclopedia of Kurtág’s compositional methods.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

There are pieces that are fiercely expressionist, others that are sweetly lyrical, even sentimental, some whose music is as withdrawn and mysterious as the titles that Kurtág gives them, and others that are laugh-out-loud witty. Whole worlds of expression are encapsulated in just a few bars, and listening to Aimard’s exemplary performances provides as important an insight into Kurtág’s very personal musical thinking as any of his larger-scale, more “public” pieces. Játékok is one of the major achievements of the last half century, and Aimard is the perfect guide to it.Listen to the album on Apple musicAllow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

The war ended weeks after the US launched an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, killing 60,000 people in less than a minute. That bomb also led to Flanagan’s father, then days from death, being freed, which in turn allowed him to father a child who would grow up to become a writer. “How many people need to die in order that you might read this book?” Flanagan asks.Question 7, named after a riddle posed by Chekhov, is a book about the connections and choices that shape our lives, for better or worse. Flanagan is the narrator, his reading by turns mournful, reflective and quizzical as he plots a path through the lives of his parents, the writer HG Wells, Wells’s sometime inamorata, Rebecca West, and the physicist Leo Szilard, who masterminded the nuclear chain reaction that was instrumental in the creation of the bomb. These historical vignettes are intertwined with Flanagan’s own childhood memories of life in Tasmania, an island with a troubled history, and culminate in his account of a near-death experience at the age of 21, when his kayak became wedged underwater. As he assesses his own complex heritage and those of pivotal figures from the past, Flanagan reflects that “there is no memory without shame”.Available via Penguin Audio, 7hr 47minFurther listeningFreeAmanda Knox, Headline,10hr17minKnox narrates her memoir detailing her struggles to adapt to a normal life after her wrongful imprisonment in Italy.Our EveningsAlan Hollinghurst,Picador, 16hr36minThe Line of Beauty author’s latest novel about the diverging lives of two public schoolboys is read by Prasanna Puwanarajah.Explore more on these topicsBooksAudiobook of the weekRichard FlanaganAutobiography and memoirBiography booksreviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Ihave always longed to be a lighthouse keeper and now, at last, I am one. If only for the weekend. Look at my chunky-knit jumper! Feel the waterproof weave of my Donegal tweed cap! Truth be told, I am way too toasty in this quasi-nautical ensemble, having hoped and dressed for ominous fog, murderous gales and oceanic rainstorms. Instead, it is bright, calm and warm on an early spring afternoon in the famously pretty fishing village of Cudillero in Asturias, where the Costa Verde of northern Spain drops away into the deep blue Bay of Biscay.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Built in 1858, the local lighthouse – the Faro de Cudillero – stands on a shelf of rock just beyond the harbour, a short walk up stone steps and along a narrow cliff side service path. Its hexagonal beacon tower has been remodelled a few times over the years. The signal lamp inside was first fuelled by olive oil, then paraffin and petrol, before being electrified and eventually automated. With no further need for a human operator, its sturdy keeper’s cottage was left derelict decades ago. It’s sad to contemplate that absence, and the general obsolescence of the role itself. But if I can’t man the light, I can at least occupy the lighthouse.Cudillero, Spain locator mapThe keeper’s cottage has been bought, converted and partitioned into two loft-style holiday apartments by the German company Floatel, which specialises in this kind of repurposing. Staying for a couple of nights with my girlfriend and our six-year-old daughter in the Farero suite, I find the interior much plusher and airier than whatever salty quarters I might have imagined.The interior is much plusher and airier than the salty quarters I might have imaginedWe’ve got heated floors, a wood-burning stove, a fitted kitchenette, a nice, high ceiling, and a Nordic timber whirlpool bath with bench seats, big enough for all of us. Our priorities in proper order, we begin hot-tubbing without delay, while pretending to be a 19th-century lighthouse family mystified by modern luxuries.Large flanking windows look east and west to sunrise and sunset and, as the latter approaches, we go out to watch the lamp come on. The sky dims to indigo, a faint moon floats up over the tower, and visibility fades along the shoreline, tripping the sensors and flipping the switch. I expected a search beam to shoot from the lantern room and sweep the bay in whooshing gyres, but this light is programmed for a sequence of static flashes known as “occultations”. Put in Tolkienesque terms, it’s like an eye that opens for one long stare followed by three short blinks, repeating in cycles of 16 seconds. Or dash-dot-dot-dot, to represent the letter “B” in international morse code. It should really be “C” for Cudillero, but that letter was already taken by Candás, another coastal beacon about 30 miles due east.View image in fullscreenThe plush interior of the apartment was a welcome surprise.Photograph: Javir Parilla/FloatelI learn all this and more back inside by the fireplace, where the honesty bar is well stocked, and the bookshelves support a small library of lighthouse-related literature. Between novels by Virginia Woolf and Jules Verne are historical journals and photographic surveys that reference this site in particular. Progressing from tangy, cloudy Asturian cider to a decent mid-range Spanish red, I read how ancient mariners set signal fires more or less where I’m sitting, and may have lured a few ships in to wreck and plunder on these rocks.Since the lighthouse entered service, though, there’s no record of a major disaster, no defining loss of local menfolk in the unforgiving Cantabrian Sea. An Italian cargo vessel called the Amelia C (en route from Newcastle upon Tyne to Venice) sank just offshore in 1877, though it seems the lighthouse keeper mobilised the village for a rescue effort, and all aboard were duly saved.This makes for a consoling bedtime story. I’ve always been a twitchy insomniac, but now I discover the sublime and fathomless comfort that comes of drifting off beside your family in the belly of such a refuge, between the winking lantern and the sighing sea. So here we are asleep and dreaming in “lighthouse world”, as Floatel co-founder Tim Wittenbecher described it when I spoke to him on the phone.View image in fullscreenCudillero is renowned for high quality seafood.Photograph: Raul Garcia Herrera/Alamy“A lighthouse is the most purely positive structure we can think of,” Wittenbecher told me. “It has only good associations.” He discovered just how many people feel this way 20 years ago, when he and his wife turned a ruined beacon into a guest house on the Baltic Sea. Hundreds responded immediately to their first online ad, and their pet project became a business model. As Floatel, it has since entered public-private agreements to take over the empty lodgings of lighthouses in spots from Ischia in the Gulf of Naples to La Palma in the Canary Islands.“They are always in super-attractive positions, in dramatic, romantic and mostly quite abandoned areas,” said Wittenbecher. All broadly true of the Faro de Cudillero, though it’s not as far removed from civilisation as some others in his portfolio, and is close enough to the village that it once served double-duty as the local schoolhouse.Lighthouses only have good associations. They’re always in dramatic, romantic areasIt is also handy enough for the present housekeeper, Cristina, to bring us breakfast the next morning – a wicker basket full of pastries, yoghurt, juices, meats and cheeses. A single gull hovers at the window to watch us eat. “Clear off, you varmint,” says our daughter, shaking a fist and quoting one of her own favourite books, The Lighthouse Keeper’s Lunch.After breakfast, we wander around Cudillero itself, which forms a kind of amphitheatre in the tight arc of the adjoining cove, with steep vertical staircases and narrow lateral lane-ways stitched between tiers of brightly painted houses. Some have strips ofcuradillohung outside – dried sharkskin that’s been a totem around here since the days when fishers used the rough flesh to polish their boats, and ate it when they couldn’t catch much else.The seafood is still great in these parts. After walking near-deserted beaches at Playa del Silencio and Playa de San Pedro La Ribera, we ascend to lunch at the stone-built mountain innCabo Vidio,where the house special is a coastal variation on the region’s renowned bean stew,fabada asturiana, made with salt cod hauled from the cold waters below.View image in fullscreenThe writer’s family and family walked at Playa del Silencio.Photograph: Herraez/Getty ImagesCudillero fishmonger Manolo Fernández supplies every restaurant in the vicinity. “The quality of the produce is the same in each place,” Fernández assures me at his shop beside the port, while cleaning and gutting a hake. “The only difference is the chef.” He’s quick to laugh but also prone to lamentation. “This used to be a real seafaring village,” says Fernández. “I remember 230 boats out there; now we’re down to about 30.” This shop has been in his family for three generations and almost a century, “but me and my brother will be the last, I think”. As he cheerfully lists the reasons why – supermarkets, politics, overfishing, the climate crisis – it occurs to me that I’d forgotten all those worries while staying at the lighthouse. There it is above us, and ahead of us: salvation for sailors in trouble.We climb the path back to our perch, and watch our little girl sit cross-legged in a sunbeam on the windowsill, scanning the horizon for mermaids and orcas with the house binoculars. Some day, I’m thinking, this will be a bright spot in my memory – a signal light out of the distant past, flashing dash-dot-dot-dot. B for “beautiful”. B for “bygone”.Accommodation was provided byFloatel, which has two two-person apartments at the Cudillero Lighthouse from€190or€290a night B&B; the entire lighthouse sleeps four and can be rented from €480a night B&B (four nights for the price of three, seven nights for the price of five)Explore more on these topicsSpain holidaysCottagesFamily holidaysSelf-cateringEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This explains the shape, and why the word evolved to describe a slice of meat that has been pounded until it’s the same slimness all over.This week’s recipe is inspired by the restaurantBocca Di Lupoin Soho, which a few months ago, after a night at the theatre with my parents, was one of the few places still open and more than welcoming to walk-ins at 10.30pm. Sitting on the high stools at the end of the long, marble bar, Dad chose ravioli filled with ricotta and spinach, while Mum and I hadscaloppine di pollo al marsala e funghi(thin chicken escalope with mushrooms in a soft, slightly thickened marsala sauce). The meal and wine would have been superb in any circumstance, but the feeling of relief combined with the particular thick atmosphere that fills some restaurants at that point in the evening – charged with work and pleasure but starting to wind down – made this a particularly enjoyable meal.It’s one I have repeated several times since, following a recipe in a September 1983 edition of the magazineLa Cucina Italiana, which comes close to the plate we were served at Bocca Di Lupo. The process of pounding helps to tenderise the meat, but it also means that the cooking is relatively quick and even.A note about marsala, which is Sicilian fortified wine made from three grapes (grillo, catarratto and inzolia) and characterised by tumultuous fermentation and ageing in oak barrels. Like any fortified wine, marsala varies dramatically, but, broadly speaking, the most helpful categorisations relate to its sweetness:secco(dry),semisecco(semi-dry) ordolce(sweet). And its age:fine(aged for at least one year),superiore(aged for at least two years) andvergineorsoleras (aged for at least five years). Marsala’s rich praline and raisin flavour is central to today’s dish and brings everything together, so look out forsecco orsemiseccomarsalasuperiore, and enjoy a glass while you cook.Serve immediately, making sure every piece comes with enough mushrooms and some of the marsala gravy. Mashed or boiled potatoes are good here, as is green salad; bread, too.Chicken scaloppine with mushrooms and marsalaServes44 bonelessand skinless chicken breasts(each roughly 160g)100g flourseasoned with salt and pepperOlive oil60g butter2 shallots, peeled and diced300g mixed mushrooms, cleaned and thinly slicedSea salt and black pepper120mlmarsala75mlchicken stock2 tbsp minced parsleySlice each chicken breast in half horizontally, then place each piece between two sheets of clingfilm or greaseproof paper and use a rolling pin or meat mallet to bash the thickest part with an outward, stretching movement, so the whole thing widens into an escalope about 6mm thick. Dredge both sides of each piece of chicken in the seasoned flour, and tap off any excess.Working in batches, and warming a little olive oil and butter each time, fry the chicken for about three minutes, until golden brown on the underside, then turn and fry on the other side for another two minutes. Lift out on to a warmed plate, loosely cover with foil to keep warm, and repeat with the remaining scaloppine.Once all the browned scaloppine are on the covered plate, warm two tablespoons of olive oil and 20g butter in the same pan, add the shallots and saute until soft. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and saute for four to six minutes, until lightly browned. Add the marsala and leave to bubble in a lively way for about three minutes, until slightly syrupy. Add the stock and leave to bubble again until you have a gently thickened sauce.Take the pan off heat and swirl in the remaining butter. You now have two choices: either put the pan back on the heat and return the chicken escalopes in batches, turning them once or twice so they get coated with the sauce; or simply tip the hot sauce and mushrooms all over the chicken escalopes you have set aside on the warmed plate.Explore more on these topicsFoodA kitchen in RomeItalian food and drinkChickenMeatVegetablesWineMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

Never pretentious, he had the habit of decanting fine vintages into plastic cola bottles he carried around for the job, most memorably a 1964 Moët that he produced for a Masters ofWinemeeting. He relished his American road trips promoting his belovedpetits châteaux.Born in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, Bill was the son of Pamela (nee Beachcroft), a Wren in the second world war, and John Blatch, later company secretary to the fishmonger business Mac Fisheries. He boarded at Bradfield college, Berkshire, then spent a year teaching inFrance.An early entrant into the wine trade, he worked for a period with Stowells wine merchants in Gerrards Cross before starting a modern languages degree at Magdalen College, Oxford in 1967. Beginning a pattern throughout his life of generosity and conviviality, he befriended his college cellar master, who recognised his palate early on.Bill could not resist the allure of France. In 1973 he married Tita Marsan, a Frenchwoman, and the following year they set up home in Bordeaux, where Bill became an established wine personality. He qualified as a master of wine and worked for two different wine merchants before founding his own business, Vintex, in 1982.After selling the company in 2006, he established an online business, Bordeaux Gold, specialising in Barsac and Sauternes. This is where he is best remembered, working with his beloved Sauternes, about which he was incredibly knowledgable; in 2014 he was made a Chevalier de L’Ordre Nationaledu Mérite for his services to the wine trade.Two of Bill’s great passions were fishing and scuba diving. He loved his annual expedition into the Canadian wilderness, setting up camp at various rugged locations, where he fished and lived off the land, once unexpectedly shooting the rapids in Hudson Bay. Bill had a huge and varied cohort of friends, one of whom described him as a “joy to be with”, remembering his “incredible wealth of stories and information”. Bill’s life ended doing what he loved, watching the fishes and swimming among them while snorkelling off Tahiti.He is survived by Tita, his nephew, Adam, and me.Explore more on these topicsWineOther livesFranceobituariesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Besides Provençal rosé (a column for another day), New Zealand sauvignon blanc has to be one of the most successfully marketed wines of the past century. This grape is, of course, planted around the world, and originally French, but it has become so wrapped up in the identity of New Zealand wine, and so at the forefront of our minds, that several people I know who have heard of New Zealand’s take didn’t know that sauvignon blanc also constitutes many appellation wines from the Loire and Bordeaux.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It was1973when the first sauvignon blanc vines were planted in Marlborough, and were initially intended to be blended with müller-thurgau, which at the time was one of the region’s more popular grape varieties. That’s almost unthinkable now, when Marlborough is by far the most famed region for sauvignon blanc, with about 25,000 hectares of vines, low rainfall and long, sunny days, as well as free-draining soil. In other words, ideal conditions for producing wine en masse.Today, New Zealand sauvignon blanc is one of – if notthe– most widely drunk white wines in the UK. It is, however, not that widely drunk within the industry itself, and some decorated wine enthusiasts can be a little snobby about it. I think that probably has something to do with the branding: a lot of New Zealand sauvignon blanc can taste rather similar, after all. But part of having a brand is that you’re easily recognised by the consumer, right? It’s also so often a person’s first foray into the world of wine, and that initial interest should always be encouraged.Marlborough sauvignon blanc is crisp, dry and, above all, intensely aromatic. When you think NZ SB, think green (asparagus, gooseberry, pea pod) and tropical fruit (passion fruit, melon). Its lightness and acidity makes it a drinking wine, rather than a thinking wine. You also know exactly what you’re getting when you open a bottle, in much the same way as you know what you’re getting every time you open a can of lager or order a bargain bucket from KFC.And Marlborough is just one of several regional styles. The country’s next biggest grower of sauvignon blanc is Hawke’s Bay, on North Island, and although it has only 1,000 hectares, it produces a more diverse range of styles, both riper and finer, than Marlborough. Next there’s Nelson, on the top of South Island, which I love for its elegant, poised chardonnay and pinot noir; its sauvignon is the same, but this is a more boutique region, so its wines tend to cost a little more than Marlborough.International Sauvignon Blanc Dayis being celebrated on 2 May, apparently, and we all need something to look forward to, so why not make it a whimsical, self-imposed wine holiday?Four New Zealand sauvignon blancs worth looking intoInviniti Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc 2023£10.50, The Wine Society, 12.5%.
