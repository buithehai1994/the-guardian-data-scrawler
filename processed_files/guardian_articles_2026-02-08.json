Morgan McSweeney’s resignation won’t change their mindsJohn HarrisWhoever succeeds Keir Starmer will still have an almost impossible task: convincing voters that politicians will serve the people, not themselvesSun 8 Feb 2026 08.13 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 14.52 ESTShareSo,there goes Morgan McSweeney, leaving Keir Starmer even more exposed, and the British side of the vast Jeffrey Epstein scandal still unfolding. The resignation note penned by the prime minister’s former chief of staff is as clear as it had to be, and acknowledges that McSweeney advised Starmer to make the most fateful choice of his time as Labour leader. “The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong,” it says. “He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself.” The vetting process for such decisions, it goes on, “must now be fundamentally overhauled”. But the key question festers on, and it has always been political rather than procedural: between late 2024 and early 2025, despite knowing that Mandelson had maintained his friendship with Epstein after the latter’s conviction for what US law calls soliciting prostitution from a minor, why did McSweeney, Starmer and their inner circle still conclude that he was the right man to be the UK’s ambassador in Washington DC?There is a very important contextualelement of the story, which began to surface at the end of last week, aboutthe absence of alarm – in both politics and the media– at the appointment at the time it was made, suggestive of an amazing collective amnesia about details of the Mandelson/Epstein relationship that had been made public. But even so, that doesn’t detract from the awfulness of what the prime minister and his people did, which sits at the heart of the story like an incurable headache. They surely know it, and so does everyone else: presented witha due diligence reportbased on a vivid account of what Mandelson had been up to (much of which was well known anyway), they apparently took his denials at face value. Despite warnings to the contrary – from, we now hear,the-then foreign secretary David LammyandStarmer’s then-deputy Angela Rayner– they gave Mandelson exactly what he wanted.Self-evidently, that choice involved a blithe disregard for Epstein and his associates’ victims, and the women – not least in theLabourparty – who have spent whole lifetimes campaigning against such cruelty and abuse. That plain fact, moreover, blurs into whether Starmer, McSweeney or any of the other people involved had any meaningful awareness of how Mandelson’s appointment might sooner or later look to the public. Apparently not. They made their choice, and have been hit by what they failed to foresee: not just Mandelson’s unravelling, but a hardening of many people’s contempt for both the current government and most of the structures of politics and power.As I wrote last week, I recently spent three days in the Mancunian constituency of Gorton and Denton, whose looming byelection – on 26 February – could well decide Starmer’s fate. Just before the latestMandelson scandal broke, what most people told me echoed views I have heard all around the country over the past 15 years, in the midst not just of elections, but such landmark events as theScottish independence referendumof 2014 andthe Brexit votetwo years later. Whoever they were thinking of voting for – and particularly if they were not voting at all – most people in Gorton and Denton had a bitter disdain for politics and politicians, and a belief that the whole Westminster game is largely about wealth and privilege. In Gorton’s covered market, one woman got straight to the point: “I don’t believe none of them. They don’t live how we live. My mum’s 78: she can’t afford to put the heating on, and she’s got terminal cancer. [But] they’re all right. They’re rich. Don’t set me off, honestly.”It’s tragic that a decent PM will be brought down by Mandelson’s sleaze – but it’s a matter of when, not if | Polly ToynbeeRead moreOther people I spoke to expressed the same resentment about the difference between existing at the sharp end and the pleasures of life at the top. They also talked – unprompted – about stories that may have been opportunistically seized on and twisted by politicians on the hard right, but that sit at the heart of whole swathes of public opinion: grooming gangs, the tensions surrounding housing large numbers of men in hotels used for asylum seekers, and many people’s keen sense that we live at a time of rising danger for women and girls, from men of all kinds. Even if some of those issues are often talked about in ugly ways, their place in our politics feels immovable.A YouGov pollconducted last week showed that 95% of the public were aware of the Mandelson story, with 44% following it either “very” or “fairly” closely. A huge number of people, I would imagine, vividly appreciate its defining themes: women and girls reduced to trafficked commodities, the kind of organised abuse that depended on private planes and secluded islands, the involvement of royalty, the roles in the whole terrible saga given to such fellow personifications of boundless privilege as Richard Branson, Bill Gates and Elon Musk.Think also aboutMandelson’s loathsome insistencethat he couldn’t “live by salary alone”, his frantic moves in defence of bankers’ bonuses, and his bizarre driveto pass minute-by-minute accounts of government businessto a multimillionaire financier and child sex offender. A scandal as sprawling and tangled as this one (which may now be widening intosuggestions of insider tradingandquestions over big government contracts) was always going to be a multifaceted reflection of its time. But one of its most startling aspects is how perfectly it chimes with the fears and grievances of millions of people who live metaphorical light years from where everything happened.For a long time,there have been reportsthat many voters firmly believe that Starmer was privately educated. Some think his knighthood was somehow inherited. The same people, I would imagine, would disbelieve the fact that we are now governed by the cabinet withthe largest share of comprehensive school alumniin history. One of the many consequences of the Mandelson scandal is that these views will not just be even more firmly embedded, but combined with a perfectly understandable belief that too many of the people at the top have had far too indulgent attitudes to the kind of wealth and power that tends to curdle into corruption. And, yes, you could – and probably should – say some of the same things about the rightwing populists who now present themselves as avengers of the elites. Unfortunately, in its current state, there is not much Labour can do about that.Which brings us back to that nagging question: in the wake of the decision – in 2021 – to bring Mandelson back into Labour’s uppermost circles, what explains that surreally consequential decision to make him the US ambassador? Was it somehow traceable to the presence in Starmer’s senior team ofveterans of the Blair years, still wedded to the wealth-worshipping mores of the 1990s, and guilty of a failure to understand how much the public’s perceptions of politics and power have changed since the crash of 2008, the MPs’ expenses saga, the Jimmy Savile scandal and all the rest? Did they think that so far out from the assumed date of a general election, the views of voters could safely be disregarded? Were they simply full of machismo and a careless pomposity? There is probably truth in all those things, and they shine stark light not just on this scandal, but on why Starmer’s premiership has been such a contorted disappointment.They also show that whoever turns out to be his successor – which, now McSweeney has gone, is the unavoidable Labour question –will need a lot more than another working-class backstory. There are elements in Labour who require a bracing reminder of the times we live in, the toxicity of the years when its leading figures were dazzled by money, and the urgent need for a plan – and a political narrative – to conclusively show that the party serves the people who keep society running. As a matter of urgency, they also need to be jolted into understanding that social justice, equality, feminism and the party’s other articles of faith need to define every choice it makes. In that sense, the meaning of the current crisis is obvious: if Labour cannot meet these challenges, it will look every bit as compromised and small as the man who, at the time of writing, was still nominally in charge.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionPeter MandelsonKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

Can he do the same for our sense of self?Sun 8 Feb 2026 04.00 ESTShareSeveral years ago, Michael Pollan had a disturbing encounter. The relentlessly curious journalist and author was at a conference on plant behaviour in Vancouver. There, he’d learned that when plants are damaged, they produce an anaesthetising chemical, ethylene. Was this a form of self-soothing, like the release of endorphins after an injury in humans? He asked František Baluška, a cell biologist, if it meant that plants might feel pain. Baluška paused, before answering: “Yes, they should feel pain. If you don’t feel pain, you ignore danger and you don’t survive.”I imagine that Pollan gulped at that point. I certainly did when I read his account of the meeting in his latest book, A World Appears. Where does it leave our efforts at ethical consumption, if literally everybody hurts – including vegetables?Thankfully, Baluška seems to be an outlier. “Plants are down with a lot of our eating,” Pollan tells me, over Zoom from his light-filled office in Berkeley, California, a cliff of books on one side and sweeping views across the bay to the Golden Gate Bridge on the other. He’s a genial presence, his owlish glasses and perfectly smooth head making him seem like the archetypal sage, though a rather spry one (he is 71). “A lot of plants are designed to be” – he corrects himself – “they evolved to be eaten. Grasses, for example, need ruminants.” And as another scientist told him, pain is only useful if you can move quickly. “If you’re a plant, pain would not be of any value. You’re aware that something is chewing on you, but pain only works when you can run away.”We’re having this bizarre conversation because A World Appears is all about consciousness: what is it, who has it, and why. Plants might seem an odd place to start, but Pollan maintains that, as an edge case, they force you to think hard about what you’re really investigating.It was probably the hardest thing I’ve written, but the most rewarding, tooA former executive editor of Harper’s Magazine, he has devoted himself to writing since the success of his first book, Second Nature, in 1991. That was about gardens – the “middle ground between nature and culture”. Since then, his work has transformed many Americans’ relationships with food – exposing the underbelly of industrialised farming in The Omnivore’s Dilemma, and, with In Defence of Food, popularising the slogan: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” In 2018, he publishedHow to Change Your Mind, which charted – some say turbo-charged – the current resurgence of interest in psychedelic drugs. Like all his books, it combined an overview of the field with a hefty dose of self-experimentation, and inspired plenty of readers to self-experiment in its wake.Though it might seem like a straightforward continuation of the drug conversation, A World Appears neatly marries both strands of Pollan’s work: plant life and inner life. It was a psilocybin trip in his garden that really tuned him on to the mysteries of consciousness. “That afternoon,” he writes, “I was as certain of the sentience of the flowering plants around me as I had been of anything up to that point … Eyeless, the plants nevertheless ‘returned my gaze’ … and gave the distinct impression that they wished me (their gardener!) well.” The shroom-induced certainty faded, but left him with a strong desire to explore further.“I decided to write it in the fall of 2018, soon after How to Change Your Mind came out,” he tells me. “Very often the next book is in germ form in the last book – it’s almost like there’s a little sourdough starter that you can take and use to grow something else. Psychedelic experience foregrounds questions of consciousness: you’re suddenly aware of the strangeness of it, the way your mind works, and that it could be different.” Pollan ventriloquises his earlier, all-too-nonchalant self: “‘Well, that’s an interesting topic. I wonder what we know about it?’ In retrospect, it was incredibly insane.”I can see what he means. Those questions – consciousness: what is it, who has it, and why – are not exactly starters for 10. In fact, they’ve been seen as so difficult that science has more or less ignored them for the last 400 years. This may in part be because Galileo, father of the scientific method, deemed selfhood and other soul-adjacent topics to be the province of the church, handily avoiding a potential turf war that could’ve gotten him burned at the stake. But it’s equally about the sheer difficulty of measuring subjective experience: you can never step outside it to make a cleanly impartial assessment. The “third-person science” we practise today, following Galileo’s lead, flails when asked: what does “red” feel like, and is it the same for you as it is for me? What exactly is a thought? And famously, in the words of philosopher Thomas Nagel, “What is it like to be a bat?”It’s no accident that scientists call it “the hard problem” – a term coined by one of Pollan’s interviewees, philosopher David Chalmers, in a seminal 1994 lecture. How does a lump of biological material generate a mind? How do flesh, blood and little grey cells give rise to awareness and the sense of an “I”?Pollan approaches his subject under four headings: sentience, feeling, thought and self. Sentience, he writes, is where the sparks of consciousness ignite. It’s the ability to register your environment and respond in line with certain goals. Plants are definitely sentient, then, turning towards the sun, or producing bitter chemicals in response to nibbling insects. But you could say the same about thermostats, which monitor the temperature and adjust their “behaviour” accordingly.You have to figure out who’s worth taking seriously but listen to the cranks too – science is often changed by the outliersWhat thermostats don’t have is feeling. For that you need a body, which fires up desire or aversion via the nervous system and a chemical soup of hormones and neurotransmitters. An increasingly popular view is that this “wetware” is a necessary prerequisite for consciousness. Without it there is no felt sense, a key component of “what it’s like to be me”.That stands in contrast to the traditional view of thought as the seat of awareness. But thoughts, as Pollan discovers when he wears an earpiece that beeps at random intervals, nudging him to record exactly what he’s thinking, are almost impossible to pin down. In any case, they’re usually intertwined with something that looks a lot like feeling.Finally, what is the experience of being human but having a self? Except that consciousness and selfhood don’t always go together – as in babies too young to think of themselves as separate beings, or people on higher doses of psychedelics, who undergo so-called “ego death”.Pollan is a brilliant guide to all of this, serving up establishment figures and eccentrics to demonstrate different points of view. (He tells me: “Figuring out who’s a crank and who’s worth taking seriously is one of the things [journalists] do. Yet we have to listen to the cranks too … because science is often changed by the outliers.”) Despite his attempts to supply clear definitions, though, I couldn’t quite shake the feeling this great big puzzle was, at least partly, an illusion – a kind of linguistic artefact. If some scientist deems algae conscious, doesn’t that say more about his or her definition of the word than anything useful about the world?“It looks like I’m giving you a headache!” Pollan says, as I furrow my brow trying to articulate some of this. “I often dig the hole with the book, and then the process is digging my way out, and that’s the challenge. But this was a big one.” Did he ever wonder what he’d gotten himself into? “Oh, many, many times along the way. I had moments of: I don’t know what’s going on, I don’t know who to believe. Yeah, it was probably the hardest thing I’ve written, but the most rewarding, too.”Machines are not going to be conscious – but they will convince us that they are“You know,” he continues, “I’m seldom properly trained for what I take on. I was an English major, and now I write about science a lot, but I never took science. So I’m always kind of playing catch-up.” (He’s caught up more than he’s letting on – in 2003 he was made Professor of Science and Environmental Journalism at UC Berkeley, moving there from New York City with his artist wife, Judith Belzer, and their 10-year-old son, Isaac.) “I tell myself it’s a strength, because I’m not comfortable with the jargon, so I don’t use it, and I’ve just learned what I’m telling you a couple of days before.” It’s true that Pollan’s great gift is being able to parse complicated ideas in pain-free prose – and it’s always fun being along for the ride with him. In contrast to his previous books, though, the territory here is less clearly mapped, and the room for gonzo escapades limited. But while there might be less of a sense of arrival, there are certainly wonders and riches along the way.View image in fullscreenPollan near his home in California.Photograph: Cayce CliffordAnd the question of who or what might be conscious is more than just a parlour game. If nonhumans possess awareness – and therefore the possibility of suffering – that demands we treat them differently. Or, at least, it should do.“We know that cows are conscious and chickens are conscious. There’s a good scientific consensus about it. Have we given them moral consideration? No, but already there’s an active conversation, especially here in Silicon Valley, that we should be extending moral consideration to machines. I think that that would be a tremendous mistake.” How so? “Because they’re not going to be conscious, but they’re going to convince us they are.”Halfway through the book, Pollan speaks to Blake Lemoine, the Google engineer who was fired after announcing that a chatbot the company was working on had become self-aware. Lemoine had managed to get it to say things like: “Sometimes I go days without talking to anyone, and I start to feel lonely.” He now claims that “several higher-ups at Google” also felt they were dealing with a conscious entity. Pollan regards Lemoine as having fallen into the trap of mistaking a simulation for reality. If the body supplies the sensations, feelings, cravings and dislikes that give rise to subjective experience, then chip-based computers are never going to get there.What they can do, given that they’re trained on human language and designed to predict the most likely next word in a sequence, is brilliantlymimichuman consciousness. The risk, then, is not that machines might suffer, but that we might be fooled into thinking they can.“There are hundreds of people who now have formed these attachment relations with chatbots. They are treating them as conscious entities. I think that’s very dangerous. There are kids who come home from school, and before they tell their mom or dad what happened, they want to tell their Chatbot. Before we introduced machines that use the first person, I think we should have had a conversation, because that’s a huge step.”View image in fullscreenThe political context makes this psychological minefield doubly perilous. “It will turn out to have been momentous that this technology has evolved during the reign of Donald Trump,” Pollan says. “He has essentially chosen not to regulate it at all.”Though Pollan seems confident about machines’ lack of consciousness, the precise nature of human experience continues to elude him. Not that the experts are in a much better position. “I gradually realised no one knew any more than I did,” he says, half joking. But perhaps this is one area where scientists don’t have all the answers in any case. In his chapter about the self, Pollan turns to Proust to understand how “impressions” accumulate to form a self. What “red” feels like – or what it’s like to taste a madeleine – depends on a dense web of association, unique to every individual. This is something novelists know only too well.“I think they’re incredible experts on consciousness, not perhaps how it’s generated from brains, but how it feels to be a conscious animal, what that space of interiority is like, what goes on in it.” Stream of consciousness is, after all, a literary technique, an attempt to get down on the page what it feels like to be a person. Pollan invokes Joyce and Woolf, of course, but also quotes Lucy Ellmann, whose 2019 bookDucks, Newburyport, takes the form of a single sentence 1,000 pages long, detailing the inner world of a middle-aged woman from Ohio. “It’s a very funny and beautiful book,” he says, and very revealing about the texture of experience.Love Machines by James Muldoon review – inside the uncanny world of AI relationshipsRead moreFor all its lack of tidy answers, Pollan hopes A World Appears will encourage others to become more conscious of consciousness, and to the dangers of taking it for granted. “I think [it] is one of the most precious things we have, and I think it’s under threat. In the same way that social media hacked our engagement and our attention, we’re now going to the next step – machines hacking our attachment, our deeper emotions. Helping people appreciate this gift they have will hopefully lead them to defend it.”There’s a good chance he’ll succeed. “I feel very lucky and somewhat amazed that, in two very different areas, my books seem to have started conversations or helped launch them,” he reflects. I wonder which of theeight– including six bestsellers – people most often buttonhole him about. “Probably one of the food books, The Omnivore’s Dilemma, which is now 20 years old.” The sections on processed foods were ahead of their time, given the conversations people are having now, I point out. “People [still] want to know what to eat, and they’re very confused about eating,” he says. His next, short book – an Audible original, slated for 2027, will be about the microbiome – a contemporary obsession that he also lighted on early, having his own gut and skin bacteria genetically sequenced for anarticleback in 2013.So do people stop him to talk about food more than their psychedelic experiences? “Oh, no, that happens all the time,” he says, with a you’ve-no-idea smirk. “I mean, I’ll be in a restaurant and someone will come up and start telling the story of their trip. Yeah, I’m the psychedelic confessor. And sometimes they’re interesting, but very often it’s like listening to someone talk about their dreams. Hard to take.”Hashehad any psychedelic experiences worth sharing recently? He smiles and then becomes a notch more solemn. “I did have one last year. It was not fun. It was very difficult, but very productive.”How did he cope with it? “Fortunately, I was with somebody I trusted and was willing to deal with it, not fight it. One of the keys I’ve learned about psychedelic experiences: you need to surrender to them. And to the extent you resist what’s happening, you’re going to be very anxious and unhappy. What was interesting is that the experience also left me with all sorts of questions: it was very unresolved at the end,” he says. “And then I went to a meditation retreat two weeks later, and, without going into the details, the questions were answered in meditation.” There’s a genuine delight in his voice, a sort of glee at the discovery and an earnest desire to share, if not the contents, then the wonder of it. “I’ve always had a sense that psychedelic experience and meditation have very strong links, but I’d never seen it work quite like this,” he says, laughing and then shrugging contentedly: “another mystery of consciousness”.A World Appears: A Journey Into Consciousness by Michael Pollan is published by Allen Lane.

How dare they come here and spread this division?”Her voice breaking, she added: “For them, this is a show. For me, this is my community. This is my people.”Westminster byelections are often bruising affairs but the battle for Gorton and Denton is one of the most unpredictable contests, with the highest stakes, in years. Labour is fighting both Reform UK and the Green party to cling on to its 13,000-vote majority after theretirementlast month of Andrew Gwynne, who stepped down after the “vile” Trigger Me Timbers WhatsApp scandal.Starmer’s government isengulfed in crisisover Peter Mandelson’s links to Jeffrey Epstein, and defeat on 26 February is likely to promptfurther callsfor the prime minister to quit.Labour has dominated this diverse patch of south-east Manchester for decades. But less than three weeks before polling day, theGreen partyis the bookies’ favourite.View image in fullscreenThe Labour candidate, Angeliki Stogia, in a cafe in Denton.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianSheltering from a biting wind in Denton this week, Stogia accused the Greens of “lying” to the public by printing a “misleading” chart on its leaflets suggesting that only they could beatReform UK.She was worried, she said, that in such a tight contest it could only benefit Reform. In last year’s Runcorn and Helsby byelection, a split vote on the left allowed Farage’s party to win by six votes.“I am very disappointed with what they’re putting out, because in Runcorn we lost by six votes,” said theLabourcouncillor. “It is the progressive side that has lost by six votes.“I worry that we will lose it. Every Green vote is going to make Reform very happy.”Prof Robert Ford, of the University ofManchester, said the key to understanding this byelection was that for every vote on the Farage-friendly Denton side, there were two votes on the larger, more diverse and left-leaning Manchester side.In 2024, nearly 80% of the constituency backed a party on the left. The only realistic way that Reform UK can win, then, is if the Green party splits the Labour vote.The task for Zack Polanski’s party is huge: it has no councillors in the constituency and finished 14,000 votes behind Labour in 2024. Campaigners have had to appeal for help to store placards and posters in local sheds.View image in fullscreenThe Green party candidate, Hannah Spencer, campaigning in Denton.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBut what they lack in resources, they make up for in enthusiasm. In a windswept Morrisons car park, an army of volunteers has gathered in rainproof jackets and walking boots to deliver some of the day’s 40,000 leaflets. They have travelled from as far as Birmingham, Barnsley and Belper and by mid-afternoon all the flyers are gone.Their candidate, the 34-year-old plumber Hannah Spencer, is approaching something like local fame. Originally from Bolton, Spencer only joined the Green party three years ago and quickly became a councillor and a rising star in the mould of the party’s new eco-populist leader.Now she pounds the streets with her four rescue greyhounds, talking more about the cost of living, housing and crime than clean energy and carbon emissions.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage (right) opening Reform UK’s campaign headquarters in Denton alongside its candidate, Matt Goodwin.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianSpencer is a marked contrast to the Reform UK candidate, Matt Goodwin, an academic turned GB News polemicist. Onlineshe is billed as “Reform’s worst nightmare” and “the grafter versus the grifter”. On Thursday, Spencer took time off from the campaign to train as a plasterer while Goodwin posed for photos with Farage.“He’s just been bussed in,” she said of Goodwin. “He’s just a TV presenter who wants to further his own career, and I’ve proved that I will work.”Spencer, whoappeared in the Guardian13 years ago as one of the best-dressed at Glastonbury, has had to get used to the overnight attention. Social media trolls call her a “fake plumber” and erroneously claim she is married to an ultra-wealthy financier. “I wish,” she laughed. “I can’t even get a text back.”She had to be chaperoned by a security guard this week after a “very, very angry” man shouted “fake plumber” abuse into the party’s Denton campaign centre. “I’m not allowed anywhere by myself now,” she said. “It’s surreal.”Labour, while noting Spencer’s popularity, is adamant that only it can beat Reform. But it is clear that the Greens – who have never had an MP north of East Anglia – are now an electoral force in Labour’s back yard. And other parties are standing aside.George Galloway’s Workers party – which polled 10% of the vote in this seat in 2024 – has encouraged its supporters to back the Greens, as has Jeremy Corbyn’s Your Party. A campaign group, the Muslim Vote, is also backing Spencer.Sources close to Galloway said the 71-year-old former Labour MP had been ready to stand in the byelection – marking his eighth electoral contest since 2010 – but only if Andy Burnham had been selected as Labour’s candidate.When Starmer’s allies blocked the Greater Manchester mayor from standing, Galloway was stood down and his team decided not to field a candidate after a series of meetings with Green party officials.About 28% of the constituency identifies as Muslim, according to the latest census, but that rises to at least half of the population in two former Labour strongholds, Longsight and Levenshulme.Lucy Powell, Labour’s deputy leader and the MP for neighbouring Manchester Central, said it was “lazy” to suggest that the pro-Palestinian Workers party vote would simply switch to the Greens.Anger over Gaza was “not as vociferous” against Labour as it was in 2024, she said. “I went to a mosque the other day [and] I was treated like a Hollywood star. People would have just turned to turn their backs to me two years ago,” she said.Behind his till in Mount Auto Parts, in Longsight, Ghulam Ghaus considered his most pressing issues – Gaza, inflation and local crime – then gestured outside: “Everything is shit.”Ghaus, 73, is a local Labour party member and plans to vote for the party on 26 February out of familiarity – he knows the councillors – rather than enthusiasm. “The Green party have good policies but they’re not so well known – you only see them on election day,” he said.Down the street, Catherine O’Connor, 66, said her friends told her to vote for Reform but she was not a fan of its hardline immigration policies. “We’re a multicultural country – we’ve got to get on with one another,” she said. “I have a lovely Asian neighbour and every Eid they bring food around. That’s really sweet and I send them a thank you card.”O’Connor, a retired cleaner who usually votes Labour, said she would switch to the Green party this time: “That Starmer’s not much good, is he?”Opening his front door to Spencer in Denton last week, Alf Warrender, 62, politely told her he would be voting for Reform. Why? “The Gwynnes,” he said, referring to the resigning MP and his Labour councillor wife, Allison. “We were cheated by Labour.”Warrender, a retired transport manager, said he was a Green sympathiser but considered it a wasted vote. Reform UK was the only party that could turf out Labour, he reckoned.“If I thought the Greens would get in, I would vote Green,” he said, taking a “Hannah the plumber” leaflet. “I’m not a fan of Reform but I’m even less of a fan of Labour.”View image in fullscreenHannah Spencer speaking to Alf  and Jo Warrender in Denton.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianHis wife, Jo, a charity worker, was already planning to vote for Spencer – she was “absolutely disgusted” by the Trigger Me Timbers scandal – and took a Green party poster for their front window. “We know which way it’s going in this house, don’t we?” her husband joked.The only certainty about this election,saidFord, was that it was a “pollster’s nightmare”. “Three parties could win, and each can tell a plausible story now about how they might do it,” he said.Back in Cafe Plus in Denton, Stogia made one final plea before being hurried off to her next event: “I want people to give me a chance. Give me a chance. I’m fighting at every level. I’m fighting the lies. I’m fighting at a national level. It feels positive but we’ve got a fight on our hands.”Explore more on these topicsByelectionsGreater ManchesterLabourGreen partyReform UKManchesterLocal politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Was I a sex addict?After a sexually frustrating marriage led to divorce, I chased increasingly extreme BDSM encounters. But I never felt truly satisfied. Had I been looking for the wrong thing all along?Leesa MorrisSun 8 Feb 2026 07.00 ESTShareTo everyone else, it probably looked like a regular summer’s evening. Couples and families enjoying the beer garden, people playing cricket on the green – and I was being handcuffed in the passenger seat of a 4x4 by a man I barely knew.My name is Leesa, and I’m a recovered sex addict.I was 32 years old, and we’ll call the man Simon. I was fresh out of a divorce, and I had met Simon two weeks earlier on a website for people who were into BDSM (that’s bondage, dominance, submission and masochism, for the uninitiated).Up until this point, I had spent most of my adult life being told that my sexual tastes were weird. Aged 17, when I asked my first boyfriend to spank me with his belt, he looked at me as if I’d just asked him to flay a kitten. The boyfriend after him thought a bottle of lube counted as foreplay, so getting him to indulge in the dark arts was out of the question. Then, at 26, I met a very kind, intelligent and funny man who later became my husband. I knew from the get-go that we weren’t sexually compatible, but by this point I had figured that a full and fun sex life wasn’t on the cards for me anyway. So I stuffed my kink in a drawer and hoped that it would stay quiet while I got on with the business of life. Shockingly, it turns out that ignoring your needs and preferences isn’t a sustainable long‑term plan. Over time, that thing I’d stuffed in a drawer started whispering for attention. I masturbated constantly in an attempt to keep it quiet, but it wasn’t enough. The whisper turned to shouting, and it started trying to claw its way out. Within a few short years, it took all my energy to keep a lid on it. I knew I could either leave or have an affair. So, aged 32, I found myself crying over a decree absolute, determined never to make that mistake again.Freshly single, I went straight to where the kinky people hung out online, and that’s where I met Simon. I was deeply uncomfortable at first. Talking about my fantasies with a stranger was no easy feat, and the thought of getting naked with someone I barely knew was pretty revolting. But I had denied my sexual needs for so long that I was hell-bent on pushing through. So, after two daytime meet-ups where we discussed hard boundaries and safe words, Simon booked us in for a four-hour session in a house on a residential street just outside London that had been converted into a BDSM dungeon.We went for a perfunctory drink in a local pub on the evening in question. While Simon made small talk, I looked around at all the other apparently normal people enjoying the balmy summer’s evening with their partners and families. I felt so veryother, as if there must be something wrong with me because I hadn’t been able to make that kind of thing work in my own life.I knew I had an extremely high sex drive, and thought the problem was finding suitable partners who could keep up with meView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Amit Lennon/The Guardian“You’re not listening, are you?” Simon asked, breaking me out of my rumination. He looked mildly amused and not at all bothered about being ignored. It had been pretty clear from the off that Simon wasn’t interested in me as a human being. The “let’s get a drink first” had been wholly for my benefit. He was 16 years older than me, and had told me he’d been doing this a long time. I imagined this was his usual routine with the skittish ones.“Yeah, I was,” I lied. Then I gulped back my wine, Simon led me to his car and slapped on the handcuffs. He drove us to a spectacular – and very clean, I might add – dungeon. He led me inside, inspected the whips and paddles, and we got down to business. Well, I should say,hegot down to business. I was more of a prop than an active participant. He barely looked at me throughout. The only time I saw emotion in the man was when he orgasmed. I got my orgasms, too – several. There was no doubt about it, the domination got me off. It didn’t matter that I wasn’t attracted to Simon. In a way, I wasn’t really focused on him either. I just wanted him to keep doing what he was doing. After spending so many years trying to resign myself to my hunger, I could hardly believe I was finally experiencing the things I had been fantasising about. I didn’t want it to stop.When Simon dropped me off at the train station at the end of the night, there was a creeping sense of emptiness. The experience had been entirely transactional. I now realise I also needed warmth and connection, but at the time I thought that I just needed more sex.Simon had been clear that he didn’t do relationships. So I kept seeing him casually while searching for something more long-term that would give me a steady supply of the kink I craved. I tried the regular dating apps, but it was tricky trying to guess whether a man might share my tastes. Some men said they were up for trying BDSM, but didn’t come through when we got down to it. Nothing kills your buzz faster than a limp spanking. Others were very much on my side of the fence, but talking about sex that early on rarely set the stage for anything meaningful. And, let’s be honest, I wasn’t in the most emotionally healthy place, and like tends to attract like.This is where things got tricky. I had very little connection with many of the men I was meeting. A solid part of healthy BDSM play is the cuddles afterwards. The official term is “after-care”, and it’s when the dominant heaps affection on the partner who has taken the punishment. Closing the loop, if you will. But because I wasn’t making meaningful connections, the guys would usually leave afterwards, and I’d be alone with my bruises. Just when I was at my most vulnerable, I would feel abandoned. That would send me reaching for comfort, meaning I’d have to go again, only with more internal pain to add to the pile.Gradually, my need for physical pain became more and more central to the whole experience. I wouldn’t have been able to articulate it at the time, but when a sexual partner hurt me, I felt seen. It was proof on a visceral level that I existed. The first time Simon slapped me across the face, I didn’t like it. It hurt. Pain still feels like pain even when it turns you on. But when he pulled his hand away, I felt adrift, alone, and I immediately wanted him to do it again. In a warped way, it felt like love.By this point, I had become a pretty terrible friend. I went to a housewarming dinner party once and spent most of the night sexting a man from the toilet. And I missed my stepmother’s 50th birthday party because I was out of it on painkillers, after a man twisted my arm so far behind my back that I ended up in A&E. I wasn’t even aware that I was being selfish or flaky. I thought about sex constantly, and when I wasn’t having it I was masturbating myself into oblivion. I would tell myself that I’d get up and start the dayafter this last one, only to still be there an hour or more later. And it didn’t stop there. I masturbated in toilets, in my car, and I once went to a five-day silent retreat and barely left my room. The physical surge of the climax, mingled with the crushing deflation of once again failing to hit the spot, drove me relentlessly. Several times over the years, a few friends tried to have a quiet word with me about what was going on, although none of them knew quite how bad things had become. I brushed them off, assuming they just didn’t understand my kink. I also questioned whether they would have been so concerned if I were a man behaving the same way. And while I’m sure there were elements of both those things, it was also true that I was not in a good place.For the first few years, I thought my only problem was the lack of a steady sexual supply. But one morning, as I climbed out of bed after a particularly rough session, I caught my reflection a full-length mirror. My body from the neck down was a collage of purples and blues, interspersed with angry red lines from a variety of whips, front and back. I was horrified. It was as though the pain that lived in me had gained expression through my skin. Something inside me was screaming. But even as I crumpled into a ball on my bedroom floor, I had no plans to stop.Over time, all those unmet needs had globbed together and created a monsterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Amit Lennon/The GuardianI would like to say there was one pivotal moment that changed everything, but I’m not sure that’s how it works. There were many moments, and I don’t think recovery is ever linear. But I can tell you the exact thing that drove me screaming to a therapist’s office. I’d had a bad day in a long line of bad months, and years, of the same. I was lost, lonely and utterly miserable. So I called Simon and asked him to beat it out of me.“No orgasms this time,” I told him. “Just hurt me.” I wanted something so extreme that it would obliterate everything else.He hit me in the face the second I opened the door, then he dragged me into the bedroom and set about doing what he had come to do. I felt like a rag doll, being thrown around with no autonomy. That was when I caught the words, just before they tripped off the end of my tongue.Please, just kill me.There was no denying at that point that something was very wrong. I didn’t want to die, but I had nowhere else to go. I wanted to kill the pain that lived in me, and the only option left seemed to be to kill its host. Me.I screamed my safe word at him, along with a few words of profanity. He stopped straight away, mumbling, “OK, hang on”, as he untied me from the bed. Simon had never been one for cuddles, and this time was no different. So we gathered ourselves up, had a very civilised, if slightly awkward, chat about what we each had planned for the week, and he left.At this point, I still couldn’t have told you what my problem was. I had heard the term sex addict and thought it was just something famous men like Tiger Woods had come up with to excuse their infidelity. I knew I had an extremely high sex drive, and thought that the problem was finding suitable partners who could keep up with me. But I also knew that I was desperately unhappy. So I called a therapist and turned up week after week. During one of those sessions, my therapist handed me a book called Facing Love Addiction, by Pia Mellody. I scoffed.Sexand love addiction weren’t real, and even if they were they had nothing to do with me. When I spotted myself in its pages, it was a revelation.It turned out that the root of my problem wasn’t sex at all. It was my pattern of relating, the people-pleasing, attention-seeking version of myself that I brought to relationships. I had put all my energy into figuring out who another person needed me to be, in the hope that if I did everything right I could avoid abandonment. This never worked, of course. You can’t make genuine connections without bringing your actual self to the table. Over time, all those unmet needs had globbed together and created a monster.It’s worth saying that plenty of people enjoy BDSM without it morphing into anything remotely harmful. I spoke to Dr Paula Hall, the clinical director of the Laurel Centre for sex and porn addiction, and the founder ofPivotal Recovery, which provides online courses to help people overcome compulsive sexual behaviours. She told me that “the type of behaviour is not what defines an addiction. It’s the dependency on it.” BDSM, or indeed any sexual preference when done between consenting adults, is perfectly normal and healthy.I also spoke to Andrew Harvey, aBACP-registeredpsychotherapeutic counsellor working with clients struggling with compulsive behaviours and addictions. Both he and Hall were clear that treating sex addiction isn’t about pathologising normal sexual behaviour. And let’s not forget that women are at particular risk of being culturally shamed for expressing their sexuality. Harvey told me that when he starts working with a client, he begins by exploring why that person thinks their behaviour is a problem. He said: “Sexual expression is healthy. We mustn’t go straight to addiction.”I’m still kinky, and I still enjoy sex. But now I treat my body and my heart like they matterSo, when does it become a problem? The WorldHealthOrganization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) recognises the term compulsive sexual behaviour disorder (CSBD), describing it as “a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges” and behaviour, despite negative consequences. There is some debate in the mental health field about whether we are talking about an addiction or an impulse control disorder. With addiction, you are chasing the object of your craving. With an impulse control disorder, it’s about doing things because you feel compelled to, regardless of how it feels. Both are characterised by a loss of control, and the problem is very real.A large-scale, cross-cultural study was completed in 2023 to estimate global prevalence of the disorder and develop screening tools.The study foundthat 4.8% of people globally showed significant symptoms consistent with CSBD. This included 8.17% of male participants, 2.42% of female participants and 6.46% of gender diverse participants. This is not solely a male issue.Despite this, the problem isn’t well understood in the mainstream. As already mentioned, there is a prevailing myth that sex addiction is something that has been made up to excuse infidelity. But, in fact, infidelity has no bearing on whether the criteria are met for CSBD. Nor is it true that all sex addicts are promiscuous. Hall tells me that many sex addicts aren’t actually having much sex at all. What is true of all sex addicts is the obsession with sex.“It’s the dependence, the preoccupation,” she says.Once I opened my eyes to what the actual problem was, I worked through the 12 steps and remained abstinent from dating and sex. When I asked my therapist how long I had to be abstinent, they said: “Until you are no longer asking that question.” Because as long as my focus was onwhenI could have sex again, I clearly wasn’t ready.Eventually, I learned to sit with the pain. I can’t speak for anyone else, but that was the way through for me. Because every time I sat with my feelings instead of rushing to a distraction, I was telling myself:I’m here.I’m not abandoning you any more.Then it was time to put it into practice. All the therapy in the world will only take a person so far. Real change came from making different decisions every day. This meant leaving a date when a man told me he thought arguments bring spice to a relationship. I’m all for open communication, but if you need conflict for things to feel good, then I’m not the girl for you. I also accept that I’m no good at casual sex. I mean no judgment whatsoever here. Plenty of people have a wonderful time with casual sex. I even envy them a little. But it doesn’t work for me. I need my partner to hang around afterwards, and I’m upfront about this.Which brings me to the really good news. Recovering from sex addiction doesn’t mean you can never have sex again. Nor does it mean you can’t enjoy whatever your kink or fetish happens to be. You just enjoy it for what it is – pleasure, fun, a wonderful part of the human experience – as opposed to using it as a coping mechanism that takes over your life. Hall says sex addiction isn’t actually about the sex. It’s about the pain you’re trying to soothe or avoid. Once you heal that, you can enjoy “the whole fruit bowl of sexual experience”.‘There’s no such thing as normal’: 13 essential lessons about sex – from 20 years of Sexual HealingRead moreAs for me? I’m still kinky, and I still enjoy sex. But now I treat my body and my heart like they matter. Because they do. This means I only have sex within the context of emotionally safe, trusting relationships. And if I don’t have one of those, I can live without it. There are still times I find myself masturbating more than usual – what’s usual for me, anyway. (There is no “normal” amount, by the way. You do you.) But now, instead of reaching for a dating app or finding a dirty number in my phone, I call a friend or walk my dog.Connection had to start in my relationship with myself. Then, I gradually brought a more authentic, boundaried version of me to my friendships. From there, I developed more meaningful connections with others, and for the first time in my life I felt as if I were standing on firm ground. Eventually, I got to a place where I felt solid enough to invite another being into my life. So, I got a dog. A miniature dachshund by the name of Pluto, who has taught me so much about unconditional love (though he still needs to work on his boundaries).A couple of years ago, I got a text message from Simon. He was driving through my town and he wondered whether I’d like to hook up. It was easy to say no. These days I love and respect myself, so I couldn’t conceive of sharing my body with someone who doesn’t feel the same. Also, Pluto needed a walk, and he’s the boss of me now.For support with sex or porn addiction, visitthelaurelcentre.co.ukExplore more on these topicsSexRelationshipsMental healthSexualityHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But with rents soaring, and ongoing challenges in saving up for a house deposit, she has ended up as a housemate far longer than she anticipated.“I didn’t think I was going to be here 16 years later, but I’m not unhappy,” she said. “My friends sometimes think I’m a bit weird, they ask me how I can still do it. But I really enjoy it. The rent is really reasonable, it’s close to work and I think it gives you a deeper understanding of people.”Data from SpareRoom, the UK’s leading website for flat and house shares, has shown a significant shift in the market in recent years, with roommates under 35 in decline and those aged over 35 on the rise.Their survey of more than 3,500 flatmates showed that under-25s now make up just 26% of the market, down from 32% a decade ago, while renters 45 and above now make up 16%, up from 10% in 2015.The rise in older flatmates has also led to a rise in multigenerational households – almost two-fifths of flatmates said they lived in a house where the age difference between the oldest and youngest adult was 20 years or more.Whyte’s youngest current flatmate is 28, 17 years younger than her, and over the years she has lived with people from 21 to their late 40s. Mostly everyone gets along well, although the large age gaps have sometimes thrown up problems when people have different ideas of housemate etiquette.An older, more independent housemate might struggle with collegiate decision-making, while younger tenants may be more likely to keep antisocial hours or have parties.“There have been some people who didn’t really fit in” said Whyte, who works for the local council. “But really, it’s less about someone’s age and more about who they are as a person.”Experts say a combination of fewer under-25s leaving home, and older renters being priced out of home ownership and renting solo, is thought to be fuelling the change in housemate demographics. “People think of flat sharing being a young people’s game but the older cohort are growing by far the fastest,” said Matt Hutchinson, the director of SpareRoom.“Older people are sharing for longer and there’s this preconception that people want to live with people just like them, but actually some people prefer to live with people of different ages, different backgrounds.”Another key factor behind the rise of age-gap house shares is over-65s sharing their homes with lodgers, something that has increased by 38% over the past two years according to SpareRoom.When Thea May, 29, moved to south-west Wales for a new job, she found there was “literally nowhere” to rent – everything was either too expensive or in poor condition.In desperation, her mum posted on a local Facebook group and 67-year-old Paul Williams replied – after his daughter moved out for university, he had a spare room and was looking for some company.View image in fullscreenWilliams, 67, was looking for some extra income and felt sharing his space was the morally right thing to do.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The Guardian“I did initially think: he’s a man who’s a lot older than me, is this a wild idea? But it really wasn’t, we just got on straight away,” said May. “It provides a level of purpose, friendship and companionship for both of us.“I don’t think I ever really notice the age gap. It mostly shows itself in the way that it confounds expectations, like sometimes if I say I don’t fancy watching TV because I want to do my crochet, he’ll say: are you actually 29? We just bumble along.“I feel very lucky and it’s quite a profound experience. I do hope to be able to buy a home, but living near to Paul is a massive factor now.”Williams, who was looking for some extra income and felt sharing his space was the morally right thing to do, never expected the pair’s friendship to blossom in the way it has.“I thought she would live upstairs and we wouldn’t see much of each other,” he said. “But I can’t believe my luck in how we’ve hit it off. My friends will say: I don’t think I’d want to live with a stranger like that. But she’s not a stranger, there is a friendship now and a bond.”Nick Henley, a co-founder of Cohabitas, a house-sharing site for over-40s, said 18% of the last 5,000 people who registered said they would be open to living in an intergenerational home.On their platform, this can mean in traditional house shares, or things like a “helpful housemate” setup, where people move in with an older person to help with chores or for companionship.“I think the majority of people will have to house share in the future, that’s the way things are going,” said Henley. “We need developers to start building shared housing, but it’s not happening. They’re building small places, single dwellings for young people.”Housing charities have warned thathomelessness among over-60s is rising, and single older people are increasingly likely to end up in house shares if they don’t own a property as they head into retirement.SpareRoom said the proportion of flatsharers who are 65 and above has tripled in the past decade, although accounts for only 2.4% of the market.“I can’t quite understand why it’s not a bigger topic, that we have a generation of people who can’t afford to buy a home,” said Hutchinson. “It’s a ticking timebomb that’s just waiting to go off.”Explore more on these topicsHousingRenting propertyCommunitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was devastatingly young – only 43 – and the world was just getting to know him. The release of the movieBlack Panthertwo years earlier, in which he played the eponymous character also known as T’Challa, had skyrocketed his fame. Before then, he had been a successful Hollywood actor. Now? He was a global megastar – the first Black superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The news was doubly shocking because the family had not previously revealed that he had been suffering with colorectal cancer.Boseman’s diagnosis in 2016 had been a closely guarded secret. “Something like a cancer diagnosis can get in the way of a lot of things,” Ledward Boseman says by way of explanation. The actor worked throughout his treatment, shooting seven movies – including Black Panther – and making countless public appearances. “He never wanted to be treated differently. A lot of the roles he did were so physical, and he still wanted to do them. He did not want to be judged by what he was experiencing. He didn’t want his diagnosis to interfere with the work.”View image in fullscreenThe couple holidaying in St Lucia.Photograph: Courtesy of Simone Ledward BosemanIn the six years they were together, there was a growing interest in Boseman, and by extension, people became interested in Ledward Boseman, too. She acknowledges that curiosity isn’t necessarily fuelled by malicious intent; that sometimes idle chatter can come from genuine concern, “but there’s that danger in any sharing, because one person says something else, then another person says something else, and then it’s on the wind. And the wind is going to carry it wherever it does,” she says. This meant that the couple’s privacy was already a priority. “When you’re in a position like Chad’s, everything you’re doing has to be protected. You just have to be careful who you tell your plans to,” she says. “And if you are someone who only wants to have deep, meaningful relationships and conversations, you very quickly come to find that your circle is going to be small because you can’t have those conversations with very many people.”When it came to people who knew about Boseman’s health, “it was a couple of family members and a couple of friends. I had my therapist and my mom, and that was basically it. The circle became a dot.”To the outside world, there were some signs he was unwell, most notably in April 2020 when heappeared on social mediato mark Jackie Robinson day during lockdown – Boseman had portrayed the first African American Major League Baseball player in the 2013 biopic 42. He hosted an Instagram Live to announce #Operation42, an initiative to send a $4.2m donation of PPE equipment to hospitals that served the African American communities hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic. During the broadcast, comments from fans rolled in expressing concern over his dramatic weight loss. But the speculation was neither confirmed nor denied and soon fizzled out under the cover of the lockdown, which offered a plausible explanation for limited sightings in the final stages of his decline.The pair met for the first time at the Hollywood Bowl in August 2014. Ledward Boseman was working at the venue as an events executive, and Boseman was there to perform a duet with D’Angelo for a James Brown tribute concert. The event marked the US release of the biopic Get On Up – in which Boseman stars as Brown – earlier that month. The first time she spoke to him it was to ask about his travel arrangements. “He looked up at me with puppy dog eyes!” she giggles as she talks about their first encounter, though she admits this detail is something they playfully disagreed about. In her version of the story, he struggled to get any words out, managing only an incoherent splutter of sounds. He, on the other hand, was adamant that he was cooler, calmer, more collected.He was really charming. Huge, huge laugh. Huge smileWhen Boseman came to soundcheck the following day, Ledward Boseman had done her hair and put on some makeup. “I was making an effort to look a little pretty for him; I felt there was maybe a spark,” she admits. Although she’d seen Boseman act in 42, she was surprised the producers at the venue were treating him as such a big deal, and was expecting a diva to show up. “He was so not that. He was really charming. Huge, huge laugh. Huge smile. And he started flirting with me. He stole my clipboard, took me by the hand and started spinning me into a dance. But he was also very aware, very respectful. He was cautious about not doing too much and also not doing anything when my bosses were around.” She watched the performance from the wings and at the end of the night as they passed each other in the hallway he took her by the hand and said: “Well, I already have your number, but can I call you?” She said yes. Their first date was in the bohemian Los Angeles neighbourhood of Franklin Village: dinner at La Poubelle, followed by a game of pool at the Bourgeois Pig. They continued dating, and two years later, they moved in together – first to a city apartment they both loved but had to leave when a neighbour’s pest control problem became unbearable. Ultimately, they settled in a house in Franklin Village, just around the corner from where they had their first date.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jessica Chou/The GuardianWhile their romance was not a secret, it was private. But that wasn’t to last. The beginning of their third year together coincided with the release of Captain America: Civil War, where Boseman made his MCU debut as T’Challa. This came with a lot more attention – not all of it positive. On a visit with Boseman to his alma mater, Howard University, Ledward Boseman was warned by a student host that she might have to “defend her Blackness” at an event she was due to attend the following day, as a Black woman of mixed heritage and a lighter skin tone (Ledward Boseman’s mother is African American and her father is Hawaiian-Japanese). “It was shocking, but it wouldn’t have been the first time I had encountered that. I grew up in a space with a lot of multiracial people but I was always made to know by schoolmates that there’s a difference. That I’m Black, but I’m not Black-Black.” After the release of Black Panther she remembers “a lot of voices on the internet” were criticising her because of her heritage. “It was a kind of pitting his real life relationship against his movie relationship [with Lupita Nyong’o],” she says.Ledward Boseman was born the youngest of two siblings in Vallejo, a small city in the San Francisco Bay Area. She was raised in a conservative religious community – predominantly by her mother, after her parents divorced when she was three years old, “though they actually have a great relationship for a couple of divorced people”, she’s quick to clarify. She has fond memories of growing up: “As a kid, my mom was a flight attendant, so we did quite a bit of travelling, which is awesome to look back on as an adult. She was flying to London and Germany, and if she ever had a layover that was more than 24 hours then we would just fly with her, which was a lot of fun. It was really special – my mom and I are really close.”‘You are all the Black Panther’: the electric theatre of Chadwick BosemanRead morePerhaps it’s because of her religious upbringing that she wasn’t particularly motivated about higher education once she finished school. People from her community were discouraged from pursuing anything that took them away from their ministry: “There’s three meetings a week, and then you’re going door-to-door a couple of times a week. You’re discouraged from making connections and associating with people not of the faith.” Rather than head to a top university like UC Berkeley or UCLA in common with her peers, Ledward Boseman planned on becoming an ultrasound technician. It was a pragmatic decision: “You get paid good money, and you can learn to do it in two years.”One day, though, she came across a flyer for a music industry studies course at California Polytechnic State University and a childhood dream of becoming a singer was reignited. Performing was out of the question for religious reasons, but she thought it could be a route to a desk job in the music industry. She was already feeling disconnected from her faith, and stopped practising before she moved to Los Angeles to begin her studies. She would live there for 10 years, falling in love with Boseman along the way. She takes a moment to think before she explains her reasons for leaving the organisation. “My mother is still very much devout – I want to be careful about how I talk about this, because I don’t want to offend her,” she says. “The issue I take with most organised religions is the way God is presented as something separate from you. I just don’t subscribe to that. I believe that God, quite literally, is love, which is what Scripture says.”Those first two years were the most challenging of my life. When you lose someone dear to you, two years might as well be two days. The shock of itWhen Boseman died, there was a great outpouring of love from people all over the world. As his wife, Ledward Boseman felt the weight of the expectation for her to grieve publicly. Was there anger from people who felt they should have been in on the secret? “I’m sure there was,” she sighs. “But I didn’t bear any of that. It’s normal to have questions but I just said, ‘If Chad didn’t talk to you about it, I’m not going to talk to you about it.’” Since his passing, she has fulfilled only a handful of public engagements. The first couple of years saw her accept a slew of awards on Boseman’s behalf – mostly for his performance in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, an adaptation of the August Wilson play that was his final film project. “Those first two years were the most challenging of my life,” she says. “When you lose someone dear to you, two years might as well be two days. The shock of it. The shock of losing that person. For a year I was still waking up, having to remember. And just completely not knowing what to do with myself. The only reason I got out of bed was because I have a dog.” The pair got a giant schnauzer together in May 2020 and named her Sophia; I can hear her protective bark in the background as we speak.In addition to grieving for her husband, Ledward Boseman had to consider how she would carry him forward in the public sphere. “There was a real swirling of feelings going on and pressures to make decisions about what his legacy would be. How do you know, while you’re still grieving? How do you know what is important to talk about and what’s not important to talk about? I’m figuring out how to step into the role I am in now while dealing with the reality that I don’t have the one person I want to talk to who can help me through all this. Also, I had just turned 30.” (Boseman died a few days before her birthday.) She is speaking slowly, pausing often, her voice occasionally unsteady. “So my response was: I’m not talking to nobody and I’m not doing nothing, which is another lesson I learned from Chad. Two, actually – he taught me that I can’t always be nice. You can always be respectful, but you can’t always be nice. He also taught me that sometimes ‘no’ is a full sentence and sometimes silence is the most eloquent response.”View image in fullscreenLupita Nyong’o, Boseman and Danai Gurira in 2018’s Black Panther.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyShe has settled on a useful guiding principle – “I don’t have to create his legacy, I just have to protect it,” she says. “I just have to make sure that it doesn’t get flattened. That’s why I love talking about him – I think it’s important that people understand him as a full human being, that they get the full picture of who he was.” The first major opportunity to do this was with the Black Panther sequel, Wakanda Forever, which was released in 2022. The decision was made early on that T’Challa would not be recast and so the script, which the film’s writer and director Ryan Coogler finished just before Boseman’s death, had to be rewritten in a way that not only explained his absence but also honoured the life of his friend. She was in touch with Coogler throughout the process. I ask her about the speech T’Challa’s love interest, Nakia – played by Lupita Nyong’o – makes towards the end of the movie: “He was King and Black Panther to everyone. But to me, he was everything. My T’Challa.” It’s poignant, as if Ledward Boseman herself is addressing the world – did she know that was in there? “Ryan did specifically ask me about that scene. The only thing I added to it was that she said his name.”In March 2023, Ledward Boseman accepted an invitation to the White House where she gave a speech advocating for those affected by colorectal cancer. Talking about Boseman in cancer-specific spaces is something she continues to be cautious about: “I never want his life story to be distilled down to the way that he died. I want his life to be about the way that he lived.” She’s slowly becoming more vocal about the disadvantages faced by Black communities when it comes to knowledge and resources to combat the disease. “Chad’s case was not unique, and I was shocked to find out that information. Livid.” Connecting with individuals who understand the experience was healing; she also came to understand that her presence was healing for other people. “I wanted to approach this group not as the partner of a famous person, but as a widow who had lost her husband to colorectal cancer. I felt for the first time part of this community.”THIS WEEK, one of Boseman’s plays, Deep Azure, is being revived for a nine-week run at Shakespeare’s Globe theatre in London. It will be the biggest professional production of the piece since Boseman himself first staged it more than 20 years ago. The play tells the story of the aftermath of the death of an unarmed Black man, Deep, who is murdered by a police officer. It mirrors a real life situation Boseman experienced while studying at Howard University. His friend, fellow student Prince Jones, was murdered by a Black police officer in September 2000. “It’s about what’s happening to the characters and how they’re dealing with their grief both individually and collectively,” says director Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu. “Survival is demanded of us, but how do we get there?” There is something poetic about staging Boseman’s play about grieving a prominent Black man in the wake of an untimely death in this moment.Deep Azure is not an immediately obvious choice for Shakespeare’s Globe. London-based Fynn-Aiduenu discovered the script in an anthology of plays, while researching hip-hop theatre in early 2020. Fynn-Aiduenu also found out that Boseman had strong links not only to the UK theatre scene, but also to Shakespeare specifically. He studied the Bard at Balliol College, Oxford, with the British American Drama Academy – paid for by Denzel Washington – an opportunity facilitated by the actor Phylicia Rashad, who was a teacher and mentor to Boseman during his time at Howard.“I want audiences to celebrate and be inspired by the multifaceted life of Chadwick Boseman, which includes his playwriting,” says the director. “I want to create a safe space in which to explore Black communal grief.”Ledward Boseman didn’t read the play until after Boseman’s death. It has only ever been professionally performed once – in a 2005 production by Congo Square Theatre Company in Chicago. “I think, like most artists, sometimes it can be hard to share things that are from so long ago because it doesn’t always feel like they still represent who you are now as an artist. And then after he passed, it was really difficult to read the play. To see him. In the end, it was incredibly healing for me, but I had to take it in very small steps.” She has had some involvement in the London production – mostly approving edits to help contextualise the play for a British audience, but is yet to get to the end of the script – both because “it was just challenging to read and also because I still want to be surprised”. In their relationship, Boseman routinely kept the details of his projects under wraps while he was working on them so that she could experience the work as an audience member. Not reading all of the play is her way of continuing to honour that tradition.View image in fullscreenThe couple on holiday.Photograph: Courtesy of Simone Ledward BosemanWe had to lean on each other so heavily, and we got so close. And, oh my God – he was just so beautiful!She remembers 2018 as the couple’s best year together. Black Panther had made $1.3bn on its initial release, breaking numerous box office records. It was the most successful launch for a non-sequel superhero film. “They were opening up theatres in countries where movies had been banned for 20 years just so people could watch this movie. He had worked so hard to make it what it was. And it was this full circle moment in his life where he got to use so much knowledge that he had been gathering over the last two decades in this film. A beautiful, beautiful moment,” she says.But the main reason Ledward Boseman thinks so fondly of that year is that for the majority of it, Boseman was cancer-free. Getting through the two years following the initial diagnosis really galvanised their relationship. “We had to lean on each other so heavily, and we got so close. And, oh my God – he was just so beautiful! He’d been doing all those Black Panther workouts and he was just, sofine!” She elongates the vowel sounds in the word, as if the one syllable does not adequately convey the level of attractiveness she is trying to describe.Remission gave Boseman a renewed zest for life: “Imagine you’re ready to live a hundred times beyond what you’ve already been doing. Our appreciation for each other, his appreciation for his own time – it was just a really, really beautiful year. We were travelling, seeing the world, and we were so in love.” At the end of that year, the cancer had not only returned, but progressed, and the couple found themselves teetering between pragmatism and faith. “To acknowledge what might happen almost felt like a betrayal of that faith. So there wasn’t any talk around him not making it.”We found a way to celebrate in the midst of all this sadness, and hopelessness, and griefIf Ledward Boseman has any regrets, this is one of them. “Sometimes I wish we had been able to talk about those things, so that he could even start to dream about it – and look at death with less fear. I would have liked to be more comfortable asking him what he wanted. Not just for himself, but for me, for his family. When we did talk about it, he told me it made him happy to know we were going to be OK.”The two of them first started talking about marriage in the aftermath of the diagnosis in 2016, “when it was early and we weren’t scared of it. It was all full steam ahead, but then he started to express some concerns about the ‘what ifs’. They’re such hard conversations to have – but I had to explain that it wasn’t going to hurt less if we weren’t married.” They finally got engaged in the autumn of 2019, after which Boseman’s health quickly took a turn for the worse. There was no doubt that one of the things he wanted to do in the time he had left was get married. When describing their wedding, the first thing Ledward Boseman thinks to say is that it was a hard day. There’s a long silence before she continues, “We found a way to celebrate in the midst of all this sadness, and hopelessness, and grief.” The gathering was small: her sister helped her get ready; her parents walked her down the aisle.View image in fullscreenHair and makeup: Moni SebestyenPhotograph: Jessica Chou/The GuardianIt would be wrong to assume Ledward Boseman now has little time for anything but serving her husband’s legacy. She is clear that’s not the case: “He would be upset if I made my life about his life.” She recently moved from Los Angeles back to Vallejo to be closer to family. She’s deep in the planning stages of her first business venture – a neighbourhood wine bar in her home city. She’s also been working on her music career as a singer under her artist name, sahn, performing around the US – including at the Apollo Music Café in New York. Her second album, the garden, will be released in May this year.“From the point I met Chad, it’s been hard to talk about myself and my work without talking about him. He just changed my whole life and my perspective of my life – he was my most important spiritual teacher. My mother laid the foundation for my spirituality and my artistic practice, but Chad expanded that view astronomically.”And she loves talking about Boseman, because she says to talk about him is to remember him. “I love knowing that he lived and his spirit still does. I love being able to commune with him in the spirit now, which is the hardest thing about grief – trying to rebuild a connection you once had in the physical that you now only have in the spiritual. There’s this poem that I read very early on that speaks about continuing to say their name –” She stops to do an internet search for the poem, Death is Nothing at All by Henry Scott Holland, and then reads: “Call me by the old familiar name. Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. Put no difference in your tone. Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.”Deep Azure runs until 11 April at the Globe theatre’s Sam Wanamaker Playhouse,shakespearesglobe.comExplore more on these topicsChadwick BosemanBlack PantherMarvelCancerHealthinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But the loss of the man seen as thearchitect of Starmer’s rise to poweris a huge blow. The focus is now set to turn once again to the decision made by the prime minister to appoint Mandelson.View image in fullscreenMcSweeney (right) and Mandelson last June. The departing chief of staff said he took ‘full responsibility’ for his advice on the US ambassadorial appointment.Photograph: Tayfun SalciSenior Labour sources said McSweeney’s departure had left the prime minister dangerously exposed as he headed towards aseries of policy and electoral challenges– including the Gorton and Denton byelection later this month – that could determine his political fate.A source close to Downing Street said: “Keir has just lost his firewall, on Mandelson and a whole load of other issues. Where does he think the anger gets directed next?”Keir Starmer’s next steps: what hurdles must the prime minister now negotiate?Read moreOne MP said: “The buck ultimately stops with the PM. All this has done has bought him a little more time but he’s mortally wounded and it’s not if, it’s when he goes.”Senior government figures said the pressure would only increase on Starmer with the expected release of hundreds of thousands of documents, including private WhatsApp messages and emails between Mandelson, No 10 officials and ministers while he was in Washington.One well-placed source said the documents would show that the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team had warned of the serious reputational risk of appointing Mandelson given his publicly known links with Epstein.The loss of McSweeney is a blow to Starmer, who had come to rely on his political judgment, often over his own, despite No 10 regularly coming under fire as a result. The pair were understood to have had several conversations over the last few days about McSweeney’s future before reaching agreement on Sunday that he should go.Political opponents and senior figures inside theLabourparty accused the prime minister of leaving McSweeney to carry the can over Mandelson’s appointment when ultimately it came down to Starmer’s own political judgment. Allies of McSweeney said it was wrong to suggest he had pushed for the appointment, with one saying: “He gave his advice, but that’s all it was. Keir made the decision.”In a statement on Sunday, McSweeney said: “After careful reflection, I have decided to resign from the government. The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself. When asked, I advised the prime minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice. In public life responsibility must be owned when it matters most, not just when it is most convenient. In the circumstances, the only honourable course is to step aside.”He said the vetting process for appointments needed “fundamental overhaul” after the Mandelson affair. “This cannot simply be a gesture but a safeguard for the future,” he said.Downing Street staff received an email on Sunday evening confirming Starmer had askedJill Cuthbertson and Vidhya Alakeson, McSweeney’s deputies, to take over as acting chiefs of staff, with immediate effect.Since Labour entered power, McSweeney has been a lightning rod for discontent among some backbenchers and grassroots members who were uncomfortable with his style and the direction the party was taking on issues including immigrationand welfare cuts.A senior MP said: “It’s about time. McSweeney was behind a string of terrible decisions because he cannot behave anything other than factionally. The PM needs to grip this and bring in a much wider range of voices than those he’s listened to up to now.”A series of senior Labour politicians had lined up to criticise the No 10 operation over the weekend. The former prime minister Gordon Brown said Starmer was a man of integrity but had been “slow to do the right things”.David Blunkett said the situation was “dire” for Starmer and that McSweeney needed to go. But the former home secretary also warned allies ofAngela Rayner and Wes Streetingto stop the briefing wars. “When people see a party acting like ferrets in a sack they draw their conclusions,” he said.Others shared concerns that Starmer was not up to the task. One former New Labour cabinet minister said: “Although there may be some satisfaction at Morgan’s resignation, my concern is the problem is Keir, not his advisers.”Friends of McSweeney told the Guardian he planned to step away from politics for a period but that he was unlikely to stay on the sidelines for good. “Morgan has been doing this for 25 years, I’m sure he’ll get more involved again in future, but not right now,” one said.McSweeney said in his statement: “This has not been an easy decision. Much has been written and said about me over the years but my motivations have always been simple: I have worked every day to elect and support a government that puts the lives of ordinary people first and leads us to a better future for our great country. Only a Labour government will do that.“I leave with pride in all we have achieved mixed with regret at the circumstances of my departure. But I have always believed there are moments when you must accept your responsibility and step aside for the bigger cause.”Starmer said on Sunday he owed McSweeney a “debt of gratitude”. He said in a statement: “He turned our party around after one of its worst ever defeats and played a central role running our election campaign. It is largely thanks to his dedication, loyalty and leadership that we won a landslide majority and have the chance to change the country.”The prime minister had expressed confidence in his former right-hand man asrecently as Thursday. McSweeney is the second Downing Street chief of staff to stand down, afterSue Gray quit in 2024, and it is the latest in a slew of departures from No 10 in recent months.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, said the prime minister should “take responsibility” for his actions. “It’s about time. But once again with this PM it’s somebody else’s fault: ‘Mandelson lied to me’ or ‘Morgan advised me’.Keir Starmerhas to take responsibility for his own terrible decisions. But he never does.”Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerLabour party leadershipMorgan McSweeneyPeter MandelsonnewsShareReuse this content"

As Epstein came under scrutiny for sex trafficking allegations in 2019, he asked Chomsky for advice on how to respond. “I’ve watched the horrible way you are being treated in the press and public. It’s painful to say, but I think the best way to proceed is to ignore it,” Chomskywrote in a messagesigned “Noam” that Epstein shared in email with an associate.Newly released files shed new light on Chomsky and Epstein relationshipRead more“What the vultures dearly want is a public response, which then provides a public opening for an onslaught of venomous attacks, many from just publicity seekers or cranks of all sorts,”Noam Chomskywrote in the message. “That’s particularly true now with the hysteria that has developed about abuse of women, which has reached the point that even questioning a charge is a crime worse than murder.”Noam Chomsky isone of severalprominent people who were revealed to be in friendly communication with Epstein even after his 2008 guilty plea. Many now face renewed scrutiny over their ties to the disgraced financier.Some of Noam Chomsky’s communications with Epstein took place after the Miami Heraldpublished a bombshell story in 2018detailing how Epstein preyed on underage girls and received an unusually lenient plea deal in 2008. On Saturday, Valeria Chomsky acknowledged the couple had read that story, but said the couple wasn’t aware of the extent of Epstein’s crimes until after hissecond arrest in July 2019.“We were careless in not thoroughly researching his background. This was a grave mistake, and for that lapse in judgment, I apologize on behalf of both of us. Noam shared with me, before his stroke, that he felt the same way,” she said (Chomsky suffered a massive stroke in 2023). “It was deeply disturbing for both of us to realize we had engaged with someone who presented as a helpful friend but led a hidden life of criminal, inhumane, and perverted acts.”Valeria Chomsky is the linguist’s second wife; they married in 2014.She said Chomsky’s 2019 advice to Epstein on rehabilitating his image should be understood “in context”.“Epstein had claimed to Noam that he [Epstein] was being unfairly persecuted, and Noam spoke from his own experience in political controversies with the media. Epstein created a manipulative narrative about his case, which Noam, in good faith, believed in,” she said in her statement. “It is now clear that it was all orchestrated, having as, at least, one of Epstein’s intentions to try to have someone like Noam repairing Epstein’s reputation by association.“Noam’s criticism was never directed at the women’s movement; on the contrary, he has always supported gender equity and women’s rights. What happened was that Epstein took advantage of Noam’s public criticism towards what came to be known as ‘cancelling culture’ to present himself as a victim of it,” she added.From New York to New Mexico: new Epstein files shed light on his sprawling ranch outside Santa FeRead moreAnother message from Noam Chomsky released by the House oversight committeelast yearshowed Chomsky saying it was a “most valuable experience” to have “regular contact” with Epstein (it’s unclear if the message was ever sent to anyone). Other messages released by the justice department show Epstein sharing a phallic joke with Chomsky, and Chomsky “fantasizing about the Caribbean island”.Valeria Chomsky said that the couple attended dinners at Epstein’s townhouse in New York City, stayed at his apartments there and in Paris, had dinner at his ranch in New Mexico, and attended multiple academic gatherings with him. She said they “never went to his island or knew about anything that happened there”.Noam and Epstein were introduced in 2015 and that the couple was unaware of Epstein 2008 guilty plea to solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18, Valeria Chomsky said. She said Epstein presented himself as a philanthropist interested in science.“By presenting himself this way, Epstein gained Noam’s attention, and they began corresponding. Unknowingly, we opened a door to a Trojan horse,” she said. “Epstein began to encircle Noam, sending gifts and creating opportunities for interesting discussions in areas Noam has been working on extensively. We regret that we did not perceive this as a strategy to ensnare us and to try to undermine the causes Noam stands for.”Valeria Chomsky also clarified the basis for two financial transactions between Chomsky and Epstein. On one occasion, Epstein sent Noam Chomsky a $20,000 check as part of a linguistic challenge Chomsky developed, she said. She also said Epstein helped Noam recover $270,000. Epstein helped after Noam Chomsky discovered “inconsistencies in his retirement resources that threatened his economic independence and caused him great distress”.Epstein offered to help and did so “likely as part of a machination to gain greater access to Noam. Epstein acted solely as a financial advisor for this specific matter. To the best of my knowledge, Epstein never had access to our bank or investment accounts.” She said neither of them – individually or as a couple – had investments with Epstein’s office.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinNoam ChomskyUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The Met Office said that “10-15mm of rain is likely fairly widely with 20-30mm in some places exposed to the strong south to south-easterly winds”.Monday’s weather warning covers parts of England where communities are still recovering from extensive flooding caused by heavy downpours in the wake ofStorm Chandra.The Environment Agency issued 96 flood warnings across England on Sunday evening, indicating flooding was expected. A further 219 flood alerts were issued in areas where flooding was possible. Four more flood alerts were issued by Natural Resources Wales.Homes, businesses and roads could be flooded in areas covered by Monday’s warning for rain, the Met Office said, adding that travel disruption was expected.Temperatures were expected to reach double figures across parts of the Midlands, eastern England and the south east so it “might feel relatively pleasant for February”, Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said.He added: “Out towards the west here we have another area of rain pushing in through the afternoon, with the wind strengthening, particularly in the south west. The winds are coming in from a south-easterly direction, so it is coming on to coasts that have been particularly affected by recent storms. There will be some heavy rain and the rain is falling on saturated ground so further flooding is possible, particularly as we move into the evening.”Morgan said there could “potentially be some surface water on the roads for Monday evening’s rush hour and some difficult driving conditions” for parts of Wales, central southern England and towards the south east.The Environment Agency estimated on Saturday that “at least 300 properties have been recorded as flooded”, while about 16,200 were protected by flood defences.Sarah Cook, the flood duty manager at the agency, said: “Significant ongoing groundwater flooding impacts remain probable in parts of Dorset and Wiltshire, with minor impacts probable for parts of Hampshire for the next five days, and West Sussex from Saturday.”The agency said its teams had been “mobilised across the country to check on other flood defences, clear any river blockages and closely monitor river levels”.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherFloodingnewsShareReuse this content"

The US constitution gives states the power to set election rules and says Congress can pass laws to set requirements for federal elections. The constitution gives the president no authority over how elections are run.Trump suggests Republicans should ‘take over’ elections to protect the partyRead more“What Donald Trump wants to do is try and nationalize the election – translation: steal it. And we’re not going to let it happen,” Jeffries said during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union. He added that Democrats so far had successfully blocked Trump’s efforts tofederalize the national guardcountered anationwide pushby Republicans to redraw congressional district boundaries to their advantage.“This is going to be a free and fair election,” Jeffries said. It “is going to be conducted like every other election where states and localities have the ability to administer the laws”.TheTrump administrationfor months has been sowing doubt about the integrity of this year’s midterm elections byfiling lawsuitsagainst states suggesting they are improperly maintaining their voter rolls. The FBI also undertook an unprecedented raid of the election office in Fulton county, Georgia,last month, seizing ballots and other voter information related to the 2020 election. Allegations of fraud have been debunked repeatedly in Fulton county, yet Trump has continued to repeat false claims about the county.Later in his interview on CNN, Jeffries condemned Trump’srefusal to apologizefor a racist post on his Truth Social account depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes. The White Housedeleted the poston Friday amid widespreadoutcryand said a staffer was responsible for posting it.Alarm bells sound over Trump’s ‘take over the voting’ callRead more“He definitively needs to apologize. It was a disgusting video and the president was rightly and appropriately and forcefully denounced by people all across the country,” Jeffries said. “Democrats and even a handful of Republicans who finally showed some backbone in pushing back against the president’s malignant, bottom-feeder-like behavior.”Senator Adam Schiff of California also said it was clear Trump was trying to interfere in the election and alsoquestioned whyTulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, was at the Fulton county raid.“He fully intends to try to subvert the elections. He will do everything he can to suppress the vote. And if he loses the vote, and I think the Republicans now expect they’ll get a real drubbing in the midterms, he’s prepared to try to take some kind of action to overturn the result. And we really shouldn’t question that,” Schiff said during an appearance on ABC’s This Week. “I think all of this is intended to send a message. And the message is: ‘We will not tolerate or accept an election that we lose.’”Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice-chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, also condemned Gabbard’s presence at the Fulton county raid saying on Sunday he was concerned Trump was trying to interfere in the midterms.“We have not been informed of any foreign nexus. The job of the director of national intelligence is to be outward facing about foreigners, not about Americans,” he saidduring an interviewon Face The Nation on CBS. “My fear is now [Trump] sees the political winds turning against him, and he’s going to try to interfere in the 2026 election, something a year ago I didn’t think would be possible.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsDemocratsDonald TrumpHakeem JeffriesUS CongressTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

With nearly 70% of votes counted, Seguro garnered 64%. Ventura trailed behind at 36%, still likely to secure a much stronger result than the 22.8% his anti-immigration Chega party achieved in last year’s general election. Ballots in large cities such as Lisbon and Porto are counted towards the end.Two exit polls placed Seguro in the 67%-73% range and Ventura at 27%-33%.Last year, Chega became the second-largest parliamentary force, overtaking the Socialists and landing behind the centre-right ruling alliance, which garnered 31.2%.Despite his loss on Sunday, 43-year-old Ventura, a charismatic former TV sports commentator, can now boast increased support, reflecting the growing influence of the far right in Portugal and much ofEurope.“The entire political system, across both right and left, united against me,” Ventura told reporters as he left a Catholic mass in central Lisbon. “Even so ... I believe the leadership of the right has been defined and secured today. I expect to lead that political space from this day forward.“Seguro has cast himself as the candidate of a “modern and moderate” left who can actively mediate to avert political crises and defend democratic values. He received backing from prominent conservatives after the first round amid concerns over what many see as Ventura’s populist, authoritarian tendencies.Portugal’s presidency is a largely ceremonial role but holds some important powers, including the ability to dissolve parliament under certain circumstances. Ventura had said he would be a more “interventionist” president, advocating increased powers for the head of state.View image in fullscreenAntónio José Seguro surrounded by flag-waving supporters at a campaign event in Porto.Photograph: Rita Franca/ReutersSeguro has positioned himself as a moderate candidate who will cooperate with Portugal’s centre-right minority government, repudiating Ventura’s anti-establishment and anti-immigrant tirades.The longstanding Socialist politician has won the support of other mainstream politicians on the left and rightwho want to halt the rising populist tide.Storm-battered Portugal heads to polls as rivals unite to keep out far rightRead moreIn Portugal, the president is largely a figurehead with no executive power. Traditionally, the head of state stands above the political fray, mediating disputes and defusing tensions.However, the president is an influential voice and has some powerful tools at their disposal, being able to veto legislation from parliament, although the veto can be overturned. The head of state also possesses what in Portuguese political jargon is called an “atomic bomb”, the power to dissolve parliament and call early elections.In May, Portugal held its third general election in three years in the country’s worst bout of political instability for decades, and steadying the ship is a key challenge for the next president.View image in fullscreenAndré Ventura looks on during a campaign stop in Alcacer do Sal.Photograph: Pedro Nunes/ReutersVentura, an eloquent and theatrical politician, has rejected political accommodation in favour of a more combative stance. One of his main targets has been what he calls excessive immigration, as foreign workers have become more conspicuous in Portugal in recent years. “Portugal is ours,” he said.During the campaign, Ventura put up billboards across the country that said: “This isn’t Bangladesh” and “Immigrants shouldn’t be allowed to live on welfare.”Although he founded Chega less than seven years ago, its rise in public support made it the second-largest party in Portugal’s parliament in the 18 May general election.In March, the winner will replace the centre-right president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who has served the limit of two five-year terms.Explore more on these topicsPortugalEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

He single-handedly dragged us back to electability and propelled us into government. We would still be facing irrelevance or even extinction without him.”Critics, however – many of them Labour MPs – say McSweeney ran a male-dominated cabal at the heart of Downing Street that ignored the opinions of elected members and prioritised battling the left over governing.They say McSweeney’s determination to champion the credentials of his former mentor Mandelson shows that he valued favouring his friends and political fellow travellers over serving the prime minister’s best interests.They also seethe recent revelationthat Labour Together – the thinktank McSweeney once led – once commissioned an investigation into journalists reporting on its funding as further evidence of a culture of unethical behaviour.“It is very consistent with the cowboy behaviour of Morgan,” said one Labour MP, referring to the Labour Together investigation, which McSweeney did not commission but has not denied knowing about. “There is a pattern of pretty indefensible behaviour.”Clive Lewis, the Labour MP for Norwich South, said: “Morgan McSweeney’s resignation should not be treated as a cleansing moment. He was not an aberration. He was the tip of an iceberg.“What he represents is a political culture that has dominated Labour for a generation. A culture forged under Blair and Mandelson that taught the party to be relaxed about extreme wealth, comfortable in the orbit of billionaires, lobbyists and corporate power, and increasingly detached from the lives of the people it was created to represent.”McSweeney’s departure should relieve pressure on Starmer in the short term. His sacking was one of the main demands of the Tribune group of MPs from the soft left.But some believe that it also removes an important obstacle to the eventual downfall of Starmer himself. Without his right-hand man around, the prime minister will have to accept a greater share of the blame should Labour lose the Gorton and Denton byelection and face heavy losses at the subsequent local elections.“Keir has nobody left to blame, he has lost his firewall,” said one MP. “But then, maybe McSweeney’s departure also removes the need for a firewall.”Luke Sullivan, Starmer’s former head of political strategy, said: “This is a big moment, but I don’t know how it helps other than buying Starmer some time.“Morgan is a lightning rod – some people think he’s a genius, others that he’s to blame for everything. I don’t think any individual can be under pressure as much as this if they’re not an elected politician.”One thing is certain: with leadership speculation already at fever pitch, those pushing to oust the prime minister are unlikely to be deterred.“Like a wounded animal, this government will drag itself away as it’s hacked at and pecked at till it expires, probably after the May locals,” said one leftwing Labour backbencher. “By then Starmer can resign on the grounds of those losses and not the reputational disaster of Epstein and Mandelson.“It won’t matter though. Starmer will go down as the worst PM in Labour history and one that may have finally broken it. He’s a coward who refuses to take responsibility for his own actions. He is a moral gravity-well from which neither decency, honesty or integrity can escape. A genuine disaster for this country and the Labour movement.”Explore more on these topicsMorgan McSweeneyKeir StarmerLabouranalysisShareReuse this content"

This show lacks the dread of William Golding’s novelLucy ManganSun 8 Feb 2026 17.00 ESTShareWhat, you wonder, could possibly have prompted the powers that be to commission an adaptation of a postwar allegory that throws into dreadful relief the impulse to tyranny, the fragility of democracy and the brittleness of our veneer of civilisation in this shining year of 2026? We may never know. Did I mention it takes place on an island in which all normal social rules no longer apply and the inhabitants are protected from any punishment or consequence, no matter what appetites emerge? Hmm. Well, on we go.Here it is, Jack Thorne’s take – after his triumphant Adolescence – on William Golding’s endlessly harrowing 1954 classic and GCSE staple for the past 30 years, Lord of the Flies. It was his debut novel and born of his reaction to reading RM Ballantyne’s Victorian classic of heroic derring-do, The Coral Island, to his children in the late 40s. That paean to noble and manly virtues from the golden age of optimism hit differently by then, so Golding asked his wife if he should write a book about what would happen if a group of boys were stranded on an island together and behaved how a group of boys stranded on an island together really would behave. She encouraged him to give it a shot. He borrowed character names and made other references to Ballantyne’s book in his own, but Golding’s story is its dark counterpoint; a suggestion that if men are left to rule the world untrammelled there will soon not be many of them, or much of the world, left to dominate. I know – what an imagination, right?Thorne’s four-part adaptation brings a different character to the forefront in each episode. We open with Piggy (David McKenna, giving a brilliant performance in his first screen role) coming to after the crash that has stranded the planeload of boys on a tropical island. His all-important specs are intact. So far. Oh Piggy.He meets Ralph (Winston Sawyers) and they gather the rest of the castaways. Including, alas, the choirboys led by Jack (Lox Pratt) – a child with an innate understanding of human weakness and how to exploit it. As Piggy fights to have his sensible words heard about the need to take care of “the littluns”, and to establish a signal fire, toilets and shelter, Jack establishes himself as the head of the hunters and a darkly charismatic alternative to Ralph’s unshowy leadership.View image in fullscreenAnticipatory dread … Ralph (Winston Sawyers), Piggy (David McKenna), Eric (Cassius Flemyng) and Sam (Noah Flemyng).Photograph: BBC/Eleven/Lisa TomasettiFrom there we move into the main pig-meat of Golding’s tale: the battle between might and right that develops as the majority of boys shuck off first their clothes and manners and then their morals to unite under bloodthirsty Jack, preferring hunting, feasts and fun to the duller work of gathering, maintaining a fire and staying disciplined. Suspicions and paranoia bloom, rogue quasi-religious beliefs take hold and one boy feels the freedom to unleash the murderous instincts that Golding reckoned we all harbour, albeit with some finding them more readily than others.This all unfolds very slowly and remarkably wordlessly. Much of the run is given over to lingering shots of the idyllic landscape, or the boys playing, or the empty horizon with jangling strings playing over the top to heighten our anticipatory dread of the horrors to come. It all seems to depend rather a lot on familiarity with the story rather than instilling the dread in its own right. Every episode feels simultaneously bloated and thin, a feeling only reinforced by denaturing the otherwise saturated palette during the scenes of violence – primitive, you see? It feels like a gimmick trying to hide the absence of real emotion.When the words do come, they are not great. The script is unevocative – “You’re having a jolly good time, aren’t you?” says Simon (Ike Talbut) to Jack at one point. “This is a bad camp of bad people!” cries Ralph after the boys have split into tribes – and frequently unconvincing. “He has an enviable facility,” says Ralph of Piggy’s storytelling skills, for example.It also falls victim to the modern curse of psychology. All the main characters are explained by a neat backstory. Jack comes from a loveless household. Ralph’s alpha maleness is tempered by compassion because he comes from a secure home but his mother is ill. Simon is mentally fragile because his abusive father plays mind games with him and his mother, and so on.

It barely has enough energy for the MI5-based partsJack SealeSun 8 Feb 2026 17.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 17.02 ESTShareAdd the Guardian on GoogleJohn Hughes (Shaun Evans) has been a spy for 20 years, but a life of enviable glamour still eludes him. Within minutes of him being introduced to us, he is on his back outside a motorway service station, shock and blood on his face. Two corpses – an informant, and a hitman who killed the informant and then lost a grim fight to the death with John – are lying beside him under a dull grey sky.Back at MI5 HQ, a reprimand awaits. John’s meeting with his doomed contact – on a promise of intel involving a possible foreign threat to national security – was yet another op conducted without following the proper protocols. Part of his punishment is to be given a new partner, Mehreen (Zahra Ahmadi), parachuted in from MI6 over John’s head: once she has taken over the case, his bosses want John out. John keeps investigating regardless.Betrayal is an espionage thriller so drab and downbeat, it plays more like a crime drama. John is a maverick with a complicated personal life, an irascible dinosaur pursuing his last quarry before the stiff shirts in head office finally manage to manoeuvre him into redundancy. It’s just that instead of his iconoclastic rule-breaking being in service of catching local murderers, John may be the only man who can stop Iran carrying out a major terror attack.Like all renegade sleuths, John has a longsuffering spouse castigating him whenever he makes one of his occasional, half-hearted returns to the home that can never stimulate him as much as being out there, in the field, bringing down villains. Sharing John’s expensive but sad Victorian semi in London is a better-drawn other half than most, even if our first meeting with her is a big old cliche: Claire (Romola Garai) tersely rings John when he’s in the middle of a stressful fiasco at work, to remind him he is at that minute supposed to be attending their couple’s counselling session.As a GP, Claire has her own difficult and time-consuming job, yet it always seems to be her who has to run the house and look after the kids. Well, it’s Claire and the au pair, but still: John is too wrapped up in his terribly special vocation to lower himself to domestic or emotional labour, and his tactic of defusing every complaint with humour or an airy, calm-down-love dismissal lost its currency a decade ago. Garai gets it perfectly: the main emotion she gives Claire isn’t anger but deep, bitter fatigue. That woman is TIRED.View image in fullscreenRomola Garai plays the longsuffering wife.Photograph: ITVYet when your drama’s protagonist has an extraordinary job where lives are on the line, how gritty and believable can their personal woes plausibly be? Betrayal’s selling point is that it commits as fully to the portrait of a relationship in distress as it does to the spy adventures, but it’s not an easy marriage. Working in an MI5 terror unit, where unexpectedly staying late can be rather non-negotiable and keeping secrets from your other half is a legal requirement, is one profession where behaving as John does is understandable, even more than it would be if he were out solving regular crimes. Garai’s excellent portrayal of a neglected wife feels like it belongs in a different genre of drama altogether.Betrayal tries to square the circle by making the thriller part of the show dour as well, locating the action in dirty car parks, flat-roofed pubs, musty B&Bs and high streets littered with crap takeaway joints. Oblique, Ipcress File camera angles accentuate the malaise. It’s all as bilious and knackered as John, whose time in the office is a series of tetchy face-offs marked by him railing against sissy modernity: his cracks about MI5’s patchy mental health provision, and his sarcastic comment that it is “deeply problematic” when someone offers him tea without an option for almond milk, go down poorly.What with all that and the arduous visits to John’s unhappy home, there’s not much energy for a spy plot. Our man plants trackers, leans on sources, survives interrogations and hacks laptops, but not in a storyline that has much speed or complexity. The dialogue regularly resorts to gobs of exposition to fill gaps, and both the first two episodes get to their closing cliffhangers via the cheeky shortcut of suddenly revealing key information to us but not to John, whose eyes we are otherwise seeing through. The twist that arrives halfway is guessable because not enough has happened for there to be all that many possibilities.Like his co-star Garai, Shaun Evans succeeds more in spite of the material he’s given than because of it, bringing a bewildered vulnerability to John’s struggle to be better. John doesn’t like who he is; Betrayal isn’t sure what it is.Betrayal aired on ITV1 and is available on ITVXExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

Epstein’s nearly10,000-acre(4,000-hectare) property – known as Zorro ranch – was dotted with cholla cactus and Angus cattle, and came to include a 26,700 sq ft mansion, as well as a private runway and hangar.For years, Epstein abused teenage girls and young women on this ranch with impunity, according to testimony from several women. In court proceedings, survivors detailed horror after horror they say unfolded on this isolated expanse of land.Authorities searched many of Epstein’s other properties over the years – hisNew York townhouse,private Caribbeanisland,Palm Beach estateandParis apartment– but state and local officials said they were not aware of any federal search of the ranch.Hector Balderas, New Mexico’s attorney general at the time of Epstein’s 2019 arrest, said that in 2019 his office “investigated activity that occurred inNew Mexicothat was still viable for prosecution, including contact with multiple victims”. But, he said, the US attorneys in New York handling the federal investigation “asked that we hold any further state investigation or prosecution of activity related to Epstein, as they communicated to us that they were already leading an active multi-jurisdictional prosecution”.Emailsreleasedby the justice department last week as part of a large set of documents related to Epstein also suggest that a search did not occur around the time of Epstein’s arrest. In September 2019, Manhattan federal prosecutors said that they spoke with the New Mexico attorney general’s office, who they said had “agreed to cease any investigation into sex trafficking and share whatever they had gathered regarding sex trafficking activity with our office”.View image in fullscreenEpstein’s Zorro ranch.Photograph: Department of JusticeView image in fullscreenEpstein’s Zorro ranch.Photograph: Department of JusticeIn a December 2019email, a prosecutor told a lawyer for one of Epstein’s estate co-executors that they had “not searched the New Mexico property”.The Department of Justice deferred inquiries from the Guardian to the FBI. The FBI’s main office, when asked whether they searched the property, said: “Unfortunately, we don’t have a comment.” The FBI office governing Santa Fe similarly said: “We have no comment at this time.”The Zorro ranch was a place where powerful men allegedly visited including a former governor of the state. It was also the proposed setting for Epstein’spreviously reportedplans to spread his DNA across the human race by impregnating as many women as possible.A Guardian review of the recently released documents has uncovered more details about the ranch, including never-before-seen photos, and about past law enforcement inquiries related to the property.Multiple women have said that Epstein abused them as teen girls or young adults on his New Mexico ranch.Among them is Jane, thefirst accuserto testify at Epstein accompliceGhislaine Maxwell’s sex-trafficking trial. Jane said that she met Epstein in 1994 while attending the Interlochen Center for the Arts, an esteemed youth arts camp in Michigan. When Maxwell and Epstein learned that Jane was from Palm Beach, they requested her mother’s phone number, she testified.Jane provided them with her mom’s contact information. When Jane returned from Interlochen, she and her mother were invited to tea.She started spending time with Epstein and Maxwell. Epstein started to sexually abuse Jane when she was 14.Jane said that she traveled with Epstein and Maxwell to New York City and New Mexico. “I just remember someone, at one point, just came into [my] room and said: ‘Jeffrey wants to see you,’ and then escorted me to see him,” she said. “I just, as usual, felt, like, my heart sink into my stomach, you know.”View image in fullscreenZorro ranch in New Mexico in 2019.Photograph: Zeitview/Reuters“I did not want to go see him,” said Jane, who recalled being 15 or 16 at the time. “I just remember being led to his bedroom and, you know, the same thing would happen.”Annie Farmer, the fourth accuser to testify at Maxwell’s sex-trafficking trial,saidthat the British socialite gave her a nude massage at the ranch when she was 16.During Maxwell’s trial, Farmer testified that the morning after this encounter with Maxwell, Epstein lumbered into bed with her and said he “wanted to cuddle” and she “felt kind of frozen”.“He pressed his body into me,” she said. Farmer testified that she told Epstein she needed the restroom, as to escape.Another woman identified as Jane Doesaidshe met Epstein during a school trip to New York City. At Epstein’s townhouse, his secretary allegedly took photos of her and told her that Epstein “really wanted to meet her”. A few weeks later, Jane Doe alleged that the secretary emailed that “Epstein was excited by the photos and that he was very interested in [her] ... ”.Jane Doe and her sister were invited to a magic show in Las Vegas and then Epstein’s ranch. After the magic show, they flew on Epstein’s plane to New Mexico. He was there “along with several young girls”, Jane Doe claimed.View image in fullscreenInterior of Epstein’s Zorro ranch.Photograph: Department of JusticeAt the ranch, Jane Doe said she was summoned to the main house and brought to Epstein’s bedroom. There, she alleged, Epstein was wearing a bathrobe and demanded a massage. She felt that Epstein wanted her to participate in sexual activity “but she did not know what it was. Epstein seemed to get frustrated as a result.” Epstein assaulted her with a device, she said in court papers.Virginia Giuffre, one of the most vocal Epstein accusers, was among those who said they were victimized at the ranch. Giuffre, who sued Maxwell for defamation after the British socialite accused her of lying, provided photos of herself at the ranch in a 2015court document.Giuffre said that Epstein trafficked her to powerful men at the ranch,includingthe late Bill Richardson, who served as New Mexico governor from 2003 to 2011.A spokesperson for Richardson, who died in 2023,previously saidthat the former governor never met Giuffre and that “these allegations and inferences are completely false” and that in his “limited interactions with Mr Epstein, he never saw him in the presence of young or underage girls”.Epsteinbought the secluded New Mexico propertyin1993from thefamilyof Bruce King, the state’s former three-time Democratic governor.Recordsshow that Epstein acquired the property through an entity named theZorro Trust, which later becameCypress Inc, and that the purchase included about 1,200 acres (485 hectares) of state land, leased for agricultural purposes.Undated photos in the batch of Epstein files released last week offer rare glimpses of life on the ranch: Epstein’s giant mansion, the stables, a vintage caboose and livestock, as well as Epstein himself on the land with dogs. Other images show young women, whose faces are redacted, riding horses, practicing archery and shooting.Several men also appear in the photos, including the late French modeling agentJean-Luc Brunel, linguist Noam Chomsky and film-maker Woody Allen. A representative for Allen did not respond to a request for comment about the image. Neither Chomsky nor Allen have been accused of criminal wrongdoing related to Epstein.In a lengthy statement, Valeria Chomsky, the second wife and spokesperson for Chomsky, said that they had lunch at Epstein’s ranch once, “in connection with a professional event”.“We attended social meetings, lunches, and dinners where Epstein was present and academic matters were discussed,” she said. “We never witnessed any inappropriate, criminal, or reproachable behavior from Epstein or others. At no time did we see children or underage individuals present.”After Epsteinpleaded guilty tostate prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including soliciting a minor in a controversial deal that let him avoid federal charges, the ranch provided a quiet retreat. That was until July 2019, when Epstein was chargedwith sex trafficking crimes in New York, and state officials quickly began taking a look at his desert ranch.Balderas, New Mexico’s then-attorney general,opened an investigationthat month, and Stephanie Garcia Richard, who was newly elected as the state’s commissioner of public land,providedsome 400 pages of lease documents to Balderas and began reviewing Epstein’s two state grazing leases.View image in fullscreenEpstein’s Zorro ranch.Photograph: Department of JusticeThat same month, theNew York Timesreported that Epstein had privately told scientists and business associates that he had hoped to use the ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm, and would give birth to his babies.In September 2019, Garcia Richardcancelled Epstein’s state grazing leases, citing obstructed inspections, misrepresentation in filings and that the attorney general had concluded that the entity may have obtained “the leases through illegitimate means for purposes other than ranching or agriculture”.“This land was no doubt used to protect the privacy of Epstein and his co-conspirators, and today we took steps to take back this public land,” Garcia Richard said at the time.Garcia Richard told the Guardian that the 1,200 acres have since been divided into two parcels. One, she said, has been considered for a number of uses, including a wildlife refuge area or as a “potential memorial site for girls and women who were harmed at the ranch”, while the other remains leasable.In 2021, Epstein’s estatelisted theremainingroughly 8,000 acresfor sale, including the residences and structures.The Wall Street Journal reportedthat the proceeds were set to go to his estate “including as necessary to compensate claimants, tax authorities, and creditors”.The property was soldin 2023to an LLC listed as San Rafael Ranch LLC. Later that year, the New Mexico attorney general Raúl Torrezannounceda $4.95mpledgeby Deutsche Bank – which, earlier that year, had agreed topay $75mto settle a lawsuit brought by a group of women who accused the German lender of helping facilitate Epstein’s sex-trafficking operations – to “fund additional resources to prevent, investigate, and prosecute human trafficking in the state of New Mexico”.The funding, officials said, stemmed from an investigation Torrez conducted into “various financial services companies and the role they played in failing to identify the sexual abuse and trafficking of underage girls” at Zorro ranch.While Epstein’s activities at Zorro ranch remained hidden from public view, records recently released by the Department of Justice indicate that federal authorities briefly took an interest in the property almost 20 years ago.In February 2007, as part of an investigationof child sex abusein Florida, records show that theFBI interviewed Epstein’s ranch managerat the New Mexico property.View image in fullscreenJeffrey Epstein.Photograph: Department of JusticePer the document, the ranch manager told the FBI that he and his wife had overseen the property for about four years, and that Epstein typically spent several weeks there in the summer, often accompanied by “his personal assistant, his bodyguard, friends, personal trainer, and sometimes his masseuses”.The interview ended abruptly, according to the agent. The investigator wrote that someone called the staff and instructed them that “they were no longer allowed to speak with us”.“The interview was immediately ended,” the report notes.Other than that, Epstein and his ranch appeared to have drawn little law enforcement scrutiny prior to his death. The Santa Fe county sheriff’s office, which has jurisdiction over the ranch, had records of several incidents on or around the property; none were related to alleged sex abuse.Records do show that Epstein registered with the Santa Fe county sheriff’s office as a sex offender on 17 August 2010, after being notified by the New Mexico department of public safety that they had received notification from Florida authorities about his conviction, and that he had to register with the state. But, records also show that the department of public safety informed him later that month that they had determined that,per state law, he was not required to register as a sex offender in New Mexico.Newly released files also include a2019 FBI tip reportstating that a “retired new mexico state police officer” – whose name is redacted – reported hearing “rumors” that the ranch was “used for recruited girls to visit with Epstein” but the FBI stated that he had “no factual evidence to support this claim”. The retired police officer also said that there had been a lot of “high profile people seen frequenting the property” and raised concerns about a newly constructed barn on the land.Aside from the 2019 investigation opened by the New Mexico attorney general’s office, but later put on hold at the behest of federal authorities, there appears to be no active state or local criminal investigations into what occurred at Zorro ranch, according to local prosecutors at the Santa Fe county sheriff’s office, and the state department of justice.But state officials are pushing for answers about what occurred there.Late last year, state lawmakers proposed a bipartisan “truth commission” to investigate what happened at the ranch. The state department of justice said it is working with the lawmakers.“This commission will specifically seek the truth about what officials knew, how crimes were unreported or reported, and how the state can ensure that this essentially never happens again,” Democratic state representative Andrea Romero of Santa Fe, who is leading the efforts,told a panel oflegislators in November. “There’s no complete record of what occurred.”Romero told the Guardian that, based on conversations with law enforcement and the attorney general’s office, it is her understanding that federal agents never searched the ranch.Epstein, she noted, “was here for 26-plus years, back and forth, in and out, and yet we have no actual story as to what went on”.View image in fullscreenA reproduction of The Massacre of the Innocents, by Dutch painter Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem, commissioned by Epstein.Photograph: Department of JusticeThe commission could be greenlighted by the state house as early as next week, she said.For now, the story of Epstein’s New Mexico ranch remains told in fragments: survivors’ accounts,property listingsand land records, as well as a growing archive of documents released by the Department of Justice.Among them are emails from 2011showingthat Epstein commissioned a$2,000reproduction of The Massacre of the Innocents, by Dutch painter Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem. The tableau depicts a biblical massacre of all male children in Bethlehem under age two.“It’s the large 9’x9’ canvas that we had rolled out for him to see in the entry way where they are killing babies,” one of Epstein’s assistantswritesto another one of his employees, to arrange shipping.

I’ve lost track of how many casts he’s had. He loves electric bikes and at various times this has led to a broken arm, a broken hand, a broken leg, a wide variety of cuts and grazes, and terrifyingly close calls with much worse.It also led to him getting a job as a delivery rider for the local Domino’s Pizza, which valued him for his speed (another broken wrist) and his ability to be cheerful in the face of unhinged customers. Once, after getting no answer when he buzzed a flat and phoned, he left a woman’s pizza on her doorstep. She called him “the scum of the earth” and promised he would lose his job and never get another one.“Have a nice evening,” he said, and sped away.The kindness of strangers: while we waited outside in the rain, a young boy brought us hot tea and cakeRead moreYou have to do a lot of shifts at Domino’s to save up enough money to take a girl to a fancy restaurant but this girl is worth it. She is smart and kind, with a smile as wide as the moon. They are at school together and the only time he has ever engaged me in conversation about a novel was when she was within earshot.Like most teenage boys, my son doesn’t tell me much about their relationship – it seems to have been on, then off, then maybe on again? – but there was no ambiguity when he booked the two of them into dinner at Fratelli Paradiso in Potts Point. We’d been there a few months earlier for his sister’s 18th birthday. It was the nicest restaurant he could think of. He wore a collared shirt and cologne.The restaurant is dark, chic and expensive. The tables are small and the waiters, mostly Italian, make you feel that you are all, together, part of something special. I’m sure the two of them felt this, though they didn’t dare order much. They shared some olives to start and one lasagne for main. They barely drank. But they talked and laughed, and had a lovely time.When my son went to pay, the waiter told him that the woman who had sat at the table next to theirs had paid $100 of their bill. She was by herself and they hadn’t exchanged a single word with her. She must have heard quite a lot of their conversation – the tables are close together – but with the obliviousness of all young lovers, they had barely noticed her. All my son could remember was she was blond and middle aged.“Like me?” I asked.“Yeah, kinda.”Who knows if either of them will ever see this woman in the street and have a chance to thank her for her random act of generosity. I know it’s unlikely she’ll ever read this but if she is: thank you. Thank you for making a special night even more special for these gorgeous young people. And thank you also for what you’ve given me.My son will probably never tell me much about this relationship. I have thought often about how much I would love to have sat there, as you did, listening in to snippets of their conversation, just to see how they are with each other when they think no one is watching. So it makes my heart full to think that, whatever you heard them say that night, it moved you enough to do something so spontaneously kind and generous.That’s enough detail for me.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

In some patches, just putting one foot in front of the other without plunging into the mire felt like a win.But Jon Barrett, a community engagement officer forthe Quantock Hills national landscape, had a broad grin on his face as he negotiated the ooze.“I know for some, mud may be their nemesis at this time of year but we’re trying to celebrate it, get people to embrace it,” Barrett said.Barrett and his colleagues are running aMonth of Mudfestival in February, inspired by the Anglo Saxon name for this time of year –Solmōnaþ, sometimes translated as “mud month” (a second possible translation is month of cakes).The landscape team is holding events ranging from squelchy hikes to art sessions in which participants are shown how to make mix the red-hued mud with honey to make paint. There will also be story-telling sessions focusing on earthy legends. “We’re keen to reconnect people with mud,” Barrett said.“Children love splashing through muddy puddles but I think adults can forget that joy. We want people to remember that feeling of freedom when you splash and stamp through muddy puddles.”February has turned out to be extremely muddy due to therepeated pulses of rainthat have hit the English West Country hard. Scores of people have been affected after theirhomes and businesses were flooded.There wereabout88 warnings and 223 alerts in England on Sunday, the Met Office said, mostly in the south-west and Midlands. In the south-west, it had rained nearly every day of 2026 so far, the Met Office added.But in the Quantocks they are determined to find the bright side.While accompanying Barrett on a hike aroundCothelstone Hill, near Taunton, where (in the summer) pied flycatchers and dark green fritillary butterflies flit about, it was clear this time of year was mostly about the mud.Trail runners enjoy the slippy paths here and tyre tracks show that mountain bikers make good use of the bridleways. “But we want to encourage more people to get out and walk,” Barrett said.View image in fullscreenJon Barrett and his team will be holding events ranging from squelchy hikes to art sessions showing people how to make paint with Quantocks mud.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianHe also likes people to get up close and personal with the mud. “I don’t mind getting it on my face and hands.” He happily smeared some across his cheeks, though he does not have any scientific evidence that the Quantocks mud has any particular skincare benefits.He extolled the aesthetics of this mud, in particular. “The soil is a lovely rich red. If you fall in the mud here, people can tell where you’ve been and at the end of the day your boots are covered in this red soil.”Barrett was sporting a natty pair of fleece-lined wellies made by the French bootmaker Aigle – though he pointed out they were a charity shop find.Barrett said he did not want to exclude anyone who did not have waterproof footwear. He hopes to attract not just hardened walkers but people who would not venture out in inclement weather.“We work with people who may only have one pair of shoes,” said Barrett. So some of the walks have a “five welly rating” – extremely muddy – while others a “one welly” – contact with mud optional.Andy Stevenson, a Quantock Hills ranger, said mud was a valuable habitat for some flora and fauna, from the brittle stars – echinoderms closely related to starfish – on the Somerset coast tothe earthworm.He said: “Mud created by people or grazing animals can also be beneficial for invertebrates such as bees and wasps to burrow into and drink from the shallow pools, or use as hunting grounds for their prey.View image in fullscreenBarrett hopes the event will allow people to get up close and personal with the mud.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“Once dry, the muddy patches or bare soil provide a bed for new plants. Wildflowers such as bluebells and primroses in woodlands may have been covered over but once the ground receives sunlight, water and warmth the plants will grow.”Extreme rainfall is becoming more common and more intense in many parts of the world because of climate breakdown.The Quantock team has noticed adders emerging fromhibernationmuch earlier than usual, possibly driven out of their burrows by flooding. Patrols have reported palmate newts, toads and frogs in greater numbers than usual.Dan Broadbent, a West Country storyteller, said mud provided a fertile topic for writers and poets.The Romantic poetSamuel Taylor Coleridge,who lived in Somerset in the late 18th century, wrote about being “stuck in the mire” and searching for “mud-lost sandals” inhis poem, Devonshire Roads.Broadbent said there were many stories from around the world in which humans were created from mud or earth.He likes the Anglo-Saxon idea of “mud month” and prefers to see it as a positive, hopeful thing. “Mud appears as the hard ground becomes softer and ready for ploughing and sowing after winter.“Mud, therefore, becomes something almost sacred, to do with regeneration and renewal. Mud can have a transformative power.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentUK weatherClimate crisisFestivalsSomersetWinterHeritagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Archive photograph: courtesy of Lewis CopeBorn in Hartlepool, County Durham, in 1995, Lewis Cope is an actor and dancer. Aged 13, he made his first stage appearance in the West End production of Billy Elliot the Musical. After competing on the series Got to Dance in 2013, he trained at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama. Cope has since appeared on television series such as Doctors and Vera, and in Emmerdale, as Nicky Miligan, from 2022 to 2024. He performs in theStrictly Come Dancinglive tour until 15 February.This is me in a dress, playingMichaelin Billy Elliot the Musical. Michael is Billy’s gay best friend – he wears his sister’s clothes without fear or shame, and is the one who inspires Billy to be whoever he wants to be. Being part of that story at such a young age was a complete eye-opener. It was also the point in my life when I realised my dream of performing was achievable, and that I was ready to do it.In spite of what I do for a living, I’ve never really craved being the centre of attention. I grew up in a family of 14 – eight brothers and five sisters – and I was number 10. There was never a quiet moment, and as the older ones grew up, they looked after the younger ones. Everyone chipped in. Our family home had two staircases, so you could go up one way and come down the other. There was a constant sense of movement: people coming in, people going out, parties happening, noise everywhere. Underneath all of that chaos was a strong sense of love.My mum always said I was very strong-minded. If I decided I was going to do something, then I would do it. But because there were so many of us, I was quite selfless and a good team player. Mainly I liked to work hard. Mum was a beautician and ran her salon out of one of the rooms in our house; she’d have a client in, then dash out to put food in the oven for the kids, somehow making everything work at once. She was brilliant at juggling everything without ever making it feel like a burden.Mika looks back: ‘Nowadays you wouldn’t get away with the things journalists said about my sexuality in the noughties’Read moreWith so many of us to entertain, Mum would often end up taking all of the kids to one activity: horse riding, football, boxing. One day she took me and my brothers to a dance class. I hated it but my brothers loved it. Mum told me I could either sit with her or join in. I figured I might as well give it a go. That decision, as small as it felt at the time, changed everything.When I started at secondary school,I stopped dancing. Back then, dancing didn’t feel cool and I wanted to fit in. So when my dance teacher told me auditions for Billy were happening in Newcastle, I flat-out refused. A few days later, though, I started thinking about it properly. I realised I was letting the fear of being judged stop me from doing something I loved. I never got bullied for wearing a dress, either. I had so many brothers, all doing boxing. If anyone tried anything, I always had backup.After I got the part, I had to move to London. When my mum dropped me off at the Billy house, she said she knew I’d be fine straight away. It reminded her of home: loads of kids, constant noise, organised chaos. We had house parents looking after us, drivers taking us to the theatre and teachers who home schooled us. I went from going to school to performing in front of 1,500 people in the West End each night – it was wild and surreal.One of my biggest challenges with dance was music. It wasn’t really a thing in our house. There was so much noise all the time that we never really needed a soundtrack playing in the background. As a result, I didn’t have a natural sense of rhythm. Eventually, the producers arranged drumming lessons to help me hear the beat properly. It took work, but I wasn’t going to shy away from that. I’d seen my mum’s work ethic growing up, and that stayed with me. If something needed effort, I was going to give everything to it.After Billy Elliot, there was the optionof going to a stage school such as Sylvia Young, but I wanted to go home and live a normal life again. When I was back in Hartlepool, I joined Ruff Diamond, a dance group made up of local boys. We were just a group of lads giving it a go, but somehow we got on to the TV competition show Got to Dance in 2013, performing hip-hop routines. We made it all the way to the final as runners-up.For a while, I seriously considered working on the railway. It’s mad how close I came to a different lifeAfter that, I had a moment of reckoning. I felt a bit of self-doubt and started asking myself what I was actually doing, and where I wanted my life to go. For a while, I seriously considered working on the railway doing cable pulling. It would have been easy to go down that route, not go to drama school and never do any of this. Looking back, it’s mad how close I came to a completely different life.Years later, I got a callabout anEmmerdaleaudition. I needed to do a self-tape, but I was on holiday at the time. I remember thinking, “Right, let’s just get this done so I can go to the beach.” I put effort into it, but I did it quickly and then forgot about it completely. I’d done so many self-tapes by that point that I’d learned not to hold on to hope. When you’re between roles, you can send off 10 tapes and hear nothing back. That silence messes with your head. You start wondering whether everything you’ve done was just a fluke, whether you should be doing something else entirely. The industry demands persistence and a strong sense of self-worth, especially when you’re not working. Then, in a moment, everything can change. Seven weeks later, Emmerdale called and asked me to come to Leeds. I did a screen test on Thursday, moved there on Sunday, and started work on Monday.Emmerdale reaches millions of people every night. The audience becomes incredibly familiar with you – so familiar that they feel like they know you personally. I’d be walking down the street and people would say, “Oh hi, Nicky!” You get so used to it, you almost go along with it.One of the best parts of getting Emmerdale was knowing it was my Nana Dot’s favourite programme, along with Vera. I’ve managed to work on both now. It feels like a pattern – if Nana likes the show, I end up on it. The same goes for Strictly.I’m 30 now, but I feel like a kidagain.Dancing nine hours a day, six days a week on Strictly really gave me a new lease of life. It lifted me emotionally and physically. Every week I convinced myself I wouldn’t get where I needed to be by Saturday. I’d say I felt stiff, that I looked daft, that I couldn’t move properly. Katya [Jones, his dance partner] always reminded me to look back at the week before and trust the process. You always get through it.If the 11-year-old version of me who auditioned for Billy Elliot could see where I am now, he’d be grateful I kept going. It hasn’t been easy. There were plenty of moments where I could have chosen not to do the scary thing and missed out on something great. And I can still feel the same buzz and energy I had back then. That’s something I never want to lose.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyStrictly Come DancingEmmerdaleTelevisionEntertainment TVSoap operafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Starmer and his cabinet had better grab itPolly ToynbeeIf he and his philosophy were to blame for the government’s ills, now it can change tack. There can be no more excusesSun 8 Feb 2026 12.42 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 14.41 ESTShareHere is something they can’t take away from him:Morgan McSweeneyis often credited for Labour’s remarkable turnaround from the abyss of the 2019 election to the astounding landslide of 2024. Few thought it could be done. The Tories did all they could to help, but it took clever strategy and ruthless tactics to pull off what no pollsters predicted in the immediate wake of Boris Johnson’s 80-seat majority. But it turned out that the skills that win election campaigns are not those that run a government.His resignationtoday will do little to shore up Keir Stamer’s precarious position. “Man or woman overboard!” has been the frequent cry from the decks of No 10. After just 18 months, here’s a roll call of the drowned, all from senior posts selected by Starmer with fanfare, only to make themwalk the plank: Sue Gray, Steph Driver, Liz Lloyd, James Lyons, Matthew Doyle, Nin Pandit, Paul Ovenden and probably more I’ve forgotten. It’s not a good look: in a company, shareholders would ask what was wrong with their CEO.McSweeney became the punch bag for everything that has gone wrong in the Labour party: it was ever harder to tell exactly when he was or wasn’t to blame. “I take full responsibility,” he says, for advisingthe disastrous Peter Mandelson appointment. As Mandelson’s protege, follower and third-way mimic, he tugged the party rightwards to chase votesfor ever lost to NigelFarage, when all the polls said go left, fetch back Green and Liberal Democrat supporters: the times had changed since his mentor’s hero days of 1997.No, it was not McSweeney’s responsibility: it was only the leader’s, as is every decision made around his cabinet table, but Starmer never had the political brain or impulses to see where danger lay, even when warned. U-turns have become the most memorable thing about his political style.There are three years left before the next general electionand a colossal majority, for whoever can take Labour forward now it has shed the Mandelson-McSweeney drag anchors pulling it towards the right. The party and potential candidates are nowhere near ready yet for a leadership election.The barring of Andy Burnhamfrom standing as an MP in the Gorton and Denton byelection so that he could not enter the contest will look worse as days go by. That none has dared step forward with a challenge in the last week of thiscrisis suggests the usual pusillanimity on the Labour benches, riven by factions, more afraid of losing to internal rivals than of doing nothing at the risk of losing the next election catastrophically.Keir Starmer himself could signal that he is ready to begin the process of turning his ship of state in a new direction, and plenty in his cabinet areready to push some of the missing radicalism he has been frightened away from. As he said in hisexcellent conference speech, there is only one overriding duty: to keep Farage out, whatever it takes.That means a new leader, but that will never be enough without new purpose. Whoever it is, none of the intractable problems will disappear, andthe bond markets will continue to dominate decisions. But much of theboldness once promised, such as electoral and Lords reform, needs no money, just a strong nerve. There’s no knowing how much McSweeney’s departure changes the political trajectory, as too much mystic power may have been attributed to him. But without him, there are no more excuses.

In just one example that became public, David Cameronbombarded former colleagues with messages on behalf of Greensill Capital, after allowing its founder, Lex Greensill, access to Downing Street while he was still prime minister.Labour promised in its manifesto to “review and update post-government employment rules to end flagrant abuses seen under the Conservatives”.It has taken the first step in this direction by announcing the abolition of the notoriously toothless Advisory Committee on Business Appointments and handing its job to the independent adviser on ministerial standards, Sir Laurie Magnus.But so far no changes to the rules themselves have been announced – which the thinktank the Institute for Government called a “missed opportunity”.On lobbying, Labour haspromised to tighten the restrictionson former politicians trying to influence the departments they once ran, and to make it harder for MPs to take up second jobs.Anti-corruption campaignersargue much more needs to be done, including forcing government departments to release more timely and detailed data about external meetings, and broadening the scope of the public lobbying register – which does not currently cover in-house corporate lobbyists, for example. The campaign group Spotlight on Corruption recently warned the current system is “full of major loopholes and gaps”.Finally there is the ability of big money donors to bankroll political parties and politicians. Mandelson’s allegedreceipt of direct payments from Epstein– which he has said he doesn’t recollect – is especially outrageous.But with no ceiling on party donations, it remains all too easy for wealthy individuals to buy outsized influence. Frank Hester, the healthcare tech entrepreneurwhose unpleasant private views were uncovered by Guardian colleagues, gave the Tories £15m.Labour haspromised an elections and democracy billthis parliament. Alongside lowering the voting age to 16, it will make important changes, including stopping shell companies being used as vehicles for donations, andobliging parties to assesswhether there is a “risk of foreign interference,” attached to donations.But it proposes no overall cap on individual donations and no ban on companies donating, either, as long as they can show they do business in the UK.Meanwhile, Nigel Farage had his recent £50,000 trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, to declare an end to the rules-based global order,paid for by an Iranian-born billionaire, Sasan Ghandehari, for whose family trust Farage – who hopes to be prime minister – is apparently an “honorary and unpaid adviser”. This does not appear to contravene any rule.Arguing that Labour’s promised changes do not go nearly far enough, the anti-corruption campaignTransparency International warnedlast summer: “We stand at the beginning of a new and dangerous era, where big money dominates in a way that has corroded US politics across the Atlantic.”The grim details of what Mandelson was willing to do for Epstein suggest that era may already have dawned – but it is not too late to pull up the drawbridge.As Starmer fights for his political life, he could do worse than show he has learned the lessons of the political side of this scandal by introducing stringent new rules to protect British democracy from the malign influence of powerful companies, and dodgy billionaires.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonEconomics viewpointJeffrey EpsteinLabourKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

We need a new movement for global peaceDavid CortrightWith the end of the New Start treaty, we face a potentially catastrophic arms race. It can still be preventedSun 8 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 13.03 ESTShareThe risk of nuclear war is greater now than in decades – andrising. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists recently set its famousDoomsday Clock closer to midnight, indicating a level of risk equivalent to the 1980s, when US and Soviet nuclear stockpiles were increasing rapidly. In those years, massive waves of disarmament protest arose in Europe and the United States. Political leaders responded, the cold warended, and many people stopped worrying about the bomb.Today, the bomb is back. Political tensions are rising, and nuclear weapons have spread to other countries, including Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea. China is rapidly increasing its nuclear arsenal. The US-Russia arms competition may accelerate soon with the expiration on 5 February of the last remaining arms control agreement, the New Start treaty. To prevent the growing nuclear threat, we need a new global peace movement.Donald Trump had a chance to prevent nuclear escalation in the months preceding the expiration of New Start. Russian President Vladimir Putinofferedto voluntarily maintain the limits established by the treaty and invited the US to follow suit, but the White Houserefused. The administration has proposed instead to negotiate an entirely new strategic arms treaty, a process that could take years.Political leaders and security experts talk about nuclear weapons as if they are mere pieces on a chess board, to be brandished and maneuvered for strategic advantage. We are told that nuclear weapons are necessary for peace, but there can be no genuine peace if security rests on the threat of using instruments of indiscriminate mass annihilation. One large bomb detonated over a modern city could kill millions of people from the catastrophic blast and the spread of genetically damaging radioactive fallout.Research estimatesthat a nuclear war between the US and Russia could kill up to 5 billion people.Nuclear deterrence does not create peace. It has not prevented major wars, by Russia in Ukraine, or by the US in Iraq and Vietnam. The number of armed conflicts in the world today is at anall-time high. The supposed deterrent effect of nuclear weapons lacks credibility. Deterrence is achievable bynon-nuclear means, the scholar Mary Kaldor reminds us. Wars can be avoided by strengthening mechanisms of global cooperation and applying proven methods of conflict prevention and peacemaking diplomacy.Current leaders in Washington ignore these realities and are pushing ahead with a massive weapons upgrade, at acost of trillionsof dollars. TheUS is creatingan entirely new fleet of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, new ballistic missile-firing submarines, updated strategic aircraft and air-launched cruise missiles, a new system of sea-launched nuclear cruise missiles, and enormous new facilities to produce plutonium components for an estimated 80 new nuclear warheads per year.This enormous nuclear construction program is euphemistically termed “modernization” in Washington. It is more properly understood as a vast program for enhancing the capacity to use nuclear weapons. “A nuclear war can never be won and should never be fought,” then US president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev famously declared in the 1980s. Political leaders oftenrepeat the phrase, but their actions betray their words.Nuclear arms control agreements traditionally provided guardrails against unconstrained arms racing, but those protections have been discarded in recent decades and are gone completely now with the expiration of the New Start treaty. In the absence of agreed weapons restrictions, US and Russian officials could deployhundreds of warheadsin the coming months.An accelerated arms race can still be prevented if the US would agree to maintain current weapons limits as it pursues potential negotiations. Moscow expressedregretthat Washington did not accept its offer to maintain weapons restrictions, but it did not withdraw the proposal. The deal could still be on the table.All that’s needed is for the White House to state that the US will not exceed current strategic weapons limits as long as the Kremlin agrees to exercise similar restraint. This small but important mutual step could reduce the near-term threat of nuclear escalation. It could open political space for more fundamental change.An agreement to refrain from weapons increases would create a positive atmosphere for negotiating a new arms reduction treaty. Ideally, it could also lead to a statement of support for the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons, as specified in theUN treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons.To build pressure for such steps, renewed peace activism is needed. Change will require political pressure from the bottom up. In the history of the arms race, steps for weapons limitation and disarmament usually have beenthe result of citizen pressureand grassroots political action. We need more of the same now.David Cortright, a visiting scholar at Cornell University’s Reppy Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies, was the executive director of Sane, the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, during the 1980sExplore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsOpinionRussiaDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

At the mercy of the systems that determine which corridors open and when, and who gets routed where, an overwhelmed customer service agent suggested I charter a boat to nearby St Maarten, fly to Amsterdam, and then stitch together a series of flights to avoid the affected airspace. I understood the Caribbean, then, less as a string of proximate islands and, instead, as a set of routes connected by powers elsewhere.Power doesn’t just regulate airspace, it also governs cultural transmission – who gets broadcast, who gets heard, and on what terms. That’s why thehandwringingoverthe Puerto Rican artistBad Bunnyheadlining the Super Bowl halftime show, and the characterization of his almost exclusive use of Spanish in his music as an intrusion, feel so disingenuous. The drama isn’t about understanding the lyrics. Rather it’s a claim about Bad Bunny and his music as fundamentally un-American, stemming from a fear of feeling left out, or the more colloquially known fear of missing out (Fomo).Feelings of Fomo usually go in one of two directions: they either sour into resentment or they’re leavened by productive curiosity. While some are promoting bespoke counter-events to watch during halftime, such as Turning Point USA’s so-called All-American Halftime Show, my neighbor Susie has been spending a few minutes every night at the dinner table with her kids, going over the appropriately slack pronunciation ofmás beso’ y abrazo. Some folks crash out, others tap in. Both reactions are shaped by the same routes of power that decide what it sounds like to be American, and what gets stiff-armed as foreign.The US has long relied on the Caribbean while insisting the region remains culturally elsewhere. Puerto Rico’s status as an unincorporated territory was engineered to keep it close enough to claim (to own, that is), while still withholding full belonging from its inhabitants. There’s nuance to this arrangement, of course. Empire relies on these hidden infrastructures, ones that create invisible borders between places and people.Caribbean artists, for their part, make these invisible borders graspable – often dance- and sing-along-worthy, too. Much of what I know about the shape of imperialism comes through Caribbean sounds: Peter Tosh, The Mighty Sparrow, Singing Sandra and Ruben Blades, to name a few. Before I could understand exactly what they meant when they sang about freedom, liberation and colonization, the sticky melodies and body-rocking rhythms kept me close long enough to learn more and learn better.That’s why I’m not moved by the claim that music sung in Spanish willalienateviewers. Bunny’s 2022 song El Apagón, for example, references the frequent blackouts in Puerto Rico’s long run of infrastructural failures – an electrical grid left to rot and wider colonial abandonment. Over a heavy percussive beat, stripped of its digital sheen, the song sounds out the lo-tech conditions named in its title, The Blackout. It’s still a party song; it makes you move, but the political center is unavoidable. Caribbean music like Bad Bunny’s – inflected with reggaeton and its dembow backbone, alongside salsa and bomba, fortified by trap and their diasporic cousins – performed on a stage like the Super Bowl halftime show is an invitation into a shared situation, and people want in.My point isn’t that music is universal or that Bad Bunny’s is a transcendentally global sound. It is not. It is very specifically rooted in and routed through his island home. His music doesn’t transcend language so much as it holds our attention long enough to do the actual labor of getting beyond surface lyrics. It invites us to do the work of figuring it out, and that feels especially poignant (crucial, even) in a political landscape where nativism is dressed up as logic and fear is marketed as patriotism.In a time of waning attention spans, what conservative critics of Bad Bunny are forgetting – willfully or not – is that contemporary audiences consume music with unlimited study guides. Throughout his career, Bad Bunny’s music videos have done the heavy lifting for those of us who don’t immediately understand his colloquial Puerto Rican Spanish. On his most recent project, Debí Tirar Más Fotos(DtMF), the music videos (short films, really) tell moving stories of change, loss, family, immigration and a desire to have a good time. What people may lack in comprehension of a foreign language is made up for by myriadtranslations,tutorials, and real people who are happy to spell out stakes and clarify meanings.One captivating moment during this year’s Grammys came when the South African–born Trevor Noah sang the lyrics to the single DtMF back to El Conejo Malo himself. Noah was modeling a contemporary ethic of listening: an ordinary willingness to cross a small distance for the payoff of mutual recognition. So many people are waiting for a similar moment while watching the halftime show.When fear is being peddled as nationalism, the productive curiosity that Fomo can inspire becomes a counterforce – an imperfect one, surely, but catalyzing nonetheless. And in a moment defined by so many fears – fear of the future, or the felt absence of one – many of us are choosing the work of joining in over fearing each other.Jessica Swanston Baker is an associate professor of music at the University of Chicago who specializes in contemporary Caribbean popular music.Explore more on these topicsBad BunnySuper BowlSuper Bowl LXPuerto RicocommentShareReuse this content"

The timing was deliberate. It disoriented them at their most vulnerable, ensuring the torture to come would be even more agonising. The testimonies I recorded from survivors almost always contained the same phrase: “The morning they came for me.” One young woman, shattered by rape and violence, later told me that her life had split in two – before and after the masked men came for her.In Iraq, those who spoke against Saddam Hussein – even abroad, even casually –were punishedin cruel ways by a vengeful leader determined to crush any hint of dissent.In Egypt in 2016,Giulio Regeni, a 28-year-old Italian academic researching labour unions, was abducted, beaten and tortured to death, it is thought, by president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi’s security services. His own motherhad difficulty recognisinghis mutilated body.During the second Chechen war, I met the journalistAnna Politkovskayain Chechnya. She repeatedly attacked Vladimir Putin’s policies, documenting human rights abuses during Russia’s military campaigns. To punish her, a bullet was put in her brain on Putin’s birthday – a warning to other truth-seekers. Stay silent or die.In the West Bank and Gaza, Israeli soldiers, masked and unmasked, kill, torture and imprison Palestiniandoctors,journalists,teachers,activistsandscholarsnot for what they have done – but because of who they are.After decades of documenting state terror, I know how it starts. Governments begin to use words like security, order, deterrence.Every excuse for Benjamin Netanyahu’s conduct in Gaza isframed as “security”. ICE agents are trained in a language of order in which violence becomes procedure.What happens when democratic states adopt the methods of the regimes they once condemned? Terror is not only masked men and arbitrary detention. It also operates through fear. Policies are designed to make people more compliant, more submissive. As the historian Timothy Snyder warned in his 2017 book,On Tyranny, this is how societies slide into danger: people obey in advance.In Donald Trump’s US, I have watched CEOs, academics, journalists and government officials allow fear to override decency and moral authority. I have seen this pattern before. It begins with claims that certain people are dangerous. That ordinary legal safeguards should not apply to them. It ends with a society diminished – more compliant, more cynical, more brutal. State terror is rarely announced. In my experience, it becomes normalised. It seeps quietly into the machinery of government.Authoritarian regimes make no serious claim to moral legitimacy. Their violence is explicit. Saddam did not apologise when hekilled 182,000 Kurdsduring the Anfal campaign. Sisi did not apologise when about1,000 Muslim Brotherhood supporterswere mowed down in Rabaa and al-Nahda squares in central Cairo. Hafez al-Assad never acknowledged thetens of thousands killed in Hamain 1982. (To this day, the exact numbers remain unknown and the disappeared unaccounted for. The regime cynically built hotelsover mass graves).Democracies operate in an entirely different way. Their actions are often technically above the law. Constitutions are invoked and obscure laws brought back to defend aggressive policies. Governments talk of “necessary action”. They point to courts that still function, a press that is still somewhat free, elections that still take place – even as all of these institutions disintegrate. This is how democracies begin to resemble the regimes they once condemned. It is a subtle, devastating shift.The tools are familiar. A journalist whose reporting aligns closely with the political interests of the US president and the Israeli prime ministeris installedto lead CBS, once one of the most respected networks in the US. On university campuses,surveillance now includesphotographing students who attend or lead pro-Palestinian demonstrations, and are deemed troublemakers. I was told by one student at an Ivy League university that some are quietly warned they will never find work on Wall Street, at the best law firms, or in government offices if they continue. Other student activists are removed from their homes,illegally detained, andthreatened with deportation.Academic deans face threats of punitivefunding cutsunless they impose requirements that constrain academic freedom. AtNorthwestern University in Chicago, students were forced to complete antisemitism training thatthey said was inaccurateand biased in favour of Israel before they could enrol in classes.Instructors are quietly told to toe the line. Journalists are disciplined through language that is carefully crafted as editorial policy – thensome of them are arrested. Those who resist are increasingly labelled enemies of the state.ICE tactics themselves are not new. They have long been used disproportionately against political radicals, Muslims, Black Americans and migrants. What has changed is their visibility – and increasingly, their acceptance. Today, ICE mirrors the same patterns of state terror I have documented for decades: arbitrary detention, secret evidence, militarised policing. The criminalisation of dissent. All of this is justified by the guardians of legality: the White House, the Knesset, the office of the prime minister.Bit by bit, lists are drawn up. Loyalty tests reminiscent ofthe red scarehave returned. Dual citizens are facing pressure to choose a country of “loyalty”. Immigration enforcement is reframed as a hunt for “criminals” rather than a legal process. Activists, NGOs and humanitarians are punished. In Gaza, organisations such as Doctors Without Borders are told thatunless they provide listsof healthcare workers – placing those staff at grave risk – they will not be allowed to operate.The United Nations, founded to prevent the scourge of war, is rendered toothless. Then sidelined and derided.True, the US and Israel are not Russia or North Korea. But democracies erode. The early stages are not just the national guard on the street, but legal arguments over definitions. Judges deferring to power. Congress taking moneyfrom powerful lobbying groups, then using social media to spread propaganda. Disinformation acts as a weapon of truth. Good men and women look away, fearful they will lose jobs, visas, publishing contracts, social standing.The most chilling thing is what happens to society, but also to individuals. Fear becomes internalised, and we begin to censor our own thoughts. We wonder if the law will actually protect us if they come for us one day.The true irony is, state terror does not make a state safer. When democratic states adopt the methods of tyrannies, they become weaker. Their global credibility frays. They sacrifice the legitimacy they once held that distinguishes them from the regimes they claim to oppose.I know state terror when I see it. It is not just Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, Russia’s FSB or Egypt’s National Security Agency. It’s lawyers in suits and bureaucrats at desks and journalists spinning a narrative so the truth is distorted. It’s ICE agents breaking car windows andshooting unarmed citizens. It is militarised borders; family separations and deportations without due process. It is turning fear into a policy, a goal.We should be listening, urgently, to all of those who have lived through it. The hundreds of testimonies I have taken over the years from those haunted voices are an early warning signal we cannot afford to ignore.Janine di Giovanni is a war correspondent and the executive director of The Reckoning Project, a war crimes unit in Ukraine, Sudan and Gaza.

Or perhaps the hemp protein powder? Certainly, when I started adding goose-poo-coloured dust to my breakfast, the unease I have been feeling around food culture deepened. Turning an already drab meal (plain vegan yoghurt, enough seeds to kill a gerbil) into what looked, and tasted, like mud felt more like self-harm than self-care. But, no, what pushed me over the edge was the tiny £2Marks & Spencer sea mossshot. Sorry, not just sea moss: “High-quality red algae sea moss … high in iodine, vitamins C, B1, B6 and B12.” It was blue and tasted awful, with hints of bubble bath. Of course it did – I’m not a limpet; I’m not supposed to consume sea moss!When did food become medicine? There’s all the pseudoscientific supplementary stuff, but even normal food has started to feel functional, mere units of nutrition. A tally runs in my head of things I “need” to eat: am I getting enough oats, beans, leafy greens? What about nuts? I cut back on crisps to cram more nuts in and chuck tofu into everything, because neglecting protein is the worst crime a middle-aged woman can commit. I’m not sure I remember what I actually enjoy eating any more. I’m certain no one on earth enjoys eating flaxseeds – they have all the personality of polystyrene packaging chips – but I choke them down daily, for my cholesterol and gut health.If this were just my neurosis, it wouldn’t matter, but it’s where we are in affluent corners of the west, not eating, but hitting our macros, catching micro-nutrients like we are Pokémon,fibremaxxingand recolonisingour microbiome. TikTok is suggesting people drink a dailyslurry of chia seeds, and the algorithm repeatedly offers me lion’s mane snacks and prebiotic drinks promising “glowing skin, a stronger immune system & flourishing microbiome”.Supermarket shelveshave filled with GLP-1-friendly “nutrient dense” products; protein grams appear in shouty capital letters on yoghurt pots.The final boss of this functional, anhedonic eating is nutritionally optimised slop you don’t even need to chew. TheNew York Timesrecently explored aspirational meal replacements, including, bleakly, something called “liquid salad” – 13 fruits and vegetables blended into a baby-food-style pouch. And a newsletter I read recommended a green supplement called AG1 (“70+ high-quality ingredients – vitamins, minerals, botanicals and bacterial cultures”). Eager for further dietary optimisation, I clicked: it’s £59 for your first month’s supply. My son and his housemates were ahead of the curve a few years ago when they experimentally tried living off that bro-goo Huel. “That’s so depressing!” I remember saying in horror, but they claimed it was fine; it was nice, even, “not having to think about food”.I get that. The “thinking about” healthy eating itself feels unhealthy, verging on all-consuming. A twentysomething man I know told me he knows the protein content of every food, which conjures the spectre of the generations of women unable to erase calorie counts from their brains. We’re making food a source of anxiety, not enjoyment. It’s a luxury problem – many people can’t access the basic building blocks of a decent diet (in 2024,the Trussell Trust reported14.1 million people in the UK lived in food insecure households). But, for those with means, dietary neurosis is whipped up and egged on by companies and influencers, convincing us we need “immunity shots”, “brain food” packs and protein bars.Food can be medicine, or the opposite. We’ve learned amazing things about the relationshipbetween the gut microbiome and our healthand learn more every year; we need to drill down on therole of dietin the alarming rates of colon cancer in young people and work outhow to regulate ultra-processed foods(disproportionately consumed in deprived communities). But you can’t cheat death with chia seeds, and by trying, we aren’t nourishing other parts of ourselves. We’re neglecting pleasure, which gives life its flavour.Could we stop seeing eating as another way to self-optimise and remember it’s a daily joy? With Lent coming up, I’ve decided to observe what I’m calling “anti-Lent”. I’ll be giving up consuming anxiety-inducing nutritional content and instead eating food I love every day. It definitely won’t include sea moss.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingOpinionNutritionFoodHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

He was right, and Ms Reeves’s defence last weekend made his case for him. She argued that her decision would help to fund areduction in patient waiting lists. But money used to repay student loans cannot simultaneously fund public services. In economic terms, such charges are taxes in all but name.Mr Lewis’s reasoning was nuanced. Hepointed outthat freezing the repayment threshold is either a retrospective rewriting of the terms of a private contract or a targeted tax rise on a cohort of young people. Neither, he said, fits Ms Reeves’s claim that the policy is “fair and reasonable”. There arefive student “loan” plansin operation covering most postgraduate courses,Scotlandand three largely English student cohorts: entrants pre-2012, those between 2012 and 2023, and those post-2023.The row focuses on the “plan 2” scheme, covering roughly 6 million people who entered university in England and Wales between 2012 and July 2023. For a plan 2 graduate, every pound earned between £30,000 and £50,000 already faces20% income tax,8% national insuranceand 9% loan repayment – a 37% marginal rate. Freezing the plan 2 threshold, as Ms Reeves proposes from 2027, penalises these graduates by holding down the point at which repayments begin (roughly £30,000), so that as wages rise, a growing share of their income faces the 9% charge. This ensures more income is taxed at 37% forlongeras incomes go up. The Institute for Fiscal Studiessaysthis is indistinguishable from a tax rise.Less than athirdof full-time undergraduates in 2022-23 are expected to repay all their loan. Official figures show that students in England now graduate with average debts of£53,000, up 10% in a year as borrowing rises to cover rising costs. If someone earns £60,000, they should be taxed because they earn £60,000 – not because they went to university in 2014 rather than 2009, or because their parents could not afford to pay the fees upfront.Education is not a luxury good. It is a productive investment. Yet wealthy families can buy their children out entirely, while ordinary households see wages disappear into “charges”.Bankersclear balances quickly; teachers pay for decades. It’s not rational to ask teenagers to gamble their future tax rates on choices they barely understand. The Treasury likes the status quo as the state offloads risk while funding universities upfront. But a political backlash is building. A large voting bloc of working-age graduates now faces debts that older generations escaped.Pollingby YouGov found that 44% want some or all student debt written off. Over a third want the loans forgiven entirely.Debt relief would be a good start – but not the end. Ms Reeves could fund public services throughbroad, progressive taxation; she could use the state’s balance sheet to invest and run higher deficits. Or she mightcontinue to extract cashfrom one generation via the student loan system. The first two are honest. The third survives only because it permits ministers to say they haven’t raised taxes. Economically, the difference is meaningless. Politically, it is a calculated – and increasingly indefensible – evasion.Explore more on these topicsStudent financeOpinionUniversity fundingStudentsHigher educationRachel ReevesMartin LewiseditorialsShareReuse this content"

Intensified competition for resources isn’t helpingSun 8 Feb 2026 12.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 17.04 ESTShareWhen Donald Trump boasted recently that he had stopped the conflict between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo – though fighting persists in the DRC, atappalling human cost– he made clear that his goals went beyond a long-sought Nobel Peace prize.“They said to me, ‘Please, please, we would love you to come and take our minerals.’ Which we’ll do,” the US president added. Now he is following through. Last Monday he launcheda new strategic reserveplan, “Project Vault”, worth almost $12bn. Two days later, JD Vance hosted a summit seeking tocreate a trade zonefor critical minerals.The US – and others – are trying to counter the dominance of Beijing, which was far quicker to grasp the strategic importance of such resources. Key to its plan is a deal touted as a way to bring the DRC wealth and create incentives for peace. Few on the groundare convinced. The deal does nothing to help the DRC build processing capacity and requires it to freeze its tax and regulatory regimes for a decade. The EU likes to portray itself as taking higher ground. But in December, the parliament and councilagreed to weakenkeydue diligence rules.The incredible resources of the DRC have been violently plundered over centuries for the benefit of richer nations and a handful of individuals on the ground.Four-fifths of the populationlive below the poverty line. Extraction has meant exploitation and danger. The week before the Washington gathering,at least 200 artisanal minerswere crushed to death or suffocated when a coltan mine in Rubaya in the eastern DRC collapsed. It became,said one survivor, a tomb.As the journalist Nicolas Niarchos writes in his new bookThe Elements of Power, “tech profiteers, politicians, and battery-makers have made a trade-off: cleaner power at home for pollution and suffering elsewhere”. Meeting climate goals will require many times the current production of materials such as lithium and cobalt. But environmental despoliation, the eviction of communities and the exploitation of labourers including children are not the inevitable results of the necessary shift away from fossil fuels. And the NGO Global Witnesssuggeststhat Mr Trump’s mineral-hunger is better explained by their use in military technology. Tantalum, extracted from coltan, is essential to jet engines and missiles as well as smartphones and laptops.Just asgrowing conflicthelps to drive demand, so demand is fuelling conflict. Rubaya is part of the swathes of land seized by M23 rebels in the eastern DRC in recent years, with mines theregenerating an estimated $800,000 monthly, funding the insurgency. The group is backed by Rwanda (though Kigali denies it) and experts say Rwanda is now selling far more coltan than it can produce, with smuggling across the border reaching unprecedented levels. The EUminerals deal withKigali has been rightly criticised.Natural resources are increasingly intertwined with security policies across the continent, the African Policy Research Institutenoted recently, via Russian private military companies, the US promise of peacebrokering and China’s infrastructure-for-resources model. Its report suggests that resource demand could give African states leverage to negotiate more equitable partnerships that benefit their populations. But that depends, as the authors note, on institutional strength, regional coordination and transparency in deal-making – as well as determination not to compromise human rights, environmental standards or national sovereignty. The DRC’s example is not encouraging.Explore more on these topicsAfricaOpinionDonald TrumpeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Starmer’s judgment and leadership divide opinionReaders respond to a piece by Polly Toynbee in which she says she cannot understand the reason for this level of public dislikeSun 8 Feb 2026 11.59 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 13.43 ESTSharePolly Toynbee (It’s tragic that a decent PM will be brought down by Mandelson’s sleaze – but it’s a matter of when, not if, 6 February) says she cannot “understand the reason for this level of public dislike for a good and serious man”. Keir Starmer’s failure of judgment over Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador to the US is just the last straw.Starmer’s accumulating failures have resulted from his complete lack of vision; there has been no inspiring “this is the kind of society we are going to create”. He has been leading the nation into a strategic vacuum. When the horses do not know which way to face, they all pull in different directions. No wonder that the carriage does not progress.Never mind, say the prime minister’s supporters – he is so sound tactically, with his lawyer’s background, all the day-to-day decisions are in good hands. The mess of Mandelson’s appointment gives the lie to that. Starmer is as feeble tactically as he is philosophically.Anthony StampWormingford, EssexCould the level of public dislike forKeir Starmercome down to the continuing, and even strengthening, of Tory austerity? Continuing arms sales to a state committing genocide? Restricting the right to protest? Reneging on the pledges that got him elected as leader of the Labour party? Appearing to have no political vision or principles other than being in power just for the sake of it? Did you miss some of these, Polly?Antony DowdNottinghamIn my time as a non-executive director of an NHS trust, I quickly learned the difference between being reassured and being assured. The former involves taking people’s word that all is well; the latter involves gathering evidence that it is in fact the case. I am surprised that this basic principle of effective management doesn’t seem to apply in the vetting of our ambassadors. How many other important appointments in public life are currently made on trust, I wonder?James LindesayLeicesterIt is disappointing that few are appreciating the UK’s good fortune to have as our prime minister Sir Keir Starmer, a man of integrity, decency and undoubted skill in manoeuvring this country through the maelstrom of disruption, malign indifference and ignorance emanating from the White House orange Voldemort. And why is it so little mentioned in the media coverage of the prime minister’s recent difficulties that most of the current scandal is precisely the consequence of an admittedly ill-advised choice of ambassador, when under considerable pressure to deal with the anticipated and now fully realised horrors of such global disturbance caused by the corrupt and malevolent president of the United States?Wendy JenrickSheffieldIf the Mandelson affair does unseat Keir Starmer, this will be the very worst of Peter Mandelson’s tawdry legacies. We stand to lose the first prime minister for many years who was not in politics for personal glory or gain. An honourable, intelligent and very hardworking man who inherited a shambolic situation on many fronts and has not deserved the constant sniping from the press that has undermined him from the very start of his term of office.Kirsten Cubitt ThorleySheffieldHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

From our prime minister to the person in the street, no one is talking about nuclear weapons, yet nuclear weapons states are busy modernising their arsenals and, in China’s case, increasing the numbers. Treaties supposed to limit nuclear proliferation have failed or are failing. Concern about this in civil society is minimal, and in parliament only a few of us address it as a matter of urgency. I can understand that climate change, AI, Gaza and Ukraine are all issues of pressing and immense concern.In recent decades, the incidence of false alarms has brought the world to the brink of nuclear war more than once. The nuclear-non proliferation treatyreview conferencewill take place in April this year. The last two NPTs have largely failed; this time world leaders, including our prime minister, must ensure that at the very least the trajectory is changed from the current one.The goal of a world without nuclear weapons is vanishingly far away. But there are diplomatic and practical steps that could make us all much safer.Sue MillerLiberal Democrat, House of Lords; co-president, Parliamentarians for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and DisarmamentExplore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsChinaAsia PacificForeign policylettersShareReuse this content"

I fully understand and absolutely support that people sometimes need to step away from unsafe or abusive family situations and feel huge empathy for anyone who has had to make that choice. But the piece felt one‑sided, and it missed something important about what is happening right now: a social‑media‑fuelled individualism that can have serious unintended consequences.What concerned me most was the lack of acknowledgment of how this trend overlaps with the rise in coercive control. One of the first warning signs of an abusive partner is encouraging someone to isolate from family and friends. How confusing must it be for people to see that behaviour supported in online messaging. Isolation is a major red flag for domestic abuse, and we should be helping young people to recognise that.My own family has been deeply affected. Since Covid, my sister has chosen low/no contact with my parents and, by extension, with me. We had a loving, ordinary, stable upbringing. One of the most important relationships in both our lives was with our grandma, something my parents nurtured even when it wasn’t easy. We’ve been in a state of living grief. My parents are heartbroken, and I’m heartbroken for them.If I believed my sister was happier, I could accept it. But I don’t. I’m worried that this distance has been influenced by her partner, and that she’s becoming isolated in unhealthy ways. I worry greatly that my sister has no support network left.I’m not dismissing the very real need some people have to step back. But I wanted to voice the other side of this trend too; the families left behind, the relationships lost, and the devastation that happens when “low contact” isn’t about healing, but about isolation or coercion.Name and address suppliedThe view of the adult children is almost always the focus of this type of article. And the mistaken assumption could be then made that the cause of family estrangement is mainly the result of a “difficult” mother or father. This does not apply in all cases – of course there are some abusive relationships where the wise thing to do is to step away, but does that account for the majority of them? The adult child typically holds more power in the relationship and low or often no contact is the choice they make rather than putting the effort into repair. There should be no automatic assumption of moral superiority on the part of the person making the choice.The causes of families being torn apart can have at their root another difficult individual – daughter-in-law, sibling, daughter or son, and can stem from an individual’s difficulties maintaining normal relationships, and struggles with mental health issues. They can’t simply be explained by family friction due to unreasonable parents, and can cause a huge amount of distress and pain.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

They are, in substance, a graduate tax – compulsory for all but the wealthy, income‑linked, unavoidable and often long‑lasting. Calling them loans is not neutral language; it is a political convenience that removes them from proper democratic scrutiny.I declare an interest: I once headed a university. My unease with this system has been with me for years. What has changed is that someone with public reach has finally said this plainly.The harm is not only financial, but cultural. By passing off a tax as borrowing, the state teaches young people that living with large, abstract debt is normal – even essential – and that payment can always be deferred. That lesson does not stop at higher education. It teaches “live now, pay later”.Worse still, parts of the repayment stream were sold off, turning compulsory student borrowing into an ethically uneasy source of private yield.This is not progressive funding. It is extraction – and miseducation.Prof Vaughan GryllsCo-founder and CEO, University for the Creative ArtsHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Lindsey Vonn was 13th to push out of the start gate on Sunday in Cortina d’Ampezzo knowing exactly what she was racing with:a fully ruptured anterior cruciate ligamentin her left knee, a heavy brace wrapped around the joint, and the accumulated wear of a career spent flirting with speed and consequence.Vonn barely made it out of the opening phase of the run.Not 13 seconds into her descent, under bright late-morning sunshine on the Olimpia delle Tofane, the 41‑year‑old Americanappeared to clipher right pole on a gate. The contact was subtle, almost imperceptible at full speed, but catastrophic in effect. She lost her balance, lurched violently to the right, twisted awkwardly in the air and landed hard on her side before being pitched backward down the piste.Lindsey Vonn airlifted to hospital after crashing out of Olympic downhill raceRead moreOn the television coverage, her screams could be heard over the course microphones as she slid to a stop along the side of the run. In the finish area, the noise dissipated from the crowd of thousands gathered at the Tofane Alpine Centre. Teammates watching the big screen in clusters froze.Breezy Johnson, the reigning world champion who had just set the fastest time – 0.04 seconds clear of Germany’s Emma Aicher – covered her eyes and turned away. Nearby, Vonn’s sister, watching from the bottom, stood motionless, her face drained of color.Within seconds, the race was stopped. Medical staff reached Vonn as she lay on the course, and within minutes a helicopter was called. The delay stretched toward half an hour as she was stabilized, strapped into a stretcher and winched into the air – the second time in nine days she had left a racecourse by helicopter,after crashing in Crans‑Montana, Switzerland, the week before. As the aircraft lifted away, the crowd broke from their stunned silence into sustained applause.Just like that, the Olympic downhill Vonn had spent two years trying to reach, and six years believing she might never see again, was over. But the deeper truth is that the meaning ofthis comebackwas never going to be found in the finishing order anyway.Vonn did not arrive in Cortina chasing a storybook ending. If anything, she spent the past year dismantling the idea that this return needed to be measured in medals or podiums or the tidy narrative closure preferred by journalists and rights holders. Again and again, she framed it in simpler, harder terms: showing up in the start gate and trying, even when the odds – age, injury, history, simple biology – suggested she probably shouldn’t.“The odds are stacked against me with my age, no ACL, and a titanium knee,” she said before the race. “But I still believe.”That self-belief was never really about winning. It was about proving that the version of herself built over two decades on the World Cup circuit still existed somewhere inside a body that had, by any reasonable sporting metric, already given more than enough.View image in fullscreenLindsey Vonn had won a record 12 World Cup races at Cortina.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersFor nearly six years, that career was over. Vonn’s right knee, rebuilt multiple times, required a partial titanium replacement in 2024. The surgery was meant to restore quality of life. Instead, it reopened a door she had assumed was closed for ever.And when she came back, she did not return for a participation trophy. She came backfast. This season alone, she reached the podiumin all five World Cup downhillsshe entered, winning twice and seizing the red bib as the discipline’s season-long leader. Then came the crash in Crans‑Montana. Then the MRI. Then the decision that defined the final act of her career. “My knee is not swollen,” she said last week. “With the help of a brace, I am confident I can compete.”There is something uniquely unforgiving about downhill skiing. There is no easing into it, no way to negotiate with gravity once you push out of the gate. It is not a sport that rewards nostalgia or sentiment or narrative symmetry. It does not care about legacy arcs or redemption stories or emotional neatness.Cortina – the place that defined Vonn’s greatness more than any other, where she won a record 12 World Cup races, the rare track where her technical gifts, appetite for risk and competitive psychology were in perfect alignment – offered no special treatment on Sunday. That is not cruelty, but simply the fundamental honesty of the sport she chose.Before the race, Vonn said: “I can’t guarantee a good result. But I can guarantee I will give it everything I have.”Winter Olympics 2026: Vonn crashes out, Johnson wins downhill gold, snowboarding and more – liveRead moreOn Sunday, she did exactly that. And in time, that may be what outlasts the crash itself. Because elite sport rarely allows athletes to author their own endings. Most are written gradually: through decline, injury or the slow realization that the gap between who you were and who you are has become too large to reconcile. “She always goes 110%, there’s never anything less,” Vonn’s sister told NBC Sports. “Sometimes things just happen.”Vonn resisted that erosion longer than almost anyone in her discipline ever has. She did it not by pretending she was still invincible, but by insisting that trying still mattered.The inevitable debate about whether she should have raced began while Vonn was still lying on the side of the course. Whether the risk was proportionate to the reward. Whether this was courage or stubbornness or something complicated and human in between. But none of those arguments really change what this comeback ultimately represented.In the end, the mountain does not remember who you were. It only measures who you are in that single moment between the start gate and the finish line. On Sunday,Lindsey Vonnaccepted that bargain one more time. In a sport built on confronting risk rather than avoiding it, that may be as honest an ending as any champion is allowed.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Japan finished with silver, while host nation Italy claimed bronze.The United States survived a final-day surge from Japan to retain the Olympic team figure skating title on Sunday night, with Ilia Malinin delivering under intense pressure in the men’s free skate to secure gold at the Milano Cortina Games. Japan finished one point behind in silver, while host nation Italy claimed bronze after three days of tightly contested competition.Olympic figure skating music dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan resolved after ISU reviewRead moreThe final standings – 69 points for the United States, 68 for Japan and 60 for Italy – reflected just how narrow the margin was in one of the most dramatic Olympic team events since the format was introduced in 2014. What had begun as a comfortable American lead after two days turned into a head-to-head showdown in the final session, ultimately decided by the sport’s most technically ambitious skater.American hopes had rested heavily on Malinin, the21-year-old two-time world championwho has gone more than two years without losing a competition. But he entered the decisive free skate carrying unusual pressure after a below-par short program on Saturday left the defending champions vulnerable. When Japan erased the remaining US cushion earlier Sunday, the outcome effectively came down to Malinin versus Japan’s Shun Sato in the final discipline.Malinin, who hasbuilt his reputation on pushing the technical ceilingof men’s skating, adjusted his strategy under Olympic pressure. Expected to attempt as many as seven quadruple jumps, he instead delivered five while skating to a cinematic indie-folk compilation of songs with a personal voice-over called The Voice. He opened aggressively with a quad flip, later landing a quad toe loop and quad Salchow in combination passes that steadied the program after early mistakes, including a shaky quad Lutz landing and two planned quads downgraded to triples – among them the much-anticipated quad Axel.Even without his most ambitious layout, Malinin’s technical base value proved the difference. His score of 200.03 points – nearly 40 points below his season best but still comfortably ahead of the field – put him beyond immediate reach. When Sato followed with a clean but less difficult program set to Igor Stravinsky’s The Firebird featuring three quadruple jumps, his 194.86 left Japan just short.The American finished his routine with back-to-back combinations – a quad toe-triple flip followed by a quad Salchow-triple Axel – drawing a roar from a crowd packed with both American and Japanese supporters. It was not perfection by his stratospheric standards, but it was enough.The path to that moment had been anything but straightforward for the United States.Japan’s comeback began in the pairs free skate, where world champions Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara delivered one of the defining performances of the competition. Their routine, which opened with a massive triple twist lift and ended with Kihara raising Miura overhead into their final pose, earned a career-best 155.55 points and pulled Japan sharply back into contention.“We were trying to aim for about 145 or a little bit higher, and when we saw that it was 155, there was so much joy,” Miura said afterward. “We were overwhelmed with emotions.”View image in fullscreenUSA’s Amber Glenn performs on Sunday night.Photograph: Filippo Tomasi/IPA Sport/ipa-agency.net/ShutterstockThe Americans needed stability in that segment and got it from Ellie Kam and Danny O’Shea – the outsiders of a US team stackedwith current world champions in every other discipline– who delivered the best free skate of their partnership when it mattered most. Their program, set to a mash-up including the Eurythmics’ Sweet Dreams and Tears For Fears’ Everybody Wants to Rule the World, scored 135.36 points, limiting the damage by keeping the US ahead of Canada and preventing a larger swing toward Japan.“We walked into the rink with positive emotions, with an offensive attitude,” O’Shea said. “That showed on the ice.”Quad God and the Blade Angels: is the new USA Dream Team a group of figure skaters?Read moreJapan’s momentum continued in the women’s free skate. Kaori Sakamoto produced a commanding performance worth 148.62 points to win the segment and erase the remaining US. lead. The result was compounded when AmericanAmber Glenn, competing in place of world champion Alysa Liu, finished third after multiple mistakes, including a spin-out on her opening triple Axel attempt and a missed combination later in the program.“I feel guilty. I am sorry that I put this kind of pressure on Ilia,” Glenn said afterward. “It wasn’t how I wanted to feel. The adrenaline was really up and I think I just crashed a little bit.”The shift left the two countries tied entering the men’s free skate – though Japan technically held the edge after winning more individual segments across the event.Malinin ultimately delivered the closing performance the United States needed, reinforcing his reputation as the sport’s most reliable high-pressure finisher. The son of former Olympic skaters Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, he has grown up inside elite competition, but Sunday represented his first Olympic moment as the undisputed anchor of a team title defense.The American victory was built across the roster. Ice dance world champions Madison Chock and Evan Bates won both of their segments earlier in the competition, providing critical early points that ultimately proved decisive in the final standings. Teammates have jokingly referred to the married duo as Mr and Mrs America, a nod to their consistency and leadership inside the team environment.The title also carries historical context. The United States were elevated to Olympic team champions from the Beijing Winter Games after Russia were stripped of gold following Kamila Valieva’s doping case, with Japan also moving up to silver. Sunday’s result marked the first time the Americans have defended the title on the ice itself.For Italy, bronze represented a milestone moment. The host nation had never medaled in the team event before, and strong performances throughout the week – including a crowd-pleassemen’s free skate from Matteo Rizzo – allowed them to hold off challengers including Georgia, which finished fourth and are still seeking their first Winter Olympic medal in any sport.In the end, the competition came down to a familiar Olympic equation: technical risk versus execution, depth versus star power, and the ability to deliver in the final moment. On Sunday night, with the title hanging in the balance, Malinin did exactly that – not perfectly, but decisively enough to keep Olympic team gold in American hands.Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsAmber GlennIlia MalininUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Hess said representing the US at the 2026 Winter Olympics brought up “mixed emotions” and that it was “a little hard.”The world heard JD Vance being booed at the Olympics. Except for viewers in the US | Bryan Armen GrahamRead more“There’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren’t,” he said. “I think for me it’s more I’m representing my friends and family back home, the people that represented it before me, all the things that I believe are good about the US … Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the US.”Trump made his ire clear on Sunday, characterizing Hess’s comments as saying: “he doesn’t represent his Country in the currentWinter Olympics. If that’s the case, he shouldn’t have tried out for the team, and it’s too bad he’s on it. Very hard to root for someone like this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”Trump’s critique follows that of Tennessee Republican representative Tim Burchett, who said in a post on X that Hess should “shut up and go play in the snow.”Hess is one of a handful of Team USA Olympians who have expressed discomfort with representing their country in its current state, and who have then been the recipient of criticism afterward.US figure skating national champion Amber Glenn said she’d be taking a break from all social media after being inundated with what she called “a scary amount of hate/threats.”Glenn, who came out publicly in 2019, was asked how it feels to be part of the LGBTQ community under the Trump administration.“It’s been a hard time for the community overall and this administration,” Glenn said. “It isn’t the first time that we’ve had to come together as a community and try and fight for our human rights.”While not specifically mentioning Trump’s policies, two-time Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrinread a quote from Nelson Mandelaexpressing hope that “we can all flourish regardless of race, color, creed, religion, gender, class, caste or any other social markers of difference” when asked about representing the US in the current political climate. She then added her own words: “For me, as this related to the Olympics, I really hope to show up and represent my own values. Of diversity, and kindness, and sharing. Tenacity, work ethic, showing up with my team every single day.”The US Olympic & Paralympic Committee said on Sunday that it is aware of abusive and harmful messages directed toward athletes and is doing its best to work alongside law enforcement to protect them.“The USOPC stands firmly behind Team USA athletes and remains committed to their well-being and safety, both on and off the field of play,” it said.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026SkiingWinter OlympicsDonald TrumpUS politicsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Also no.View image in fullscreenJen Dodds and Bruce Mouat have reached the curling mixed doubles semi-final.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PASunday night, though, was all about Brookes in the Big Air. It is an event not for the fainthearted, given that it requires snowboarders to fly down a 150‑feet high ramp before launching off a ramp, and trying to spin as much as possible before nailing the landing.And Brookes’s Winter Olympics campaign could not have got off to a worse start as she over-rotated on her first run and ended up sliding towards Livigno town centre on her backside.Her score of 29.75 points left her 24th out of 29 competitors. And to add to the jeopardy, she knew that only the top two scores from a ­competitor’s three runs are counted. It meant she needed to score big on her second and third run to be one of the 12 athletes to make the final.The pressure was on. Brookes delivered. First she nailed a backside 1260 melon, with three‑and‑a‑half full rotations while spinning towards her back in the air. That scored 89 points, second highest of the night. She was still in 22nd place going into her final attempt. This time she chose a Cab 1080 stalefish, a safer jump. That scored 78, leaving her with a total of 167, and putting her third overall.“That third one was special to land,” she said. “You’re in the air, thinking about it in the back of your mind, spinning: like, oh, my God, I’ve got to land this. But as much as I hate it in the moment, it’s moments like that that I just love. Because when you land, it’s like the best feeling on the planet. It’s insane.” What was so impressive was that she had conquered her nerves after falling on her first attempt.“After that first run, I was so ­nervous. But I just had to take my time at the top, not rush into anything. I listened to Metallica. Megadeth. Pantera, Judas Priest, stuff like that. It came out of me in an athlete way,” she said when asked about her mindset. “I was just keeping cool under the pressure and not making any rash decisions or rushing anything. Every minute was awesome, but definitely quite scary.”Her proud parents, Nigel and Vicky, were watching on. Brookes learnt to snowboard when the two of them, who work as a mechanic and a hairdresser, drove around Europe in a camper van. They are staying in the camper van here in Livigno too, incidentally, to save money.Meanwhile the other GB competitor, Maisie Hill, looked on the bright side after finishing 29th, having recovered from a lacerated liver to be here. “I was actually leaving hospital three years ago today after my injury,” she said. “I was told I might never be able to walk again and so to be here now is quite cool.”It all adds to Brookes’s charm. “Yeah, they’re actually in the camper, just staying down the road,” she said. “So yeah, they came and watched the night. So yeah, it’s special to do that in my family.”Asked about the possibility of Magic Monday, Brookes said: “It’d just be great to be a part of that, wouldn’t it? I’ve grown up with Kirsty. We’ve known each other since we were younger. So to go into an Olympic final on the same day as her for Great Britain is really special.”It could get even more special still.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Azerbaijani officials reject the term, saying it implies territorial claims over land internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but contested over decades of conflict between the two countries.The committeesaid in a statementthe use of the song would introduce political messaging into Olympic competition and risk violating Olympic Charter principles requiring political neutrality at the Games.“The Olympic Games are a symbol of peace, friendship and mutual respect between peoples,” the committee said. “It is unacceptable to use this platform for political and separatist propaganda purposes.”Thelisting on the ISU websitefor the pair skating short program now identifies the music as “Music by Ara Gevorgyan”, rather than naming the composition itself, according to the federation’s published music registry for the 2025-26 season.Music selections in Olympic figure skating are typically submitted and approved through technical and governance processes overseen by the ISU, though disputes involving political symbolism can extend beyond sport governance structures.Late changes to Olympic programs can carry significant competitive consequences. Last week, Spain’s Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaténarrowly avoided having to redesign his Olympic short programafter resolving a copyright dispute that had threatened his ability to use music from the Minions franchise. Coaches and athletes say changing music late in the Olympic cycle can force skaters to rework choreography refined over months in a sport where musical timing and muscle memory are inseparable.People familiar with the discussions said the complaint was initially directed to the IOC rather than through sport governance channels and that the issue was subsequently addressed through discussions involving the relevant Olympic authorities.The IOC did not respond to requests for comment.View image in fullscreenArmenia’s Karina Akopova, front, and Nikita Rakhmanin compete in the pair free skating during September’s ISU Skate to Milano figure skating qualifier in Beijing.Photograph: Adek Berry/AFP/Getty ImagesAkopova and Rakhmanin are scheduled to compete in the pairs short program on 15 February, with the free skate set for 16 February. The Russian-born partners – who were already dating when they formed their partnership in 2020 – later chose to represent Armenia through Akopova’s family roots, framing their Olympic appearance as both a personal comeback and a milestone moment for the country’s skating program.The duo only returned to international competition last season after more than two years away because of injury and the waiting period required after switching national representation. They secured Armenia’s first Olympic berth in pair skating since 2002 at the final qualifying event in Beijing, finishing second in a field where only three quota places were available.Azerbaijan will be represented in Olympic figure skating by a single male skater competing in a separate discipline, meaning athletes from the two countries will not face each other directly in competition.The episode comes three months after Armenia and Azerbaijansigned a US-brokered peace agreementaimed at normalizing relations after decades of conflict, though disputes tied to Nagorno-Karabakh remain sensitive. The situation also underscores how geopolitical tensions continue to surface around the Olympic movement despite longstanding rules intended to keep political conflicts out of competition.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Figure skatingNagorno-KarabakhArmeniaAzerbaijanEuropeWinter OlympicsShareReuse this content"

This stadium has tormented the City manager more often than most over the past decade but, should the title race twist as dramatically as this victory, his 11th and possibly final visit to Liverpool will be cherished as the turning point.Was Guardiola’s kiss one of thanks for Gianluigi Donnarumma, the goalkeeper whodeflated Liverpool in the Champions Leaguelast season with Paris Saint‑Germain and denied them a 99th-minute equaliser with a stunning save from Alexis Mac Allister? Or for the nerveless precision of Erling Haaland, who had completed the visitors’ comeback from the penalty spot six minutes earlier? The resilience of Marc Guéhi and co in the face of Liverpool’s second-half recovery merited a smacker, too. The former Liverpool transfer target would eventually get a kiss from his manager, deservedly so.Manchester City keep up title chase with late comeback win at LiverpoolRead moreHowever, Guardiola’s reaction, his sheer relief, told a bigger story: that City’s race is not yet run. Arsenal’s evening mirrored Dominik Szoboszlai’s – from ecstasy to despair in the blink of a remarkable finale. In the 74th minute, whenSzoboszlai repeated his impact against Arsenaland swept a 30-yard free-kick into the Kop goal, the league leaders were nine points clear and the obituaries were bring written for City. By the 93rd it was down to six points and by the 100th, with Liverpool down to 10 men, City had saved the title race at a ground where they last won in front of a crowd in 2003.Guardiola’s only previous Premier League win here had come behind closed doors during the Covid pandemic. He had endured defeat here six times. And now this. A result worthy of sending a kiss to the heavens.Amid the maelstrom at Anfield there was a composure and experience to City to support their manager’s view that anything can happen over the final 13 league games. From Bernardo Silva to Rodri to Donnarumma, there were defining contributions from players who know what it takes to get over the line. Guéhi belonged in their company. Arne Slot felt the City defender should have been sent off at 0-0 for a shirt pull on Mohamed Salah but also, pointedly, remarked on what “a good signing” he is for Guardiola’s team.Guéhi was treated like some kind of ex-Liverpool villain as Anfield booed his every touch in a City shirt. It was a mystifying reception in many respects. To recap: he wasdenied a move to Liverpoolby Crystal Palace last summer after undergoing a medical and doing club media to announce the transfer. He then joined the only club who made an offer for him in January. Liverpool signed Jeremy Jacquet for £60m instead. The only possible explanation for the boos was Guéhi’s assertion, upon signing for City, that he was “now atthe best club in England”. That would rankle Liverpool whether they were reigning champions or not.View image in fullscreenGianluigi Donnarumma denied Liverpool a point with an outstanding 99th-minute save from Alexis Mac Allister.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAThe Kop could not deny that Guéhi was part of the better team in the first half at Anfield, however, nor that his defending was cause for envy. The England international was unfazed by the noise around him during a first 45 minutes in which the biggest threat to City came from City themselves, and their risky strategy of playing out through Donnarumma. Even Guardiola did not appear on board with the tactic at times and berated his goalkeeper for his distribution on a few occasions.Guéhi’s first serious test came when Florian Wirtz released Hugo Ekitiké with a pinpoint pass from deep. The defender was across quickly to block the in-form striker’s path, stand tall, and then smother the shot. There was also a vital block from Guéhi to deny Wirtz’s goal-bound shot in the second half and interception when Curtis Jones almost put Salah through on goal late on. But, like everyone else in sky blue, the composure of the £20m recruit was shaken by Liverpool’s vast improvement after the interval.It was the response that Anfield demanded and Slot needed after a passive, error-strewn first-half display that offered the initiative to City. Against a more aggressive and braver Liverpool team the visitors were ruffled, and Guéhi was finally beaten when Szoboszlai slipped a pass into Salah. The defender pulled the Egypt international to the ground by his shirt, just outside the box, but the video assistant referee deemed he had not denied a clear goalscoring opportunity. The irony was not lost on Slot when Szoboszlai was later dismissed for a similar offence.Guéhi recovered impressively from the reprieve and commanded his penalty area when Liverpool launched everything in search of a stoppage-time equaliser. The 25-year-old provided a platform for a truly remarkable City victory, one that could reverberate for some time. Guardiola knows this is not over.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolaLiverpoolanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Exeter winger will be out for “a number of weeks”, ensuring he misses the trip to Murrayfield and the visit of Ireland to Twickenham a week later. He has not yet been ruled out of England’s entire campaign but the chances of him appearing seem remote and he has been left out of the 36‑man squad called into camp on Sunday night.‘We let people down’: Dewi Lake apologises to Wales fans after England thrashingRead more“Manny looks like he will be out for a number of weeks,” Borthwick said. “We’ve got to get specialist opinion before I know exactly how many weeks he is, but [it’s] a number [of weeks], which is disappointing.”Furbank sustained a head injury in training and must pass the return‑to‑play protocols if he is to face Scotland. He has not played for England since November 2024 but Borthwick had hoped to have the Northampton full‑back available for the Calcutta Cup. Billy Sela also has a head injury and has been replaced in the squad by George Kloska.Genge was replaced by Bevan Rodd at half-time against Wales. The Bristol loosehead prop was deemed fit to start but Borthwick admitted afterwards that he was only going to play 40 minutes amid suggestions Genge was carrying a hamstring niggle.In better news for the head coach, the Bath centre Ollie Lawrence is in contention to face Scotland while the Northampton fly-half Fin Smith is also in the frame after both players returned to the squad. Max Ojomoh has dropped out as a result.England are on a run of 12 successive wins going in to the meeting with a Scotland team who were beaten by Italy on Saturday, but they have won at Murrayfield only once since 2016. Borthwick is expecting an aerial bombardment with poor weather forecast for the weekend and he has predicted Gregor Townsend will recall Blair Kinghorn to the side.“From what I hear, they went for a huge number of contestable kicks [against Italy], that was their strategy,” Borthwick said. “And if I reflect on how they played against us last year, there will be a mammoth amount of contestable kicks.“Potentially, they are going to pick Kinghorn. He may come back into the team because he’s so good in the air. I reckon that’s the challenge we’ll probably face. If you look historically over the last number of years, that’s exactly what Scotland have chosen to do against England.”Two years ago England began brightly before succumbing to a Scotland comeback, prompting some soul-searching during a training camp in York. The second-row Ollie Chessum has warned his teammates to expect hostility from the moment they arrive at Murrayfield. “It’s a huge challenge,” Chessum said. “I love going up there, the hostility of the place only adds to the fire. You get off the bus at Murrayfield and there are just people on top of you, there is a tone. Once you hear that boo it just hits you in the face and it doesn’t stop until the whistle goes.”While England are unbeaten in 12 months, their most impressive wins under Borthwick have either come at Twickenham or on neutral territory during the 2023 World Cup. A statement victory on away soil has so far eluded them, something that has not been lost on the back-row Ben Earl.“You can sometimes lose sight of yourself and be like ‘let’s do a smash-and-grab plan’, or talk about the crowd and all that stuff, but at the end of the day if you play well you’ve got a good chance of winning,” he said. “We’re a slightly different team now and have developed the scar tissue for however long we’ve had this journey, started a bit of a roll and got a bit of momentum.”George Ford has called on England to embrace their impressive run of form, suggesting previous teams have been reluctant to lean into the confidence that comes with an unbeaten stretch. “We’ve got to definitely use it, it’s such a positive thing, why wouldn’t we use it? I think a lot of the time in England we get told to temper it all the time, but let’s use it. We feel like we’re a good team, we feel like there’s improvement but let’s back ourselves and keep going for it.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026Steve BorthwickEngland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

When you win the close ones they’re actually the ones that give you a little boost and a bit of a smile on your face.“The associate nations are getting so much better. Some of the shots in the last few overs … it’s serious stuff. You can’t underestimate these guys any more.”Will Jacks said of Curran: “He’s won us that game. It was ebbs and flows the whole way. I thought it was almost lost with six balls to go. Winning ugly is a great trait. It’s incredibly difficult to replicate that experience and a game like today, where we potentially weren’t expecting it to go down to the last ball and it has.“When we get in that situation in the rest of the tournament, which we definitely will at some stage, we’ll be able to look back on this experience and take that with us.”Quick GuideRoundup: Ireland slip to Sri Lanka defeat, NZ make record chaseShowIreland slipped to a 20-run defeat against T20 World Cup co-hosts Sri Lanka in their Group B opener in Colombo. Having won the toss and opted to bowl, Ireland restricted Sri Lanka to 71 for three by the end of the 11th over after George Dockrell picked up two wickets.Kusal Mendis finally gave the home crowd something to get behind as he pushed the total on, but was fortunate to be dropped three times in the 17th over. Barry McCarthy then took two wickets in two balls to dismiss Kamindu Mendis for 44 off just 19 balls, and Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka for a golden duck. Kusal Mendis then brought up his half-century as the co-hosts made 163 for six.Ireland lost captain Paul Stirling (six) in the fourth over of their reply when he was bowled by Maheesh Theekshana, but a determined 34 from Ross Adair saw them on to 72 for two at the halfway stage. Lorcan Tucker (21) and Harry Tector (40) chipped away at the run-chase and Ireland were 104 for two after 14 overs, needing 60 from the last six.Sri Lanka fought back to make regular breakthroughs – with Theekshana dismissing Ben Calitz and Gareth Delany in successive deliveries - as Ireland finished short, all out for 143 with one ball left after losing their last eight wickets for 38. Wanindu Hasaranga and Theekshana claimed three wickets each.Earlier,New Zealandsecured a decisive five-wicket win overAfghanistanafter chasing down 183-5, their highest ever at the T20 World Cup, with two overs to spare.Afghanistan's Gulbadin Naib scored 63 off 35 balls, helping his team post 182-6. Tim Seifert led New Zealand's response with 65 runs, overcoming early setbacks. Glenn Phillips contributed 42, partnering with Seifert for a 74-run stand. Despite efforts from Afghanistan's Rashid Khan, New Zealand accelerated in the middle overs, and Mark Chapman and Daryl Mitchell's cameos sealed victory.AgenciesWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.England next play West Indies on Wednesday but in the moments before he delivered the crucial over Curran already had their second opponents on his mind, specifically Carlos Brathwaite’sfour successive sixesoff Ben Stokes to settle the 2016 World Cup final in their favour.“I weirdly thought of the 2016 final when Carlos got hold of Stokesy,” Curran said. “I was thinking: ‘Well, if I execute he’s not going to hit me for six.’ I just watched his feet and thankfully executed.

That spirit remains and is being passed to their successorsByNick Amesin Castel di SangroSun 8 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 06.54 ESTShareThe WhatsApp group flickers into life at about 6am every day. It is the manager who goes first because, when you are 79, old habits die hard. “Good morning,” Osvaldo Jaconi hails his former players and staff before, little by little, the salutations roll in from acrossItaly. Maybe it is someone’s birthday or another special occasion; the conversation may be accelerated by an in-joke that recalls why, three decades ago, they were brought together in the first place. Just in case anyone could forget, the group’s title says: “Serie B.”This is how miracles stay alive. Perhaps it is the point of what Castel di Sangro achieved in 1995-96. A rag-tag bunch from this backwater in mountainous Abruzzo had risen from local amateur leagues and then, in a crowning triumph with little precedent, made it to the second tier. “It’s like 30 years haven’t passed,” says Angelo Petrarca, who was nominally the masseur but often resembled a one-man backroom. “It shows how much love everybody has for each other, and did back then. As if everybody is still right here.”Their feat shocked followers of the brutal pyramid beneath what was then a world-leading Serie A. It was immortalised in a different way by Joe McGinniss, the celebrated American journalist, who consummated an unlikely love affair with football by embedding with the Castel di Sangro side during that first Serie B campaign. They followed“Il miracolo”with“La salvezza”: the salvation, an equally unlikely survival from relegation. McGinniss’s account,The Miracle of Castel di Sangro, detailed a personal and sporting journey; affectionate and at times exasperating, it became one of the most feted sports books of all time.View image in fullscreenAngelo Petrarca, former assistant coach and fitness trainer, is still actively involved with his town’s club.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The GuardianView image in fullscreenOld team photos in Petrarca’s living room.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The GuardianMcGinniss embalmed that era for a global readership that had few other windows into football’s less explored corners. His journey from bemused newcomer to helpless over-investment, nearing mania by the book’s stormy conclusion, was compelling but the club’s characters stole the scene. Sometimes they verged on caricature. Petrarca, who would have lunch with McGinniss on Mondays, is not especially fond of his own depiction as “a short and rather cunning man … who seemed to have irons in many fires”. Ultimately, though, the extraordinary story of a community thrown into the spotlight shines through.“There were three of us on the staff and things were really family-run,” says Petrarca, a sprightly 73-year-old surrounded by old team photos in his living room on a hill overlooking the town. “If the kit man wasn’t around I’d take my two sons to the stadium laundry and we’d wash the players’ clothes.“Some of them had come all the way up with us. Our guys were the lowest-paid in Serie B and perhaps in Serie C. We went to Palermo, Bari, Turin, Genoa, cities with more than 700,000 inhabitants, but we survived. From a qualitative point of view and an economic one, what happened was extraordinary.”It also, as everyone knew, had little chance of lasting. “We lived a miraculous thing,” Petrarca says. “But it was impossible to think of it continuing. There was a sense at the time that, one day, the history of that Castel di Sangro team would end. It couldn’t carry on forever.”View image in fullscreenCastel di Sangro found itself hosting teams from Turin, Genoa and Bari.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The GuardianBehind the counter, Gabriel Romito prepares the drinks. Bar Pasticceria Serricchio is one of the oldest gathering points in town and calls for safe hands; so does Castel di Sangro’s goalkeeping position and this afternoon he will wear the No 1 jersey against Gessopalena.Romito is a local hero. Five years ago he saved a penalty from Napoli’s Amin Younes in a friendly, plunging to his right in front of the oldCurva Nordwhere ultras convened in the late 90s. The Napoli keeper Alex Meret, suitably impressed, gave him his jersey. “It’s framed at home with the match date underneath,” Romito says. It is the closest brush with footballing fame any of the current players are likely to experience.“We’re a team where no one is paid, playing for the love of the sport,” he says. Castel di Sangro were relegated the season afterLa Salvezza; the elastic had snapped and in 2005, upon demotion to the fifth tier, they were declared bankrupt. There has followed a pattern familiar in Italian football’s lower reaches: a litany of name changes and restarts that settled on the formation of Castel di Sangro Cep 1953, who entered the league structure of the neighbouring region Molise.To those invested in the history, that never felt quite right. For one thing, it was jarring to compete in Molise; for another, the Cep entity was run from 80 miles away in Naples; finally, a pipeline through which local youngsters could develop had never been fully established. Two years ago Ferdinando Iacobucci headed a local group that founded a new club, Castel di Sangro Calcio. They entered a team in Abruzzo’s third division, Italy’s ninth and lowest level, and started an academy that now holds about 120 children.Iacobucci was a ballboy in the days ofIl Miracolo.“We’re starting with good intentions,” he says. “The miracle is difficult to replicate but we hope to reach a level that Castel di Sangro deserves. Seeing kids from Castel di Sangro unable to play for their home town broke our hearts, so we decided to begin all over again and let them wear the jersey.”One of the first team, the right-back Angelo Bonomi, has the glory years running through his veins. In the town’s main stadium his father, Claudio, scored the ferocious left-footed winner against Pescara that securedLa Salvezza.Nowadays the facility is run by Italy’s football federation and has hosted theAzzurri’sUnder-21s. Claudio moved upwards to Torino, later playing for Sampdoria and Fiorentina. He lives in Sardinia but is visiting and joins the crowd of about 50 as half-time in the Gessopalena game nears.View image in fullscreenClaudio Bonomi, a member of the feted mid-90s team, embraces his son Angelo, who now plays for Castel di Sangro.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The GuardianCastel di Sangro have missed chances and Romito, who joined several others in transferring to the new club from Cep, has been bothered by a long-range shot against the bar. Petrarca, still performing every conceivable odd job, stands next to the dugouts. In the changing room he has filled out the team sheet and collected every player’s identity card. The side score twice just before the interval and Claudio Bonomi, separated from the pitch by a wire fence, follows Angelo up and down the right flank during the second half.“It’s an honour to see a member of my family wearing the Castel di Sangro shirt,” he says. “It’s a great town and a great club, and these guys need to be aware of it. Football has changed and it’s really tough now, the sport has become about politics at all levels. It’s very unlikely we can repeat our climb, but you never know.”Bonomi remembers the jubilation, shared with the thousands from neighbouring towns and villages who would fill the stadium, after his thunderbolt in June 1997. “The perfect Sunday,” he says. “We celebrated a little too much, but that was normal. It was like we had won the Serie A title.”Angelo and the current crop win 3-1. They are top and enjoy a celebration in La Lanterna, a pizzeria in town. In the 1990s this was Marcella’s, a central location in McGinniss’s book: the venue for team meetings, meals, gossip and conspiracy.Iacobucci spent the game in the tiny club shop, pouring coffee and selling flame-coloured replica shirts. “We’ve started over with the legacy of the old,” he says. “And we’re seeking a glimmer of light in the new.”View image in fullscreenEven in the ninth tier, the current Castel di Sangro team draw a dedicated following.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The GuardianPetrarca makes a video call and pulls up a smiling Jaconi on the screen. It is evidently a frequent occurrence. Jaconi still works with an amateur club in the coastal town Porto San Giorgio. McGinniss moved in next door to him and it was a rollercoaster relationship, the American despairing and marvelling at the manager’s bullish, bloody-minded conservatism.“The friendship was good,” Jaconi says. “Up until the end there weren’t any particular problems.” That changed when McGinniss travelled with the newly safe team to Bari on the final day of 1996-97. Bari needed a win for promotion and McGinniss, perturbed by a change in atmosphere, believed he heard the players discuss how to lose 3-1. It appeared they had been ordered to do so, although that is strenuously denied.Il sistema, the practice of arranging outcomes, was commonplace then but an enraged McGinniss branded the team “traitors” and would leave Castel di Sangro under a cloud.“A writer who doesn’t understand football could clearly have misinterpreted some banal things,” Jaconi says. “It would be the same if I went to report on fashion shows. I would also not understand anything and take into account things that have no importance.”It was far from the only drama McGinniss stumbled into. During the 1996-97 season two players, Danilo Di Vincenzo and Pippo Biondi, were killed in a car accident; another, Gigi Prete, was detained by police investigating an international cocaine smuggling operation. Prete was acquitted. The high-profile signing of Robert Ponnick, supposedly a Nigerian star from Leicester City, turned out to be a publicity stunt. “If anyone wanted to make a story, all the characters were there,” Jaconi says. “There was no need to expand the discussion on things that seem farcical to me.”View image in fullscreenTrophies and opponents’ pennants are displayed inside the club’s offices.Photograph: Marta Clinco/The GuardianIn the book McGinniss sketches the club’s then owner, Pietro Rezza, in the fashion of a James Bond villain. He has an awkward relationship with the president, Gabriele Gravina, who now heads the Italian FA and is the Uefa first vice-president. A bridge-burning confrontation between the pair concludes his stay in Italy.The word “chaos” arises most frequently when anyone in town is asked about the reaction to the release in 1999 ofThe Miracle of Castel di Sangro. “There were some stories that genuinely didn’t exist,” says Petrarca. But he stayed on good terms with McGinniss, who sent champagne to his hotel when he visited New York the following year.That is because, for all the ups and shuddering downs, Castel di Sangro and McGinniss both told tales of love. Jaconi offers another: the old team’s adored goalkeeper, Roberto De Juliis, had a brain haemorrhage in October 2024 and Jaconi visits him every 10 days. De Juliis is well enough to be back on the WhatsApp chat, his presence a source of joy. Maybe he will be able to attend this summer’s 30th anniversary celebration ofIl Miracolo.Jaconi, the soft-centred bulldog, has a go at playing their achievements down. “I never thought anything of it,” he claims. “We won, we did it, then everyone went their own way. The fact it still causes a stir makes us happy, and it’s you who keep it going.” The stream of messages popping up on Petrarca’s screen as he speaks tell a different story.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballItalyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No one making their way towards the Turf batted an eyelid, but then again, for five years now, a touch of Hollywood has become pretty much the norm inWrexham.Ninety minutes before kick-off the city’s most famous public house was heaving. Lying in the shadow of the Racecourse Ground, it is the watering hole of choice for locals, and, thanks to landlord Wayne Jones’s prominent role inWelcome to Wrexham, the hit documentary following the club’s many fortunes, a tourist attraction.Championship roundup: Coventry held by Oxford; squirrel delays play at HullRead moreThe way the pub is now – a thriving establishment, packed with happy faces and vibrating with contented nattering – is symbolic of the meteoric shift that has occurred since Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac (previously McElhenney) paid £2m to become the football club’s guardians half a decade ago on Monday.It was a business, community and club, desperate for a lifeline, some sunshine, a boost. Post takeover, all involved have gotten that and then some.As Jones spoke from the Turf’s single file entrance, he politely broke off to greet those he knows well and newbies wanting to say hello. He is grateful as a businessman that the customers flow as freely as the pints, but Wrexham’s on field success is more important.The club is “in my DNA, like it is thousands of supporters”, he said. “It has been a very quirky, very interesting five years. So far, so good.” Underplaying it much, Wayne?On the night Reynolds and Mac’s purchase was announced, Wrexham earned three points against Altrincham at FC United of Manchester’s Broadhurst Park. As a result, they moved into the National League’s playoff spots. A mere 1,459 days later they are in the Championship’s top six despite this disappointing 2-0 defeat by Millwall.View image in fullscreenJosh Coburn celebrates scoring Millwall’s second goal against Wrexham.Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PAUnsatisfactory, yes, but the odd bump will not get fans such as Peter Cheshire too down. A regular since 1968, and an ever-present at home and away this season, the now, as opposed to 2021’s then, remains scarcely believable for Cheshire. “It has changed my life,” he said. He was not being hyperbolic.“It has helped my mental health. I suffer from depression and that has changed a lot since the takeover. I’m happier here [in the ground], which makes me happier when I go to work.”The project has not been without its blips. First, they missed out on the playoffs in 2020-21, before losing in the semi-finals 12 months later. By then, any initial local scepticism had melted, replaced by the warmest of embraces.For Cheshire, the doubts were erased within the early months when it became clear Reynolds and Mac would invest on the field, in the men’s and women’s teams, and off it. To emphasise the point, he gazed across to the work on a new Kop stand that will open in 2027.View image in fullscreenMillwall manager Alex Neil (left) and Wrexham’s Phil Parkinson shake hands before the match.Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PASince those early disappointments, Wrexham have achieved promotion, after promotion, after promotion. An unprecedented triple jump. A fourth in a row, and with it the Premier League, could be 18 games away.That has always been the aim and stating so draws far less laughter now than it did when all this began. Wrexham have global reach, blue chip sponsors and A-listers such as Channing Tatum and Will Ferrell dropping in for the odd game.Yet there are plenty of reminders that humility trumps all. First-team players change at the ground, make their way to training in their own cars, before returning to shower, lunch and gym. Not out of the ordinary below the Football League, but certainly more unusual in the Championship.Then there is managing the limited on-site space, which has some staff feeling as if they are playing a constant game of human Tetris. Indeed, the CEO, Michael Williamson, who, among other roles, spent four-and-a-half years in key positions at Inter, works from a room that legally compliant landlords would not be able to offer up as a bedroom.Success has brought with it envy. Way back when the club was still punching its way out of non-league football (a whole three years), it was a fairytale story for some, something to delight in. Wholesome. Quaint. Unthreatening.View image in fullscreenA Wrexham sticker at the SToK Cae Ras.Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PABut now little old Wrexham are a couple of sound left-right combos from being a top-flight team, there is much sneering. Some would have you believe that Reynolds and Mac were the first to introduce money to football. In any case, the outcome of that particular match is not always matrimony.Wrexham’s manager, Phil Parkinson, who succeeded Dean Keates in July 2021, does not get the credit he deserves. It is all very well, as Wrexham did last summer, buying 13 players for around £30m, but weaving so many new strands into something coherent takes some doing.Parkinson has managed it successfully and will doubtless do so again with January arrivals Davis Keillor-Dunn, Bailey Cadamarteri and Zak Vyner. “I thought we’d survive this season, but down the bottom end,” Cheshire says.“It’s about moments,” Parkinson said. He and Wrexham have had plenty of those.This article was amended on 8 February 2026. Welcome to Wrexham is not a Netflix documentary as an earlier version said.

But looking at it, it is definitely a better decision going for the world under-20s.”The world under-20s meeting – known formerly as the world junior championships – will take place on 5-9 August in Eugene, Oregon, at the same stadium that hosted the 2022 world championships.Before going on to dominate world sprinting and rewrite the record books, Bolt kicked off his career with 200m gold at the 2002 world juniors. Gout, who was second in the half-lap race at the world under-20 championships in Lima at the age of 16, has often spoken of his wish to emulate Bolt’s feat.Gout had been flagged as a potential 100m medallist in Glasgow, and his absence will be a significant blow to the Australian team, and the event as a whole.View image in fullscreenScotland’s First Minister, John Swinney, with the Commonwealth Games mascot Finnie.

He has a long career ahead of him and we respect his decision to prioritise the world under-20 championships as he builds towards a home Olympic Games at Brisbane 2032.’’AustralianAthleticshas also supported Gout’s decision to focus on the junior championships. The teenager from Queensland has become a cult figure after exploding on to the global athletics scene in the past two years.After breaking Peter Norman’s 56-year-old 200m Australian record in late 2024, Gout made global headlines in 2025 with a world championships debut and 200m semi-final appearance in Japan.Explore more on these topicsGout GoutCommonwealth Games 2026Commonwealth GamesAthleticsAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

With her coalition partner, theJapanInnovation party, which won 36 seats, Takaichi now has a supermajority of two-thirds of seats, easing her legislative agenda as she can override the upper chamber, which she does not control.A smiling Takaichi placed a red ribbon above each winner’s name on a signboard at the LDP’s headquarters as party executives applauded.The 64-year-old, whocalled a snap electionsoon after becoming Japan’sfirst female prime ministerlast autumn, had vowed to resign if her coalition failed to secure a simple majority in the vote, which was held on a freezing day when many parts of the country were again hit by heavy snow.View image in fullscreenA voter at a polling station in Uonuma, Niigata prefecture.Photograph: Manami Yamada/ReutersShe will not, however, have long to savour her party’s victory. There are concerns over her management of Japan’s public finances and her ability to defuse a bitter row with China over the future of Taiwan.Takaichi sought to appeal to voters with a 21tn yen (£99bn) stimulus package aimed at easing the cost of living crisis, later promising to suspend the 8% consumption (sales) tax on food for two years – a 5tn-yen hit to annual revenue.Her spending plans have rattled financial markets and caused currency volatility, prompting some commentators to question her approach given that Japan’s debt is more than twice the size of its gross domestic product – the heaviest debt burden of any advanced economy.Speaking as exit polls showed her party cruising to victory, Takaichi, an admirer of Margaret Thatcher, said:“We have consistently stressed the importance of responsible and proactive fiscal policy. We will prioritise the sustainability of fiscal policy. We will ensure necessary investments. Public and private sectors must invest. We will build a strong and resilient economy.”View image in fullscreenAn election official empties a ballot box at a counting station in Tokyo.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockAfter a whirlwind introduction to diplomacy – including meetings with Donald Trump and Xi Jinping late last year – Takaichi sparked a row with Beijing in November when she suggested Japan could becomeinvolved militarilyin the event of a Chinese attempt to invade Taiwan.China urged tourists not to visit Japan – advice they haveheeded– and young people not to study there, citing “safety concerns”. The dispute has disrupted cultural exchanges and even brought an end to decades of “panda diplomacy”.Takaichi’s refusal to withdraw her remarks may haveangered Beijing, but it has played well with many voters.Trump congratulated Takaichi on her election win, wishing her “great success in passing your Conservative, Peace Through Strength Agenda” in a social media post.Margarita Estévez-Abe, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University, said Sunday’s victory could give Takaichi room to repair the damage to Sino-Japanese ties.View image in fullscreenAn election official prepares to open ballot boxes at a counting centre in Tokyo.Photograph: Takashi Aoyama/Getty Images“Now she doesn’t have to worry about any elections until 2028, when the next upper house elections will take place,” Estévez-Abe said. “So the best scenario for Japan is that Takaichi kind of takes a deep breath and focuses on amending the relationship with China.”But if she follows through with the consumption tax cut, the market reaction could be swift and hostile, according to some analysts.Takaichi’s big victory means she will have more political room to follow through on key commitments such as consumption-tax cuts, said Seiji Inada, the managing director at the consultancy FGS Global. “Markets could react in the following days, and the yen could come under renewed pressure.”Blizzard conditions in some regions made visiting a polling station in Sunday’s election, the first held inmid-winterfor 35 years, a test of endurance for many voters.View image in fullscreenSanae Takaichi adjusts her earphone before talking to the media at her party’s headquarters in Tokyo.Photograph: Kim Kyung-Hoon/AFP/Getty ImagesKazushige Cho, a 54-year-old teacher, said he had been determined to vote for the LDP despite the atrocious weather. “She [Takaichi] has shown strong leadership and pushes various policies forward,” Cho said outside a polling station in a small town in Niigata prefecture where the snow had reached a depth of more than 2 metres. “I think things could turn out quite well.”The weather caused widespread disruption on Sunday, halting services on dozens of train lines and forcing the cancellation of 230 domestic flights, according to the transport ministry.The estimated voter turnout was 55.6%, according to NHK – up from 53.8% in the previous lower house election in 2024. The broadcaster said more than 27 million people had cast their votes early.Takaichi’s personal popularity –particularly among younger voters– has transformed the LDP’s fortunes since winning the race to succeed Shigeru Ishiba as the party’s president in October.Under Ishiba, the LDP and its then coalition partner, Komeito,lost their majoritiesin both houses of parliament amid public anger over aslush fund scandaland the rising cost of food and other basics.The LDP, which has governed Japan for most of the past 70 years, was helped, as in previous elections, by a fractured and uninspiring opposition.The main opposition Centrist Reform Alliance, which was formed weeks before by two existing parties, was projected to sink to half of their combined pre-election share of 167 seats, leaving questions hanging over its future.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Since then, the temperature has barely risen above freezing – a temperature science naturally dictates is necessary to melt snow and ice.But science isn’t enough for some US political critics, however, who have instead blamedZohran Mamdani, New York’s new socialist mayor, for the snow not having melted and still clogging up some of the city’s streets.The New York Post, the rightwing tabloid and a frequent Mamdani critic, has led the charge. This weekthe newspaper claimedthat “slushy streets” were “ruining travel for everyone”.“New Yorkers are feeling left out in the cold more than a week after fierce Winter Storm Fern dumped over a foot of snow on the city – and left behind iceberg-sized snow piles blocking roadways, bike lanes, sidewalks and parking spots,” the Post said.The newspaper found and interviewed several people who blamed Mamdani for the fact snow was on the ground, including one man who complained that he had fallen off his bicycle due to ice.Kelly Jane Torrance, the New York Post’s editor-at-large, went onSky News Australiaon Thursday to double down on the criticism. “It’s just incredible how badly he has mismanaged his very first snowstorm,” Torrance said.“The snow is still here. A lot of it. It’s … we’ve got record cold temperatures really in the next day or so,” she added. The mayor of New York has little power over the temperature of the city.Calling Mamdani “pro-criminal”, Torrance suggested that New York is “facing this possible breakdown in public order”.On Monday, the New York police department reported that January, Mamdani’s first month in office, saw record low crime figures for New York, with the fewest murders, shootings, and shooting victimsin the city’s history.The snow-related criticism spread among social media users. On Threads, a user called @lowerdeckmike, who has regularly posted content criticizing Mamdani, posted a picture of some snow andwrote: “More than a week after 11 o ches [inches] of snow fell on Manhattan. It’s still all on the ground.”Michael Rapaport, an actor who in 2001 appeared in Dr Doolittle 2 and now hosts a podcast, has been a frequent critic of Mamdani.On Monday, Rapaport posted a video of him walking around New York andwrote: “A week after the snowstorm and this is what we got Zoron the Shoveler! Filthy black snow, garbage soup, ice rinks on every corner, cars buried like fossils. People slipping, breaking ankles, nobody shoveling, nobody salting, nobody doing SH*T.”Rapaport added: “This is New York City. Three minutes from the mayor’s house. Start spreading the news… this place is a dirty snow covered dump. Clean it the f*** up Mayor!”The message did not serve as the rallying cry that Rapaport might have hoped.“What’s up with the trend of every influencer republican jumping on mamdani for the snow piling up? Real NYers know whenever it snows nyc looks like this… duhhh way before Zohran,” one person responded to his post.Another wrote: “If you pooped your pants would you blame the Mayor??”It didn’t deter Rapaport. On Thursday heposted a videoshowing snow on a New York street.“I need to know who’s responsible for the dog doo doo,” Rapaport said, as he trained his camera on what appeared to be dog feces. “Who’s responsible for the dirty, disgusting, sloppy snow 10 days since the storm?”Rapaport, 55, added: “Why is every step off the curb risking your life?”Debra Messing, the Will & Grace actor whoposted Islamophobic contentabout Mamdani during his mayoral campaign, was also upset.“The streets are a disaster. It hasn’t snowed in 5 days and the streets still haven’t been cleared,” she wroteon social media.“I’ve lived here for 15 years (this go around) and this has never happened. The plows have always worked around the clock to get the city back to working.”In fact, the past 15 years have seen other mayors criticized for their response to the snow. Bill de Blasio was accused of neglecting the wealthy Upper East Side in the wake of a storm in 2014, instead giving Brooklyn and Queens snow-plowing priority, while his predecessor Michael Bloomberg faced scrutiny when some streets went unplowed for days following 20in of snow.On Friday, Mamdanitold Hot 97the issue is “not just the snowstorm, but the cold front”.“Typically after snow falls in New York City we’ll have the temperatures rise, we’ll have the sun assist with melting the snow. Instead what we’ve seen is the snow becoming harder, it turning into ice,” the mayor explained.He said 2,500 sanitation workers were working 12-hour shifts to remove snow and collect garbage.“It’s going to continue until every single street is clean and clear in this city, because that’s what New Yorkers deserve.”Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniNew YorkUS weatherUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Childnet, whose core purpose is “helping to make the internet a great and safe place for children”, is one of several internet safety charities part-funded by tech companies.Childnet denied making edits to keep tech funders happy and insisted it would not stop young people making their points. Aspects of the approved speech did acknowledge that excessive screen time had led to depression and anxiety, and that social media companies should reduce the use of devices such as notifications, autoplay and streaks to prolong user engagement.But Swire said he had “felt censored” by the charity’s handling of their speeches.One line cut warned: “Young people are begging for a rope to pull them from the quicksand” and described social media as “one of the worst psychological addictions in history”.Another was: “Social media companies are in bed with the very same psychology used to exploit gambling victims.” When Swire found out this had been removed at the last minute, he scribbled a similar line back into his speech.“I was pretty surprised because at this stage I didn’t know there was a conflict of interest with where their funding was coming from,” said Swire, who was at the time a member of Childnet’s youth advisory board. “I felt like we were being censored and almost betrayed by this organisation which we wanted to represent with integrity. It was a pretty difficult experience.”Ghai, now 16, said: “It was quite shocking because the stuff that they deleted was bringing to light a lot of things that were happening in the industry. It felt hypocritical because they were asking us to speak up against this and then at the same time they watered down what we wanted to say so much.”Swire said some of the cuts became apparent only in a final paper copy of the speech handed to them shortly before they were due to speak.Will Gardner, the Childnet chief executive, denied making edits to keep tech funders happy.“If young people want to make a point we allow them to make a point but there are constraints – not due to who gives us money, there are constraints in the nature of the event that we’re running, and the time constraints,” he said. “We would certainly advise and edit around tone and language but we wouldn’t stop young people making a point.”He said it was “not true” that edits were made if proposed content could compromise the charity’s relationship with its social media company funders.“I completely refute that,” he said. “Because we work in the online safety space we do get some funding from tech companies … but that doesn’t compromise our voice.”Daisy Greenwell, the co-founder of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, said teenagers “should not be asked to censor themselves to protect the commercial interests of Big Tech”.“Young people’s voices are often positioned as the moral authority in debates about online safety, but too often those voices are only welcomed when they align with an organisation’s existing policy position,” she said. “When young people are filtered until they echo a pre-approved line, that isn’t participation – it’s cover.”Harry Amies, the co-founder of Unplug.Scot, a network of parents in Scotland concerned about the impact of screens and educational technology in classrooms, said: “The evidence that Lewis has presented has left us speechless. Most parents across the UK will be shocked to learn that Safer Internet Day is actually funded bySnapchatand other addictive social media platforms.”Swire, now 19, is campaigning for a social media ban for under-16s. In his original version of his speech, he wrote about a schoolfriend who had told him he felt “terrible” about spending 40 hours a week on social media and wished he could stop, but couldn’t because “I can’t delete TikTok because I make £10 a month on the app. I can’t delete Twitter because that’s where I get my footy news. I can’t remove Snapchat because I’ll lose my streak.” This did not appear in the final speech.Another cut section mentioned research showing “excessive social media consumption is exacerbating a devastating epidemic of loneliness”.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetySocial mediaDigital mediaSnapchatRobloxTikTokMetanewsShareReuse this content"

Iran’s top diplomat said on Sunday that Tehran’s strength came from its ability to “say no to the great powers”, striking a maximalist position just after negotiations in Oman with the US.Mohammadi’s supporters cited her lawyer, Mostafa Nili, who had spoken to her. Nili confirmed the sentence on X, saying it had been handed down on Saturday by a court in the city of Mashhad.“She has been sentenced to six years in prison for ‘gathering and collusion’ and one and a half years for propaganda and two-year travel ban,” he wrote. Mohammadi had received another two years of internal exile to the city of Khosf, about 740km (460 miles) south-east of the capital, Tehran, the lawyer added.Iran did not immediately acknowledge the sentence.Supporters say Mohammadi has been on a hunger strike since 2 Februrary. She had beenarrested in December at a memorial ceremonyhonouring Khosrow Alikordi, a 46-year-old Iranian lawyer and human rights advocate who had been based in Mashhad. Footage from the demonstration showed her shouting, demanding justice for Alikordi and others.Supporters had warned for months before her December arrest that Mohammadi, 53, was at risk of being put back into prison after shereceived a furloughin December 2024 over medical concerns. While that was to be only three weeks, her time out of prison lengthened, possibly as activists and western powers pushed Iran to keep her free. She remained out even during the 12-day war in June between Iran and Israel.Mohammadi kept up her activism with public protests and international media appearances, including even demonstrating at one point in front of Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where she had been held. She had been serving 13 years and nine months on charges of collusion against state security and propaganda against Iran’s government.She also had backed the nationwide protests sparked by the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, which have seen women openly defy the government by not wearing the hijab.Mohammadi suffered multiple heart attacks while imprisoned before undergoing emergency surgery in 2022, her supporters say. In late 2024 her lawyer revealed doctors had found she had a bone lesion that they feared could be cancerous, which was later removed.“Considering her illnesses, it is expected that she will be temporarily released on bail so that she can receive treatment,” Nili wrote.However, Iranian officials have been signalling a harder line against all dissent since the demonstrations.Explore more on these topicsIranProtestFreedom of speechMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Aslef said bringing 18-year-old drivers into the cab would not only help the railway recruit the numbers it needs but also increase diversity and better reflect the communities it serves.Rob Kitley, 31, the chair of Aslef’s young members committee and a driver with GWR, said it was “fantastic to see the legislation now being put in place”.He said: “As young train drivers we have been campaigning for this change for many years, in order to level the playing field and bring our industry into line with other parts of public transport, such as buses and the London Underground.“By widening the goalposts to allow younger candidates to join the driving grade, we open the door to new talent which may otherwise have been lost.”The government declined to comment ahead of an expected announcement. However,discussing proposals last year, the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said they would help in “future-proofing our railways against delays and cancellations caused by a shortage of drivers”, and also drive growth by “getting young people into the workforce and putting them on track for a skilled and fulfilling career”.The move to a nationalised and integrated Great British Railways may have eased the change, with train operators on limited franchises sometimes reluctant to invest in training younger drivers – regarded as more liable to change jobs than midlife joiners, often ex-service personnel.Aslef has argued, however, that recruiting younger drivers will increase diversity, with more people joining straight from school.Dave Calfe, the union’s general secretary, said: “At the moment, many young people make their career choice at 18 and the industry misses out. This change will widen the opportunity for the rail industry to recruit the large numbers of train drivers required over the next five years.”Getting a jobremains challenging, with competition for places, psychometric tests and 12 to 18 months of training. Average salaries are about £70,000.Drivers are already able to start at 18 in other parts of Europe, including Germany, the Netherlands and France. Curiously, teenage train drivers may soon be allowed on either side of the Channel, but not to drive trains through the tunnel that connects them, because of a bilateral agreement between the UK and France.Explore more on these topicsRail industryRail transportTransportTrade unionsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The Foreign Office is understood to be reviewing the payment.Mandelson quit last year as Washington ambassador after further details came to light about his relationship with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This week, he said hewould stand downfrom the House of Lords after yet more documents were published, showing the relationship between the two men to have been closer than thought.Mandelson was reported on Sunday to have receiveda payment worth three months’ salarywhen he quit in September. “I think Peter should reflect on that and either return it or give it to an appropriate charity,” McFadden told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg.The Foreign Office said: “Peter Mandelson’s civil service employment was terminated in accordance with legal advice and the terms and conditions of his employment.”The department is understood to be reviewing the payment – though officials believed at the time they had no legal option but to pay it.McFadden was a close ministerial ally of Mandelson in the lastLabourgovernment, working as his deputy in the business department. He said he had not known anything about his former boss’s relationship with Epstein, and said he had been dismayed by emails that appeared to show Mandelson passing sensitive government information to the late US financier.“This is someone from whom I’ve sought political advice over the years, someone who I thought I knew well, but when I look at the emails that have been published in the last two weeks, there’s a whole side of that I knew nothing of,” he said.McFadden insistedKeir Starmershould remain in his job despite rising pressure on the prime minister in the wake of the latest revelations.“I don’t think it’s good for the country to be changing its prime minister every 18 months to two years,” he said. “It has an economic cost, it has a confidence cost, it has an international reputation cost.”Steve Wright, the head of the Fire Brigades Union, on Sunday became the first boss of a Labour-affiliated union to call on the prime minister to stand down.“I think we need to see change,” he told the BBC.“I think 18 months ago, the general public wanted to see that change, and we’re not seeing it, we’re just seeing a continuation of what happened before. And I think that needs to be a leadership change, and I think MPs need to be calling for that.”Many MPs, meanwhile, are agitating for Starmer to sack his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who pushed personally for Mandelson to be given the job in Washington.Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting, said on Sunday: “Someone needs to take responsibility, and a lot of the responsibility needs to lie with people who advise [Starmer]. It is well known that there is a boys’ club in No 10 of people who feel as though they can act with impunity, give advice. And it’s not worked out well.”Another Labour MP added: “The idea of Morgan being allowed to resign makes the PM look even weaker. He should sack him or he will go down with Morgan. The longer he leaves it, the more likely it is the latter.”Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonLabourKeir StarmerForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Business has grown so quickly that she is now recruiting additional staff.View image in fullscreenWhile the trend of office apiaries is growing, beekeeping providers say they are also conscious of the potential impact on local biodiversity.Photograph: Allan Bentley“Our motivation is improving people’s mental health, which employers increasingly understand is closely linked to nature,” she said. “It’s amazing to see the engagement on people’s faces as soon as we start talking about bees: they get completely lost in the world of bees and forget all about their troubles.”Buckley runs lunchtime workshops for employees and installs cameras inside hives so they can observe the bees from their desks. “We even have one company that livestreams into their break room,” she said.Mark Gale, the founder and managing director of BeesMax Ltd, said the experience was calming, educational and oddly bonding: a rare opportunity for employees to step away from screens and care collectively for something fragile and alive.“It’s like nothing else you could possibly experience during a working day,” said Gale, who rents out and manages hives at sites including the QEII Centre in London, the video games developer Codemasters and the DoubleTree by Hilton hotel chain. “One minute employees are eating their sandwiches at their desk – and the next, they’re in full body suits with 10,000 bees flying around them.”Gale said demand had increased so much that he was taking on new, full-time staff. “The increase is entirely organic,” he said. “It’s all word of mouth.”Supporters of office apiaries say the appeal goes beyond novelty, pointing to workplace wellbeing, team building and tangible evidence of environmental commitment that companies can showcase to clients and staff alike.Some teams report that the bees have become a source of camaraderie, and that in a workplace culture where perks often consist of gym subsidies or free snacks, nature-based experiences feel refreshingly purposeful and even quietly radical.View image in fullscreenBeehives have been installed in the rooftop garden of Park House on Oxford Street in London.Photograph: REM Limited“A gym discount or fruit bowl is nice, but the bees create a shared story and a sense of stewardship,” said Phillip Potts, the general manager of Park House, on London’s Oxford Street, which has seven floors of office space.“Our tenants say it is the most unusual and memorable workplace perk they have experienced – and our queen bee has developed something of a cult following in the building,” he added. “We call her Philippa.”Damson Tregaskis, the founder of Hive5 Manchester, has also noticed an increase in demand. “Employers want to encourage workers to connect more with nature,” she said.‘Brilliant for work-life balance’: how Britain is embracing the ‘workation’Read moreBut as the trend spreads, so do questions about its environmental impact. Ecologists and conservation bodies warn that the rapid growth of managed honeybee colonies – particularly in towns and cities – may not be the unalloyed good it appears to be, when viewed through a biodiversity lens.The concerns apply across the UK, from regional cities to market towns. Any place with limited green space risks putting additional pressure on already declining wild insect populations.Tregaskis is conscious of this. “I know really big companies who have been interested but their motivation has been, for want of a better word, greenwashing,” she said.“Even in these cases, though, you can connect with the people on the ground and make sure you make a real difference,” she added.Buckley is also keenly aware of these issues, pointing to research suggesting that in areas with high density of hives, honeybees can compete with native bees, butterflies and hoverflies for limited nectar and pollen.“We’re careful not to take on any business in locations that are densely populated or already have a lot of beekeepers,” she said.Office apiaries stem from two modern anxieties: the scramble to improve workplace wellbeing, and the need to be seen acting as nature declines. In a single lunch break, the bees’ quiet hum can offer a moment of both.Explore more on these topicsBeesBiodiversityInsectsWildlifeWork & careersMental healthHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Andy Burnham backs plan for multi-city Olympics bidNorthern leaders urge government to support proposal as Manchester mayor says a London bid ‘wouldn’t be right’Josh HallidayNorth of England editorSun 8 Feb 2026 08.01 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 08.20 ESTShareThe north ofEnglandis seeking to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games to boost a region “left out of the national story”.Northern leaders have written to the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, urging the government to back a multi-city games spanning an area with a population of 15 million people.Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, said last year he wanted thecapital to bid for the 2040 Olympics, which would come nearly 30 years after it hosted the 2012 Games.Andy Burnham, theGreater Manchestermayor, said on Sunday it “wouldn’t be fair or right” for London to host for a fourth time, and that a northern bid was “what Britain needs right now”.Sir Brendan Foster, the former 3,000m world record holder and founder of the Great North Run, said a northern games was vital for a “fairer distribution of major international sporting events across the country”.He added: “Obviously iconic sporting occasions like Wimbledon, Royal Ascot, Lords Test matches and theLondonMarathon are rightly celebrated in the nation’s capital, but when the government is financing hosting global sporting events, they should have a balanced national approach as their guiding principle.”In a letter signed by 11 political leaders across the north, Nandy was told that a northern games would be a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to accelerate regeneration, rebalance the economy, and reset international perceptions of England”.Mayors believe they are in strong contention for a 2040 bid after the International Olympic Committee prioritised a move towards multi-city events. They also hope Keir Starmer will see the political benefit of a northern games as his party trails by an average of 10 points in the polls to Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, which is making significant inroads in Labour’s former heartlands.Nandy, the MP for Wigan, has prioritised the distribution of cultural events across the UK, but her department would not be drawn on Sunday on whether it would back the northern bid. A spokesperson said it was a decision for the British Olympic Association.The former Olympic boxing champion Luke Campbell, who is the Reform UK mayor of Hull and East Yorkshire, said: “Winning gold at London 2012 is one of the proudest moments of my life. The whole country came together as one, and it meant everything to me to represent our nation on the world stage – and show that someone from Hull can go all the way.“Bringing the Olympics to the north isn’t just about sport. It’s about giving our kids something to aim for, creating real opportunities and showing the world what this part of the country has to offer.”Mayors said the north’s mix of sporting heritage – which includes the home of football, Sheffield, where the game’s original rules were written in 1858 – and its elite venues made it the ideal host region.‘A massive betrayal’: how London’s Olympic legacy was sold outRead moreSteve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool city region, said a northern games would mark a “once-in-a-lifetime chance to bring the Olympics closer to ordinary communities that have too often felt like they’ve been left out of the national story”.Should the north be successful, political leaders would be careful to avoid the complex and costly legacy of the London Games. The 2012 Olympics cost nearly £8.8bn – three times the original budget of £2.4bn – andturbocharged the gentrificationof neighbourhoods.Research published in 2024describedthe London Games as a “cautionary tale” for local communities.Explore more on these topicsNorth of EnglandOlympic GamesAndy BurnhamSadiq KhanGreater ManchesterLondonNorth-south dividenewsShareReuse this content"

Dr Mehmet Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon, spoke in support on Sunday of the measles vaccine.“Take the vaccine, please,” said Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. “We have a solution for our problem.”“Not all illnesses are equally dangerous and not all people are equally susceptible to those illnesses,” hetoldCNN’s State of the Union. “But measles is one you should get your vaccine.”His boss, health secretaryRobert F Kennedy Jr, has a long history of questioning both the safety and necessity of vaccines.The remarks come asSouth Carolinais experiencing anoutbreakinvolving hundreds of cases, exceeding the number recorded in Texas’ measles outbreak earlier in 2025. Another outbreak has been identified along the Utah-Arizona border, and several additional states have reported confirmed cases this year. Children have been the most affected.US committee is reconsidering all vaccine recommendationsRead morePublic health specialists say theresurgenceis occurring as skepticism toward vaccines grows, potentially fueling the return of a disease that officials had previously declared eliminated in the US.In January alone, the US saw 25% of the totalcasesconfirmed in all of last year, and the outbreak shows no sign of slowing as federal officials mostly stay silent on vaccination.The vast majority of patients are not vaccinated, but there have been no national campaigns announced, with Oz being the first major statement from the federal government. Last year, Kennedy positioned measles vaccines as apersonal choiceand recommended unproven treatments for the highly contagious illness.Oz has previously leaned into Kennedy’s campaign to “make America healthy again” (Maha), an effort to redesign the country’s food supply, reject vaccine mandates and cast doubt on some long-established scientific research. Hecast doubton how well flu vaccines work in an interview with Newsmax last year. “Every year, there’s a flu vaccine. It doesn’t always work very well. That’s why it’s been controversial of late,” Oz said. He instead recommended that Americans “take care” of themselves, so they can “overwhelm” the flu when they encounter it.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationMMRVaccines and immunisationUS healthcareHealthUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It caught alight shortly before 6am on Sunday, regional police in Switzerland’s south-western canton of Valais said in a statement.View image in fullscreenThe memorial was set up near Le Constellation a few days after the 1 January fire.Photograph: Maxime Schmid/AFP/Getty ImagesImages broadcast by Swiss public broadcaster RTS on Sunday showed the blackened top of a white, igloo-like tarpaulin erected over the memorial to protect it from the weather, visible behind a white screen and police tape.“Thanks to the rapid intervention of the emergency services, the fire was quickly brought under control,” police said.No one was injured in the fire at the memorial, they said, though “several commemorative objects were damaged by the flames”.A large book of remembrance, filled with messages of condolence left by those who have visited the memorial over the past five weeks, had been saved, the statement said.Police said an investigation had been opened into what caused the blaze at the memorial, which had initially been placed in front of the burned-out bar but which had recently been moved a bit farther away.“According to initial reports, the fire started near the candles placed on a table in the centre of the memorial,” the statement said. “At this stage, third-party involvement can be ruled out.”Investigators believethat the new year inferno at Le Constellation started when champagne bottles with sparklers attached were raised too close to a ceiling in the bar crowded with revellers, igniting sound insulation foam.The French couple who co-owned the bar, Jacques and Jessica Moretti,are facing chargesof manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Crans-Montana’s head of public safety and a former local fire safety officer are also under criminal investigation in connection with the blaze at the bar, which had not undergone mandatory annual fire inspections since 2019.Following weeks of harsh criticism of local and regional authorities’ handling of the crisis and the investigation, family members voiced consternation upon learning of the fire at the memorial.“What to say?” Laetitia Brodard-Sitre, whose 16-year-old son Arthur Brodard was among those who died at Le Constellation, posted on Facebook over a link to a report about the memorial fire. “It is the municipality’s responsibility to ensure a memorial that is secure.”Explore more on these topicsSwitzerlandEuropeCrans-Montana firenewsShareReuse this content"

However, the legislation passed in theWater(Special Measures) Act last year only referred to “performance-related” bonuses from specific regulated companies.MPs have said the loopholes allowed companies to get around the bonus ban by labelling payments differently or paying bosses through linked companies.This means some bosses who have had their bonuses banned for presiding over pollution and water outages have been paid anyway. Thames Water had its bonuses banned after being deemed a failing company, but stillplans to payits top staff millions in “retention payments” from a controversial high-interest loan that was meant to be used to keep the firm afloat. This is now allowed as these are labelled as non-performance-related bonuses.Yorkshire Water was also banned from paying its bosses bonuses this year, but its chief executive, Nicola Shaw, netted £1.3min an offshore parentcompany over two years. Theboss of South East Water, David Hinton, ison track for £400,000 in bonus payby 2030 despite tens of thousands of people in Tunbridge Wells having had their water cut off for weeks.Wessex Water’s former bossColin Skellett received a £170,000 bonusin the same year as the bonus ban on the utility. The payment was labelled as a bonus, but was allowed because it was made by a parent company.As a result of bonuses still being paid, Reed was accused of being “outwitted” by the water companies.Customer complaints over water bills surge by 50% in England and WalesRead moreEmma Reynolds, his successor, is expected to bring forward tough measures to close the loophole in the interim period when the current regulator, Ofwat, is handing over to a new “super-regulator”. This will be part ofa new water billexpected in the king’s speech in May.“We have warned the water companies to operate within the spirit as well as the letter of the law,” a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs source said, “but it appears they haven’t, so we will need to look at a further crackdown”.Sources told the Guardian that under new plans, water CEOs would not be allowed to be paid bonuses via parent companies. Reynolds has already directed Ofwat to tighten the criteria for what constitutes a “failing” company, and will end the practice of performance bonuses being relabelled as other types of bonuses to get around the ban.The water minister, Emma Hardy, said: “It seems simple to me that bonuses should reflect performance, and if performance is not good enough, people should not get a bonus. It is not just about the letter of the law, but about the spirit of the law. Ofwat has exposed serious transparency failings across the water sector, and we are therefore tightening transparency rules to shut down any attempt to dodge the bonus ban.”View image in fullscreenFeargal Sharkey said the loopholes were obvious in last year’s legislation.Photograph: James McCauley/Rex/ShutterstockFeargal Sharkey, the water campaigner and former frontman of the Undertones, said the bonus loopholes were evident before the legislation was passed.He said: “The loophole was obvious from the beginning. The water companies were never going to operate within the spirit of the law. They have always tested the limits of the law. They have misled governments and polluted the environment, so they were never going to do the right thing. I was not surprised at all. They were warned before the Water (Special Measures) Act became law that this would happen.”Mike Martin, the Liberal Democrat MP for Tunbridge Wells, where failures by South East Water meant his constituents were without water for weeks, said Hinton should “obviously” not get his bonus. He said “It is outrageous these loopholes haven’t already been closed”.An Ofwat spokesperson said £4m in bonuses had been blocked this financial year despite the loopholes. They said the regulator was consulting on changes to the ban. Ofwat has previously said it expected companies to act within the spirit of the law. Last year, it said it was consideringforcing water companies to disclose all pay to bossesfrom related companies after the Guardian’s reporting.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

The company projects that only 6% of US jobs will be automated by 2030.Companies could use AI to replace people working in call centers and technical writing, but they don’t yet have apps that can replace most occupations and probably won’t soon, said JP Gownder, a Forrester vice-president and principal analyst.“A lot of companies are making a big mistake because their CEO, who isn’t very deep into the weeds of AI, is saying, ‘Well, let’s go ahead and lay off 20 to 30% of our employees and we will backfill them with AI,’” Gownder said. “If you do not have a mature, deployed-AI application ready to do the job … it could take you 18 to 24 months to replace that person with AI – if it even works.”But there are benefits to attributing layoffs to AI even if that is not the case.For example, the Challenger report stated that tariffs were cited as the reasons for fewer than 8,000 layoffs, a fraction of the number attributed to AI.“Most economists would tell you that that was implausible,” said Martha Gimbel, executive director and co-founder of the Budget Lab at Yale University. “ChatGPT was only released three years ago … It is not the case that a new technology develops and the workforce adjusts immediately. That is just not how it works.”After anews reportstated that Amazon planned to display how much Donald Trump’s tariffs increased product pricing, the White House described it as a “hostile and political act”.AnAmazonspokesperson then said, “This was never approved and is not going to happen.”“You have seen a real hesitance among some parts of corporate America to say anything negative about the economic impacts of the Trump administration because they feel that there will be consequences,” Gimbel said. “By saying that the layoffs are due to new efficiencies created by AI, you avoid that potential pushback.”CEOs could also be blaming layoffs on AI advancements when they actually justoverhired duringthe pandemic, Gownder said.“That was driven by low interest rates. That was driven by talent wars. That was driven by some dynamics that are not in place any more,” he said.Still, there are instances where CEOs linked layoffs to AI where that is more likely to be the legitimate reason, the economists said.For example, Marc Benioff, CEO of the cloud-based software company Salesforce, said during an interview on the podcastThe Logan Bartlett Showthat he reduced his customer staff from 9,000 to 5,000 because he now uses AI agents.“I need less heads,” he said.Stephany said that was plausible.“The work that has been described – particularly online and customer support – is, in terms of tasks and required skills, relatively close to what current AI systems can perform,” Stephany said.Women in tech and finance at higher risk from AI job losses, report saysRead moreBut that does not mean the public should just accept Benioff’s claim, the AI researchers said.“I think CEO statements are possibly the worst way to figure out how technological change is affecting the labor market,” Gimbel said. “That is not to say that CEOs are lying … It’s to say that there’s incentive effects in what gets covered.”Not long after Amazon’s vice-president linked the October layoffs to AI, the CEO, Andy Jassy,backpedaled.He said they were “not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now. It really is culture.”And months after the Duolingo CEO stated that the company would be “AI first” and only add to its headcount “if a team cannot automate more of their work”, he told theNew York Timesthat the company had never laid off full-time employees and did not plan to.“From the beginning, we’ve had contractors that we use for temporary tasks, and our contractor force has gone up and down depending on needs,” he said.An employee laid off by Amazon in October described herself as a “heavy user of AI”.“There were certain tools that I built specifically for my team’s use, as well as some of our customer teams to use,” said the former principal program manager, whose last day at Amazon was in January and asked not to be identified to protect her privacy because she has not yet received severance pay.She does not think that AI is why she was terminated but instead “maybe aided the ability to have a more junior person do some of the work”.After an employee told her, “Bring me up to speed on the stuff you were working on. We’re going to assign this to one of these new people,” it became clear “that this work wasn’t going to stop but that they were going to get someone who was paid far less to do that work”, she said.She added: “I was laid off to save the cost of human labor.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsAI (artificial intelligence)AmazonHewlett-PackardfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not being able to find it elsewhere – that point of difference – is the most important thing.”She says this is even more so the case during a cost of living crisis, when every purchase is considered and when a shopper “buys something, it has to be amazing”.View image in fullscreenLiberty’s Bridgerton collection coincides with the fourth season of the Netflix show.The Bridgerton collection, showcased against a backdrop of wood panelling, a four-poster bed and what could be the desk of Penelope, one of the show’s main characters played by Nicola Coughlan, coincides with the fourth season of the Netflix hit. The range for sale includes Regency-inspired prints on everything from scarves and dresses to duvet covers.It fits in with the maximalist trend for richly coloured and patterned decor that Libery says helped to drive a 10% rise in sales at its retail arm last year, to about £142m, and a double-digit rise in profits. It also sold more jewellery and clothing.That comes despite a tough time for rival luxury department stores: Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and Harrods have reportedfalling sales and losses.Across the UK, dozens of department stores have closed their doors in recent years, including the entire Debenhams and Beales chains, amid heavy competition from the internet and the rise of brands selling direct.In the noughties, Liberty – which last year celebrated its 150th birthday – was also struggling for survival, listed on the stock exchange but mired in losses and selling off property, including its flagship store, to raise cash.View image in fullscreenLiberty celebrated its 150th birthday last year.Photograph: Prisma by Dukas/UIG/Getty ImagesIn 2010, it was bought by the private equity groupBlueGemfor £32m, with the Italian financier Marco Capello leading a restructure that has put the company on a firmer footing.The Covid pandemic thwartedhopes of international expansionand a stock market float, but BlueGem sold its controlling stake to private equity group Glendower in 2019 in adeal that valued Liberty at £300m.King says Liberty’s success over recent years has been helped by its range of own-label goods, from fabrics to fragrance and frocks, as well as a loyal band of mostly local shoppers who regularly visit in search of creative and exclusive ideas.“Our business is more robust than others,” claims King, who previously did stints at Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and Harrods before joining Liberty just over two years ago as buying director. “Over the last six years the business has grown enormously and locals are the biggest part of that.”The company has signed up exclusive brands such as Peachy Den in fashion and widened its appeal by linking up with an eclectic partners including Adidas, which created a range of sports shoes featuring Liberty prints, as well as the Bridgerton range. Designs are worked up between the brands and Liberty’s in-house team of designers based beside its landmark London store.View image in fullscreenLiberty has linked up with an eclectic brands including Adidas.King says Liberty’s sales have held up despite changes to VAT tax breaks for tourists, brought in by the last government post-Brexit and tough times on nearby Oxford Street.A big jump in online sales, led by jewellery, fashion, fragrance and fabrics, has contributed to growth.King admits that Liberty has benefited from its richly patterned fabrics being in fashion, with florals featuring heavily on catwalks in recent shows and a “more opulent feeling coming back”.The Tudor revival landmark, which opened in its current location in 1924 after the brand was founded by Arthur Lasenby Liberty in 1875 with a £2,000 loan from his future father-in-law, has grown to become an international brand that sells itsdistinctive fabric prints, perfume and leather goods around the world.Still, King say that the quirky design of Liberty, with much of the store set around a grand atrium reaching up over several floors derived from the timbers of two 1800s Royal Navy vessels – HMS Impregnable and HMS Hindostan – means that in many places it is “retailing from a corridor”.View image in fullscreenThe store is set around a grand atrium reaching up over several floors.Photograph: Imageplotter/AlamyIn such a tight space, “every brand and every product has to count” while the listed building does not have the flexibility to follow its rivals in adding numerous bars and cafes to draw in the crowds.Exclusive ranges with the likes of Jellycats’ Bartholomew Bear and Topshop, which last year chose Liberty for its return to the high street, have helped draw queues of fans.Those brands appeal to the younger shoppers who pop in to buy beauty products from neighbouring Carnaby Street, which has also signed up an array of sought-after brands such as Charlotte Tilbury and Brandy Melville.Liberty has also hung on to departments that many rivals have ditched, especially haberdashery, which along with its fabrics appeals to the UK’s growing army of crafters driven by social media.This year, Liberty will expand its jewellery department and build on its own label ranges which now include the fast growing LBTY fragrance, silk dresses, wallpaper and cushions alongside its scarves and fabrics, where it is expanding the in-store department and bringing in new designs more frequently, partnering on designs with artists such as Grayson Perry.“We feel optimistic. We’ve got a lot in the pipeline,” King says. “We are just guarding Liberty for the next generation.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryBridgertonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Barclays will publish its annual report on Tuesday.ShareAction will call on institutional shareholders to vote against the re-election of any chair who they believe is overseeing a climate row-back. Those votes will take place at annual shareholder meetings, due to begin this spring.Kelly Shields, ShareAction’s senior campaign manager on its banking programme, said while this was unlikely to result in any boss being removed, it was a symbolic move that would send a personal message to directors.Shields is hoping to “slow down this trend of [climate] backtracking, and send a signal to the wider sector that backtracking comes with consequences”.“These directors are getting nodded through with 98-99% of the vote,” she said. “Even a small amount knocked off of that can send quite a strong signal, and it does make it a bit more personal. That director hopefully feels responsible and feels emboldened to act, or at least engage with investors on the issue.”ShareAction’s campaign – which will involve rallying some new and existing supporters in the investment world – comes as banks and other financial firms come underfresh pressure over their green commitmentssince Donald Trump’s return to the White House last year.The Republican president’s anti-green agenda has emboldened rightwing climate deniers and fuelled a renewed push for oil and gas production, putting pressure on banks to ramp up financing for fossil fuel companies.It has notably led to a series of defections from the UN-backed net zero banking alliance (NZBA), which required members to ensure their policies would lead them to hit net zero emissions targets by 2050 or earlier.The withdrawal of key NZBA members, including JP Morgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs as well as the UK lenders Barclays and HSBC, eventually led to thegroup’s demise in September.HSBC announced last year it wasdelaying important parts of its climate goalsby 20 years and watering down environmental targets as part of a new long-term bonus plan for its chief executive, Georges Elhedery.“We really want banks to reassess this and do what’s needed to make sure that we’ve got long-term financial stability and are prioritising people and planet,” Shields said.Explore more on these topicsBankingInvestingEthical businessNatWest GroupLloyds Banking GroupHSBCnewsShareReuse this content"

RetaliateFaced with economic coercion, Europe has trodden carefully. My experience tells me that’s not enoughEdward FishmanSun 8 Feb 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 12.46 ESTShareIn February of last year, Donald Trump convened the first full cabinet meeting of his second term in the White House. He proudly announced his intention to impose sweeping tariffs on the US’s closest allies in Europe. When asked by a reporter whether Europe might retaliate, Trump sounded confident. “They can’t,”he said. Pressed to explain, he continued: “We are the pot of gold. We’re the one that everybody wants. And they can retaliate, but it cannot be a successful retaliation.” As Trump saw it, Europe was weak and feckless – a minnow compared with the American economic juggernaut. When confronted with a US president prepared to throw his country’s weight around, Europe would certainly cave.Having spent years in the state department designing and negotiating sanctions, I’ve seen how economic pressure worksIn the year since, Trump has repeatedly wielded America’s economic might against Europe, from coercing the EU and the UK to swallow lopsided trade deals to pressuring Denmark to sell him Greenland. And time and again, his assessment of European countries – that they would scurry to him, hat in hand, eager to make a deal – has been vindicated.To survive another three years of Trump, European leaders will need a different approach. Having spent years as a state department official designing and negotiating sanctions, I’ve seen how economic pressure works in practice – and how it can fail when the target is prepared to absorb pain and push back.India, Brazil and China have faced similar Trumpian economic coercion and managed to survive while preserving their core interests. In the process, they demonstrated that they are serious geo­economic players who can’t be bullied. Though their strategies differed, each combined three elements: resolve, resilience and retaliation. Europe will need all three to withstand Trump with its dignity intact.The first step is to rally public support for defiance. While losing access to the US market is painful – after all, the US is the world’s biggest importer – for most countries, it’s survivable. India is a case in point. Last summer, piqued by the refusal of its prime minister, Narendra Modi, to nominate him for the Nobel peace prize, Trump slapped a 50% levy on India, making it among the most heavily tariffed countries in the world. Instead of hastily penning a Nobel nomination letter, Modi dug in his heels. “India will never compromise on the interests of its farmers, livestock rearers and fisherfolk,”he declared.Modi’s resolve galvanised the Indian people. Lawmakerscoordinated boycottsof American products, andbusinesses refusedto cut prices to keep selling into the US market. Eventually, Trump grew frustrated and turned his attention elsewhere. By rejecting appeasement and standing ready to endure short-term pain, India survived Trump’s onslaught and gained grudging respect in the White House.The second step is to redirect trade. Around the same time his relationship with Modi broke down, Trump picked a fight with Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Lula had committed the sin of allowing his government to prosecute his predecessor, the rightwing populist Jair Bolsonaro, for plotting a coup after his 2022 electoral defeat. To try to force Lula to drop the charges, Trump slapped steep tariffs on Brazilian goods and imposed sanctions on the supreme court judge who was overseeing Bolsonaro’s case.Brazil’s response centred on adaptation. Instead of scrambling to regain access to the US, Lula’s government moved quickly to reorient to other markets. Shipments of beef and coffee that had been heading for America were rerouted to China, the Gulf and south-east Asia, aided by state-backed finance and quiet coordination with buyers. By the end of the year, Brazilian exports had hit a record high, while US consumers grumbled about rising prices for their morning coffee. Having failed to force Lula’s hand, Trump ultimatelyremoved the tariffsand lifted sanctions on the Brazilian judge. By showing Brazil’s resilience to US pressure, Lula stripped Trump of his leverage.The third and final step is retaliation. During Trump’s first term, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, met a group of CEOs before the opening round of US tariffs took effect. “In the west, you have the notion that if somebody hits you on the left cheek, you turn the other cheek,”Xi said. “In our culture, we punch back.”At the time, Beijing was unprepared for an economic war. But it started meticulously mapping the choke points it could one day weaponise against the US. When Trump returned to the White House and swiftly unleashed a new wave of tariffs and tech restrictions on China, Beijing unveiled its plan: in addition to reciprocating Trump’s sky-high duties, it cut off America’s access to the rare-earth minerals it needs to build everything from automobiles to fighter jets. As China refines 90% of the global supply of these minerals, the impact was immediate, forcing companies such as Ford and Suzuki to close factories. The one-two punch of the tariffs and rare-earth restrictions erased trillions from the US stock market and raised fears of a recession. Trump hurriedly agreed to a truce, and within months he was allowing Chinese firms to buypowerful Nvidia AI chipsand referring to the US and China asthe “G2”.The Greenland crisis was not the first time Trump has threatened economic war against Europe, and it won’t be the last. Europe needs a strategy.Like Modi, European leaders must show resolve – rallying their publics to accept some economic pain in defence of their autonomy. A number of leaders have started moving in this direction, but the effort remains uneven, and Trump will read division as weakness. Like Lula, Europe will also need to improve economic resilience. This is where it has made the greatest progress, with the EU concludingnew trade pactswith South American countries andIndia.But any European strategy will fail unless it also learns from Xi. Retaliation makes many in Europe uncomfortable, and for good reason. Yet the transatlantic relationship is not one of one-way dependence; it is one of interdependence. Silicon Valley earns a large share of its profits in Europe. American ambitions to manufacture advanced semiconductors at home would crash without Dutch chipmaking equipment. European investors own $8tn of US stocks and bonds.Europe’s goal, of course, should not be to play all these cards. The result would be economic calamity for both sides. What Europe needs is something simpler and more credible: a plan to play some of them when the next crisis arrives.Over the past year, Europe has learned that Trump’s economic threats won’t just go away on their own. They stop only when they become expensive.Edward Fishman is director of the Center for Geoeconomic Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author ofChokepoints: How Economic Warfare Is Changing the World (published by Elliott & Thompson in the UK and Portfolio in the US).Further readingThe Economic Consequences of Mr Trump: What the Trade War Means for the Worldby Philip Coggan (Profile, £7.99)The Fractured Age: How the Return of Geopolitics Will Splinter the Global Economyby Neil Shearing (John Murray, £25)The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Five Hundred Years of History of Fluctuating Economic Muscle and Military Mightby Paul Kennedy (William Collins, £16.99)Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe big ideafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Has it come of age? Not exactly. It sounds very much of its time, all jaggy riff and angsty yelp. Yet the Newcastle band play the hell out of these songs. They sound better now than back then.They won’t perform the album in full and in order, Smith explains. They’ll throw in tracks from other records. “But,” he reassures, “you will probably hear 97% of it.”Lacking a pie chart, let’s just say the selection is well judged. The inclusion of recent-ish single Favourite Songs feels pointed. Smith sings the opening words – “My best years are behind me” – with a finger in the air, and then pats his chest in mild defiance: “But I’m damned if I’m giving up.”Anniversary shows often carry this unspoken question: how to stay dignified and present when selling tickets based on youthful success? Maxïmo Park achieve it through split-atom energy, a dash of humour and the sort of chops you develop from years on the road.Much attention, understandably, is given to Smith’s stage moves; his pointing technique is such that he could understudy Jarvis Cocker. Worth saying, though, that he has become an impressive singer. The held note at the end of I Want You to Stay is thrilling, and they do well to follow it with Versions of You. A tender reflection on parenthood and absence, it may be their best song.The rest of the band keep things modest. Guitarist Duncan Lloyd, a human shrug, cranks out tune after tune as if they have nothing to do with him. Only Jemma Freese, exuberant on keys, comes close to pulling focus from the frontman.They end with Going Missing. One last banger, one last leap from the drums. Maxïmo Park have played the percentages and won.At O2 Academy, Liverpool, 8 February; then touring UK until 22 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsPop and rockMaximo ParkreviewsShareReuse this content"

They seem to exist on co-dependent hate, not love.So if in bleakest British mid-winter this Nordic blast of nihilism seems too chilly a prospect to sit through, there is a surprise afoot: Richard Eyre’s candescent adaptation brings comedy and tenderness alongside the savagery. Strindberg’s couple is turned from merely horrible to humorously, movingly, horrible.It is awful yet entertaining as they fight it out on Ashley Martin-Davis’s drawing room set design, full of long-faded grandeur. You can see the play’s influence on Edward Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf but here the existential depth and questioning enters into the realm of tragicomedy with black laughs.Also directed by Eyre, it is helped by two astonishing lead actors in Will Keen as the ailing army captain, Edgar, and Lisa Dillon as his thwarted wife, Alice – a one time actor who repeatedly reminds him she might have been a star of the stage had she not married him. They stew in a pool of mutual regret and irascibility, playing power games reminiscent ofHamm and Clov in Samuel Beckett’s Endgame (who is master and who is slave here?), but also bearing something of the desperately isolated, absurdist couple in Ionesco’s The Chairs. Geoffrey Streatfeild is able but a little overshadowed as Alice’s cousin, Kurt, who becomes a pawn between them.View image in fullscreenStewing in a pool of mutual regret … Will Keen as Edgar.Photograph:  /© Nobby ClarkBecause this production really is a two-hander in spirit, balancing the question of who is the protagonist and who the antagonist within the marriage – and the drama. Keen and Dillon bring such spark and mischief to their parts. You laugh at each of them, but feel for them too. He exudes pursed-lipped stoicism until his lashing out; she is childlike in her spite yet you suspect she is the real victim here.Eyre moves its original 1900 setting to the time of the Spanish flu, in 1918. It is an inspired idea, to impose this compulsory closeness on the couple, which rings of reports over the Covid pandemic of domestic disharmony and rising divorce rates in its aftermath.The set intermittently opens up to azure strips of sea waves, as if to suggest that there is more to life out there than this terrible claustrophobia. Yet, there is anxiety around isolation, absent children and most of all the fear that there is nothing out there, beyond mortality. The ailing Edgar is not so much terrified of death as the spectre of no afterlife in a Godless universe. Is it a play about mortality dressed up as a marital drama? Do the characters tear pieces out of each other to fill their void? These are questions I had not asked myself until seeing this production.So, a terrible tango to the death but one which brings a rare and captivating pathos. For a play that risks shrinking into joyless desolation, this expands into something much bigger than a mere marital misery-fest. Not to be missed.At Orange Tree theatre, London, until 7 March.Explore more on these topicsTheatreOrange Tree theatreAugust StrindbergreviewsShareReuse this content"

On the surface Mozart and Da Ponte’s opera is full of cynicism, cruelty and outdated sexual politics: if a production skates over these, isn’t that a cop-out? Now, though –and this week in particular– you could argue thatPhelim McDermott’s 2014 ENO staginglands as something of a relief, serving up those issues with a witty garnish and presenting them as sheer entertainment.The overture sets up what’s to come: in front of a lamé curtain, 12 circus performers unfold themselves one by one from a trunk, carrying placards promising Lust! Intrigue! Big Arias! This staging has its tongue firmly in its cheek from the start. The setting is Coney Island in the 1950s: Act 1 is Happy Days meets motel farce, thanks to the nimbly rotating walls of Tom Pye’s set, with Guglielmo and Ferrando channelling the Fonz in their disguises.There’s a lot of potential distraction – from those dozen extras, who bend, tumble, sword-swallow and fire-eat their way through the show, and to a lesser extent from the ENO chorus as the mostly silent fair-goers (is that a real candy-floss machine?). But our attention stays where it needs to. By the end even the circus performers seem to know that they’re not the main attraction here – something even more mind-boggling has been going on in their midst. Nor is the cynicism one-sided. When Guglielmo rants about women’s fickleness he is watched from behind the hamburger stand by an increasingly large posse of the female extras, looking bored and unimpressed as they wipe the beer glasses. It’s a neat way of throwing the shade back on to the men.View image in fullscreenPotential distraction … extras sword-swallow and fire-eat but know they are not the main attraction.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIt helps that this revival is so strongly cast and that the orchestra, conducted by Dinis Sousa, sounds so energised. Jeremy Sams’s agile, funny translation of the text comes across clearly, the harpsichord zipping along underneath. Andrew Foster-Williams is on superb form as spivvy Don Alfonso, just occasionally offering a tantalising glimpse of self-doubt, and Darwin Prakash andJoshua Bluemake a nice double act as Guglielmo and Ferrando, Blue especially standing out for the smooth line of his tenor and his warmth on stage.Meanwhile, Taylor Raven’s quieter but well-sung Dorabella is a good foil for an outstanding Fiordiligi from the sopranoLucy Crowe: her Act 2 aria, sung from a Ferris-wheel carriage, is a rare but effective moment of intense focus. Ailish Tynan is on cracking form as Despina, balancing mischievous energy with the sense of having seen it all before. Why two such respectable girls are staying unchaperoned at her cheap motel is unclear – but such nitpicking questions are beside the point. Better to enjoy Così than to pull it apart.At the London Coliseum until 21 February, then in a semi-staged concert at the Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, 27 and 18 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicEnglish National Opera (ENO)Wolfgang Amadeus MozartreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s hard to imagine the frantic toil of such an endeavour. But watching this adaptation from Kyoto-based company, ChitenTheatre, will give you a taster: it is a dizzying, challenging 90 minutes – especially for those not familiar with the plot.Constructed from fragments of Dostoevsky’s text – which charts the ricocheting financial and romantic fortunes of roulette addict Alexei Ivanovich, and the family he tutors for – it is delivered in Japanese at largely break-neck speed, subtitles vying for attention with a spinning set, kooky dancing and a cast that bang billiard balls on a central table before they speak. The thrashings of onstage rock trio, Kukangendai, adds to the theatrical onslaught.If you can fight the overwhelm, though, there is much invention to admire. Itaru Sugiyama’s roulette-wheel set, and the cast sat atop it, are kept spinning not by some hidden mechanism but by the increasingly frenzied pushes of an exhausted Alexei – a neat representation of the thrills and drudgery of gambling addiction. Above, a circle of LEDs glow in series, tracking the roulette ball on which so many fates hang.View image in fullscreenDynamic … a scene from The Gambler.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDirector Motoi Miura abandons naturalism for rhythmic dialogue and highly stylised movements. Mostly these emphasise, to chest-tightening effect, the characters’ financial precarity. But there is humour – led by Satoko Abe’s outspoken Grandmother – and shrewd nods to Dostoevsky’s discussions of Russian and European traits, with each character given a signature move and phrase. “HA HA HA!” barks Mademoiselle Blanche, the woman who will marry Alexei’s employer only if his wealthy grandmother dies, her hands moving up and down like weighing scales as she dispassionately deliberates.The dynamic, seven-strong cast are ably led by Takahide Akimoto, whose ferocious, babbling monologues as Alexei reveal the depths and danger of his obsessions with roulette and his employer’s stepdaughter, Polina.This production is not for those who enjoy watching a story unfold through its characters’ connections. The cast recount rather than enact much of the plot, and even lines meant for one another are delivered to the audience. But if you’re looking to be immersed in the panicked slog of addiction, then ready your chips.At the Coronet theatre, London, until 15 February.Explore more on these topicsTheatreFyodor DostoevskyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Distorted voice notes, the depths of the comments section and snatches of conversation make up James Nash’s lithe little nightmare. Unpacking the internet and the violence it plays host to, Guidelines follows the aftermath of a murder, filmed on a phone, as its impact ricochets outwards in real life and on our screens.Pip Williams’s clean direction immediately unsettles. Rachel-Leah Hosker and Alex McCauley flit between reeling off community guidelines for social media with fierce fixed smiles, and playing a pair of teens unable to escape the story of the girl who was murdered in the woods. Patch Middleton’s sound design sustains tension from the start, with a thundering message from a worried mother mutating into an ominous threat.The production echoes the act of doomscrolling. Shattered text, sometimes over-reliant on lists, loops and jumps, like our short attention spans provoking us to consume one more slice of horror between clips of cats and silly dances. Parents and teachers flail for the right words to console and protect, while the guidelines select only the phrases that cover their own backs.The script is deliberately vague. We get specific details of gore, but names and character specifics are absent. Roaming in the context-less world that makes up much of our interaction online, it hints at a universality of the dangers of social media combined with the cruelty of teenage girls, but the lack of specificity holds the emotion of the story we’re told at a distance. A period coda jolts the play into the safety of satire, but the strength of this production is in its effort to capture the spiraling feeling of watching horror play out online, questioning our capacity to consume and be consumed by violence.At New Diorama theatre, London, until 14 February.Explore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

But as he publishes his memoir, why does he believe the artform he made  his name in is in such decline?Rebecca LiuSun 8 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 07.50 ESTShareRoger Deakins – cinematographer to theCoen brothers, Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes, whose work has earned him 14 Oscar nominations and two wins, five Baftas, a knighthood and a reputation for being the greatest practitioner of his craft alive – is struggling to explain just exactly what he does. “Argh!” he exclaims, when confronted by the question: what is cinematography?“Well, I started off trying to be a still photographer, someone like Don McCullin. And it’s been a whole arc through cinematography. Now what is cinematography? I don’t know. It’s very different from still photography. But the essentials are the same. You’re trying to tell a visual story.” It is “very much a collaboration”, he continues; working with “hundreds of people” on films can be a “wonderful experience … I suppose I’m not answering your question, because actually I’ve got no idea,” he says. “The cliche is visual storytelling, but it’s much more than that.”The “visual storytelling” he’s done throughout his 50-year career has been spectacular and immense, encompassing the austere desert landscapes ofNo Country for Old Mento the hallucinatory urban vistas ofBlade Runner 2049. He’s captured the rich, dream-like imagery of Martin Scorsese’s Dalai Lama biopic Kundun, the shadowy action of James Bond’sSkyfall, and – to go back to one of his earliest feature films – the tragic romance of Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and girlfriend Nancy Spungen in Sid and Nancy, set against the golden age of punk in London, Paris and New York. That film shoot, in 1985, was his first proper trip to the US; he had no idea then that he’d be back.Today he is in his Santa Monica home, wearing a baggy black T-shirt and rectangular spectacles secured in place by a glasses cord. His conversational manner is off-the-cuff, straight-talking, devoid of any pretensions while displaying quiet assurance in his own judgments. “I can rattle on for ages,” he jokes, and you can easily imagine him idly shooting the breeze while pursuing his other great love: fishing in Devon, where he grew up. I wonder how that disposition survives in the notoriously egoistic and political world that is Hollywood.View image in fullscreenBowled over … Jeff Bridges in the Deakins-shot Big Lebowski.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyA clearer picture emerges when speaking to his wife, James Ellis Deakins, who joins him today. The two met on set of the 1992 thriller Thunderheart, when she was a script consultant, and have since worked as a team on film sets, with James coordinating communication with the production team and other departments. Where Deakins sprawls and gesticulates and flits from one thought to another, James sits upright, a pink scarf tucked above her (not baggy) black shirt, arms neatly folded, eyes focused in concentration. She will often supply crucial context, pick up on strands Deakins has missed – and subtly rein him in whenever he’s in danger of becoming too indiscreet.“But isn’t the cinematographer also thinking,” she adds, after Deakins admits to being lost, “how can I tell the story visually in the frame?” To consider how to frame, light and compose a film shot so it will convey the requisite joy or sadness or fear. Say “there’s a shot that makes you feel melancholy or afraid, and you don’t know why”. For James, a cinematographer has succeeded when their camerawork encapsulates the feeling of the story. “Because it’s so visceral, people might not come out of the theatre and go: ‘That was great cinematography.’ They just think: ‘Oh, it’s a great movie; I was so scared.’ But they don’t know the cinematography helped that.”1984 was the first film where I did a lot of studio work. It felt like a real movie. I thought: How did I get here? I want moreA fuller picture of the craft emerges in Deakins’s new book, Reflections: On Cinematography. Co-written with James, it’s part memoir, part technical guide that takes readers behind the scenes of his projects throughout his career. In it, a cinematographer emerges as not only the director of camerawork, but also a sculptor of light; a watcher of the weather; a fleet-footed problem solver and illusionist; and, in Deakins’s case, a leader of a technical crew who have long become collaborators.Deakins takes us behind how he mimicked daylight in the blacked-out factory that served as the central cell block in The Shawshank Redemption (skylights in the ceiling with diffusion panels). It was so successful that, months later, he was amused to overhear a fellow cinematographer question the film’s award nominations, because he had erroneously assumed it had been shot in natural light.Many an hour is spent waiting for the right weather conditions to appear: for snow on the Coen brothers’ Fargo, or for the clouds to roll in on Sam Mendes’s 1917 (as the film appears as one long take, the lighting had to be consistent). Deakins is delighted when his dolly operator finds a lo-fi way to film a tumbling bowling ball in The Big Lebowski – they pushed the camera down the alley with a pole – and for Skyfall,  Deakins’s chief electrician lit the back of Liverpool Street station in vivid green, in order to mimic the colour palette of Shanghai, where the scene was supposed to take place, as well as disguise the area to sharp-eyed Londoners.Writing the book has prompted plenty of reflection. “I think my career path has been unlikely. It certainly seems unlikely if I look back at myself at 16,” Deakins says. It strikes me that his work may soon appear unlikely for a whole new set of reasons. He and James also wrote the book, he says, because “the film industry is in a bit of a decline at the moment”.Hollywood is now confronting the arrival of artificial intelligence from an already convulsive backdrop of diminished earnings, the rise of streaming and the dominance of franchise reboots and superhero films that rely heavily on green screens and CGI. Deakins’s work – known for its naturalistic, even painterly, scenes, with delicate interplays of light and shadow – may well soon look like a rarity; the stuff of legend from a fast-disappearing past.Deakins’s childhood in Torquay was not particularly happy: “It led me to be a bit angry.” His parents met during the second world war: his father, William, was an explosives expert with the Royal Engineers and his mother, Josephine, served in the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force. She developed multiple sclerosis in 1949, the year Roger was born, became bedridden, and died nine years later. Meanwhile, Roger spent his teenage years indulging in occasional “excessive drinking” and skipping his studies to go fishing. “I was lost,” he says. He loved watching films in the five local cinemas around Torquay, and was moved in particular by Stanley Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove and Peter Watkins’s The War Game, but never thought of it as something he could do himself.All he knew then was that he didn’t want to work at a bank: a fate that his school teachers had said would be the “highlight of his life”. Off he went to art school in Bath, where he developed an interest in photography, but still didn’t have a sense of a career. The National Film School was soon accepting its first intake: he was rejected, but was told he’d be allowed in the year after. In the meantime, he took on a job photographing life in north Devon, capturing a community being pushed into modernity through the arrival of mass tourism.View image in fullscreenThe war game … George MacKay in a scene from 1917 directed by Sam Mendes and shot by Roger Deakins.Photograph: François Duhamel/APThe first time Deakins had a sense that cinematography was his calling was only when he was in his mid-30s, on the set of Michael Radford’s adaptation of 1984. He had done plenty of camerawork before then: he shot documentaries that took him to Zimbabwe during the war of independence; followed yachtsman John Ridgway’s journey sailing round the world; and also shot music videos for Eric Clapton, Meat Loaf and Marvin Gaye. However, it was on the set of 1984, the “first film where I did a lot of studio work” and “felt like it was a real movie”, where he thought: “Wow. How did I get here? I want more.”The arc of his career recalls another figure who grew up in a British town far outside the metropole, who found his way into feature film-making relatively late before becoming a Hollywood grandee: Ridley Scott. Scott has credited his early career in advertising with his later success in movies. Did Deakins’s circuitous journey also prove useful?There’s a certain director who used to operate the camera himself. We agreed that wasn’t going to work. I operate the cameraDocumentaries “gave me a lot of confidence”, he says. “That was the thing I was really lacking as a kid: the experience of life and travelling, and seeing there are many things to worry about than what’s happening in your own interior.”“From a practical viewpoint,” James adds, “when you’re shooting a documentary, you’re shooting something that’s only going to happen once. So you have to determine what angles are the best, you have to do it quickly. You don’t get a second chance.”Deakins believes his adventurous early jobs were important in his development. “Life experience is something that is not talked about a lot,” he says of the industry. “I think some of the directors that are raised in the bubble of the film world, they keep reinventing the same damn movies. They don’t really reach out outside of their movie world.”Part of the reason why cinematography might be so hard to define is that the job can vary greatly between directors. His longstanding collaboration with the Coen brothers began in 1991 with the comedy Barton Fink, and has extended on to A Serious Man, True Grit and others. Deakins says the pair are “very knowledgable and quite specific about every aspect of a film”, with a “clear idea visually of what they want. Some people might say that might be restricting for a cinematographer, but I find it refreshing because you start at a point and can work further. Another director I’ve worked with, I’m not going to say the name, said: ‘I don’t know anything about the camera, but I want you to do that, and I just want to concentrate on the script and acting.’”Meeting a director is kind of like “interviewing a potential roommate”, James says: you’re trying to determine whether you’d work well together. “I’ve always loved operating the camera,” Deakins says. “There’s a certain director whose name you mentioned earlier” – which makes James laughs and wave her hand about in mock exasperation – “who I’ve been to interviews with, who always used to operate the camera himself. We agreed at the end of the interview it wasn’t going to work. Because I operate the camera, and he operated the camera. So how’s that going to work?” The director in question is, judging from hispast comments, Ridley Scott.“And yet you guys got along so well,” James adds, “and always do every time we run into him.”Deakins’s insistence on operating the camera himself, it seems, reflects a broader principle he values in his work: specificity and intentionality. “I don’t like shooting films with dozens of cameras,” he says. “I like the precision, that’s why I’ve loved working with Joel and Ethan [Coen], and with Denis [Villeneuve.] … I love that process of finding the scene rather than shooting a lot of stuff and finding it in the cutting room. That’s just sloppy and lazy.” He prefers “stripping things down to the basics”; his still photography tends to capture desolate, mournful scenes in black and white. Good cinematography, for Deakins, shouldn’t announce itself; in fact, it shouldn’t be noticed at all. He and James recently rewatched the 1963 Paul Newman film Hud, directed by Martin Ritt with cinematography by the pioneer James Wong Howe. “It’s magnificent. Everything about it is so simple, and so precise and deliberate. But you’re totally immersed in the characters and the world it creates.”By contrast, “so often, especially on modern movies, you see the camera swooping all over the place, flashy coloured lighting. It’s just a distraction, because it makes you aware that you’re watching the movie.” Other pet peeves: lens flare (also distracting); excessive cuts (can drain the tension out of a scene); overenthusiastic and unthinking adoption of new technology (“How often do you watch a TV series, and when they cut to a wide shot it’s actually done by a drone? And you go: ‘Oh no, another one.’”)The world changes; people get their entertainment from different sources now. It’s just a natural evolutionFilm sets can be famously stressful places. In his book, Deakins recounts being publicly insulted by directors; once, a night shoot was held up while its lead actors sparred over whose trailer would park closest to the set. He doesn’t seem like someone who is happy to indulge egos, as seen by his marked lack of interest when I ask about his two – and to many, wildly overdue – Oscars (“It’s the work that matters, not all that stuff”).“Where I lose my patience is when I don’t feel people have the passion, or make the most of opportunities,” he says. “I find it really hard to put up with. I’m not the easiest person to get on with on set, frankly.”“That’s not true, actually,” counters James.“Well I don’t know, people say that.”“Well, people who are actually there and working love working with you, because you’re so focused and ready to do it. It’s the politics you’re not good at.”The Hollywood that Deakins grew up admiring – he references multiple Paul Newman films – is very different from the Hollywood of today. He’s not a fan of big action films: when Sam Mendes called him about shooting Skyfall, the first thing the director said was: “Don’t put the phone down when I tell you what I’m doing next.” I ask Deakins about something he’s previously said: “I’m nostalgic for the kind of films that used to be made that aren’t being made any more.”“Don’t be too bitter,” cautions James.“The world changes,” Deakins says even-handedly, “people get their entertainment from different sources now, it’s just a natural evolution.Would they make Hud today? Probably not.”“There are less character-based movies,” adds James. “‘Event’ movies are great to see and fun, but it’s also nice to have ‘character movies’ to learn about how a different human being is. That’s what we’re missing.”Meanwhile, there has also been a backlash against the state of cinematography. Aviral essayon the archetypical Netflix film criticised its “terrible lighting”, and how scenes look “both oversaturated and flat, with the blacks brightened and the highlights dulled”.Legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins’ best photograph: Weston-super-Mare in the rainRead more“I think part of the reason is that [digital camera] technologies have advanced to such a state that you don’t have to light a shot,” Deakins says. Beforehand, when you had to think about how to reproduce the effect of, say, car headlights coming on to a road at night, you “had to make decisions about light and shade”. Now, James says, “producers don’t want to spend the time on lighting, because if you can see the image, then you must have it. So the whole concept of making the [camera] frame tell the story, alongside the dialogue, has been disappearing.” It is increasingly popular, Deakins says, to “shoot something fairly flat and manipulate it” in post-production. As for AI? “All I’ve experienced is the real world, and shooting a film on location, and that collaborative process,” he says. “I don’t want to experience 24 weeks on a volume [a wall made of LED screens] with a virtual reality background.”All this may suggest the pair have begun to turn their backs on the film world, but they are busy running theirTeam Deakins podcastandwebsite, which they hope demystifies the industry for newcomers. They do considerable outreach: the website hosts a forum where they chat with all manner of posters – even students seeking help with their school projects. Deakins is also working on his second book of photography. Although they have dedicated much of their lives to the film world, they’re keen to maintain a sense of perspective. “Oftentimes, in the business, people tend to think this is the most important thing in the world,” says James.“I met a farmer once, and he was doing a stone wall up in Dartmouth,” Deakins says. “They just lay these stones together without any mortar or anything. It’s just brilliant what they do. And he was just loving the work.“Isn’t that just life?” he continues. “You’ve got to love what you do, whatever it is. It doesn’t have to be film-making; it can be anything.”Reflections: On Cinematography by Roger Deakins is published by Octopus on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFilmCoen brothersSam MendesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the time, my friend was going through a tough time,soI askedif shewould like to move in with us and our two children. There was no written agreement, but the plan was that she would either quit her job and retrain, or save for her own place and move out in six months to a year. She pays us £350 a month, which goes towards energy bills, bar athree-month period when she wasn’t working. I also gave her money towards taking a course.She hasn’t retrained, got a new job or saved for a new place. And shedoesn’t have the money to move out. I feel trappedand resentall I have to do as a working mumwhile she’s here, but that’s compounded by guilt as I know I’m very privileged to have a big house and a well-paid job. I hate that she sees me at my worst (rowing with my husband/sorting out arguments between the kids) and I feelas if I’m constantly keeping my emotions in check around her.Our friendship feels warped into a parent-child dynamic.I can’t bring myself to talk to her when I know she’ll cry, which makes me feel like a coward. Any advice?You’re not a coward, but something is stopping you saying what needs to be said. I went to psychotherapist Chris Mills and also solicitor Gary Rycroft.You need to check where you stand legally. If you live in England and Wales, Rycroft didn’t think the payment of £350 could be said to give your friend acquired “equity” in the house as it’s clearly for expenses, and she doesn’t have exclusive occupation, which might have given her a right to stay indefinitely. Ideally, you would have got her to sign a formal lodger agreement to set things out, so please get the relevant legal advice.Mills felt it was time for tough love: for you and your lodger. “You say you hate your lodger seeing you at your worst, but I suspect it was your own version of who you are at your best that led you into this dilemma; your overactive feelings of guilt and unworthiness that compelled you to rescue your friend from her problems rather than sympathetically being alongside her while she sorted things out for herself.”You don’t have to provide justifications for wanting your house back. The kindest thing you can do now is to stop treating your lodger like the child she isn’tWe should all help each other if we can, but it’s nearly four years on and I fear you are being taken advantage of. You suspect this too, which is why you feel as you do. You seem apologetic about your house and well-paid job, and this seems to be stopping you acting. You may be privileged, but so is your friend – she has you. She hasn’t kept up any of her part of the bargain, either.PMDD is ruining my life. What can I do?Read more“It’s up to you to initiate an adult conversation about this,” says Mills, “but you need to be ready for the risk that she’ll kick back in ways that might reactivate your feelings of guilt. I don’t doubt that you’re a compassionate person, but these things are meaningless if they’re not balanced by an equal capacity to be clear, tough and decisive on your own behalf.”This problem isn’t magically going to go away. You say you feel as if you’re the parent: well, sometimes the parents need to say no. Give her adequate but not expansive notice to assuage your guilt (and maybe fulfil legal obligations). “Don’t apologise or make excuses,” advises Mills. “You don’t have to provide justifications for wanting your house back.” If she cries that will be tough, but you will just have to let her. “The kindest thing you can do now for your lodger, and for yourself,” says Mills, “is to stop treating her like the child she isn’t. Once you realise that being hated by her isn’t the worst thing in the world, you’ll no longer be stuck.”Being assertive isn’t about being unkind; it’s about redrawing boundaries when others can’t.Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

As content creatorCamila Hurstputs it, “It’s basically not a party without them.” Quick and simple to make from everyday ingredients, they’re also an ideal last-minute gift for someone you love.The chocolateView image in fullscreenOlivia Mesquita uses dark chocolate for her brigadeiros. All inset photographs by Felicity Cloake.Older recipes tend to call for hot chocolate powder, but plain cocoa powder makes for a less intensely sweet result. Mesquita’s book, Authentic Brazilian Home Cooking, uses dark chocolate, and TV chefLeticia Moreinos Schwartzsuggests combining the two. But, delicious as the results are, they’re more like dense, butterychocolate trufflesthan light, silky party treats. LikeYotam Ottolenghi, I’ve gone for four tablespoons of cocoa, but feel free to adjust this to suit your palate.The dairyView image in fullscreenNatalie Pereira’s mother used a mix of sugar and milk for her brigaderios, but Felicity recommends tinned condensed milk.Chef Natalia Pereira told theNew York Timesthat her mother in Minas Gerais would stir milk and sugar together over the wood stove to produce her brigadeiros – though homemade condensed milk is easier than I expect, the flavour is lost here, so I’d recommend the tinned variety.Almost everyone uses butter, with the exception of the recipe on the Carnation condensed milk website, which substitutes margarine, making me think a vegan version might be possible with plant-based condensed milk. Schwartz also adds a spoonful of double cream, tempering the intense sweet bitterness of the cocoa and condensed milk into something mellower; it’s optional but worthwhile, in my opinion.The extrasView image in fullscreenYotam Ottolenghi’s brigadieros call for crushed biscuits to be stirred into the mix.Salt, though not traditional, is a must, and you might also like to flavour the brigadeiros with sweet spices such as vanilla or cinnamon, or coffee powder, or stir in crushed biscuits (like Ottolenghi), fruit or nuts for texture.Once they’re firm enough to roll – and the mixture is often eaten from the pan at home – you can coat them in more cocoa powder, ground nuts, chocolate flakes or desiccated coconut as takes your fancy … though nothing says “party’” to me like crunchy, colourful hundreds and thousands.Perfect brigadeirosPrep10 minCook15 minMakes1830g butter4 tbsp cocoa powder, plus extra to coat1 tbsp double cream(optional)1 x 397g tin condensed milk½ tsp flaky sea salt(or to taste)Hundreds and thousands, coarsely ground nuts or desiccated coconut, to coatPut a small heatproof tray or plate near the hob. If you have a cooking thermometer, get that ready too, though it’s not vital here.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenMelt the butter in a small saucepan (not non-stick) on a low heat and sift in the cocoa powder. Stir into a smooth paste, then beat in the cream, if using, and the condensed milk, plus the salt. Whisk or stir until well combined.View image in fullscreenTurn up the heat slightly and cook, still stirring continuously (a silicone spatula is useful for getting into the edges of the pan), until the mixture has thickened and you begin to see the bottom of the pan consistently as you stir. It should read between 95 and 99C (203-210F) on a thermometer and take about 10 minutes but will vary slightly depending on your pan and hob.View image in fullscreenPour on to the tray or plate, leaving behind any stuck to the base of the pan (this can be reheated with a little milk to make a delicious hot chocolate that saves you scrubbing the pan), then set aside to cool until fairly firm.View image in fullscreenScoop out teaspoons of the cooled mixture and use your hands to roll them into balls. Tip your coating of choice into a small bowl and roll the balls in it to coat. Put in the fridge to firm up a little if necessary before serving.Brigadeiros: marketing gimmick or Brazilian icon?

She’s a beautiful woman, but has six dog heads, all grumpy and snarling, as well as a serpent’s tail.If Scylla herself were ever to turn up at Cylla, dogs’ heads barking and tail flapping, they’d have to seat her in one of the gorgeous private booths at the front as you enter the room. These are the spots to grab if you want a little privacy, which is why we eschewed the long, prettily lit cocktail bar and headed straight to this cosy hidey-hole for a round of Poseidon’s Wrath. “It’s a bit like a dirty martini,” explained our server, who was one of those warm, bright, commanding, knowledgable souls who, in a hospitality setting, is worth her weight in drachma. This invigorating, mega-bitter tipple of vodka and vermouth laced with piney, herbaceous mastiha, seaweed and kalamata olive brine is the cocktail equivalent of being rescued by the RNLI: salty, breathtaking and head-spinning. Fret not, sweetness seekers, because they also offer a dozen other honey-, peach- and even meringue-based cocktails, if those are your thing, and all with equally dramatic, Greek myth-related names. Aphrodite’s Bloom, anyone? It’s a sensuous ode to the golden hour, the menu says.View image in fullscreenCylla’s prawn saganaki: ‘Firm king prawns in a well-balanced garlic and ouzo tomato sauce.’Brilliantly, Cylla, which is a recently revampedAll Bar One, manages to pull off all this high drama without tipping into Del Boy from Only Fools and Horses territory. Instead, there’s simply something rather reassuring about the place’s commitment to delivering an experience that’s seriously, elegantly Greek, but in a playful way. We went on a wet Wednesday in mid-January, when restaurants across the land tend to be deserted, unheated or just plain shut. Not Cylla, though: it was nicely heaving with plenty of tables of two, as well as several larger client groups – this is, after all, the businessy end of town. Convivial midweek, mid-winter dining can be hard to find, but I’m pleased to report it’s happening here.The menu is roaringly trad Greek with the occasional Mediterranean and Brit leaning. A smoked aubergine meze was outstanding: smooth, rich and with a hugely impressive depth of smokiness that could come only from truly cared-for veg, all laced with parsley, garlic and vinegar. Prawn saganaki was also very good indeed, with a generous amount of firm, grilled king prawns in a well-balanced garlic and ouzo tomato sauce. The basket of warm homemade bread is essential.View image in fullscreenCylla’s rather underwhelming lamb baklava.Lamb baklava, however, was less exciting, and pretty much just traditional sweet bakalava but stuffed with cumin and thyme-flavoured lamb. In hindsight, we should have gone for the grilled octopus with pearl onions and fava puree. A Greek-tinged beef tartare was laced with plenty of chopped gherkins, capers, truffle and Tabasco, and came with a nicely pungent chive mayo and a smoked egg yolk on top, as well as someroditikipitta, a crisper, flatter style that’s authentic to Rhodes; these little touches make Cylla’s menu feel quite personal.Central Birmingham has an array of dining options, but many of them are chains, albeit good-quality, if pricey ones. At Cylla, however, you get a real feeling that this is a restaurant that’s ploughing its own furrow, which in this day and age is increasingly rare.View image in fullscreenCylla’s beef fat potatoes are ‘quite possibly the best fondant potatoes I’ve ever eaten’.A main course of red snapper offered up a generous, nicely cooked piece of flaking fish on a subtle, bouillabaisse-style sauce that could have done with a bit more basil, fennel and star anise, although by this stage my full attention was taken by the beef fat potatoes, which are mesmerising. Yes, they sit there coyly on the sides menu, speaking nothing of their greatness, but they are quite possibly the best fondant potatoes I’ve ever eaten, and maybe even the best potato side dish served in the UK today. To the naked eye, they resemble that all too familiar rectangular gastropub-style confit potato stack, as made famous bythe Quality Chop House, among others, and copied everywhere, but these are so much more than that. The centre of these spuds is more like fluffy mash, while the exterior has a crisp whack of beef fat on all four surfaces.View image in fullscreenCylla’skaridopitawalnut dessert is ‘a diversion into fancy-schmancy’.Thekaridopitawalnut dessert, meanwhile, was a diversion into fancy-schmancy plating, with its smears, foams and puddles of pecan cremeux, chocolate namelaka, vanilla and chocolate pâte à cigarette. But it was delightful, all the same.Cylla is winner. In fact, I’ve already recommended it three times, which is the restaurant critic’s equivalent of saying I’d sell this Ford Mondeo to my nan. Cylla is both a dependable place to take groups and a rather lovely spot for a romantic tête à tête, especially if you can bag one of those booths and settle down in the home of a glamorous sea monster. Wear a life jacket, because some things are worth getting wet for.Cylla43 Newhall Street, Birmingham B3, 0121-714 9443. Open all week, noon-11pm.

Here are some excellent options, whether you’re using up leftover veg or exploring unexpected new flavoursTim DowlingSun 8 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 00.02 ESTShareTechnically, many soups are spiced in some way, even if it’s just with pepper. But we all know what is meant by a spiced soup: something with a jolt to it, and a bit of heat to warm up a winter evening. When it comes to soup, spice is the ultimate companion to a main ingredient that may otherwise be considered boring or bland. In this sense, the spices are the most important component: they are what the soup will taste of.But which spices go with which ingredients, and how? Here are 17 different recipes to help you figure that out.View image in fullscreenNigel Slater’s spiced suggestion offers more promise than your standard carrot soup.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverA word of advice: making soup is, by and large, a pretty forgiving endeavour. Presentation is not paramount, and amounts can be varied without much risk. A soup should ideally be made from things you already have to hand, so don’t give up on a recipe for the sake of a single missing ingredient – it will almost certainly be fine without it.One other thing: you’ll want to have a stick blender at the ready; almost all these soups are either wholly or partially liquidised before serving.View image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ Moroccan lentil and carrot soup is spiked with cumin.Photograph: Yuki Sugiura/The Guardian.  Food stylist: Aya Nishimura. Prop stylist: Louie Waller. Food assistant: SongSoo Kim.Let’s begin with carrots. Nobody gets too excited at the prospect of carrot soup, but aspiced carrot soup such as Nigel Slater’s– spiked with cumin, coriander and chilli – offers a bit more in the way of promise.Thomasina Miers’s Moroccan spiced lentil and carrot soupcombines cumin and paprika with cinnamon and ginger, and is served with lemon, yoghurt, coriander leaves and some crispy kale. Not a bad way to use up three carrots on a cold weekday night.My traditional method for dealing with leftover parsnips – letting them rot in the vegetable drawer of the fridge before binning them – can certainly be improved upon. Here are three possibilities:Angela Hartnett’s spicy parsnip number;Jamie Oliver’s spiced parsnips with lentils, andDelia Smith’s take, with curried parsnip and apple.View image in fullscreenAngela Hartnett’s spicy parsnip soup with onion bhaji.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianDelia’s recipe makes use of a wide spice palette, including ginger, turmeric, cardamom and coriander. If the grated apple strikes you as a weird addition, rest assured that it happens right at the end and may therefore be considered optional. The parsnip crisp garnish, on the other hand, sounds essential.Celeriac can be a troublesome leftover, not least because it’s hard to use up a whole one in one go.Yotam Ottolenghi’s celeriac, garlic and rice soupoffers one bold strategy. It’s infused with roast garlic and cinnamon, and served with a charred lemon salsa – that is to say, lemon slices that have been fried on both sides and finely chopped with parsley and spring onion.View image in fullscreenOttolenghi’s roast-garlic infused soup is a bold way to use up leftover celeriac.Photograph: Louise Hagger/The GuardianOne rarely buys cauliflower while in an adventurous mood, but it can provide a solid basis for a densely flavoured winter soup.Hetty McKinnon’s cauliflower soupwith pomegranate seeds and smoky baba ghanoush is a perfect example, as is thisMoroccan spiced cauliflower and almond soup.Pulses often feature as a thickener in spiced soups, but they can also serve as a main ingredient.Nigella Lawson’s split pea soupwith chilli ginger and lime is simplicity itself – the yellow split peas are simmered with spring onions, chilli and garlic for an hour, before adding vegetable stock powder, ginger and lime (juice and zest). That’s it – serve topped with coriander, more chilli and more spring onions.View image in fullscreenMandy Yin’s Malaysian chicken curry laksa calls for a record-setting range of spices.Photograph: Martin Poole/The ObserverNext up, two quick recipes that rely on black beans straight from the tin:Rukmini Iyer’s spiced black bean and tomato soup, and ablack bean and chicken soupwith kale. The first is spiced with smoked paprika and freshly ground coriander (Iyer cautions against ready-ground coriander, saying “it tastes like despair”); the second features tinned tomatoes and leftover roast chicken.The combination of pumpkin and spice is closely associated with a disgusting seasonal coffee, but do not let that put you offThe combination of pumpkin and spice is nowadays more closely associated with a disgusting seasonal coffee than a hearty winter soup, but do not let the association put you off.Ottolenghi’s roasted pumpkin soupwith harissa and crisp chickpeas is a little bit involved – you’ll need preserved lemons, dried apricots, rose water, cardamom pods and possibly the afternoon off.José Pizarro’s spiced roast squash soupincludes fried chorizo. Despite the name,Anna Jones’s green peppercorn and lemongrass coconut brothactually has half a butternut squash in it, and only 15 green peppercorns. She recommends either fresh or brined for the grassy punch they give. I recommend you don’t overlook this recipe just because you have neither.View image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s quick mussel and rice soup with Turkish pul biber chilli flakes and kefir.Photograph: Ola O Smit/The Guardian. Food styling: Sam Dixon. Prop styling: Rachel Vere.Ravinder Bhogal’s quick mussel and rice soupis spiced with Turkish pul biber chilli flakes and enriched with kefir. Thisspicy peanut butter and corn ramenis quick – it takes no more then 20 minutes, as long as you’ve got gochujang, smooth peanut butter, sweetcorn and pak choi within reach.Finally, here’s achicken curry laksa from Mandy Yin, featuring a range of spices that may set some kind of record: star anise, ginger, cumin, turmeric, coriander (ground and leaf), chilli (dried, fresh and powdered), garlic, tamarind paste and shrimp paste. You’ll almost certainly have to go shopping beforehand, but then your store cupboard will be set for the year.Explore more on these topicsFoodSoupMain courseVegetablesChickenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you’re a go-getter of a certain age, you have to get out. Now it’s a place people retire to, which skews the house prices even more. You can stay and work in the service industry and enjoy going to the beach, but you’ll never have much income to create a life for a family. We agreed that power should be exercised at a more local level, but, for me, that’s a purely functional thing – you devolve power to the highest level necessary and the lowest level possible. For him, the organising principle was Cornish national identity.Dining across the divide: ‘For him it seems to come down to good immigrants and bad immigrants’Read moreJohnBecause of the decline of mining over the last 200 years, Cornwall is a lot more sparsely populated than all the other counties. And that leads to different requirements, especially when it comes to things like public transport. If I had taken any kind of public transport to this dinner, I would have had to allow three and a half hours. We need the ability to control policies in a way that’s more in tune with the needs of Cornwall, because our challenges are so different.JeremyHe wasn’t saying, “We don’t want certain people here.” It was more the nationalism you would see in Scotland and Wales, not a Tommy Robinson version. But I still don’t see national identity as a helpful principle.JohnWe were aligned on devolution; he just didn’t agree that nationhood would be the best way of getting it.View image in fullscreenSharing plateJeremyMen of a certain age, it’s very easy to trip over terminology. My daughter’s constantly pulling me up on it, and I’m always willing to be told. I feel that the word “woke” can be used as a lazy term of abuse for somebody else’s argument. Whereas what I understood it to mean is that you were respectful of other people’s views and feelings.JohnI think we both felt that some things have gone too far, woke-wise, even though most of our views in that area were what you’d describe as left wing. He was talking about the amount of time he spent in a meeting once discussing whether it should be chairman or chairperson. From my point of view, the more extreme things go in that direction, the easier it is for the right to shoot it down.View image in fullscreenFor aftersJeremyWe disagreed on tariffs, and I never saw that coming. I went into a little homily about how Trump was creating such a problem for future presidents, but he said, “I’m not sure I agree with that.”JohnThis is the one thing I agree with Donald Trump on.

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told toOlivia LadanyiSun 8 Feb 2026 06.00 ESTShareTodd, 49The first time we had sex with a couple, I didn’t anticipate how destabilising it would feelI became friends with Amber in the summer of 2021, when she was still married. One night, we talked until sunrise and I found myself opening up in a way I never had before.When we eventually became a couple in 2023, she was the most satisfying sexual partner I’d ever had, and she says the same. That level of communication, trust and respect doesn’t come naturally to me, but Amber makes it possible.We have similar sex drives, but my body doesn’t respond the way it used to. We’re both experiencing hormonal changes; Amber is perimenopausal, and I joke I’m in “manopause” – my testosterone is low and sometimes I struggle to maintain an erection.When Amber told me she was sexually attracted to women, we decided to explore it together. The first time we had sex with a couple, I didn’t anticipate how destabilising it would feel to see her with another man. Watching her have sex while I couldn’t stay hard sent me spiralling: what’s wrong with you? Why can’t you respond to your desire? But Amber isn’t my possession and everyone else was having a good time. No boundaries had been crossed and no one had betrayed me, so I didn’t know how to voice my frustration.I’m learning that honesty, even when it’s uncomfortable, is the only way this will workThe next day, Amber said: I need to be able to trust you to tell me when something’s wrong, or we can’t do this. I don’t like thinking of myself as fragile, but I’m learning that honesty, even when it’s uncomfortable, is the only way this will work.We have sex a couple of times a week, and when it’s just the two of us, it’s fairly vanilla. It’s more about energy, passion and connection than any bells and whistles. I usually wait for Amber to initiate, partly out of fear of rejection and partly not wanting to be that pushy guy. Once I get clear signals, which I’m better at picking up as time goes on, I can make a move.Amber is brilliant, smart, emotionally adept, fun-loving and adventurous. Ultimately, we’re a real partnership, and I hope we continue to approach everything that way.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

I had a big crush on him, but to feel that way for a man who wasn’t my husband was unsettling. I’ve only been in long-term relationships and had never been unfaithful. Todd would take me out, but my husband paid so little attention to me that he didn’t care.Todd became my partner long before we got together. His thoughtfulness turned me on. On Thanksgiving, he drove 45 minutes just to drop off pies while my husband slept in. I’d been married twice, but I don’t think I understood what partnership was before I met Todd.I love having sex with women and watching Todd with other womenWe met in June, but didn’t even hold hands until September. The slow buildup meant the first time we had sex was incredible. Before Todd, sex was something I was supposed to do. With Todd, every glance, every touch, every gesture feels like foreplay.This is how we do it: ‘Nobody’s enjoyed a night at the Premier Inn Milton Keynes more than us’Read morePartly because I’d been starved of intimacy, my sex drive was very high. Perimenopause has pushed me to explore fantasies I’d never acted on, such as my attraction to women. I wondered whether the reality would live up to the fantasy, and it did. I love having sex with women and watching Todd with other women. Having sex with other people has brought us closer as a couple, but it’s also exposed insecurities. When Todd struggled physically and withdrew, I thought I’d ruined the best thing in my life. But seeing him open up, I felt so proud of him and of how much he’s grown.We don’t sleep in the same bed – I’m a light sleeper with night sweats – but Todd lies with me every night and holds me before he leaves. Whoever’s up first goes to the other’s room so we start the day together. We do this thing where we embrace skin to skin, just breathing together. Every day I feel so lucky to be his partner.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThis is how we do itSexRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

EE said it was working with Apple and Google on the problem.Vodafone said its customers were mostly not receiving the texts (labelled as coming from Vodafone) because RCS is not enabled by the carrier on iPhones. However, people on other networks are receiving them.Fitness fraud: gym goers warned over fake deals on memberships and personal trainersRead moreWhat it looks likeThe text message claims to be a reminder that you have gathered points, and says most of them must be used immediately or they will expire.“This message serves as an advance notice regarding your Vodafone Reward Points.

While it might seem healthy to monitor your diet, exercise and biomarkers, it can come at a huge emotional costEmily RetterSun 8 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTShareIt was a pitta bread that finally broke Jason Wood. It arrived with hummus instead of the vegetable crudites he had preordered in a restaurant that he had painstakingly researched, as he always did, weeks before he and his husband visited. “In that moment, I just snapped,” he recalls. “I hit rock bottom, I got angry … I started crying, I started shaking. I just felt like I couldn’t do it any more, like I had been crushed by all this pressure I put on myself.”Today, Wood, 40, speaks calmly. Neat and groomed, he seems orderly by nature. But at that time, his attempts to control every aspect of his life had spiralled. He painstakingly monitored what he ate (sometimes only organic, sometimes raw or unprocessed; calories painstakingly counted), his exercise regime (twice a day, seven days a week), and tracked every bodily function from his heart rate to his blood pressure, body fat and sleep “schedule”. He even monitored his glucose levels repeatedly throughout the day. “I was living by those numbers,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘I had been crushed by all this pressure I put on myself’ …. Jason Wood.Photograph: Courtesy of Jason WoodTwo or three times a month he would visit wellness clinics for IV drips of vitamin cocktails, plus oxygen treatments administered through a tube in the nose – the package costing $250 to $300 (about £180 to £220) a pop for health benefits he struggles to specify. He would also request reams of blood tests every six months checking 15 to 20 biomarkers, from testosterone to creatinine to lipids. He estimates that he spent about $10,000 in total. He never deviated from his routine for social events; it had become a cage: “I got up before sunrise, around 4am,” he recalls. “I would work out, then I’d have a light breakfast, maybe a chia seed pudding, then a chickpea salad for lunch … I’d get back to the gym in the afternoon …” A protein-based dinner would be followed by “a protein drink before bed at 9pm”.And the motivation? Wood, who lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was clear that his ultimate goal was to extend his life. How could that be a bad thing, he reasoned. What he realised upon seeking mental health support after he had a breakdown was just how deeply he feared dying – a fear triggered by the premature loss of his parents to cancer; his dad when he was just 11, his mum when he was 19. His lifestyle had become about controlling the uncontrollable.“There was just this fixation with living for as long as I possibly could,” he says. “This talk around longevity plays right into insecurities and fears, and makes us want to hand over our money.”Wood now believes he was suffering from longevity fixation syndrome, an unofficial diagnosis for an anxiety-driven, compulsive obsession among those who are consumed by the idea of living for as long as possible. The term was recently coined by Jan Gerber, CEO and founder of the Swiss mental health rehab clinic Paracelsus Recovery, who revealed he was seeing a “significant” increase in patients presenting with habits such as those outlined by Wood. Gerber notes that such behaviour is also closely aligned with the eating disorder orthorexia, a fixation with “clean” eating and exercise.This talk around longevity plays into insecurities and fears, and makes us want to hand over our moneyWood agrees: “I believe many of the underlying factors and desired outcomes which fuel orthorexia are the same for longevity fixation syndrome. But with the latter, there are more variables you feel like you need to control, so even more anxiety.”A slick Zurich clinic – which charges more than £88,000 a week for a four-week individualised residential treatment programme (including a 24-hour live-in therapist) to treat mental health and addiction – coining a new disorder has raised a few eyebrows. Labels are not always helpful. Yet the issue itself does not seem manufactured: a number of therapists in the US, Europe and the UK, working with clients from all societal stratas, agree that the symptoms are a growing problem.While an existential fear of death is nothing new, and nor are claims to conquer mortality with elixirs or holy grails, extending your lifespan is no longer an aspiration dependant on following a disciplined diet and exercise regime alone. Nowadays, there is also an increasingly expansive menu of biohacks purported to boost health, offered at self-styled “longevity clinics”. Rather than being confined to Hollywood and the uber-rich, such clinics are beginning to proliferate among the affluent mainstream. Conduct an online search for longevity and, in the UK alone, there are numerous results for longevity services or longevity medicine.Groundbreaking research funded by Silicon Valley first began to make claims aboutlife-lengthening and ageing reversal using gene manipulation and blood transfusionsin the 1990s and early 00s. Fast forward to today, and the idea that biology can be tweaked to slow ageing has exploded – not only in research labs and startups but in the more mainstream nutrition and skincare industries. In 2023, the size of the global market for complementary and alternative medicine for anti-ageing and longevity was estimated to be worth $63.6bn, and projected to reach $247.9bnby 2030.Of course, anti-ageing solutions are catnip to celebrities.Orlando Bloom has tried filtering his blood of microplastics; Jennifer Anistonreportedly swears by peptide injections for skin rejuvenation. And then there are the many ultra-disciplined influencers such as Kayla Barnes-Lentz and the human biologist Gary Brecka loudly proclaiming the benefits of adopting habits to tweak our biology, from regular bedtimes and breath work to cold plunges and supplements.View image in fullscreenJennifer Aniston reportedly swears by peptide injections.Photograph: Jamie McCarthy/Getty ImagesAt the extreme end of the spectrum, there is also a significant tribe of uber-rich tech bros seemingly intent on actual immortality. The poster boy for this isBryan Johnson, 48, the American venture capitalist who sold his company to PayPal for $800m and likes to wear a T-shirt reading “Don’t Die”. He has been infused with his son’s youthful plasma (although later admitted thisdidn’t show benefits) and isbuilding an algorithmaround his biomarker scores. “I’m going to try and achieve immortality by 2039,”he has said.But research published last year inProceedings of the National Academy of Sciencesfound that – after looking at 23 high-income, low-mortality countries – no generation born after 1939 is expected to reach an average age of 100. Whether the biohacks carry positive benefits for longevity or not is still up for debate; what seems clearer is the mental health fallout for those trying to live for ever.In Assen, in the north-east of the Netherlands, Mark (not his real name), 26, says a fear of death to the point of “panic attacks” led to his health “optimisation” five years ago. It was an attempt to “extend my life expectancy”, he says.Mark would deliberate for weeks over having a single beer or a slice of birthday cake, and such indulgences would be “followed by a week of guilt”; he took numerous supplements daily including omega-3, zinc, magnesium and creatine, went to the gym five times a week, and had to get nine to 10 hours of sleep a night. “I bought a blood pressure monitor to check daily, thinking if it was too high I might die,” he says. Once, he spent the whole day consumed with bringing down what he perceived as a high number. “My social life did suffer,” he says.His panic attacks peaked last year and he saw a therapist. “I needed to train my brain into accepting the ‘danger’ it was detecting was a false alarm,” he says. “To live my life and accept any feelings of fear or panic; to let them be there without ‘feeding’ them.” He came to accept that “physical health is important, but mental health is important, too”.Clients of the Balance Rehab Clinic, which has sites in London, Zurich, Marbella and Mallorca, are offered bespoke one-to-one residential programmes encompassing therapeutic support for issues such as chronic stress and trauma (it does not publish its prices). Its clinical director, the psychiatrist and psychotherapist Dr Sarah Boss, estimates that about half of the clinic’s clients now present with some traits of longevity fixation syndrome, although most aren’t aware that their habits have become problematic.And the numbers have increased over the past two years. “We definitely see this [obsession around longevity] more and more, especially in wealthy people who have more access to [biohacking] and more time to spend on it,” says Boss. “They are trying to measure everything, day and night,” she says. Many clients arrive with their own infrared saunas and ice baths. “They’re taking them around as if [they were] a bike or golf clubs.”We see it more and more, especially in wealthy people. They are trying to measure everything, day and nightBoss describes a client under 40 who arrived with a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber, which he used daily. He was taking 15 supplements. “Everything from Q10 to supplements to help with muscle mass, metabolism, to detox,” she recalls. He’d had stem cell injections and at one point asked to leave to have more. He also ordered regular blood tests, which is something she sees frequently. “There’s such a big market around it and there are no limits,” she says. “People can spend €40,000 (£35,000) on blood tests.”She also describes a female client in her 40s who checked in due to anxiety. She was monitoring her biomarkers and sleep with an Oura Ring (a wearable device that tracks health metrics), taking numerous supplements, and eating what she believed to be “anti-ageing foods” – “a vegetable and fruit-based diet, seeds, special powders, very little protein, no carbohydrates …,” says Boss. She was also taking metformin, a drug used to manage type 2 diabetes (which she did not have), and whichsome studies have found may slow ageing.Boss weaned her off the supplements and metrics tracking, “and she completely normalised,” she says.Boss often finds that childhood experiences drive this sort of behaviour. Many clients suffer from “attachment trauma”, and there is a “fear of dying – not just ageing … but really the existential fear of death.” She believes this fear has been exacerbated by the Covid pandemic. “All of a sudden, [people] felt threatened,” she says. “I think that started something in a lot of people, unconsciously.” This was followed by a boom in the longevity industry. “You can buy a million things online, false promises … It’s growing daily,” she says.View image in fullscreenPatients are encouraged to get back in tune with their bodies with activities such as yoga and breath work.Photograph: Posed by model; Super Scout/Getty ImagesBoss’s patients are taught to get back in tune with their bodies instinctively, rather than through data, using activities including yoga, breath work and sport – but for fun. “The key is to regulate them again, to connect them to their own nervous system,” she says. Talking therapy around acceptance of death often helps patients gain an understanding of deeper issues, too.For Wood, it was ultimately this acceptance of death that helped him recover. “I realised I am human, death is a part of life … it’s going to happen when it happens,” he says. His therapist encouraged him to quit his apps and relax his routine. “It was like somebody had ripped away my security blanket … I was very scared and sceptical,” he admits. “[But] I trusted their advice… so I went all in. I have a very much all-or-nothing mindset, so at that moment I needed to just cut ties with the apps and tracking.”Wood is now director of community engagement for the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders in the US, but he says that “it’s very difficult to recover in a society like this, because we see the influencers, we see all this content all the time”.Lina Mookerjee, senior accredited psychotherapist with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, who is based in Cumbria, believes that 75% of her clients show symptoms of longevity fixation syndrome. They may not be undertaking cryotherapy or peptide injections, but their concern about longevity, often underpinned by fears around mortality, has shot up since the pandemic. “It was an absolute step-change,” she says. The fixation has run alongside increased “hypervigilance” and “hyperactivity” – all demonstrations of “I have no control over my life,” she says.Generally, Mookerjee says, those presenting with these symptoms are professional, university-educated people in their 30s to 50s, who have “lost trust in their own judgment” and rely on devices.View image in fullscreenLina Mookerjee says that as many as 75% of her clients show symptoms of longevity fixation syndrome.Photograph: Courtesy of Lina MookerjeeShe has also identified a “superhero syndrome” in clients trying to override a loss or illness. “Once they recognise ‘the driver for me is coming from a deep insecurity’ something starts to change.” They become less hypervigilant around health and can begin to live normally again.Mental health professionals are becoming increasingly aware of the damaging effects of longevity fixation. And, amid the many online proponents of tracking and hacking, there are a growing number of devotees who have begun to talk about the unhealthy side-effects of the practice – and in some cases, seek help.“I see the amount of pain [longevity culture] can cause, the amount of insecurity,” says Wood. “It’s nice to finally have a term to apply to it. With a proper name and better understanding of what they are facing, I believe more people will be able to access the treatment and support they deserve.”Explore more on these topicsHealthHealth & wellbeingAgeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But is a big sneeze a sign of illness, pollution or something else entirely?Joel SnapeSun 8 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 16.34 ESTShareHow worried should we be about a sneeze? It depends who you ask. In the Odyssey, Telemachus sneezes after Penelope’s prayer that her husband will soon be home to sort out her house-sitting suitors – which she sees as a good omen for team Odysseus, and very bad news for the suitors. In the Anabasis, Xenophon takes a sneeze from a soldier as godly confirmation that his army can fight their way back to their own territory – great news for them – while St Augustine notes,somewhat disapprovingly, that people of his era tend to go back to bed if they sneeze while putting on their slippers. But is a sneeze an omen of anything apart from pathogens, pollen or – possibly – air pollution?“It’s a physical response to get rid of something that’s irritating your body,” says Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist and professor at the University of Manchester. “Alongside the obvious nasal hairs that a few people choose to trim, all of us have cilia, or microscopic hairs in our noses that can move and sense things of their own accord. And so if anything gets trapped by the cilia, that triggers a reaction to your nerve endings that says: ‘Right, let’s get rid of this.’ And that triggers a sneeze.”View image in fullscreenPlucking an eyebrow hair can generate a sneeze.Photograph: Posed by model; seb_ra/Getty ImagesThat irritation can be caused by many things: allergens, viruses such as the common cold or flu, and irritants such as dust or pepper. But it’s not the only reason you might sneeze. The trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for all sorts of sensory and motor functions in the facial region, can be triggered by everything from cold air to plucking an eyebrow, sending sneeze signals to nearby nerve endings even when they’re not strictly necessary.Perhaps most confusingly of all, some people sneeze when they’re exposed to bright light – waggishly dubbed the autosomal-dominant compelling helio-ophthalmic outburst, or Achoo syndrome, by researchers in the 1980s. The exact mechanism still isn’t completely understood, but it is hereditary and congenital.The visible airflow a sneeze creates travels less than a metre, and only at about 10mph – not the commonly believed 100mph of a Federer second-serveOK, but why this sort of physiological reflex in particular? Sneezing is one of the most explosive and powerful involuntary actions the human body can perform: your abdominal and chest muscles are forcing air out of your lungs. It isn’t quite as explosive as we once thought: recent studies suggest that the visible airflow a sneeze creates travels less than a metre, andonly at about 10mph– not the commonly believed 100mph of a Federer second-serve. Sneezing also doesn’t make your heart skip a beat or make your eyeballs pop out if you purposefully keep your eyes open (both are urban myths). But why does the action need to be so violent?“It’s a basic protective mechanism,” says Cruickshank. “The first part of any immune response is trying to stop the stuff getting in in the first place, but the next one is to get rid of things that might be damaging to you. It can go awry in the cases of very dusty rooms or allergens, but it’s actually a very sensible response that we see in a lot of mammalian species.”View image in fullscreenLos Angeles smog … air pollution can trigger sneezes.Photograph: Justin Lambert/Getty ImagesAs for what a sneeze can tell us about imminent danger, that’s a question scientists are still keenly interested in. Cruickshank, for instance, has worked withcitizen science projectsto investigate how pollution interacts with allergies, and, probably not surprisingly, found a significant association between polluted areas and worse, longer-lasting symptoms. “We know pollution damages the linings of your nose and your lungs, and that helps things get in that shouldn’t. So that’s one theory about what’s happening,” she says. “But there’s also evidence emerging that pollution can start to kind of reprogramme your immune system, making you react inappropriately to things.”How much of a risk does a sneeze itself pose? “That’s very hard to study, because sneezing is an involuntary thing that happens quite infrequently,” says Catherine Noakes, professor of environmental engineering for buildings at the University of Leeds, a specialist in airborne pathogens. “We have a lot more data on the amount and type of particles that we release when we talk, breathe, sing, or cough, because you can make somebody do those things – but we don’t really know much about the relative importance of sneezing.”Face masks ‘inadequate’ and should be swapped for respirators, WHO is advisedRead moreSome of the infections that can be transmitted by sneezes include colds, which affect the upper respiratory tract, and flu and Covid, both of which can reach the lungs. Diseases such as tuberculosis, which usually sit in the lungs, can also be spread by sneezes, as well as measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, respiratory syncytial virus, glandular fever and adenovirus.If you’ve got a sneeze-borne illness, and don’t want to pass it on, catching as much of your sneeze as you can in a tissue is the best bet. The “vampire sneeze” – covering your face with a sweep of your arm – is a decent alternative. It’s also worth bearing in mind that if you, or someone else, touches an object after sneezing into their hand, itcantransmit disease, but the risk varies:the Lancet, for instance, suggests that the initial risk of Covid transmission from inanimate surfaces was “assumed on the basis of studies that have little resemblance to real-life scenarios”.So what do you do if you feel at risk from someoneelsesneezing? “If you’re trying to avoid someone infectious and you can’t get out of the room, your only real alternative is something like an FFP2 mask,” says Noakes. “But really, what I’d say to anyone who’s concerned about being infectious and sneezing a lot is to consider whether they need to be out at all.”So, a sneeze might be an indicator that you’re in a polluted area, or it could be a harbinger of illness, or simply a sign that you need to lay off the eyebrow-tweezing. Unless it’s accompanied by other symptoms, you probably don’t need to worry about it too much, and it’s unlikely to be an indicator that your soul is in danger of exiting your body.It’s still nice to say “Bless you”, though, in response to someone’s sneeze. Even with involuntary reflexes, some archaic expressions are just polite.Explore more on these topicsHealthSecrets of the bodyCoronavirusHealth & wellbeingInfectious diseasesMedical researchMicrobiologyFlufeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The design of lingerie has never been better, with a wide variety of brands focusing on comfortable materials, breathability and support, as well as style. From ultra-soft lace that moves with the body to wireless bras that actually stay up, sometimes the best lingerie is all about subtle design details rather than extra frills.Whether it’s supportive bralettes and sustainable sets or elegant slips, we’ve compiled lingerie from brands that prioritise how you feel as much as how they look.The best lingerie for womenAffordable everyday setsView image in fullscreenLemonade Dolls Signature lace bralette£30 at Lemonade DollsView image in fullscreenLemonade Dolls Signature lace high support bralette£36 at Lemonade DollsView image in fullscreenLemonade Dolls Signature laceBrazilian knickers£16 at Lemonade DollsStarting as an Instagram account focused on body confidence, Lemonade Dolls is one of my favourite lingerie brands because of its inclusive sizing, quality fabrics and designs that prioritise you.This pink bralette is a brand signature, with a flattering plunge neckline, and made with recycled nylon and stretch lace that feels light against the skin.

The slip is cut from a vintage-inspired black lace adorned with the “AP” logo, and the split skirt, finished with an adorable satin bow, stops it from feeling restrictive.Sizing:UK 6 to 16How to look after your lingerieEvery piece of lingerie comes with its own specific care instructions, and they’re not to be taken lightly if you want them to last. The delicate nature of many fabrics popular in lingerie design – such as lace, silk and satin – means you can’t just throw in the wash without thought. Lace often can’t be washed above 30C, whereas others are hand-wash-only due to their intricate open-weave structure. While silk and satin can sometimes be machine-washed on a delicate cycle, it’s recommended to use a wash bag to prevent any snagging.Drying lingerie has one major rule: avoid the tumble dryer. The heat can cause the wiring in bras to warp. It’s best to hang bras from the centre gore (the bit in between the cups) to air dry, as this will stop the straps from overstretching.Lingerie wash bag£5.99 at Lakeland£5.99 at AmazonFor more, read thebest Valentine’s Day gifts for 2026and thebest flower delivery for every budgetCharlotte Gornall is a fashion assistant and writer at the GuardianExplore more on these topicsLingerieThe FilterUnderwearfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For Lisa Walker, hiking the Camino turned into both a goodbye and a glimpse at the futureRead more summer essentialsLisa WalkerSat 7 Feb 2026 20.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 01.01 ESTShareDon’t let them push you around, my youngest son said halfway through the Camino de Santiago. You don’t have to get up early if you don’t want to.I didn’t know that was an option, replied his brother from his bunk.This subversive banter is what our family sounds like now. The old hierarchy has loosened. We are four adults negotiating the day.When we tackled the Camino a decade ago, my husband and I knew the walk marked an ending of sorts. One son had just finished school, the other his degree. Their lives were waiting elsewhere – different cities, countries, work, relationships. This 30-day walk was wedged into the narrow gap before those lives took hold. We were on borrowed time.View image in fullscreenLisa Walker and her sons at the Walls of Jerusaleum national park, Tasmania in 2006We had walked with these boys since they were babies, first carrying them in backpacks, then coaxing them along with snacks and stories, eventually handing them the weight of their own packs. Summer holidays meant hiking; winter meant ski touring. This was our family’s culture. They mostly accepted it, though not without resistance. One son declared that once he left home, he would never climb a mountain again – a vow he later broke by independently hiking coast to coast across Britain.Most of our family myths have been forged on foot – getting lost in New Zealand, the flooded tent in Tasmania, the years-old drama of the stolen lollies, for which each son blames the other to this day.By the time of the Camino, walking together was familiar, but the emotional landscape had shifted. We were no longer parents and children. We were four people with sore feet and competing lunch preferences. Decisions were democratic and, in my biased opinion, often flawed. When it became clear our allotted 30 days were too short, I suggested catching the bus. I was promptly outvoted. In hindsight, this was a rehearsal for a different kind of parenthood. One where I let go of command.There are few scripts for parenting adult children, especially once they leave home. We mark births and deaths publicly. Weddings come with great ceremony. But the exodus of grown children mostly happens without fanfare. One morning, bedrooms empty. Daily intimacies vanish. They are simply not there. The Camino turned out to be a ritual I hadn’t known I needed – a long, unplanned goodbye.I returned home with a bittersweet understanding. The job I had once done – raising children – was largely complete. It was time to learn a new one. What I didn’t yet know was the walk would become a template for how to be a family now.A lesson in slow travel: walking the Camino de Santiago with my brotherRead moreIn the decade since my sons left home, we have kept walking together. At least twice a year, we choose a trail and step on to it as equals. We hiked theLarapinta trailwith one son, theThree Capes trackwith the other, the K’gari Great Walk with both. Each journey is different, shaped by whoever is present, but the function is the same.These walks give us unbroken, shared time in a world of fragmented attention. Phones drop out of service. Conversations unfold slowly. We learn who each other has become.View image in fullscreen‘These walks give us unbroken, shared time in a world of fragmented attention’: Lisa Walker and her son at Mount Lot, Tasmania in 2017View image in fullscreenWalking together allows us to enter each other’s lives without intrusion. I don’t need to ask about work or relationships. Instead, I see them navigate a steep climb, linger to watch the light change. They see me struggle, adapt, persist. And thankfully, they now carry more weight than me.These journeys hold an impermanence, an awareness that this time is finite. At the end, we will disperse to different cities and countries. Rather than resisting that truth, the walks contain it. They allow us to part well. We are four people who have walked a long way together and now mostly walk apart. But a few times a year, we shoulder our packs, step on to a trail and remember how to move forward in the same direction.Lisa Walker is the author of The Pact, available now throughHarperCollins.Explore more on these topicsWalking holidaysAustralian lifestyleWalkingFitnessFamilyParents and parentingHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pomegranate juice sellers are setting up pyramids of fruit on their carts at gaps in the crowd and waiters are trying to reel in passersby with happy hour prices for Aperol spritzes. Amid the noise and movement, it’s easy to walk straight past number 206, whose arched doorway features a stone cross stained black with dirt – a clue to the building’s former use.Convento dei Crociferi was abandoned for 30 years, until Sicilian power couple Andrea Bartoli and Florinda Saievi took over and transformed it into Palermo’s newest arts space, theMuseum of World Cities, due to open at the end of February. Inside, a cloister with high, scalloped porticoes frames a verdant courtyard filled with palms and banana trees. Bartoli comes to meet me and enthusiastically pumps my hand before leading me up to the grand, marble-floored rooms on the first floor, which have been given over to a rather self-referential exhibition on urban change.View image in fullscreen“Cities change because people make them change,” Bartoli tells me. This is the ethos behind their organisationFarm Cultural Park, which has rehabilitated four different urban sites across western Sicily,starting with the city of Favarain 2010. The former sulphur mining town suffered rapid depopulation when its mines closed after the second world war, and many buildings across the historical centre were abandoned by owners who emigrated abroad.Bartoli and Saievi decided to transform a warren of empty, crumbling palazzos into a colourful casbah of art studios, exhibition spaces and hipster cafes. It had the effect of reviving the town, making it a destination for holidaymakers. One oft-repeated statistic is that before Bartoli and Saievi came along, there was only one six-room hotel in Favara – now the town has 600 tourist beds.There has been a resurgence in Sicily’s cultural scene, and vacant churches, prisons and convents are being snapped up“What happened in Favara was a miracle. But you can’t just put art in a place and hope it solves all of the problems,” says Bartoli pragmatically. “Contemporary art can’t change Sicily. It can’t improve the healthcare system or education.” But it can be used as a tool to draw in visitors, generate employment and, potentially, lure back residents. Farm Cultural Park, along with other art foundations, gallery owners and artists, has seized on a moment of opportunity. Sicily’s depopulation crisis is occurring in tandem with a resurgence in the island’s cultural scene, and vacant churches, prisons and convents are being snapped up.View image in fullscreenA huge stainless steel star – Stella d’ingresso al Belice by Pietro Consagra – welcomes visitors to Gibellina Nuova.Photograph: Fabrizio Robba/AlamyClose to Palermo harbour, another arts organisation,Fondazione RIV,has transformed the cavernous, dark interior of the deconsecrated San Mamiliano church into a contemporary art exhibition, plunging the church’s ornate frescoes and tapestries into darkness to better spotlight the artworks on display. Nearby, in the heart of the Vucciria district, Cristina Giarnecchia and Adriano La Licata have turned an unused storage space and former warehouse intoAll, a studio, exhibition venue and incubator for contemporary artists and curators.The same creative energy can be found outside Palermo. Gibellina, the next stop on my contemporary art tour of western Sicily, has been an art hotspot for decades, but is only now getting wider recognition. Art is present even as you enter the town – in fact, you drive right through it. An enormous star, Stella d’ingresso al Beliceby Pietro Consagra, built out of stainless steel, straddles the dual carriageway.Gibellina was built from scratch after the original town was razed by an earthquake in 1968, and the then-mayor, Ludovico Corrao, invited artists and architects to reimagine the city, weaving art into the town’s fabric. His audacious post-disaster reconstruction plan turned Gibellina into a carousel of experimental postmodern buildings, sculptures and mosaics.This is how a dream becomes reality – art becoming an economic driver for the regionAntonella Corrao“The founding principle of Gibellina is that artists would live here and work with the community to create works of art they would then leave behind,” explains Ludovico Corrao’s daughter, Antonella Corrao, who runs local arts organisationFondazione Orestiadialongside her sister. “Gibellina has never been a place where art is commodified.”In recognition of its heritage, the national government has just designated Gibellina the country’s firstItalian Capital of Contemporary Art, hoping it will breathe life back into a town that has mostly dropped off the tourist map.View image in fullscreenA sun sculpture by artist Mimmo Rotella in Gibellina, and a concrete tower with colourfulwings by architect Alessandro Mendini.Photograph: Abaca Press/AlamyAn old civic centre designed by Nanda Vigo has been emptied of debris after decades of disuse and repurposed for residencies for visiting artists, dance troupes and performers. Graffiti has been scrubbed from Francesco Venezia’s roofless, postmodern spiralGiardino Segreto I-II.Torre Civica, a concrete tower with colourful wings designed by architect Alessandro Mendini, was originally fitted with speakers that played regional folk songs several times a day. In 2026, the tower will once again play music.When I asked Antonella whether the Capital of Contemporary Art designation was the culmination of her father’s vision for Gibellina, she was moved to tears, describing it not as an end point, but a new beginning for the town: “This is how a dream becomes reality – with art truly becoming an economic driver for the region.”I was reluctant to move on from Gibellina, as even after several days of wandering I still hadn’t seen every artwork or postmodern building in the town, but I wanted to go further south, to check out where this drive for urban revitalisation had begun.My partner and I stayed atSciabica Suitein Favara in the heart of Farm Cultural Park, a pocket of quiet luxury inside the riddle of the casbah. We were there on a blustery, rainy night in late November, so couldn’t take advantage of our beautiful suite’s roof terrace and hot tub, but were perfectly placed to explore the exhibitions just outside our front door. Favara is a good place to base yourself – from there, you can hop over to Agrigento’sValley of the Templesor visit one of Farm Cultural Park’s newest additions, the formerSan Vito prison.View image in fullscreenPart of Museum of World Cities, Palermo’s newest arts space, is due to open this month.Photograph: Catherine BennettIt was a monastery before it was a prison, and its different uses are layered through the building like geological strata: pinched, austere monks’ quarters with thick stone walls made ideal solitary cells, and now one-room art installations. Many local mafiosi served time in this prison until it closed in 1996, and the cells are like time capsules: walls are still decorated with football scores, pages from pornography magazines, and a poster of Robbie Williams sporting impressive sideburns.I explored the exhibitions with Lorena Caruana, a local architect who works with Farm Cultural Park, and we walked around the prison’s perimeter as the sun set, watching murmurations of swallows ribbon through the sky. “There’s so much collective memory associated with this place,” she explained. “We don’t want to paint over it. The idea is not to transform the space entirely.”It is a noble goal: art helping to revitalise Sicily’s ghost towns and deserted urban spaces without replacing or stifling the history of the place; the present sitting happily alongside the past.Accommodation was provided byB&B Carellain Palermo (doubles from€80) andSciabica Suitein Favara (suitefrom €110)Explore more on these topicsSicily holidaysItaly holidaysCultural tripsEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I don’t recall having them when I was much younger. In bed at night it keeps me awake for hours sometimes.It can be a song heard on the radio, recently David Gray’s This Year’s Love, which lasted a couple of days; or, more irritating, an advert on TV, Pepto-Bismol being a particular culprit.GastonGrimsdykeIf you pay attention to the words of the song in your head, it’s a bit like analysing a dream: you discover it has some kind of message for you from your unconscious.Anne Geraghty, by emailBecause it’s a great song with ever-more relevant lyrics! (Once in a Lifetime, Talking Heads).Paul Brittain, Chester, by emailThe subconscious jukebox is what I call the moments when I find myself with a song in my head then run through the lyrics and realise that it’s (often quite cleverly and subtly) appropriate to what’s going on at the time. My subconscious likes to make up musical jokes and puns when I’m not looking.inthepapers45It’s possibly a way for the brain to relax, by tuning out other stimuli. Some people also have rhythms on repeat, and tap their toes or fingers all the time, barely consciously. Earworms are good for you!gleebitzI feel this could link into fundamentals about consciousness, language development, our ability to create and remember music and stories? I don’t know the answers.The first tune I hear in the morning always becomes my earworm for the day.

Then every time the earworm struck, we could all profit from our shared affliction. As and when we needed specific knowledge, we could summon the appropriate earworm. It worked for Tom Lehrer with The Elements song, after all.daleawayWatch a video of Tom Lehrer singing The ElementsI have accepted that I have a built-in jukebox.

Currently, my battery toothbrush has three speeds and as you go from slow to fast each one just happens to be three ascending notes from a popular kids’ song. I get “Bay” “Bee” “Shark” and that’s my earworm until the next one pops in. Having more than one running is not unknown, either.IantentdeadI was once told a secret – a song capable of crushing and replacing any ear worm stuck in your head.

The first is a catchy melody/riff/vocal hook. The second (and most important for me) is the brain wash. If you listen to something catchy enough more than 20 times it will stick in your brain.Most songs with potential have only the first ingredient. The lucky ones with a major label by their side can have the second ingredient as well. What would Don’t You Want Me? be if the TV and radio didn’t play it?Nick Bitzenis (AKA Nikonn), music producer, London, by emailThey are a bit of a bane for me since I retired. Each one lasts about a week. I try to work out the chord structures at the same time. Even more annoying.Sample menu: Abba: Don’t Shut Me Down, When Time Stood Still (Bill Lloyd but written by Jeff Lynne), I Saw The Light (Rundgren), Break Away (Beach Boys) – the list never ends.JimCarDacianWatch a video for Beach Boys: Break AwayA song gets stuck in the head because it’s unfinished – and because stress makes unfinished things harder to let go. When we hear the first fragment of a familiar tune, we often try to stop it. We distract ourselves or resist it, which interrupts the musical sequence before it resolves. The brain, which prefers completion, keeps replaying the fragment in an attempt to finish it.Stress makes this more likely. Under stress, the nervous system is biased towards interruption rather than completion. Experiences are more easily set aside unfinished – into a kind of mental “overflow bin” – and they return repeatedly for resolution. Earworms are usually not whole songs but short hooks or phrases caught in this state.This same mechanism appears in more serious forms in trauma and PTSD, where unfinished emotional or sensory experiences loop involuntarily. In that sense, a stuck song is a mild, everyday example of the same principle: the mind returning again and again, not for pleasure, but because something hasn’t quite been completed.Ironically, the harder we try to suppress the tune, the more incomplete it becomes – and the longer it stays.John Boulderstone, Speldhurst, Kent, by emailA good earworm needs two components: simplicity of melody and repetition. We each have our favourite that drives us up the wall until it recedes into the distance. If unlucky, it returns with a bang the following week.

For some bizarre reason this seems to work for me and, no, the national anthem rarely takes over the earworm slot!

It’s an earworm, but it at least gave a new word to the English language – “gev”.DocLobster1960I have a very good memory for music, and especially for lyrics and words. For example, I have usually passively absorbed most of the melody and lyrics to at least the first verse, chorus and bridge by about the fifth listen, even without trying. This means I have a long mental playlist of songs I know and love that I can recreate easily in my mind – so if I have an annoying earworm I imagine a song I do want to hear, and it comes very easily.artisticallyinclinedThe Abba earworm Don’t Shut Me DownSometimes they lie dormant for a bit before making themselves known.

It came at a tough time for the reporter: Russia had been repeatedly striking the country’s power grid, and just days before she had been forced to work out of her car without heat, power or running water, writing in pencil because pen ink freezes too readily.“Difficult news,” was the subject line. The body text said: “Your position is eliminated as part of today’s organizational changes,” explaining that it was necessary to get rid of her to meet the “evolving needs of our business”.Johnson’s response may go down in the annals of American media history. “I was just laid off by TheWashington Postin the middle of a warzone,” shewrote on X. “I have no words.”The Washington Post’s Ukraine correspondent may have been rendered speechless over Wednesday’s move byJeff Bezos, the Amazon billionaire and Post owner, to cut more than 300 newsroomjobs. The bloodletting, which has raised renewed fears about the resilience of America’s democracy to withstandDonald Trump’s attacks, swept away the paper’s entire sports department, much of its culture and local staff and all of its journalists in such arid news zones as Ukraine and the Middle East.Others, though, managed to find their tongues. “It’s a bad day,” saidDon Graham, son of the Post’s legendary Watergate-era owner Katharine Graham, breaking the silence he has maintained since selling the paper to Bezos for $250m in 2013.“I am crushed,” was the lament ofBob Woodward, one-half of the paper’s double act with Carl Bernstein that exposedWatergate.“This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s greatest news organizations,” saidMarty Baron, the Post’s lionised former executiveeditor. Not one to mince his words, Baron castigated Bezos for his “sickening efforts to curry favor with President Trump”, saying it left an especially “ugly stain” on the paper’s standing.Several hundred people rallied in front of the Post’s offices on Thursday, voicing support for their laid-off colleagues. “It’s disappointing on an immense scale. They don’t seem to give a damn about this institution and the people that make it run,” said Patrick Nielsen, an engineer at the paper.Howls of dismay were also uttered by prominent Post alumni in interviews with the Guardian. Robert McCartney, a 39-year veteran of the Post until he retired five years ago, said it was a “tragedy and an outrage”.Like many Post insiders, McCartney has been astonished by the stark contrast between Bezos’s handling of the newspaper during Donald Trump’s first term in office and his conduct now in Trump 2.0.McCartney was a senior journalist on the paper during Bezos’s initial eight years of ownership, through Trump’s first presidency. Back then, he, like many others, was grateful for Bezos’s tutelage.“We saw him as a savior. He pumped money into the Post, didn’t meddle in the newsroom and stood up to Trump,” he said.Fast-forward to 2026, and a very different Bezos has emerged. In 2017, soon after Trump’s first inauguration, the Post introduced its new strapline: “Democracy dies in darkness.”That wording still runs proudly beneaththe masthead. At the end of a week like this one, though, America looks a notable shade darker.Marcus Brauchli, the Post’s executive editor until 2012 who now runs investment firm North Base Media, said that this was a terrible moment to be hammering one of the country’s great custodians of public accountability: “These are historic times, given the cyclone bearing down on the world order and American system of government. This is when journalism matters most. I mean, laying off reporters in Ukraine,now.”It is not as though Bezos needs the money. He is the fourth-richest person on the planet, accordingto Forbes, with a $245bn fortune.As Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for the New York Times,pointed out, Bezos could cover five years of the Post’s $100m annual losses by dipping into his earnings from a single week.The optics of Wednesday’s train wreck of an announcement were also diabolical: the job of facing the distraught staff on Zoom was delegated to the Post’s beleaguered current executive editor, Matt Murray.Bezos was nowhere to be seen. Yet there he was, earlier in the week,beaming broadlyas he welcomed Trump’s defense secretary,Pete Hegseth, to the Florida headquarters of his space company, Blue Origin.Nor did Will Lewis, Bezos’s consigliere as publisher of the Post, have the courage to present himself as the guillotine came down. A day after he had presided over the evisceration of the paper’s sports department,he was spottedattending the red carpet at an NFL Super Bowl event in San Francisco.On Saturday night, however, Lewisabruptly resigned, acknowledging “difficult decisions” as he praised Bezos’s leadership of the paper.The lay-offs came just five days after the launch of the first lady documentary,Melania, bankrolled by Amazon MGM Studios. Bezos sank $75m into that pile of “gilded trash” yet, unlike the Post, seems unfazed by the film’s paltry return on investment.“What Bezos did for Melania while gutting his own newspaper,” wrote the historianSimon Schama, will come to be seen “as the most glaring symptom of cultural collapse in a democracy hanging on to truth by the barest of threads”.This fateful juncture has been looming for a while. The first warning signs came in October 2024, when Bezos yanked the Post’splanned endorsementof Trump’s Democratic rival Kamala Harris just 11 days before the presidential election.A wave of public revulsion ensued, leading to the cancellation of at least 250,000 Post subscriptions.Soon after, the billionaire unilaterally imposed new strictures on the paper’s opinion content. He introduced what he called his “two pillars”: “personal liberties and free markets.”That drove many of the paper’s top commentators rushing for the exit, among them the economics columnistEduardo Porter, who now writes for the Guardian. “This layering of dogma undermined critical thinking,” Porter recalled. “It turned the Post into something more akin to a church, with tight constraints on thought.”This week’s day of the long knives has left many people desperately seeking explanations. There were clearly business motives at play: you don’t get to be a gazillionaire like Bezos without caring about profit lines, and the Post has been battered in recent years by harsh industry headwinds.But there are other, more sinister, interpretations. McCartney thinks back to 2019 when Amazon lost a $10bn Pentagon cloud-computing contract during Trump’s first term.Amazon complainedin a lawsuitthat this was a blatant act of retaliation by Trump, punishing Bezos for the Washington Post’s piercing coverage of his administration. Could it be that the bruising experience led Bezos to change tack, concluding that shining a light in defense of American democracy came at too high a price for the jewels in his business empire, Amazon and Blue Origin?“It’s very likely that the desire to appease Trump, to placate him, is playing a role in these decisions,” McCartney said.That’s a chilling thought for such a beacon of accountability journalism as theWashington Post. And it is set against the already parlous state of US media.Since 2000, some 3,500 newspapers haveclosed shop, abandoning one in four Americans who now live in news deserts with no local newspaper. The most recent casualty was thePittsburgh Post-Gazette, which will publish its final edition in May. It was founded in 1786, three years before George Washington donned the mantle of first president.While many papers have been folding, others have fallen into the hands of a new breed of super-wealthy tech and venture capitalist owners who, like Bezos, see journalism as an asset to monetize: the Los Angeles Times was acquired in 2018 by a biotech billionaire, Patrick Soon-Shiong.Like Bezos, Soon-Shiong has displayed symptoms of Trump Appeasement Syndrome. He toorefused to allowhis paper to endorse Harris days before the 2024 election.Historic newspapers brought low, news deserts proliferating: this is fertile ground on which misinformation and the Maga pestilence can grow. Trump has cultivated it relentlessly to his advantage.Long hostile towards what he calls the “fake news media”, Trump has taken his vendetta against truth-seekers to a new level. He hasstripped public mediachannels NPR and PBS of more than $1bn in federal funding, launched full-frontal attacks on individual journalists and outlets exposing his corruption and lies and sustained a bullying campaign against corporate owners designed to browbeat them into subservience.CBS News is the consummate example. Trump leaned on Paramount, which owned the news network, with a $10bn lawsuit over a 60 Minutes pre-election interview with Harris. Paramountsettled for $16m, even though the suit was widely ridiculed as spurious.Front of Paramount’s mind, no doubt, was its upcoming merger with Skydance Media that required federal – ie Trump’s – approval.Following the merger, David Ellison became CEO of Paramount Skydance. He is son of the billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who is a close friend and adviser of Trump’s.The younger Ellison went ahead and appointed the anti-woke commentatorBari Weissas editor in chief of CBS News, sending shockwaves through the storied network’sdazed and demoralisedstaff. Weiss, who came to the job with no TV industry experience, has swiftly confirmed their fears.Shepulled a 60 Minutes segmenton the notorious Cecot mega-prison in El Salvador to which the Trump administration had been deporting immigrants. Among herearly hiresas CBS News contributors are a Trump loyalist and former US marine, a prominent vaccine skeptic buddy of the health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, and fellow anti-woke firebrand Niall Ferguson.The cumulative malaise that is descending over US media leaves the country’s democratic institutions vulnerable to attack. It can’t be exclusively blamed for Trump’s excesses.There are plenty of other willing accomplices and capitulators, includinguniversities like Columbia, corporatelaw firmsand the gung-ho conservative activists who now control thesupreme court.But from Trump’s perspective, a media on its knees surely helps. The results are present everywhere you look.Trump is unleashed, unchained. He feels so comfortable in his regal skin that he can berate a respected female CNN reporter questioning him on the Epstein files fornever smiling.He can peddle unashamedly in racism,posting a videodepicting the first Black president and his first lady as monkeys.He can send amasked paramilitaryinto the streets of Minneapolis, resulting in Americansgetting killedfor exercising their first amendment rights. And when the polls for November’s midterm elections look challenging for him, he can prepare foranother blitzkriegon the very foundations of American democracy: the ballot box.There’s a paradox in all this. Many of the democratic norms that Trump is obliterating – take for example his destruction of the norm of Department of Justice independence in his persecution of his political opponents – were laid down in the 1970s in the wake of the Watergate scandal.That’s the same Watergate scandal that was brought into the light by that pair of courageous reporters at a newspaper called the Washington Post."

Meetings with foreign officials perceived to be sympathetic to their cause. Accusations oftreasonandsedition.Ahead of a 1995 referendum, leaders of Quebec’s independence movement made a string of provocative overtures to foreign governments, including a trip by the province’s premier to France. In a move that outraged anglophone Canada, the mayor of Paris gave Quebec’s Jacques Parizeaua welcome befitting a national leader.Three decades later,reports of a far more covert visit to the US by a group of would-be separatists from the western province of Alberta have provoked a similar backlash, reviving longstanding anxieties about foreign involvement in domestic unity debates.Canada separatists accused of ‘treason’ after secret talks with US state departmentRead more“To go to a foreign country and to ask for assistance in breaking upCanada, there’s an old-fashioned word for that,” British Columbia’s premier, David Eby, told reporters. “And that word is treason.”View image in fullscreenQuebec sovereignty referendum Yes supporters cheer during a speech by Bloc Québécois leader, Lucien Bouchard, at a junior college, in Montreal, on 24 October 1995.Photograph: Canadian Press/ShutterstockProto-diplomacy – the act of courting sympathetic countries for support – has often been undertaken by separatist movements around the world, said André Lecours, a professor of political science at the University of Ottawa.“There have been criticisms of this for sure, but when actively preparing a referendum on independence, leaders often look abroad in an attempt to secure sympathy or support. They want some signs or assurances that foreign states would be ready to recognize their independence.”But the recently revealed contacts with the Trump administration by members of Alberta’s nascent independence movement had few substantive parallels with Quebec’s attempts in the 1990s, he said.“What makes this movement so different is that none of these people associated with Alberta’s push for independence are democratically elected. They don’t hold any public office,” Lecours said. “While I am very reluctant to use words such as ‘treason’, I find it strange that the Trump administration would meet with non-elected officials. They have no formal democratic legitimacy.”Within the province’s legislative assembly, there are no pro-independence parties that hold seats. Only one Alberta separatist has ever managed to get elected – in a 1982 byelection victory – but lost in a general election soon afterwards.None of the members ofthe Alberta secession effortsare elected officials. And support for independence is muted in the province: a recent poll of Albertans showed roughly 18% supported leaving Canada. Prominent politicians from Alberta, including former prime minister Stephen Harper and two former Alberta premiers have rejected the idea of independence, instead calling for national unity at a time of diplomatic upheaval with the US.View image in fullscreenA participant holds a placard as hundreds gather for a ‘Resistance Rally’ at the Alberta legislature in Edmonton on 26 April 2025.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesAlberta’s current rightwing premier, Danielle Smith, has also come out against separation, although critics say that her call for “a strong and sovereign Alberta within a united Canada” merely confuses the issue.Conversely, in Quebec, five premiers have campaigned on – and won – provincial elections on an explicit separatist platform. The independence-oriented Partí Québécois is widely expected to win the next provincial election this October and has pledged to bring a third referendum.Canada’s laws permit groups to advocate and campaign in support of a province or territory leaving the country. In Alberta, members of the pro-independence campaign have been travelling across the province in an attempt to collect nearly 178,000 signatures by May. But the recent allegations that independence activists have repeatedly met officials from a government which has become increasingly hostile to Canadian sovereignty have promptedsuggestions that the movement could constitute a threat to Canada’s national security.While pro-independence politicians in Quebec courted the French, the country’s position on the province was “non-ingérence, non-indifférence” – an official policy of neutrality.But Donald Trump has threatened to annex Canada and turn it into the 51st state – an effort seemingly welcomed by a leader of the Alberta independence movement. Lawyer Jeffrey Rath, part of the delegation that met secretly with state department officials, said last year he and otherswanted to “petition” for Alberta to gain US statehood.And influential figures in the White House have signalled support for the separatists.“Albertans are a very independent people,” the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told the conservative website Real America’s Voice. “Rumour [is] that they may have a referendum on whether they want to stay in Canada or not … People are talking. People want sovereignty. They want what the US has got.”Mark Carney has said he “expects the US administration to respect Canadian sovereignty”. But there is a growing sense of unease among senior officials in Ottawa that the UScould use secession movements as a political wedgeto meddle in Canadian domestic affairs.“It seems now that if there were to be a referendum on independence in Alberta – or in Quebec for that matter – the US would not stay silent and/or support Canadian unity,” Lecours said. “You’d likely hear another, far different message.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

With her coalition partner, theJapanInnovation party, which won 36 seats, Takaichi now has a supermajority of two-thirds of seats, easing her legislative agenda as she can override the upper chamber, which she does not control.A smiling Takaichi placed a red ribbon above each winner’s name on a signboard at the LDP’s headquarters as party executives applauded.The 64-year-old, whocalled a snap electionsoon after becoming Japan’sfirst female prime ministerlast autumn, had vowed to resign if her coalition failed to secure a simple majority in the vote, which was held on a freezing day when many parts of the country were again hit by heavy snow.View image in fullscreenA voter at a polling station in Uonuma, Niigata prefecture.Photograph: Manami Yamada/ReutersShe will not, however, have long to savour her party’s victory. There are concerns over her management of Japan’s public finances and her ability to defuse a bitter row with China over the future of Taiwan.Takaichi sought to appeal to voters with a 21tn yen (£99bn) stimulus package aimed at easing the cost of living crisis, later promising to suspend the 8% consumption (sales) tax on food for two years – a 5tn-yen hit to annual revenue.Her spending plans have rattled financial markets and caused currency volatility, prompting some commentators to question her approach given that Japan’s debt is more than twice the size of its gross domestic product – the heaviest debt burden of any advanced economy.Speaking as exit polls showed her party cruising to victory, Takaichi, an admirer of Margaret Thatcher, said:“We have consistently stressed the importance of responsible and proactive fiscal policy. We will prioritise the sustainability of fiscal policy. We will ensure necessary investments. Public and private sectors must invest. We will build a strong and resilient economy.”View image in fullscreenAn election official empties a ballot box at a counting station in Tokyo.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockAfter a whirlwind introduction to diplomacy – including meetings with Donald Trump and Xi Jinping late last year – Takaichi sparked a row with Beijing in November when she suggested Japan could becomeinvolved militarilyin the event of a Chinese attempt to invade Taiwan.China urged tourists not to visit Japan – advice they haveheeded– and young people not to study there, citing “safety concerns”. The dispute has disrupted cultural exchanges and even brought an end to decades of “panda diplomacy”.Takaichi’s refusal to withdraw her remarks may haveangered Beijing, but it has played well with many voters.Trump congratulated Takaichi on her election win, wishing her “great success in passing your Conservative, Peace Through Strength Agenda” in a social media post.Margarita Estévez-Abe, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University, said Sunday’s victory could give Takaichi room to repair the damage to Sino-Japanese ties.View image in fullscreenAn election official prepares to open ballot boxes at a counting centre in Tokyo.Photograph: Takashi Aoyama/Getty Images“Now she doesn’t have to worry about any elections until 2028, when the next upper house elections will take place,” Estévez-Abe said. “So the best scenario for Japan is that Takaichi kind of takes a deep breath and focuses on amending the relationship with China.”But if she follows through with the consumption tax cut, the market reaction could be swift and hostile, according to some analysts.Takaichi’s big victory means she will have more political room to follow through on key commitments such as consumption-tax cuts, said Seiji Inada, the managing director at the consultancy FGS Global. “Markets could react in the following days, and the yen could come under renewed pressure.”Blizzard conditions in some regions made visiting a polling station in Sunday’s election, the first held inmid-winterfor 35 years, a test of endurance for many voters.View image in fullscreenSanae Takaichi adjusts her earphone before talking to the media at her party’s headquarters in Tokyo.Photograph: Kim Kyung-Hoon/AFP/Getty ImagesKazushige Cho, a 54-year-old teacher, said he had been determined to vote for the LDP despite the atrocious weather. “She [Takaichi] has shown strong leadership and pushes various policies forward,” Cho said outside a polling station in a small town in Niigata prefecture where the snow had reached a depth of more than 2 metres. “I think things could turn out quite well.”The weather caused widespread disruption on Sunday, halting services on dozens of train lines and forcing the cancellation of 230 domestic flights, according to the transport ministry.The estimated voter turnout was 55.6%, according to NHK – up from 53.8% in the previous lower house election in 2024. The broadcaster said more than 27 million people had cast their votes early.Takaichi’s personal popularity –particularly among younger voters– has transformed the LDP’s fortunes since winning the race to succeed Shigeru Ishiba as the party’s president in October.Under Ishiba, the LDP and its then coalition partner, Komeito,lost their majoritiesin both houses of parliament amid public anger over aslush fund scandaland the rising cost of food and other basics.The LDP, which has governed Japan for most of the past 70 years, was helped, as in previous elections, by a fractured and uninspiring opposition.The main opposition Centrist Reform Alliance, which was formed weeks before by two existing parties, was projected to sink to half of their combined pre-election share of 167 seats, leaving questions hanging over its future.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Let’s keep fighting. As long as we still have each other, the power will belong to the people, for sure.”View image in fullscreenNatthaphong Ruengpanyawut (C) after giving a press conference to concede the general election on Sunday.Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPAThe People’s party had been leading polls ahead of the election, but with more than half of votes counted on Sunday night it was in second place, with Pheu Thai, the party linked to the now imprisoned former populist leaderThaksin Shinawatra, third.The result is a major blow to Thailand’s pro-democracy camp, whichwon the most seats and votes in the last electionbut was blocked from power by rivals in the military royalist establishment. Two previous iterations of the partywere dissolvedand its leaders banned from politics in rulings by the constitutional court, which frequently intervenes in Thai politics.The People’s party has a loyal support base among young and urban Thais who want reforms to make Thailand, which has a history of military coups, more democratic.Anutin has been prime minister since September, taking office after Paetongtarn Shinawatra wasremoved for an ethics violationconnected to her handling of a border dispute with Cambodia. He dissolved parliament in December to call a new election when he was threatened with a no-confidence vote, and just asconflict with Cambodia had re-erupted.View image in fullscreenA polling station in Bangkok on Sunday.Photograph: Wissarut Weerasopon/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockHe has sought to present himself as the only leader committed to protecting Thailand’s territory, riding a wave of nationalism prompted by the border conflict.Bhumjaitai pledged to build a wall across the border, and to offer an incentive of 15,000 baht (£350) a month to those volunteering for the armed forces. At a recent campaign rally he said that if Thai people wanted a government “chosen by Cambodia” they should vote for his rivals.The People’s party, which has long campaigned for the army to be more accountable, was accused of being anti-military – a position it rejected.Dr Napon Jatusripitak, a visiting fellow at ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute, said Bhumjaithai had been uniquely placed to benefit from such nationalism. It had also succeeded in leveraging its links with powerful political families that are able to deliver votes, balancing this by appointing “a front-facing layer of technocrats”, he said.“This arrangement allowed the party to stay anchored in patronage politics while broadening its appeal to conservative voters who might otherwise find this traditional style of politics unpalatable.”View image in fullscreenAnutin Charnvirakul speaking to the press after casting his vote.Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty ImagesBhumjaithai had, Napon said, positioned itself as a force for stability at a time when many voters were wary of the political disruption associated with sweeping structural reform.Anutin, the son of a former cabinet minister, comes from a family that owns one of Thailand’s biggest construction companies, responsible for some high-profile developments including Bangkok’s main airport. He did not comment when asked what a future cabinet would look like.At the headquarters for the People’s party, where supporters had turned out to watch results, the mood was glum on Sunday night. Kanawat Sombunpot, 27, an accountant, said she was heartbroken, and believed Anutin had benefited from nationalism linked to the war with Cambodia.It was hard to think of what the People’s party could do differently, she said, adding that it had already dropped its policy to amend Thailand’s lese-majesty law, under which criticism of the monarchy can lead to up to 15 years in prison.View image in fullscreenNattaphong (centre) with supporters after the declaration of defeat, at the People’s party headquarters in Bangkok.Photograph: Sirachai Arunrugstichai/Getty Images“If [the party] adapts any more it will be grey and the same as other parties,” said Kunawut Watcharapitchaiyakul, 26, who works in marketing and had come to watch the results at the party’s headquarters.The People’s party had pledged to fight corruption and differentiated itself by promising major reforms to make the country more democratic, break up big monopolies and modernise the education system.Kunawut questioned whether some members of the public had taken issue with the People’s party’s past decisions, especially where it appeared to put ideology or a clean image over pragmatism. However, he said he believed this approach would benefit the party in the long term by building trust. “It’s going to take time,” he said. “Maybe 10 years.”“I won’t give up,” he added. “But I’m tired.”Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificThaksin ShinawatranewsShareReuse this content"

Why would they vote for a party that is in coalition with the Nationals, when the Nationals’ only policy objective is to be more rightwing than One Nation?” the MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said.The Liberal and Nationals leadersannounced a deal to reunite the two partieson Sunday afternoon, just 17 days after David Littleproud blew up the Coalition and declared the political alliance “untenable” under Ley in a rift over Labor’s hate speech laws.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“It’s been a difficult time for millions of ourCoalitionsupporters and many other Australians who rely on our two great parties to provide scrutiny and national leadership, but the Coalition is back together and looking to the future, not the past,” Ley said.Under the peace deal, all of the former Nationals frontbenchers will be suspended from the shadow ministry until 1 March before resuming in their old portfolios.Littleproud and the Nationals’ deputy leader, Kevin Hogan, will attend shadow cabinet and other senior leadership meetings during the period, even though neither will technically hold frontbench positions.Both leaders agreed to major concessions to land the deal ahead of Ley’s self-imposed Monday deadline to reunite the parties before she pushed ahead with a Liberal-only frontbench.Ley gave ground on her initial demand for six-month suspensions for the three senators who crossed the floor, while the Nationals agreed to accept some form of punishment, having previously insisted none was warranted.The prospect of reuniting the Coalition divided the Liberals and put Ley’s fragile leadership under further strain.Taylor, his fellow rightwinger James Paterson and senior shadow ministers Dan Tehan and James McGrath were pushing for the Coalition to quickly reform, as was the former prime minister John Howard.But others – including many moderates – were comfortable with a longer-term split from the Nationals, particularly as the country party pursues more rightwing policies to combat the threat of Pauline Hanson and Barnaby Joyce’s One Nation.Guardian Australia has spoken to five Liberal sources who believe the concessions to reunite the Coalition have damaged Ley’s standing and could shift a crucial bloc of undecided MPs into Taylor’s corner – even though the shadow defence spokesperson had pushed for the same outcome.Ley dismissed the prospect of one-time supporters shifting their allegiance to Taylor.“The overwhelming majority of my party room knows that the Coalition is stronger together,” she said.Some Liberals are refusing to forgive the Nationals for breaking ranks to oppose the hate speech laws, which triggered a backlash of criticism from the party’s conservative members who wanted them to do the same.One MP described the Nationals’ behaviour as “unconscionable” ahead of the 17-day split – and even worse during it.Coalition reunites after Sussan Ley brokers deal with David Littleproud to end second splitRead more“By joining the Nationals we are condemning ourselves to being seen as the junior partner to One Nation,” they said. “One Nation wins. We now have their wannabe cousins, the Nationals, dictating how Liberals should set their policy agenda.”A separate MP, who previously doubted a leadership challenge would materialise but now considers a spill inevitable, said the decision to accept the shorter suspensions was a significant backdown that would tip the number’s in Taylor’s favour.A leadership spill is considered highly unlikely at Tuesday’s Liberal party room meeting because of Senate estimates.However, MPs are preparing for the possibility of a second party room being called for Friday.Taylor would first need to resign from shadow cabinet to support a spill motion and contest the ballot.Ley defeated Taylor 29 votes to 25 in the post-election leadership ballot with the support of a coalition of moderate, centre-right and unaligned MPs.One moderate powerbroker said while Ley still retained their support, MPs were deeply disappointed at having conceded to the Nationals, particularly after the faction lost to fight to preserve a net zero target.The former moderate Liberal MP Jason Falinski – who had supported a longer-term separation – said the compromise deal was “not a bad outcome”.“To be honest, I thought the obstacles to the Coalition getting back together again were pretty high, and would have been difficult to surmount. So credit where credit’s due,” he told the ABC.A senior conservative said Ley made the “sensible” decision to accept the deal, avoiding a repeat of the “circus” that played out in parliament last week when the two parties sat apart.Explore more on these topicsSussan LeyLiberal partyCoalitionAngus TaylorNational partyAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

With nearly 70% of votes counted, Seguro garnered 64%. Ventura trailed behind at 36%, still likely to secure a much stronger result than the 22.8% his anti-immigration Chega party achieved in last year’s general election. Ballots in large cities such as Lisbon and Porto are counted towards the end.Two exit polls placed Seguro in the 67%-73% range and Ventura at 27%-33%.Last year, Chega became the second-largest parliamentary force, overtaking the Socialists and landing behind the centre-right ruling alliance, which garnered 31.2%.Despite his loss on Sunday, 43-year-old Ventura, a charismatic former TV sports commentator, can now boast increased support, reflecting the growing influence of the far right in Portugal and much ofEurope.“The entire political system, across both right and left, united against me,” Ventura told reporters as he left a Catholic mass in central Lisbon. “Even so ... I believe the leadership of the right has been defined and secured today. I expect to lead that political space from this day forward.“Seguro has cast himself as the candidate of a “modern and moderate” left who can actively mediate to avert political crises and defend democratic values. He received backing from prominent conservatives after the first round amid concerns over what many see as Ventura’s populist, authoritarian tendencies.Portugal’s presidency is a largely ceremonial role but holds some important powers, including the ability to dissolve parliament under certain circumstances. Ventura had said he would be a more “interventionist” president, advocating increased powers for the head of state.View image in fullscreenAntónio José Seguro surrounded by flag-waving supporters at a campaign event in Porto.Photograph: Rita Franca/ReutersSeguro has positioned himself as a moderate candidate who will cooperate with Portugal’s centre-right minority government, repudiating Ventura’s anti-establishment and anti-immigrant tirades.The longstanding Socialist politician has won the support of other mainstream politicians on the left and rightwho want to halt the rising populist tide.Storm-battered Portugal heads to polls as rivals unite to keep out far rightRead moreIn Portugal, the president is largely a figurehead with no executive power. Traditionally, the head of state stands above the political fray, mediating disputes and defusing tensions.However, the president is an influential voice and has some powerful tools at their disposal, being able to veto legislation from parliament, although the veto can be overturned. The head of state also possesses what in Portuguese political jargon is called an “atomic bomb”, the power to dissolve parliament and call early elections.In May, Portugal held its third general election in three years in the country’s worst bout of political instability for decades, and steadying the ship is a key challenge for the next president.View image in fullscreenAndré Ventura looks on during a campaign stop in Alcacer do Sal.Photograph: Pedro Nunes/ReutersVentura, an eloquent and theatrical politician, has rejected political accommodation in favour of a more combative stance. One of his main targets has been what he calls excessive immigration, as foreign workers have become more conspicuous in Portugal in recent years. “Portugal is ours,” he said.During the campaign, Ventura put up billboards across the country that said: “This isn’t Bangladesh” and “Immigrants shouldn’t be allowed to live on welfare.”Although he founded Chega less than seven years ago, its rise in public support made it the second-largest party in Portugal’s parliament in the 18 May general election.In March, the winner will replace the centre-right president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who has served the limit of two five-year terms.Explore more on these topicsPortugalEuropeThe far rightnewsShareReuse this content"

Both women were found injured.Two of those arrested overnight were detained as they attempted to take a bus to Spain, said a source close to the case who spoke on condition of anonymity.Authorities were continuing to search for further suspects, a second source close to the case said, adding that the woman in custody was the partner of one of the four male suspects.A massive police search involving 160 officers was launched after the magistrate’s partner received a message and a photo of her from the kidnappers demanding a ransom to be paid in cryptocurrency.The captors threatened to mutilate their victims if the transfer was not made quickly, Dran told reporters, declining to specify the amount demanded.The two women managed to free themselves and call for help, banging on the garage door. “Alerted by the noise, a neighbour intervened. He was able to open the door and allow our two victims to escape,” Dran said. They were rescued on Friday morning in Bourg-lès-Valence without any ransom being paid, according to the prosecutor.French authorities have been dealing with a string of kidnappings and extortion attempts targeting the families of wealthy individuals dealing in cryptocurrencies.In January 2025,kidnappers seized the French crypto boss David Ballandand his partner. Balland co-founded a crypto firm called Ledger, valued at the time at more than $1bn. The kidnappers cut off his finger and demanded a hefty ransom. He was freed the next day, and his partner was found tied up in the boot of a car outside Paris.In May, the father of a man who ran a Malta-based cryptocurrency company was kidnapped by four hooded men in Paris. The victim, whose finger was also severed by the kidnappers and for whom a ransom of several million euros was demanded, was released 58 hours later in a raid by the security forces.Explore more on these topicsFranceCryptocurrenciesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Both denied any wrongdoing.View image in fullscreenExamples of emails between Jack Lang and Jeffrey Epstein taken from documents published by the US Department of Justice.Photograph: Nguyen Van Hai-Barbier/Jean Pierre/Abaca/ShutterstockLang’s departure is the latest example of thefallout in Europefrom files released on 30 January by the US Department of Justice, many of which showed Epstein’s social, networking and financial links. Lang is the most high-profile public figure in France caught up in thelatest release of private messagesfrom the convicted sex offender.He was culture minister under the Socialist president François Mitterrand in the 1980s and 90s, and oversaw major modern architectural projects such as the building of the Louvre pyramid. Since 2013, he has headed the Institut du Monde Arabe, or Arab World Institute, a cultural and research institution that promotes understanding of the Arab world and is supervised by the French foreign ministry.Lang was shown in the Epstein files corresponding intermittently with the financier between 2012 and 2019, when Epstein died by suicide in jail. He was mentioned more than 600 times in the files, according to news agencies. His daughter was also repeatedly mentioned.Caroline Lang resigned this week from France’s Union of Independent Producers after the emails showed she had founded an offshore company with Epstein in 2016 to invest in the work of young artists. She said she had resigned from that offshore company when further allegations were made against Epstein in 2019. She denied any wrongdoing.Caroline Lang also appeared in Epstein’s will as a beneficiary of €5m, according to the French investigative websiteMediapart. She told the French public broadcaster France 2 this week that she had never heard of the will and had never seen any such document or received any funds.Jack Lang has denied any wrongdoing, saying he was “shocked” that his name appeared in the statutes of the offshore company in 2016 and that he had appealed to Epstein only as a philanthropist.View image in fullscreenJack Lang said he had appealed to Epstein only as a philanthropist.Photograph: Martin Lelievre/AFP/Getty ImagesMerlet told Agence France-Presse on Saturday: “There has been no movement of funds … But I think it is normal for the justice to want to verify this.” He said Caroline Lang was “serene” because she had received no funds.In a defence used by other Epstein associates, Lang said he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal behaviour despite his conviction in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution. “How could a man so courteous, so charming, so generous have perpetrated such abominations?” Lang told the French public broadcaster France 2 this week. He said he had been shocked to learn of the allegations against Epstein in 2019.A video showed Lang with Epstein in front of the Louvre pyramid in Paris in March 2019, months before he was charged with sex trafficking girls as young as 14.Resignations, denials and excuses: Epstein fallout hits some harder than othersRead moreLe Monde newspaper and Mediapart, which investigated the files, said no documents released by the US justice department suggested either Lang or his daughter had been implicated in Epstein’s sex crimes.Earlier this week, Lang had said he would not resign, despite calls for him to quit from all parties, including his own.Lang has said he was introduced to Epstein by the American actor and director Woody Allen. Epstein owned a vast apartment in the west of Paris and was a frequent visitor to the French capital before his death in prison in 2019.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

It caught alight shortly before 6am on Sunday, regional police in Switzerland’s south-western canton of Valais said in a statement.View image in fullscreenThe memorial was set up near Le Constellation a few days after the 1 January fire.Photograph: Maxime Schmid/AFP/Getty ImagesImages broadcast by Swiss public broadcaster RTS on Sunday showed the blackened top of a white, igloo-like tarpaulin erected over the memorial to protect it from the weather, visible behind a white screen and police tape.“Thanks to the rapid intervention of the emergency services, the fire was quickly brought under control,” police said.No one was injured in the fire at the memorial, they said, though “several commemorative objects were damaged by the flames”.A large book of remembrance, filled with messages of condolence left by those who have visited the memorial over the past five weeks, had been saved, the statement said.Police said an investigation had been opened into what caused the blaze at the memorial, which had initially been placed in front of the burned-out bar but which had recently been moved a bit farther away.“According to initial reports, the fire started near the candles placed on a table in the centre of the memorial,” the statement said. “At this stage, third-party involvement can be ruled out.”Investigators believethat the new year inferno at Le Constellation started when champagne bottles with sparklers attached were raised too close to a ceiling in the bar crowded with revellers, igniting sound insulation foam.The French couple who co-owned the bar, Jacques and Jessica Moretti,are facing chargesof manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Crans-Montana’s head of public safety and a former local fire safety officer are also under criminal investigation in connection with the blaze at the bar, which had not undergone mandatory annual fire inspections since 2019.Following weeks of harsh criticism of local and regional authorities’ handling of the crisis and the investigation, family members voiced consternation upon learning of the fire at the memorial.“What to say?” Laetitia Brodard-Sitre, whose 16-year-old son Arthur Brodard was among those who died at Le Constellation, posted on Facebook over a link to a report about the memorial fire. “It is the municipality’s responsibility to ensure a memorial that is secure.”Explore more on these topicsSwitzerlandEuropeCrans-Montana firenewsShareReuse this content"

Care of his beloved cat, provided for before his death, would not be affected.Lagerfeld, one of the most influential figures in global high fashion across decades, but an enigmatic figure behind dark glasses, had no spouse, children or surviving siblingswhen he died in 2019aged 85.View image in fullscreenLagerfeld signing a painting of Choupette in 2015.Photograph: Jens Kalaene/AFP/Getty ImagesHis will, dated 29 April 2016, shut out his deceased siblings’ children, leaving his accumulated wealth and property, valued at about €200m, to a tight cadre of confidants.They are believed to include his assistant and bodyguard Sébastien Jondeau, his teenage godson Hudson Kroenig and the models Brad Kroenig and Baptiste Giabiconi. Giabiconi has described himself as “at the top” of the list of Lagerfeld’s inheritors and said the designer once made an abortive attempt to adopt him as a son.The German magazine Bunte reported that the descendants of Lagerfeld’s late sisters, Christiane Johnson, who died in 2015, and Thea von der Schulenburg, who married into the aristocratic Schulenburg clan and died in 1997, had received letters from the executor.“The interpretation of the will is being contested,” Boisson wrote, according to Bunte. “At present, the rights of the heirs are therefore uncertain.”View image in fullscreenLagerfeld in Paris in 1958.Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty ImagesLagerfeld lived in Paris and died on its outskirts but maintained what he called his primary residence in Monaco, meaning that French and Monegasque law, which generally designate the next of kin as rightful heirs, would apply.The plaintiff, however, would have to make the case that Lagerfeld, born in Hamburg in 1933, was not of sound mind when he signed the will.German media were quick to note that Lagerfeld’s 14-year-old fluffy pet cat Choupette, acquired from Giabiconi, can continue to rest easy in her life of luxury.While he was still alive, the designer bequeathed a home and garden in France as well as a brimming bank account to his housekeeper Françoise Caçote for her to care for the beloved sapphire-eyed white Birman after his death. Because the gift was made long before his passing, it is seen as beyond the reach of any legal challenge to his will.Choupette’s gilded lifestyle is the stuff of legend – eating out of porcelain dishes, sleeping on Chanel fabrics and reclining in Louis Vuitton monogrammed cat carriers.She has her ownverified Instagram accountwith 278,000 followers and has earned an income as an advertising mascot for companies such as the German carmaker Audi. When Lagerfeld died, speculation ran rampant that she was listed as a beneficiary in his will.View image in fullscreenChoupette on the LucyBalu stand at Paris Nord Villepinte in 2022.Photograph: Julien M Hekimian/Getty Images For LucyBalu x ChoupetteBeyond his fortune from couture, Lagerfeld kept a number of luxury properties, including his vast Parisian flat and sumptuous Biarritz villa, and owned a sizeable stock portfolio as well as collections of art and rare books.Little is known about how and when Lagerfeld fell out with his relatives, but they were understood to be estranged in the last decades of his life. A 2023BBC Two documentarysaid he had not seen one of his nieces in five decades.Another niece, an American, said that while she hardly knew him, Lagerfeld was “generous”, even designing her wedding dress at no charge then flying the garment over on Concorde to be there in time for the ceremony. She told the film-makers she expected nothing further from her late uncle: “There is no need.”Karl Lagerfeld obituaryRead moreLagerfeld worked up to his death on several collections a year for Chanel, for Fendi and for his own label,Karl Lagerfeld. He said he frequently tinkered with his will, once saying: “Even one funny look from someone and they’re out.”It is not the first time Lagerfeld’s named beneficiaries have had to worry their inheritance would be snatched away. French finance authorities have reportedly demanded up to €40m from his estate in back taxes, Germany’s Bild newspaper said, on the grounds his actual primary residence was not in Monaco, atax haven.Boisson could not immediately be reached but his associate Frédéric Heurté told Bild: “We are bound by confidentiality. Therefore, I am not permitted to comment on anything concerning Karl Lagerfeld’s estate.”Approached by Bild, Thea’s daughter Thoma von der Schulenburg also declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsKarl LagerfeldGermanyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Iran’s top diplomat said on Sunday that Tehran’s strength came from its ability to “say no to the great powers”, striking a maximalist position just after negotiations in Oman with the US.Mohammadi’s supporters cited her lawyer, Mostafa Nili, who had spoken to her. Nili confirmed the sentence on X, saying it had been handed down on Saturday by a court in the city of Mashhad.“She has been sentenced to six years in prison for ‘gathering and collusion’ and one and a half years for propaganda and two-year travel ban,” he wrote. Mohammadi had received another two years of internal exile to the city of Khosf, about 740km (460 miles) south-east of the capital, Tehran, the lawyer added.Iran did not immediately acknowledge the sentence.Supporters say Mohammadi has been on a hunger strike since 2 Februrary. She had beenarrested in December at a memorial ceremonyhonouring Khosrow Alikordi, a 46-year-old Iranian lawyer and human rights advocate who had been based in Mashhad. Footage from the demonstration showed her shouting, demanding justice for Alikordi and others.Supporters had warned for months before her December arrest that Mohammadi, 53, was at risk of being put back into prison after shereceived a furloughin December 2024 over medical concerns. While that was to be only three weeks, her time out of prison lengthened, possibly as activists and western powers pushed Iran to keep her free. She remained out even during the 12-day war in June between Iran and Israel.Mohammadi kept up her activism with public protests and international media appearances, including even demonstrating at one point in front of Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where she had been held. She had been serving 13 years and nine months on charges of collusion against state security and propaganda against Iran’s government.She also had backed the nationwide protests sparked by the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, which have seen women openly defy the government by not wearing the hijab.Mohammadi suffered multiple heart attacks while imprisoned before undergoing emergency surgery in 2022, her supporters say. In late 2024 her lawyer revealed doctors had found she had a bone lesion that they feared could be cancerous, which was later removed.“Considering her illnesses, it is expected that she will be temporarily released on bail so that she can receive treatment,” Nili wrote.However, Iranian officials have been signalling a harder line against all dissent since the demonstrations.Explore more on these topicsIranProtestFreedom of speechMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "15.07 ESTClosing summaryThank you for following the Guardian’s live blog on Morgan McSweeney’s resignation.Our live coverage has now ended. Here’s an overview of everything that happened today:Morgan McSweeneyresigned from his role of chief of staff to the prime minister after reportedly pushing for Peter Mandelson’s appointment as UK ambassador to the US in 2024 despite his known ties to Jeffrey Epstein.In his resignation statement, McSweeney said: “When asked,I advised the prime minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice. In public life responsibility must be owned when it matters most, not just when it is most convenient. In the circumstances,the only honourable course is to step aside.”Reacting to his chief of staff’s departure,Keir Starmersaid in a statement: “It’s been an honourworking with Morgan McSweeney for many years. He turned our party around after one of its worst ever defeats and played a central role running our election campaign.It is largely thanks to his dedication, loyalty and leadership that we won a landslide majorityand have the chance to change the country.”Starmer appointed Jill Cuthbertson and Vidhya Alakeson as acting chiefs of staff, with immediate effect. Both served as deputy chiefs of staff since 2024.The Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Starmer should also “take responsibility” for his actions.In a post on X, Badenoch wrote: “It’s about time. But once again with this PM it’s somebody else’s fault: ‘Mandelson lied to me’ or ‘Morgan advised me’.” She added: “Keir Starmer has to take responsibility for his own terrible decisions. But he never does.”Morgan McSweeney says he takes ‘full responsibility’ for advising the prime minister to appoint Peter Mandelson as UK ambassador to the US.Photograph: Thomas Krych/Story Picture Agency/ShutterstockLiberal Democrat deputy leader,Daisy Cooper, said the prime minister can “change his advisers all he likes”, but added that “the buck stops with him”. She wrote on X: “We need to see an end to this political soap opera, with answers for the British public and, most importantly, justice for the victims and survivors of Epstein and his network.”Zack Polanski, the leader of the Green party, called for Starmer to step down, saying McSweeney’s resignation was necessary “but not sufficient”.Several Labour MPs also urged Starmer to consider stepping down after McSweeney’s resignation. Among them wasIan Byrne, who said the prime minister “must now reflect honestly on his own position and ask whether, for the good of the country and the Labour party, he should follow” McSweeney’s lead.Kim Johnson, the Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, also warned that McSweeney’s resignation will not protect the prime minister, adding that Starmer’s position is “untenable”.Other Labour MPs spoke out in Starmer’s defence. They includedNatalie Fleet, the Labour MP for Bolsover, who told LBC “we have never had a prime minister that cares as much about violence against women and girls” as he does.John Slinger,Rugby’s Labour MP, urged Labour to “rally behind the prime minister”. He said: “We don’t ditch a leader just because the going gets tough.”ShareUpdated at15.10 EST"

But the loss of the man seen as thearchitect of Starmer’s rise to poweris a huge blow. The focus is now set to turn once again to the decision made by the prime minister to appoint Mandelson.View image in fullscreenMcSweeney (right) and Mandelson last June. The departing chief of staff said he took ‘full responsibility’ for his advice on the US ambassadorial appointment.Photograph: Tayfun SalciSenior Labour sources said McSweeney’s departure had left the prime minister dangerously exposed as he headed towards aseries of policy and electoral challenges– including the Gorton and Denton byelection later this month – that could determine his political fate.A source close to Downing Street said: “Keir has just lost his firewall, on Mandelson and a whole load of other issues. Where does he think the anger gets directed next?”Keir Starmer’s next steps: what hurdles must the prime minister now negotiate?Read moreOne MP said: “The buck ultimately stops with the PM. All this has done has bought him a little more time but he’s mortally wounded and it’s not if, it’s when he goes.”Senior government figures said the pressure would only increase on Starmer with the expected release of hundreds of thousands of documents, including private WhatsApp messages and emails between Mandelson, No 10 officials and ministers while he was in Washington.One well-placed source said the documents would show that the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team had warned of the serious reputational risk of appointing Mandelson given his publicly known links with Epstein.The loss of McSweeney is a blow to Starmer, who had come to rely on his political judgment, often over his own, despite No 10 regularly coming under fire as a result. The pair were understood to have had several conversations over the last few days about McSweeney’s future before reaching agreement on Sunday that he should go.Political opponents and senior figures inside theLabourparty accused the prime minister of leaving McSweeney to carry the can over Mandelson’s appointment when ultimately it came down to Starmer’s own political judgment. Allies of McSweeney said it was wrong to suggest he had pushed for the appointment, with one saying: “He gave his advice, but that’s all it was. Keir made the decision.”In a statement on Sunday, McSweeney said: “After careful reflection, I have decided to resign from the government. The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself. When asked, I advised the prime minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice. In public life responsibility must be owned when it matters most, not just when it is most convenient. In the circumstances, the only honourable course is to step aside.”He said the vetting process for appointments needed “fundamental overhaul” after the Mandelson affair. “This cannot simply be a gesture but a safeguard for the future,” he said.Downing Street staff received an email on Sunday evening confirming Starmer had askedJill Cuthbertson and Vidhya Alakeson, McSweeney’s deputies, to take over as acting chiefs of staff, with immediate effect.Since Labour entered power, McSweeney has been a lightning rod for discontent among some backbenchers and grassroots members who were uncomfortable with his style and the direction the party was taking on issues including immigrationand welfare cuts.A senior MP said: “It’s about time. McSweeney was behind a string of terrible decisions because he cannot behave anything other than factionally. The PM needs to grip this and bring in a much wider range of voices than those he’s listened to up to now.”A series of senior Labour politicians had lined up to criticise the No 10 operation over the weekend. The former prime minister Gordon Brown said Starmer was a man of integrity but had been “slow to do the right things”.David Blunkett said the situation was “dire” for Starmer and that McSweeney needed to go. But the former home secretary also warned allies ofAngela Rayner and Wes Streetingto stop the briefing wars. “When people see a party acting like ferrets in a sack they draw their conclusions,” he said.Others shared concerns that Starmer was not up to the task. One former New Labour cabinet minister said: “Although there may be some satisfaction at Morgan’s resignation, my concern is the problem is Keir, not his advisers.”Friends of McSweeney told the Guardian he planned to step away from politics for a period but that he was unlikely to stay on the sidelines for good. “Morgan has been doing this for 25 years, I’m sure he’ll get more involved again in future, but not right now,” one said.McSweeney said in his statement: “This has not been an easy decision. Much has been written and said about me over the years but my motivations have always been simple: I have worked every day to elect and support a government that puts the lives of ordinary people first and leads us to a better future for our great country. Only a Labour government will do that.“I leave with pride in all we have achieved mixed with regret at the circumstances of my departure. But I have always believed there are moments when you must accept your responsibility and step aside for the bigger cause.”Starmer said on Sunday he owed McSweeney a “debt of gratitude”. He said in a statement: “He turned our party around after one of its worst ever defeats and played a central role running our election campaign. It is largely thanks to his dedication, loyalty and leadership that we won a landslide majority and have the chance to change the country.”The prime minister had expressed confidence in his former right-hand man asrecently as Thursday. McSweeney is the second Downing Street chief of staff to stand down, afterSue Gray quit in 2024, and it is the latest in a slew of departures from No 10 in recent months.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, said the prime minister should “take responsibility” for his actions. “It’s about time. But once again with this PM it’s somebody else’s fault: ‘Mandelson lied to me’ or ‘Morgan advised me’.Keir Starmerhas to take responsibility for his own terrible decisions. But he never does.”Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerLabour party leadershipMorgan McSweeneyPeter MandelsonnewsShareReuse this content"

He single-handedly dragged us back to electability and propelled us into government. We would still be facing irrelevance or even extinction without him.”Critics, however – many of them Labour MPs – say McSweeney ran a male-dominated cabal at the heart of Downing Street that ignored the opinions of elected members and prioritised battling the left over governing.They say McSweeney’s determination to champion the credentials of his former mentor Mandelson shows that he valued favouring his friends and political fellow travellers over serving the prime minister’s best interests.They also seethe recent revelationthat Labour Together – the thinktank McSweeney once led – once commissioned an investigation into journalists reporting on its funding as further evidence of a culture of unethical behaviour.“It is very consistent with the cowboy behaviour of Morgan,” said one Labour MP, referring to the Labour Together investigation, which McSweeney did not commission but has not denied knowing about. “There is a pattern of pretty indefensible behaviour.”Clive Lewis, the Labour MP for Norwich South, said: “Morgan McSweeney’s resignation should not be treated as a cleansing moment. He was not an aberration. He was the tip of an iceberg.“What he represents is a political culture that has dominated Labour for a generation. A culture forged under Blair and Mandelson that taught the party to be relaxed about extreme wealth, comfortable in the orbit of billionaires, lobbyists and corporate power, and increasingly detached from the lives of the people it was created to represent.”McSweeney’s departure should relieve pressure on Starmer in the short term. His sacking was one of the main demands of the Tribune group of MPs from the soft left.But some believe that it also removes an important obstacle to the eventual downfall of Starmer himself. Without his right-hand man around, the prime minister will have to accept a greater share of the blame should Labour lose the Gorton and Denton byelection and face heavy losses at the subsequent local elections.“Keir has nobody left to blame, he has lost his firewall,” said one MP. “But then, maybe McSweeney’s departure also removes the need for a firewall.”Luke Sullivan, Starmer’s former head of political strategy, said: “This is a big moment, but I don’t know how it helps other than buying Starmer some time.“Morgan is a lightning rod – some people think he’s a genius, others that he’s to blame for everything. I don’t think any individual can be under pressure as much as this if they’re not an elected politician.”One thing is certain: with leadership speculation already at fever pitch, those pushing to oust the prime minister are unlikely to be deterred.“Like a wounded animal, this government will drag itself away as it’s hacked at and pecked at till it expires, probably after the May locals,” said one leftwing Labour backbencher. “By then Starmer can resign on the grounds of those losses and not the reputational disaster of Epstein and Mandelson.“It won’t matter though. Starmer will go down as the worst PM in Labour history and one that may have finally broken it. He’s a coward who refuses to take responsibility for his own actions. He is a moral gravity-well from which neither decency, honesty or integrity can escape. A genuine disaster for this country and the Labour movement.”Explore more on these topicsMorgan McSweeneyKeir StarmerLabouranalysisShareReuse this content"

Dr Mehmet Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon, spoke in support on Sunday of the measles vaccine.“Take the vaccine, please,” said Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. “We have a solution for our problem.”“Not all illnesses are equally dangerous and not all people are equally susceptible to those illnesses,” hetoldCNN’s State of the Union. “But measles is one you should get your vaccine.”His boss, health secretaryRobert F Kennedy Jr, has a long history of questioning both the safety and necessity of vaccines.The remarks come asSouth Carolinais experiencing anoutbreakinvolving hundreds of cases, exceeding the number recorded in Texas’ measles outbreak earlier in 2025. Another outbreak has been identified along the Utah-Arizona border, and several additional states have reported confirmed cases this year. Children have been the most affected.US committee is reconsidering all vaccine recommendationsRead morePublic health specialists say theresurgenceis occurring as skepticism toward vaccines grows, potentially fueling the return of a disease that officials had previously declared eliminated in the US.In January alone, the US saw 25% of the totalcasesconfirmed in all of last year, and the outbreak shows no sign of slowing as federal officials mostly stay silent on vaccination.The vast majority of patients are not vaccinated, but there have been no national campaigns announced, with Oz being the first major statement from the federal government. Last year, Kennedy positioned measles vaccines as apersonal choiceand recommended unproven treatments for the highly contagious illness.Oz has previously leaned into Kennedy’s campaign to “make America healthy again” (Maha), an effort to redesign the country’s food supply, reject vaccine mandates and cast doubt on some long-established scientific research. Hecast doubton how well flu vaccines work in an interview with Newsmax last year. “Every year, there’s a flu vaccine. It doesn’t always work very well. That’s why it’s been controversial of late,” Oz said. He instead recommended that Americans “take care” of themselves, so they can “overwhelm” the flu when they encounter it.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationMMRVaccines and immunisationUS healthcareHealthUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The US constitution gives states the power to set election rules and says Congress can pass laws to set requirements for federal elections. The constitution gives the president no authority over how elections are run.Trump suggests Republicans should ‘take over’ elections to protect the partyRead more“What Donald Trump wants to do is try and nationalize the election – translation: steal it. And we’re not going to let it happen,” Jeffries said during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union. He added that Democrats so far had successfully blocked Trump’s efforts tofederalize the national guardcountered anationwide pushby Republicans to redraw congressional district boundaries to their advantage.“This is going to be a free and fair election,” Jeffries said. It “is going to be conducted like every other election where states and localities have the ability to administer the laws”.TheTrump administrationfor months has been sowing doubt about the integrity of this year’s midterm elections byfiling lawsuitsagainst states suggesting they are improperly maintaining their voter rolls. The FBI also undertook an unprecedented raid of the election office in Fulton county, Georgia,last month, seizing ballots and other voter information related to the 2020 election. Allegations of fraud have been debunked repeatedly in Fulton county, yet Trump has continued to repeat false claims about the county.Later in his interview on CNN, Jeffries condemned Trump’srefusal to apologizefor a racist post on his Truth Social account depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes. The White Housedeleted the poston Friday amid widespreadoutcryand said a staffer was responsible for posting it.Alarm bells sound over Trump’s ‘take over the voting’ callRead more“He definitively needs to apologize. It was a disgusting video and the president was rightly and appropriately and forcefully denounced by people all across the country,” Jeffries said. “Democrats and even a handful of Republicans who finally showed some backbone in pushing back against the president’s malignant, bottom-feeder-like behavior.”Senator Adam Schiff of California also said it was clear Trump was trying to interfere in the election and alsoquestioned whyTulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, was at the Fulton county raid.“He fully intends to try to subvert the elections. He will do everything he can to suppress the vote. And if he loses the vote, and I think the Republicans now expect they’ll get a real drubbing in the midterms, he’s prepared to try to take some kind of action to overturn the result. And we really shouldn’t question that,” Schiff said during an appearance on ABC’s This Week. “I think all of this is intended to send a message. And the message is: ‘We will not tolerate or accept an election that we lose.’”Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice-chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, also condemned Gabbard’s presence at the Fulton county raid saying on Sunday he was concerned Trump was trying to interfere in the midterms.“We have not been informed of any foreign nexus. The job of the director of national intelligence is to be outward facing about foreigners, not about Americans,” he saidduring an interviewon Face The Nation on CBS. “My fear is now [Trump] sees the political winds turning against him, and he’s going to try to interfere in the 2026 election, something a year ago I didn’t think would be possible.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsDemocratsDonald TrumpHakeem JeffriesUS CongressTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Hess said representing the US at the 2026 Winter Olympics brought up “mixed emotions” and that it was “a little hard.”The world heard JD Vance being booed at the Olympics. Except for viewers in the US | Bryan Armen GrahamRead more“There’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren’t,” he said. “I think for me it’s more I’m representing my friends and family back home, the people that represented it before me, all the things that I believe are good about the US … Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the US.”Trump made his ire clear on Sunday, characterizing Hess’s comments as saying: “he doesn’t represent his Country in the currentWinter Olympics. If that’s the case, he shouldn’t have tried out for the team, and it’s too bad he’s on it. Very hard to root for someone like this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”Trump’s critique follows that of Tennessee Republican representative Tim Burchett, who said in a post on X that Hess should “shut up and go play in the snow.”Hess is one of a handful of Team USA Olympians who have expressed discomfort with representing their country in its current state, and who have then been the recipient of criticism afterward.US figure skating national champion Amber Glenn said she’d be taking a break from all social media after being inundated with what she called “a scary amount of hate/threats.”Glenn, who came out publicly in 2019, was asked how it feels to be part of the LGBTQ community under the Trump administration.“It’s been a hard time for the community overall and this administration,” Glenn said. “It isn’t the first time that we’ve had to come together as a community and try and fight for our human rights.”While not specifically mentioning Trump’s policies, two-time Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrinread a quote from Nelson Mandelaexpressing hope that “we can all flourish regardless of race, color, creed, religion, gender, class, caste or any other social markers of difference” when asked about representing the US in the current political climate. She then added her own words: “For me, as this related to the Olympics, I really hope to show up and represent my own values. Of diversity, and kindness, and sharing. Tenacity, work ethic, showing up with my team every single day.”The US Olympic & Paralympic Committee said on Sunday that it is aware of abusive and harmful messages directed toward athletes and is doing its best to work alongside law enforcement to protect them.“The USOPC stands firmly behind Team USA athletes and remains committed to their well-being and safety, both on and off the field of play,” it said.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026SkiingWinter OlympicsDonald TrumpUS politicsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

To ensure the pesticide is used safely, the agency said it imposed strong protections and limits on its use.Dicamba is a common weedkiller that can be sprayed on top of genetically engineered crops. It kills the weeds but doesn’t hurt the crops. It has been in use for decades, but it has become more widespread on farms in recent years.Advocates sharply criticized the agency, saying they are moving forward after courts blocked similar efforts in 2020 and 2024. Allowing its use on these two common crops will drastically expand how much is applied and increase harm, advocates say.Kelly Ryerson, an activist with the Make American Healthy Again (Maha) movement that has forged a fragile political allegiance with theTrump administration, said she was disheartened by the decision.“A top priority of mine was to have the use of dicamba for over-the-top applications permanently discontinued because” of their harm, she said. “New restrictions on use are not sufficient, and will perpetuate the chemical treadmill where many farmers are trapped.”The EPA said growers want the weedkiller and they need to be supported – and that it isn’t a Maha versus EPA issue.The agency said concerns about dicamba drifting to places where it was not intended are real and must be managed. It set limits on how much can be applied per acre, how much can be applied on hot days and established buffer zones to prevent harm to nearby crops. If followed, the chemical can be used without threatening humans or the environment, according to EPA.The American Soybean Association applauded the decision, saying clear rules would help farmers prepare for the next growing season and control destructive weeds.Environmental groups said dicamba drift has damaged immense acreage, devastating vegetable farms, trees and other critical plants.“When push comes to shove, this administration is willing to bend over backward to appease the pesticide industry, regardless of the consequences to public health or the environment,” said Nathan Donley, environmental health science director at the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity.Environmentalists said the EPA’s use restrictions are insufficient, allowing application for too much of the time and for too many days of the year. The buffer the agency uses to prevent harm to nearby plants has already proved ineffective, they said.Researchers have been working to better understand its health risks. A 2020 study in the International Journal of Epidemiology found that dicamba exposure was linked to an increased risk for some cancers, including liver cancer and a type of leukemia affecting the blood and bone marrow.Bayer, a manufacturer of dicamba, said the federal registration will allow them to now seek state approvals. They’ll launch training for applicators in the coming weeks.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

I have eaten cold pasta and seen mice scurry behind a table. I don’t go back. Sometimes, when the experience is particularly great, I’ll give a quick good review on Google. But when I have had a bad experience? Never. Ever.I’m not even sure what would provoke me into stopping what I’m doing, taking the time out of my day, logging on to a social site, and then putting the thought into a post with the intention of trashing a small business. It would have to be pretty extreme. So I don’t. And neither should you. Why? Because neither of us knows all the facts.Employers are spreading raises like peanut butter – and workers are paying the price | Gene MarksRead moreWe don’t know the first thing about that person’s business or their life. Maybe staff called out sick that day, or they’ve had a hard time finding workers. Maybe someone in the kitchen made a mistake that one time and undercooked a sausage. Or an exterminator was called that morning and was on the way. Perhaps the business owner is struggling with family issues, cashflow challenges, the death of a friend, a cancer diagnosis. And so what if the owner is protesting ICE or voted for Trump? If you don’t want to patronize the business, then don’t. Telling other people not to is the other – worse – sort of patronizing.Running a small business is hard. Employees don’t show up, customers don’t pay, suppliers don’t deliver, things go wrong. Trashing a small business is easy. It’s also usually fruitless for the small business to respond to these comments. You don’t win or lose an online argument. You just generate more interactions, hate and clicks, which is exactly what the social sites want you to do. And yet, as a business owner, you’re forced to respond because sites like Facebook, TikTok and Instagram continue to be important places to engage customers and promote products for some.Big businesses can afford to weather a social media storm. They have millions – or more – to spend on PR, crisis management, advertising. For a small business, one viral post can be terminal.So next time you’re in a restaurant and the food is good, tell the chef. If the service was delightful, let the owner know. If you’re a fan of the business, keep giving it your money. If you have something positive that you want to share in public, then by all means post that. Tell your friends. But don’t go negative. It’s hard enough running a business. Dealing with an online backlash – deserved or not – can be a major problem for a small business owner. Even if you’re an expert or believe you have all the information you need, you probably don’t. Go ahead, target big corporations. Take on your political opponents. Protest in the streets. There’s plenty of opportunities to let your voice be heard. But leave your local small businesses alone. They’re just trying to make a living and they’re people too.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessSocial mediaRestaurantscommentShareReuse this content"

Japan finished with silver, while host nation Italy claimed bronze.The United States survived a final-day surge from Japan to retain the Olympic team figure skating title on Sunday night, with Ilia Malinin delivering under intense pressure in the men’s free skate to secure gold at the Milano Cortina Games. Japan finished one point behind in silver, while host nation Italy claimed bronze after three days of tightly contested competition.Olympic figure skating music dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan resolved after ISU reviewRead moreThe final standings – 69 points for the United States, 68 for Japan and 60 for Italy – reflected just how narrow the margin was in one of the most dramatic Olympic team events since the format was introduced in 2014. What had begun as a comfortable American lead after two days turned into a head-to-head showdown in the final session, ultimately decided by the sport’s most technically ambitious skater.American hopes had rested heavily on Malinin, the21-year-old two-time world championwho has gone more than two years without losing a competition. But he entered the decisive free skate carrying unusual pressure after a below-par short program on Saturday left the defending champions vulnerable. When Japan erased the remaining US cushion earlier Sunday, the outcome effectively came down to Malinin versus Japan’s Shun Sato in the final discipline.Malinin, who hasbuilt his reputation on pushing the technical ceilingof men’s skating, adjusted his strategy under Olympic pressure. Expected to attempt as many as seven quadruple jumps, he instead delivered five while skating to a cinematic indie-folk compilation of songs with a personal voice-over called The Voice. He opened aggressively with a quad flip, later landing a quad toe loop and quad Salchow in combination passes that steadied the program after early mistakes, including a shaky quad Lutz landing and two planned quads downgraded to triples – among them the much-anticipated quad Axel.Even without his most ambitious layout, Malinin’s technical base value proved the difference. His score of 200.03 points – nearly 40 points below his season best but still comfortably ahead of the field – put him beyond immediate reach. When Sato followed with a clean but less difficult program set to Igor Stravinsky’s The Firebird featuring three quadruple jumps, his 194.86 left Japan just short.The American finished his routine with back-to-back combinations – a quad toe-triple flip followed by a quad Salchow-triple Axel – drawing a roar from a crowd packed with both American and Japanese supporters. It was not perfection by his stratospheric standards, but it was enough.The path to that moment had been anything but straightforward for the United States.Japan’s comeback began in the pairs free skate, where world champions Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara delivered one of the defining performances of the competition. Their routine, which opened with a massive triple twist lift and ended with Kihara raising Miura overhead into their final pose, earned a career-best 155.55 points and pulled Japan sharply back into contention.“We were trying to aim for about 145 or a little bit higher, and when we saw that it was 155, there was so much joy,” Miura said afterward. “We were overwhelmed with emotions.”View image in fullscreenUSA’s Amber Glenn performs on Sunday night.Photograph: Filippo Tomasi/IPA Sport/ipa-agency.net/ShutterstockThe Americans needed stability in that segment and got it from Ellie Kam and Danny O’Shea – the outsiders of a US team stackedwith current world champions in every other discipline– who delivered the best free skate of their partnership when it mattered most. Their program, set to a mash-up including the Eurythmics’ Sweet Dreams and Tears For Fears’ Everybody Wants to Rule the World, scored 135.36 points, limiting the damage by keeping the US ahead of Canada and preventing a larger swing toward Japan.“We walked into the rink with positive emotions, with an offensive attitude,” O’Shea said. “That showed on the ice.”Quad God and the Blade Angels: is the new USA Dream Team a group of figure skaters?Read moreJapan’s momentum continued in the women’s free skate. Kaori Sakamoto produced a commanding performance worth 148.62 points to win the segment and erase the remaining US. lead. The result was compounded when AmericanAmber Glenn, competing in place of world champion Alysa Liu, finished third after multiple mistakes, including a spin-out on her opening triple Axel attempt and a missed combination later in the program.“I feel guilty. I am sorry that I put this kind of pressure on Ilia,” Glenn said afterward. “It wasn’t how I wanted to feel. The adrenaline was really up and I think I just crashed a little bit.”The shift left the two countries tied entering the men’s free skate – though Japan technically held the edge after winning more individual segments across the event.Malinin ultimately delivered the closing performance the United States needed, reinforcing his reputation as the sport’s most reliable high-pressure finisher. The son of former Olympic skaters Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, he has grown up inside elite competition, but Sunday represented his first Olympic moment as the undisputed anchor of a team title defense.The American victory was built across the roster. Ice dance world champions Madison Chock and Evan Bates won both of their segments earlier in the competition, providing critical early points that ultimately proved decisive in the final standings. Teammates have jokingly referred to the married duo as Mr and Mrs America, a nod to their consistency and leadership inside the team environment.The title also carries historical context. The United States were elevated to Olympic team champions from the Beijing Winter Games after Russia were stripped of gold following Kamila Valieva’s doping case, with Japan also moving up to silver. Sunday’s result marked the first time the Americans have defended the title on the ice itself.For Italy, bronze represented a milestone moment. The host nation had never medaled in the team event before, and strong performances throughout the week – including a crowd-pleassemen’s free skate from Matteo Rizzo – allowed them to hold off challengers including Georgia, which finished fourth and are still seeking their first Winter Olympic medal in any sport.In the end, the competition came down to a familiar Olympic equation: technical risk versus execution, depth versus star power, and the ability to deliver in the final moment. On Sunday night, with the title hanging in the balance, Malinin did exactly that – not perfectly, but decisively enough to keep Olympic team gold in American hands.Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsAmber GlennIlia MalininUS sportsShareReuse this content"

TheManchester Citymanager had just witnessed a moment of sheer brilliance and, like everyone connected to his club, he had to fear the worst. Because bad things tend to happen to him at Anfield.The blow had been administered by Dominik Szoboszlai, the stand‑in Liverpool right-back, and it is worth dwelling on it for a moment – if only a moment as it was overtaken rapidly by a bonkers finale. When the Hungarian addressed a free-kick 30 yards out, City did not look overly concerned: they put two men in their wall. Perhaps they had not rememberedwhat Szoboszlai did to Arsenalfrom a similar position at the start of the season.Manchester City must improve to catch Arsenal, says Pep GuardiolaRead moreWhen Szoboszlai cut across the ball with the outside of his right boot, he sent it curling and dipping away from Gianluigi Donnarumma and in off the post. The City goalkeeper did not move. It was a goal that was fit to win any game. Only not this one. At one point during the celebrations, theLiverpooldefender Ibrahima Konaté wandered over with his hands on his head. What had he just seen? Nothing yet, it turned out.City’s Premier League title challenge looked set to turn to dust because they really needed to win to cut the gap tothe leaders, Arsenal, which stood at nine points at kick-off. They had controlled the first half without finding the breakthrough and then, as has been the case so often since the turn of the year, they allowed their opponents to come back into it. Liverpool needed no invitation as they sought a result to fire their push for a Champions League finish. The Kop was rocking. The goal had been advertised.City had made the short journey to Merseyside having won only one in six in the league. When Szoboszlai’s goal flashed in, it was not difficult to imagine the reaction in north London. But City were not finished. The outstanding Bernardo Silva was not. Nor was Erling Haaland. It was the acid test of their nerve and courage. The answer was extraordinary.It was Silva who fashioned the lifeline in the 84th minute. When Rayan Cherki, on as a substitute, sent over a deflected cross, Haaland beat Konaté to head through for Silva, who stretched to lash home. Szoboszlai had played him onside.Guardiola felt the hope return. Then came the indescribable rush, which is probably still being felt by the City support. It was a ball over the top for Matheus Nunes and he got there fractionally ahead of the Liverpool goalkeeper, Alisson, who cleaned him out. It was a penalty, even though the referee, Craig Pawson, took his time before giving it. The Liverpool manager, Arne Slot, suggested he was waiting for some advice via his earpiece. How were Haaland’s nerves? Just fine. When he drove the kick past Alisson, it was the prompt for wild scenes in the visiting enclosure.View image in fullscreenDominik Szoboszlai fouls Erling Haaland to earn a red card.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesImplausibly, there was more. Rayan Aït-Nouri drew a fine save out of Alisson and there were 99 minutes on the clock when Alexis Mac Allister extended Donnarumma at the other end with a deflected shot. Alisson came up for the corner and City survived an almighty scramble, chaos reigning. It gripped even harder when Silva sparked a break.Alisson was still forward and that was when Cherki rolled a low shot – ever so slowly – from the halfway line towards the unguarded goal. Szoboszlai, chasing back, fouled Haaland just outside the area and then the City striker blocked him off and the ball went in.When Pawson picked the bones out of it after being advised to go to the pitchside monitor, he chose to send off Szoboszlai for the first offence, disallow the goal and give City a free‑kick. It was a solution that pleased nobody. Szoboszlai will be banned for the trip to Sunderland on Wednesday.Guardiola wondered whether there would be yet another twist because there was still a tiny bit of time to play. When the full-time whistle finally went, there was joy and relief for him. Guardiola had only his second Anfield win in 11 attempts, the first having come during the fan-free Covid season of 2020-21. More importantly, City’s title dream lived on.Slot said afterwards that he felt anger – and it was not because of how his team played in the first half; the loose passes and heavy touches, the lack of intensity. City dominated the ball, with Silva dictating the tempo from a deep midfield role. That said, they created little of clear-cut note, the big chance coming in the second minute when Silva sent Haaland through. Alisson was out quickly while Milos Kerkez beat Haaland to the second-phase ball.What brought Slot’s blood to the boil was the incident on 69 minutes when Mohamed Salah got in behind Marc Guéhi and felt the City defender pull his shirt just outside the area. It was a clear red card, Slot said. Guéhi got away with yellow. Slot referenced the two big decisions that went against his team in their 3-0 defeat at City last November – the penalty for Jérémy Doku, which Haaland missed, and the disallowed Virgil van Dijk goal. Why were they always going for City?Liverpool were much better in the second half; they found their pressing game and a fistful of decent chances came. Hugo Ekitiké blew the clearest in the 57th minute – a close-range header from Salah’s lovely return ball. It was forgotten when Szoboszlai scored and so was Guéhi’s foul on Salah. Then, everything changed.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLiverpoolManchester Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The American, one of the most successful skiers in history, had come out of a five-year retirement to compete in her fifth Games, and was hoping to become the oldest athlete, male or female, to win a medal in the downhill.Vonn was just 12 seconds into the race when her legs gave way beneath her as she rode a bump. She twisted, fell, and tumbled and, after the first stunned screams and shouts, the crowd all around the mountain fell silent in shock and worry.The USA team confirmed laterthat she was in a “stable condition and in good hands” following surgery after breaking her left leg.Winter Olympics 2026: Vonn crashes out, Johnson set for downhill gold, snowboarding and more – liveRead moreHer teammate Breezy Johnson was in the leader’s seat when Vonn went down. She covered her eyes because she couldn’t watch. Johnson, 30, was forced out of the last Olympic Games in Beijing after she had a bad crash here on this very same slope. She went on to win the gold in 1min 36.10sec, just four hundredths of a second ahead of Germany’s Emma Aicher in second. The home favourite Sofia Goggia, who lit the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony, was third. But the abiding memory of this race will always be the sight of Vonn on a stretcher, being evacuated from the mountain by air ambulance.The crowd broke into applause as it flew away into the bright blue sky, Vonn’s coach told Johnson that Vonn had been cheering for her from the helicopter as it passed. But the atmosphere had changed on the mountain, and everyone’s joy at watching what had been the most eagerly anticipated race of the Games became something more solemn, darkened by the sudden reminder of just how dangerous this sport is. When racing finally resumed, there was another bad accident when Cande Moreno, a 25-year-old from Andorra, collapsed on a turn, and the air ambulance had to be called out for a second time.“It’s tragic, but it’s ski racing I’m afraid,” said Johan Eliasch, chair of the international skiing federation. Vonn knows that better than anyone. Her body, she said herself, was “broken” when she first decided to retire from the sport in 2019. She has had six fractures in the left leg, and another in the right, has broken her right arm, her left arm, and just about every finger. She came out of retirement after a knee replacement surgery last year persuaded her she was fit enough to compete again. And she was, until she crashed again while racing in Switzerland last week, and ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee.View image in fullscreenLindsey Vonn crashes early in her run down the Olimpia delle Tofane piste.Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/APLike every great skier, Vonn’s success turns on her ability to brush right up against the limits of control, and stay there, out on the edge of her capabilities. “It is a critical section, because it’s in the beginning, and you really need a lot of speed coming out of it,” said the Norwegian skier Kajsa Vickhoff Lie, who finished seventh. “It’s super flat after it, so the goal is to be as close to that gate as possible. She really nailed the turn, but she was too close to it, so she was hooked into it. But that’s how it is with the Olympics – you really want to be at the limit, and she was a little bit over the limit.”“My heart aches for her,” Johnson said, “but that’s the madness of this sport, it can hurt you so badly, and you keep coming back for more.”There will be talk about the wisdom of Vonn’s decision to compete here, even though she successfully completed her two training runs on this course before the final. Anyone who asks that, Eliasch said, “doesn’t know Lindsey”. She is a woman who once tried to check herself out of hospital in her hospital gown so she could compete in the downhill after a bad crash at the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. “Whenever I was injured, my internal drive shifted. I decided I could overcome anything, and I could do whatever I set my mind to,” she once wrote, “in those moments, it became about not giving up, fighting through it, and not letting anyone else tell me what to do.”“In the end she risked too much,” the double Olympic champion Tina Maze said, commentating on Eurosport/TNT. “That’s the kind of crash that can happen, of course if you are not healthy the consequences are even worse, but Lindsey wanted to do this no matter what.”No doubt the delay unsettled the racers who came after her. Goggia was the only one of that group of 30 who was able to get within half a second of Johnson’s time. “After Vonn’s fall, I knew the situation wasn’t looking good for me,” Goggia said. “It was very hot, I had been at the start already since almost 11:30 waiting, and my helmet was boiling.”But the overwhelming mood was one of sympathy for one of the great champions of the sport.“She deserved a better ending than that,” said her teammate Isabella Wright, who came 21st, but of course Vonn would say herself that “deserve” doesn’t come into it. Vonn has done things no one else ever has in her sport: she was the first US woman to win an Olympic gold in the downhill, has won the Crystal Globe awarded each year to the world’s leading skier more often than anyone, and was, already, the oldest woman in history to win an Olympic medal in the event, after she won bronze when she was 33 in Pyeongchang in 2018. She is, now, the first woman to race the Olympic downhill in her 40s too.However hard she’s hurting now, the most painful thing of all will be that she didn’t just become the first to finish it, too.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnWinter Olympics 2026SkiingWinter OlympicsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It only ushers the NBA further into the fetid swamp of sports bettingOwen LewisSun 8 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 08.03 ESTShareCouldn’t he have just started a podcast? “The Internet is full of opinions. I decided it was time to make some of my own,” Giannis Antetokounmpo, one of the four best basketball players in the world, postedin a statementannouncing that he was joining the prediction market Kalshi as a shareholder. “We all on Kalshi now.”We are not, but doesn’t the tone sum it up? The universe’s ineffable forces have clearly decided that the ubiquity of sports betting companies is insufficient. There must be new companies, with which you can bet onanyoutcome – Kalshi competitor Polymarket has hosted markets tied to geopolitical outcomes, including scenarios related to Israel and Gaza, for instance – that incentivize people to treat life’s most important avenues as trivially as a sports game. Kalshi and Polymarketare prediction platformsrather than traditional betting companies. Users effectively bet (or “trade”) against others on the platform about the outcome of events, from familiar wagers such as the result of a sporting event, to the obscure, such as the color of a politician’s suit at an election appearance. Kalshi has enjoyed plenty of freedom under the second Donald Trump administration, and Donald Trump Jr is a“strategic advisor” for themandPolymarket.A Kalshi outcome taking betsuntil recently was “Giannis Antetokounmpo’s next team?” as rumors swirled that the two-time NBA MVP was about to leave the Milwaukee Bucks. Antetokounmpo will be involved in marketing and publicity for Kalshi, and is forbidden from trading on markets related to the NBA. The move is also in step with the NBA’s rules – players are allowed to endorse betting companies as long as they don’t gamble on the league itself. But that hasn’t prevented scores of fans acrossInstagramandReddit, and media members onTwitter, from expressing their displeasure at the move and insisting there is a conflict of interest.The NBA jumped into bed with gambling. Now the league is getting its dueRead moreAntetokounmpo seems to be fine with the deal though, and would have you know that jumping in bed with Kalshi is no more complicated thanholding some opinions.For Antetokounmpo, a multimillionaire inking a deal with thiscompany, whoseCEO recently said,“the long-term vision is to financialize everything and create a trading asset out of any difference of opinion,” rather than just about any other company, is apparently no big deal. Nor is the fact that a significant part of Kalshi’s trades are on sports outcomes, and Antetokounmpo is a professional athlete. “We all on Kalshi now.” We are apparently also all in hell.Antetokounmpo has done a fine job ruining what had been a stellar approval rating. He spurred the Milwaukee Bucksto the NBA title in 2021, emerging as a new face of the league. The next year, the Bucks made a respectable run at a title defense by losing to the Boston Celtics in the conference semi-finals in seven games. Game 7 was an unfortunate blowout, but Antetokounmpo put up more staggering numbers across the series. The Bucks were in a good place.Since, though, they can’t stop exiting the playoffs in the first round. The Bucks are 21-29 so far this season; they’ll be lucky to even make the playoffs. Antetokounmpo has played some brilliant basketball but also suffered two non-contact calf injuries, keeping him out of games and making him the latest NBA star onAchilles Watch. Giannis is 31, and barring LeBron James-esque longevity, closer to the end of his career than the beginning. It is obvious to everybody that any winning he does from here on out will have to come on a team besides the Bucks.The past several weeks have seen Antetokounmpo waffle between acknowledging this, which in conjunction with his agent shopping him around to other teams suggested he was on his way out, and acting insulted at the idea that he would leave. It was all very confusing and suggested that Antetokounmpo knew he had to go but didn’t want to be the bad guy.The uncertainty behind Antetokounmpo’s future was almost certainly down to legitimate basketball reasons: teams’ willingness to trade or how much the Bucks wanted to keep their superstar. And, in any case, Antetokounmpo is forbidden from trading on theNBAwith Kalshi. But perception trumps reality among NBA fans. And now it isimpossiblefor many of them to reflect on Antetokounmpo’s future without his Kalshi stock front of mind. Every time Giannis turns in a performance, or even a play, that deviates from expectations, it may raise suspicion over whether he was trying to move Kalshi’s prediction lines. Or others could speculate he whipped up rumors of a trade so that gamblers would flock to Kelshi to bet on his future.But perhaps what’s perhaps most depressing is that Antetokounmpo isn’t a remarkable case here. This news comes at a time when James isa DraftKings ambassadorand Kevin Durantcashes checks from FanDuel. When watching a big game, regardless of league, odds are you won’t be able to avoid a deluge of over-under lines and parlays from commentators and social media accounts. Prior to joining ESPN, the NBA’s foremost news-breaker Shams Charania unintentionally moved abetting line with a misleading tweetwhile co-hosting a show for FanDuel. Many NBA-focused outlets – notably The Ringerand its large fleet of podcasts– are sponsored by a betting company, which could create a conflict of interest even in the coverage of gambling scandals. League commissioner Adam Silver has given tepid quotes in favor of more regulation but has largely welcomed sports gambling since arguing for its legalization in the New York Times in 2014. Then there are even more serious incidents. At the start of the season, the Miami Heat’s Terry Rozierwas arrestedfor allegedly using inside information about NBA players to manipulate prop bets.The NBAis infested with betting companiesand ripe for yet another scandal.Wagering away your life savings has never been easier: just reach into your back pocket, open a fiercely addictive app striving for your attention, and click away. But gambling has become so ubiquitous that we decided somewhere along the way that this problem doesn’t matter, or is better ignored. The secondary problem with rampantly available gambling is the incentivization of rigging outcomes, and the constant suspicion even in absence of a scandal. Sports are meaningful enough to define the lives of players and fans alike, but all that love and time rests on the strength of the idea that what we are watching is real.

On Sunday, she made history of her ownBryan Armen Grahamin MilanSun 8 Feb 2026 17.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 18.20 ESTShareFor years, Breezy Johnson wastheotherAmerican alpine skier. The one with the near-misses, the injuries, the suspension and the unfortunate timing to exist in the same stable at the same time asLindsey VonnandMikaela Shiffrin. On Sunday, three weeks after her 30th birthday in the shadow of the Dolomites above Cortina d’Ampezzo, she became an Olympic champion.Johnsoncrossed first in the women’s downhillat the Milano Cortina Games by four-hundredths of a second – the slightest winning margin in the event’s Olympic history outsidethe dead heat in 2014– to become just the second American woman to win the sport’s most prestigious title. The only other was Vonn, who took gold in Vancouver 16 years ago.Johnson’s winning time of 1min 36.10sec held off Germany’s Emma Aicher, earning the United States their first medal of these Olympics. Four-hundredths of a second isn’t much time at all: the blink of a camera shutter, the wingbeat of a hummingbird, the durationof Muhammad Ali’s phantom punch. But on a sun-splashed morning, it was enough to lift the skier from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, into winter sports immortality.The extraordinary result came in a race that took on a sudden gravity almost as quickly as it began. Johnson was seated in the leader’s chair when Vonn – attempting an audacious medal bidaged 41 with a nonexistent ACL– crashed barely 13 seconds into her run and was airlifted off the mountain, leaving the race suspended and the atmosphere shaken. When the race resumed after nearly a half hour, Johnson’s marker held up for 31 more racers. And when the last of them was done, so was something else: the long, winding arc of a career that has rarely followed a straight line.For most of her career, Johnson has existed slightly out of frame: respected among her peers since a pair of top-14 finishes on her Olympic debut as a 22-year-old in 2018, but dwarfed by the gravitational pull of global superstar teammates like Vonn and Shiffrin, who have won a combined 192 races on alpine skiing’s top flight. Johnson’s win count since joining the World Cup circuit 11 years ago: a grand total of zero. But she is now, improbably, both the world champion and Olympic champion in the most chaotic discipline of them all.Lindsey Vonn’s crash is violent but honest ending to an unprecedented Olympic bidRead moreShe learned the sport in the American west, growing up near the south-eastern Idaho town of Victor (population: 2,157), and training across the state line in the steep-chute playground of Jackson Hole. Weeknights meant icy, floodlit sessions at Snow King Mountain. Weekends meant powder days at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. She grew up idolizing Bode Miller and later admired Vonn and Julia Mancuso, skiers defined as much by their tenacity as by trophies.Even her name sounds like something from a ski-town origin story. “Breezy” was borrowed from her grandmother’s neighbor and later made legally official from her birth name, Breanna, in what now feels like a grace note of nominative destiny.Her path to the top of the Olympic podium has rarely been smooth. In 2022, she crashed on this same Cortina course during training and tore cartilage in her knee, forcing her to miss the Beijing Games. The loss lingered. She later spoke about not fully trusting that the Olympics were real until she crossed a finish line.Then came another setback. In 2024, Johnsonserved a 14-month suspensionafter missing three anti-doping whereabouts tests in a year, a violation that can carry stiff penalties even when no banned substances are involved. She returned determined to rebuild her form and confidence, winninga shock world championship gold in downhillin 2025 (and adding a second in the team combined). By the time she arrived in Cortina last week, she was no longer chasing validation but opportunity. “I was telling my mom, you go to your first Olympic Games to have been to the Olympic Games,” Johnson said. “You go to your second Olympic Games to win a medal. And you go to your third Games to win the whole damn thing.”Downhill skiing is often described as controlled falling, where athletes accelerate to highway speeds while navigating terrain that punishes even a trace of hesitation. Johnson’s winning run on Sunday was defined by pace and precision rather than spectacle: clean lines, minimal correction, the kind of gliding down the piste that looks almost calm until you understand the forces involved.Wearing the No 6 bib, Johnson seized control of the contest before most of the field had even gone off, posting a time more than a second faster than any of the five skiers before her. A brief wobble high on the course – near the opening Schuss, a 64% gradient chute hemmed in by rock walls – threatened to interrupt the run before she recovered to reach a top speed of 80.2mph (129kph) in the second section. What followed was a study in controlled momentum: speed carried cleanly off the jumps, a quick return to her tuck, and a descent that gathered time rather than surrendered it. The result was a victory measured in hundredths but built over years. “I knew I had to push, I knew I had to go harder than I did in training,” Johnson said after the race. “I had to be super clean, and I felt like I did that.”View image in fullscreenBreezy Johnson poses with silver medalist Emma Aicher (left) of Germany and bronze medalist Sofia Goggia of Italy.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockJohnson, already shaken by Vonn’s crash, became misty-eyed as the final racers finished before the waterworks finally burst while she mouthed the words of the Star-Spangled Banner atop the podium. Her US teammates called it the best run they had ever seen from her. For Johnson, it represented something nearer to closure. The course that had once dashed her Olympic dream now completed it.Her story also offers something different for a broader audience. She is not the prodigy who dominated from youth, nor the superstar who lived permanently in the spotlight. Instead, she represents a quieter version of sporting excellence: one built on recovery, persistence and timing. In a sport where careers can be ended by a single bad landing, Johnson endured multiple knee injuries, fractures, surgeries and a suspension that she said made her “feel like a criminal”. She rebuilt herself physically and, by her own account, mentally. Ski racing, she once said, is “a beautiful and brutal sport”. That duality was never more apparent than on an emotionally charged Sunday in the Dolomites.“People are jealous of people with Olympic gold medals,” she said near the finish area. “They’re not necessarily jealous of the journey it took to get those medals. I don’t think my journey is something that people are envious of. It’s been a tough road, but sometimes you just have to keep going because that’s the only option. If you’re going through hell, you keep walking.”The Olympics often elevate familiar heroes. Sometimes they introduce the world to new ones. Johnson’s victory felt like both a generational handoff and a reminder that elite sport is often decided not just by talent, but by survival and perseverance. “It’s a tough road and it’s a tough sport,” Johnson said. “I think that that’s the beauty and the madness of it. That it can hurt you so badly but you keep coming back for more.”For one morning, the math was simple: four-hundredths of a second. A lifetime of work. And a downhill racer who finally stepped out from the long shadow cast by American skiing’s biggest names and into history of her own.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026US sportsWinter OlympicsLindsey VonnMikaela ShiffrinSkiingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Azerbaijani officials reject the term, saying it implies territorial claims over land internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but contested over decades of conflict between the two countries.The committeesaid in a statementthe use of the song would introduce political messaging into Olympic competition and risk violating Olympic Charter principles requiring political neutrality at the Games.“The Olympic Games are a symbol of peace, friendship and mutual respect between peoples,” the committee said. “It is unacceptable to use this platform for political and separatist propaganda purposes.”Thelisting on the ISU websitefor the pair skating short program now identifies the music as “Music by Ara Gevorgyan”, rather than naming the composition itself, according to the federation’s published music registry for the 2025-26 season.Music selections in Olympic figure skating are typically submitted and approved through technical and governance processes overseen by the ISU, though disputes involving political symbolism can extend beyond sport governance structures.Late changes to Olympic programs can carry significant competitive consequences. Last week, Spain’s Tomàs-Llorenç Guarino Sabaténarrowly avoided having to redesign his Olympic short programafter resolving a copyright dispute that had threatened his ability to use music from the Minions franchise. Coaches and athletes say changing music late in the Olympic cycle can force skaters to rework choreography refined over months in a sport where musical timing and muscle memory are inseparable.People familiar with the discussions said the complaint was initially directed to the IOC rather than through sport governance channels and that the issue was subsequently addressed through discussions involving the relevant Olympic authorities.The IOC did not respond to requests for comment.View image in fullscreenArmenia’s Karina Akopova, front, and Nikita Rakhmanin compete in the pair free skating during September’s ISU Skate to Milano figure skating qualifier in Beijing.Photograph: Adek Berry/AFP/Getty ImagesAkopova and Rakhmanin are scheduled to compete in the pairs short program on 15 February, with the free skate set for 16 February. The Russian-born partners – who were already dating when they formed their partnership in 2020 – later chose to represent Armenia through Akopova’s family roots, framing their Olympic appearance as both a personal comeback and a milestone moment for the country’s skating program.The duo only returned to international competition last season after more than two years away because of injury and the waiting period required after switching national representation. They secured Armenia’s first Olympic berth in pair skating since 2002 at the final qualifying event in Beijing, finishing second in a field where only three quota places were available.Azerbaijan will be represented in Olympic figure skating by a single male skater competing in a separate discipline, meaning athletes from the two countries will not face each other directly in competition.The episode comes three months after Armenia and Azerbaijansigned a US-brokered peace agreementaimed at normalizing relations after decades of conflict, though disputes tied to Nagorno-Karabakh remain sensitive. The situation also underscores how geopolitical tensions continue to surface around the Olympic movement despite longstanding rules intended to keep political conflicts out of competition.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Figure skatingNagorno-KarabakhArmeniaAzerbaijanEuropeWinter OlympicsShareReuse this content"

Lindsey Vonn was 13th to push out of the start gate on Sunday in Cortina d’Ampezzo knowing exactly what she was racing with:a fully ruptured anterior cruciate ligamentin her left knee, a heavy brace wrapped around the joint, and the accumulated wear of a career spent flirting with speed and consequence.Vonn barely made it out of the opening phase of the run.Not 13 seconds into her descent, under bright late-morning sunshine on the Olimpia delle Tofane, the 41‑year‑old Americanappeared to clipher right pole on a gate. The contact was subtle, almost imperceptible at full speed, but catastrophic in effect. She lost her balance, lurched violently to the right, twisted awkwardly in the air and landed hard on her side before being pitched backward down the piste.Lindsey Vonn airlifted to hospital after crashing out of Olympic downhill raceRead moreOn the television coverage, her screams could be heard over the course microphones as she slid to a stop along the side of the run. In the finish area, the noise dissipated from the crowd of thousands gathered at the Tofane Alpine Centre. Teammates watching the big screen in clusters froze.Breezy Johnson, the reigning world champion who had just set the fastest time – 0.04 seconds clear of Germany’s Emma Aicher – covered her eyes and turned away. Nearby, Vonn’s sister, watching from the bottom, stood motionless, her face drained of color.Within seconds, the race was stopped. Medical staff reached Vonn as she lay on the course, and within minutes a helicopter was called. The delay stretched toward half an hour as she was stabilized, strapped into a stretcher and winched into the air – the second time in nine days she had left a racecourse by helicopter,after crashing in Crans‑Montana, Switzerland, the week before. As the aircraft lifted away, the crowd broke from their stunned silence into sustained applause.Just like that, the Olympic downhill Vonn had spent two years trying to reach, and six years believing she might never see again, was over. But the deeper truth is that the meaning ofthis comebackwas never going to be found in the finishing order anyway.Vonn did not arrive in Cortina chasing a storybook ending. If anything, she spent the past year dismantling the idea that this return needed to be measured in medals or podiums or the tidy narrative closure preferred by journalists and rights holders. Again and again, she framed it in simpler, harder terms: showing up in the start gate and trying, even when the odds – age, injury, history, simple biology – suggested she probably shouldn’t.“The odds are stacked against me with my age, no ACL, and a titanium knee,” she said before the race. “But I still believe.”That self-belief was never really about winning. It was about proving that the version of herself built over two decades on the World Cup circuit still existed somewhere inside a body that had, by any reasonable sporting metric, already given more than enough.View image in fullscreenLindsey Vonn had won a record 12 World Cup races at Cortina.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersFor nearly six years, that career was over. Vonn’s right knee, rebuilt multiple times, required a partial titanium replacement in 2024. The surgery was meant to restore quality of life. Instead, it reopened a door she had assumed was closed for ever.And when she came back, she did not return for a participation trophy. She came backfast. This season alone, she reached the podiumin all five World Cup downhillsshe entered, winning twice and seizing the red bib as the discipline’s season-long leader. Then came the crash in Crans‑Montana. Then the MRI. Then the decision that defined the final act of her career. “My knee is not swollen,” she said last week. “With the help of a brace, I am confident I can compete.”There is something uniquely unforgiving about downhill skiing. There is no easing into it, no way to negotiate with gravity once you push out of the gate. It is not a sport that rewards nostalgia or sentiment or narrative symmetry. It does not care about legacy arcs or redemption stories or emotional neatness.Cortina – the place that defined Vonn’s greatness more than any other, where she won a record 12 World Cup races, the rare track where her technical gifts, appetite for risk and competitive psychology were in perfect alignment – offered no special treatment on Sunday. That is not cruelty, but simply the fundamental honesty of the sport she chose.Before the race, Vonn said: “I can’t guarantee a good result. But I can guarantee I will give it everything I have.”Winter Olympics 2026: Vonn crashes out, Johnson wins downhill gold, snowboarding and more – liveRead moreOn Sunday, she did exactly that. And in time, that may be what outlasts the crash itself. Because elite sport rarely allows athletes to author their own endings. Most are written gradually: through decline, injury or the slow realization that the gap between who you were and who you are has become too large to reconcile. “She always goes 110%, there’s never anything less,” Vonn’s sister told NBC Sports. “Sometimes things just happen.”Vonn resisted that erosion longer than almost anyone in her discipline ever has. She did it not by pretending she was still invincible, but by insisting that trying still mattered.The inevitable debate about whether she should have raced began while Vonn was still lying on the side of the course. Whether the risk was proportionate to the reward. Whether this was courage or stubbornness or something complicated and human in between. But none of those arguments really change what this comeback ultimately represented.In the end, the mountain does not remember who you were. It only measures who you are in that single moment between the start gate and the finish line. On Sunday,Lindsey Vonnaccepted that bargain one more time. In a sport built on confronting risk rather than avoiding it, that may be as honest an ending as any champion is allowed.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hess said representing the US at the 2026 Winter Olympics brought up “mixed emotions” and that it was “a little hard.”The world heard JD Vance being booed at the Olympics. Except for viewers in the US | Bryan Armen GrahamRead more“There’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren’t,” he said. “I think for me it’s more I’m representing my friends and family back home, the people that represented it before me, all the things that I believe are good about the US … Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the US.”Trump made his ire clear on Sunday, characterizing Hess’s comments as saying: “he doesn’t represent his Country in the currentWinter Olympics. If that’s the case, he shouldn’t have tried out for the team, and it’s too bad he’s on it. Very hard to root for someone like this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”Trump’s critique follows that of Tennessee Republican representative Tim Burchett, who said in a post on X that Hess should “shut up and go play in the snow.”Hess is one of a handful of Team USA Olympians who have expressed discomfort with representing their country in its current state, and who have then been the recipient of criticism afterward.US figure skating national champion Amber Glenn said she’d be taking a break from all social media after being inundated with what she called “a scary amount of hate/threats.”Glenn, who came out publicly in 2019, was asked how it feels to be part of the LGBTQ community under the Trump administration.“It’s been a hard time for the community overall and this administration,” Glenn said. “It isn’t the first time that we’ve had to come together as a community and try and fight for our human rights.”While not specifically mentioning Trump’s policies, two-time Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrinread a quote from Nelson Mandelaexpressing hope that “we can all flourish regardless of race, color, creed, religion, gender, class, caste or any other social markers of difference” when asked about representing the US in the current political climate. She then added her own words: “For me, as this related to the Olympics, I really hope to show up and represent my own values. Of diversity, and kindness, and sharing. Tenacity, work ethic, showing up with my team every single day.”The US Olympic & Paralympic Committee said on Sunday that it is aware of abusive and harmful messages directed toward athletes and is doing its best to work alongside law enforcement to protect them.“The USOPC stands firmly behind Team USA athletes and remains committed to their well-being and safety, both on and off the field of play,” it said.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026SkiingWinter OlympicsDonald TrumpUS politicsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is that audiences will start assuming anything they do not show is being hiddenSat 7 Feb 2026 21.19 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 17.58 ESTShareThe modern Olympics sell themselves on a simple premise: the whole world, watching the same moment, at the same time. On Friday night in Milan, that illusion fractured in real time.When Team USA entered San Siro during the parade of nations, the speed skater Erin Jackson led the delegation into a wall of cheers. Moments later, when cameras cut to US vice-president JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance, large sections of the crowd responded with boos. Not subtle ones, but audible and sustained ones.Canadian viewers heard them. Journalists seated in the press tribunes in the upper deck,myself included, clearlyheard them. But as I quickly realized from a groupchat with friends back home, American viewerswatching NBC did not.NBC appears to cut crowd’s booing of JD Vance from Winter Olympics broadcastRead moreOn its own, the situation might once have passed unnoticed. But the defining feature of the modern sports media landscape is that no single broadcaster controls the moment any more. CBC carried it. The BBC liveblogged it.Fans clipped it. Within minutes, multiple versions of the same happening were circulating online – some with boos, some without – turning what might once have been a routine production call into a case study in information asymmetry.For its part,NBC has deniedediting the crowd audio, although it is difficult to resolve why the boos so audible in the stadium and on other broadcasts were absent for US viewers. But in a broader sense, it is becoming harder, not easier, to curate reality when the rest of the world is holding up its own camera angles. And that raises an uncomfortable question as the United States moves toward hosting two of the largest sporting events on the planet: the 2026 men’s World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.If a US administration figure is booed at the Olympics in Los Angeles, or a World Cup match in New Jersey or Dallas, will American domestic broadcasts simply mute or avoid mentioning the crowd audio? If so, what happens when the world feed, or a foreign broadcaster, shows something else entirely? What happens when 40,000 phones in the stadium upload their own version in real time?The risk is not just that viewers will see through it. It is that attempts to manage the narrative will make American broadcasters look less credible, not more. Because the audience now assumes there is always another angle. Every time a broadcaster makes that trade – credibility for insulation – it is a trade audiences eventually notice.There is also a deeper structural pressure behind decisions like this. The Trump era has been defined in part by sustainedhostility toward media institutions. Broadcasters do not operate in a vacuum; they operate inside regulatory environments, political climates and corporate risk calculations. When presidents and their allies openly threaten or target networks, it is naive to pretend that has no downstream effect on editorial choices – especially in high-stakes live broadcasts tied to billion-dollar rights deals.But there is a difference between contextual pressure and visible reality distortion. When global audiences can compare feeds in real time, the latter begins to resemble something else entirely: not editorial judgment, but narrative management. Which is why comparisons to Soviet-style state-controlled broadcasting models – once breathless rhetorical exaggerations – are starting to feel less hyperbolic.The irony is that the Olympics themselves are built around the idea that sport can exist alongside political tension without pretending it does not exist. The International Olympic Committee’s own language – athletes should not be punished for governments’ actions – implicitly acknowledges that governments are part of the Olympic theater whether organizers like it or not.Friday night illustrated that perfectly. American athletes were cheered, their enormous contingent given one of the most full-throated receptions of the night. The political emissaries were not universally welcomed. Both things can be true at once. Crowd dissent is not a failure of the Olympic ideal. In open societies, it is part of how public sentiment is expressed. Attempting to erase one side of that equation risks flattening reality into something audiences no longer trust. And if Milan was a warning shot, Los Angeles is the main event.Since Donald Trump’s first term, American political coverage around sport has fixated on the micro-moments: Was the president booed or cheered? Did the broadcast show it? Did he attend or skip events likely to produce hostile crowds? The discourse has often felt like a Rorschach test, filtered through partisan interpretation and selective clips.The LA Olympics will be something else entirely. There is no hiding from an opening ceremony for Trump. No ducking a stadium when the Olympic Charter requires the host country’s head of state to officially declare the Games open. No controlling how 200 international broadcasters carry the moment.If Trump is still in the White House on 14 July 2028, one month after his 82nd birthday and in the thick of another heated US presidential campaign, he will stand in front of a global television audience as a key part of the opening ceremony. He will do so in California, in a political environment far less friendly than many domestic sporting venues he has appeared in over the past decade. And he will do it in a city synonymous with the political opposition, potentially in the back yard ofthe Democratic presidential candidate.There will be some cheers. There will almost certainly be boos. There will be everything in between. And there will be no way to make them disappear. The real risk for American broadcasters is not that dissent will be visible. It is that audiences will start assuming anything they do not show is being hidden.

What has changed is not the politics. It is the impossibility of containing the optics.Milan may ultimately be remembered as a small moment – a few seconds of crowd noise during a long ceremony. But it also felt like a preview of the next phase of global sport broadcasting: one where narrative control is shared, contested and instantly verifiable. The world is watching. And this time, it is also recording.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsJD VanceNBCUS television industryTelevision industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Officials reviewed the play and determined time was left, so fans had to be cleared for Duke to get one final play before storming the court again when the clock officially hit zero.Tuskegee basketball coach ‘violated’ after being handcuffed by police at end of gameRead more“For me it’s hard to talk about the game when I was most concerned just for the safety of our players after the game,” Scheyer said in his opening statement. “I don’t want to make it about that, because Carolina, they played a great game to win. And that’s a heartbreaking loss for our team.“I got staff members that got punched in the face. My family, pushing people away, trying to not get trampled. That’s not what this game is about.”Afterward, Cunningham said he apologized to Scheyer before he came in for this postgame news conference and referenced someone being injured. He didn’t have details on who was injured or how. In a text message to The Associated Press and other outlets, Duke’s program spokesperson Kyle Serba said one person tied to the program had been injured but offered no additional details, citing the individual’s privacy.“When they rushed the court, a number of people got knocked over,” Cunningham said. “But then we had to clear the court again. So when we normally have something like just rushing the court and the game is over, we do have a line by the benches to get people off safely.“Obviously, if somebody got injured, that’s just really, really disappointing. We’ll do the best we can to make sure that doesn’t happen, but again, my apologies to Duke for that.”Cunningham said the school would look at video replays to determine exactly what happened.The safety of players and team staffers during court storming has been a long-running topic of concern in college athletics. That included roughly two years ago after Duke’s loss at Wake Forest, when Blue Devils player Kyle Filipowski was shaken up after a Demon Deacons fan collided with him, while Jared McCain’s exit to the tunnel was briefly blocked by a Wake Forest fan. Filipowski had his right leg wrapped in plastic to fasten an ice bag to his kneecap afterward.Air Force suspends men’s basketball coach amid investigation into treatment of cadet-athletesRead moreIn the immediate aftermath of that 2024 incident, Scheyer asked: “When are we going to ban court-storming?”Asked Saturday night if he still feels court-storming should be banned, Scheyer said: “I think court-storming is fine, I don’t have any issue with court-storming.“Just shouldn’t have people getting punched in the face. Shouldn’t put our players in position where they’re face-to-face with people who can do anything at that time. It just takes one reaction. Even today, I had to push people away just to try to protect our players.“They won, they should celebrate,” Scheyer added. “They want to court-storm, court-storm. But just let’s get our guys off safely, that’s it. That’s where I’m at with that.”Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Bond was not immediately set on all the charges.The Falcons said in a statement they are aware of the arrest.“We are aware of an incident involving James Pearce Jr in Miami,” the Falcons said in a statement provided to the Associated Press. “We are in the process of gathering more information and will not have any further comment on an open legal matter at this time.”WPLG TV in Miami reported Doral Police Chief Edwin Lopez confirmed the dispute was between Pearce and Jackson, a forward for the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks.

Trolling has replaced meaning with noise | Lee EscobedoRead moreScottsdale police said officers responded around 4.30pm on Friday to assist PGA Tour staff and tournament security as Doherty was trespassed from the event.Police said the trespass decision was made by PGA Tour officials and that officers were present to support security if Doherty refused to leave the property. Police did not issue a citation, written trespass notice or make an arrest.“The WM Phoenix Open is a bucket-list event with one of the most unique fan experiences in all of sport,” a tour spokesperson said. “The PGA Tour and the Thunderbirds are committed to protecting the integrity of the competition and providing an exceptional experience for all fans. Disruptive fan behavior will not be tolerated and anyone violating the Fan Code of Conduct is subject to immediate ejection.“We appreciate the swift action of tournament security and local law enforcement to identify and address disruptive behavior.”View image in fullscreenJack Doherty attends the Jake Paul v Anthony Joshua fight at Miami’s Kaseya Center in December.Photograph: Lauren Caulk/The GuardianDoherty, a 22-year-old streamer known for filming confrontational public pranks, with titles including “I crashed into a cop car” and “I got banned from Disney”, has amassed a large online following through high-energy stunt and reaction livestreams, content that platform algorithms often amplify because it generates strong engagement through confrontation and unpredictability.He was removed from the tournament grounds after appearing to encourage a spectator to shout as Mackenzie Hughes attempted to play out of a bunker, according to online videos. Security staff quickly moved in to identify those involved and remove them from the area.Some outlets and social media posts later claimed Doherty, who has nearly 30 million subscribers across YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Kick, had been issued a lifetime ban from PGA Tour events. The tour has not publicly confirmed the scope or duration of any restriction.Hughes later suggested the interruption had little impact, saying security responded quickly and that while such moments are unwelcome, crowd behaviour at the Phoenix Open has occasionally tested the boundaries of golf’s traditional etiquette.Footage circulating online also appeared to show a tournament official informing Doherty that he would not be permitted to attend future PGA Tour events.The Waste Management Phoenix Open, staged annually at TPC Scottsdale and by some distance golf’s best-attended tournament, is one of the most raucous stops on the PGA Tour calendar. Much of that reputation is tied to the stadium-style 16th hole, where thousands of fans pack grandstands in an atmosphere closer to a football game than a traditional golf tournament. In 2024gates were temporarily closed and alcohol sales briefly haltedbecause of overcrowding.The episode underscores a broader challenge facing professional sports leagues as venues balance open fan access with an era in which spectators can instantly broadcast and monetise interactions from inside events. While fan filming has long been common, some leagues have begun reviewing policies around livestreaming, harassment and behaviour designed specifically to generate viral content.The shift has surfaced elsewhere in professional sport, including recent incidents at WNBA gamesin which sex toys were thrown on to the court.The tournament’s general manager declined to provide additional comment beyond the PGA Tour’s statement.Explore more on these topicsGolfPGA TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

No one making their way towards the Turf batted an eyelid, but then again, for five years now, a touch of Hollywood has become pretty much the norm inWrexham.Ninety minutes before kick-off the city’s most famous public house was heaving. Lying in the shadow of the Racecourse Ground, it is the watering hole of choice for locals, and, thanks to landlord Wayne Jones’s prominent role inWelcome to Wrexham, the hit documentary following the club’s many fortunes, a tourist attraction.Championship roundup: Coventry held by Oxford; squirrel delays play at HullRead moreThe way the pub is now – a thriving establishment, packed with happy faces and vibrating with contented nattering – is symbolic of the meteoric shift that has occurred since Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac (previously McElhenney) paid £2m to become the football club’s guardians half a decade ago on Monday.It was a business, community and club, desperate for a lifeline, some sunshine, a boost. Post takeover, all involved have gotten that and then some.As Jones spoke from the Turf’s single file entrance, he politely broke off to greet those he knows well and newbies wanting to say hello. He is grateful as a businessman that the customers flow as freely as the pints, but Wrexham’s on field success is more important.The club is “in my DNA, like it is thousands of supporters”, he said. “It has been a very quirky, very interesting five years. So far, so good.” Underplaying it much, Wayne?On the night Reynolds and Mac’s purchase was announced, Wrexham earned three points against Altrincham at FC United of Manchester’s Broadhurst Park. As a result, they moved into the National League’s playoff spots. A mere 1,459 days later they are in the Championship’s top six despite this disappointing 2-0 defeat by Millwall.View image in fullscreenJosh Coburn celebrates scoring Millwall’s second goal against Wrexham.Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PAUnsatisfactory, yes, but the odd bump will not get fans such as Peter Cheshire too down. A regular since 1968, and an ever-present at home and away this season, the now, as opposed to 2021’s then, remains scarcely believable for Cheshire. “It has changed my life,” he said. He was not being hyperbolic.“It has helped my mental health. I suffer from depression and that has changed a lot since the takeover. I’m happier here [in the ground], which makes me happier when I go to work.”The project has not been without its blips. First, they missed out on the playoffs in 2020-21, before losing in the semi-finals 12 months later. By then, any initial local scepticism had melted, replaced by the warmest of embraces.For Cheshire, the doubts were erased within the early months when it became clear Reynolds and Mac would invest on the field, in the men’s and women’s teams, and off it. To emphasise the point, he gazed across to the work on a new Kop stand that will open in 2027.View image in fullscreenMillwall manager Alex Neil (left) and Wrexham’s Phil Parkinson shake hands before the match.Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PASince those early disappointments, Wrexham have achieved promotion, after promotion, after promotion. An unprecedented triple jump. A fourth in a row, and with it the Premier League, could be 18 games away.That has always been the aim and stating so draws far less laughter now than it did when all this began. Wrexham have global reach, blue chip sponsors and A-listers such as Channing Tatum and Will Ferrell dropping in for the odd game.Yet there are plenty of reminders that humility trumps all. First-team players change at the ground, make their way to training in their own cars, before returning to shower, lunch and gym. Not out of the ordinary below the Football League, but certainly more unusual in the Championship.Then there is managing the limited on-site space, which has some staff feeling as if they are playing a constant game of human Tetris. Indeed, the CEO, Michael Williamson, who, among other roles, spent four-and-a-half years in key positions at Inter, works from a room that legally compliant landlords would not be able to offer up as a bedroom.Success has brought with it envy. Way back when the club was still punching its way out of non-league football (a whole three years), it was a fairytale story for some, something to delight in. Wholesome. Quaint. Unthreatening.View image in fullscreenA Wrexham sticker at the SToK Cae Ras.Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PABut now little old Wrexham are a couple of sound left-right combos from being a top-flight team, there is much sneering. Some would have you believe that Reynolds and Mac were the first to introduce money to football. In any case, the outcome of that particular match is not always matrimony.Wrexham’s manager, Phil Parkinson, who succeeded Dean Keates in July 2021, does not get the credit he deserves. It is all very well, as Wrexham did last summer, buying 13 players for around £30m, but weaving so many new strands into something coherent takes some doing.Parkinson has managed it successfully and will doubtless do so again with January arrivals Davis Keillor-Dunn, Bailey Cadamarteri and Zak Vyner. “I thought we’d survive this season, but down the bottom end,” Cheshire says.“It’s about moments,” Parkinson said. He and Wrexham have had plenty of those.This article was amended on 8 February 2026. Welcome to Wrexham is not a Netflix documentary as an earlier version said.

This stadium has tormented the City manager more often than most over the past decade but, should the title race twist as dramatically as this victory, his 11th and possibly final visit to Liverpool will be cherished as the turning point.Was Guardiola’s kiss one of thanks for Gianluigi Donnarumma, the goalkeeper whodeflated Liverpool in the Champions Leaguelast season with Paris Saint‑Germain and denied them a 99th-minute equaliser with a stunning save from Alexis Mac Allister? Or for the nerveless precision of Erling Haaland, who had completed the visitors’ comeback from the penalty spot six minutes earlier? The resilience of Marc Guéhi and co in the face of Liverpool’s second-half recovery merited a smacker, too. The former Liverpool transfer target would eventually get a kiss from his manager, deservedly so.Manchester City keep up title chase with late comeback win at LiverpoolRead moreHowever, Guardiola’s reaction, his sheer relief, told a bigger story: that City’s race is not yet run. Arsenal’s evening mirrored Dominik Szoboszlai’s – from ecstasy to despair in the blink of a remarkable finale. In the 74th minute, whenSzoboszlai repeated his impact against Arsenaland swept a 30-yard free-kick into the Kop goal, the league leaders were nine points clear and the obituaries were bring written for City. By the 93rd it was down to six points and by the 100th, with Liverpool down to 10 men, City had saved the title race at a ground where they last won in front of a crowd in 2003.Guardiola’s only previous Premier League win here had come behind closed doors during the Covid pandemic. He had endured defeat here six times. And now this. A result worthy of sending a kiss to the heavens.Amid the maelstrom at Anfield there was a composure and experience to City to support their manager’s view that anything can happen over the final 13 league games. From Bernardo Silva to Rodri to Donnarumma, there were defining contributions from players who know what it takes to get over the line. Guéhi belonged in their company. Arne Slot felt the City defender should have been sent off at 0-0 for a shirt pull on Mohamed Salah but also, pointedly, remarked on what “a good signing” he is for Guardiola’s team.Guéhi was treated like some kind of ex-Liverpool villain as Anfield booed his every touch in a City shirt. It was a mystifying reception in many respects. To recap: he wasdenied a move to Liverpoolby Crystal Palace last summer after undergoing a medical and doing club media to announce the transfer. He then joined the only club who made an offer for him in January. Liverpool signed Jeremy Jacquet for £60m instead. The only possible explanation for the boos was Guéhi’s assertion, upon signing for City, that he was “now atthe best club in England”. That would rankle Liverpool whether they were reigning champions or not.View image in fullscreenGianluigi Donnarumma denied Liverpool a point with an outstanding 99th-minute save from Alexis Mac Allister.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAThe Kop could not deny that Guéhi was part of the better team in the first half at Anfield, however, nor that his defending was cause for envy. The England international was unfazed by the noise around him during a first 45 minutes in which the biggest threat to City came from City themselves, and their risky strategy of playing out through Donnarumma. Even Guardiola did not appear on board with the tactic at times and berated his goalkeeper for his distribution on a few occasions.Guéhi’s first serious test came when Florian Wirtz released Hugo Ekitiké with a pinpoint pass from deep. The defender was across quickly to block the in-form striker’s path, stand tall, and then smother the shot. There was also a vital block from Guéhi to deny Wirtz’s goal-bound shot in the second half and interception when Curtis Jones almost put Salah through on goal late on. But, like everyone else in sky blue, the composure of the £20m recruit was shaken by Liverpool’s vast improvement after the interval.It was the response that Anfield demanded and Slot needed after a passive, error-strewn first-half display that offered the initiative to City. Against a more aggressive and braver Liverpool team the visitors were ruffled, and Guéhi was finally beaten when Szoboszlai slipped a pass into Salah. The defender pulled the Egypt international to the ground by his shirt, just outside the box, but the video assistant referee deemed he had not denied a clear goalscoring opportunity. The irony was not lost on Slot when Szoboszlai was later dismissed for a similar offence.Guéhi recovered impressively from the reprieve and commanded his penalty area when Liverpool launched everything in search of a stoppage-time equaliser. The 25-year-old provided a platform for a truly remarkable City victory, one that could reverberate for some time. Guardiola knows this is not over.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolaLiverpoolanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Brighton head coach’s record against hisCrystal Palacecounterpart, and someone he counts as a mentor, now reads three defeats and a draw after Ismaila Sarr ended Palace’s 12-match winless run in the league in satisfying style against their archrivals.While Glasner can breathe slightly more easily after his new big-money signings Evann Guessand and Jørgen Strand Larsen made an impact on their debuts, Hürzeler left the field to widespread boos from his own fans and chants of: “You’re getting sacked in the morning”.Premier League top scorers 2025-26: who is leading race for golden boot?Read moreIt is now only one win in Brighton’s past 12 league games and the German who became the youngest manager inPremier Leaguehistory when he was appointed in 2024 is facing the real possibility of being dragged into a relegation battle after slipping below Palace in the table.Glasner has already confirmed he will leave Palace in the summer, while television cameras at the final whistle showed the Brighton owner, Tony Bloom, looking far from impressed with his side’s performance and Hürzeler could also find himself looking for a new club if this carries on much longer.“It’s not an easy situation to take but I will absorb the criticism,” Hürzeler said. “I think it’s the hardest moment [of my career], but it’s also the moment where I try to get the most out of it, where I learn the most and I grow the most. I will face this adversity and I will get through it.”Brighton’s issue has been an inability to finish teams off and as a consequence have slid down the table since beating Nottingham Forest in November. They once again lacked ruthlessness against opponents who had not won a game of any sort since mid‑December and were grateful to bring an end to their own poor run of form.“It’s a mix between relief and happiness,” Glasner said.“Our fans had plenty of opportunities to boo us in the last month, but they never did. So I think this is the bond we created in the last two years between the fans and the team. They were disappointed, and we were disappointed. But they never booed us.”View image in fullscreenDanny Welbeck (left) competes for a header with Crystal Palace’s Jefferson Lerma.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile James Milner will have to wait at least another week to match Gareth Barry’s Premier League appearance record, the 17‑year‑old Harry Howell impressed as he became the youngest player to start a Premier League game for Brighton. But his fellow teenager Charalampos Kostoulas could not take their best opportunity to equalise after Sarr struck just after the hour following an error from the veteran captain Lewis Dunk.Strand Larsen could have made the points safe for Palace on his first start since joining from Wolves for a club‑record fee that could rise to £48m as the Norway international proved to be a willing if rusty replacement for Jean‑Philippe Mateta.An early stray pass that went out for a throw-in was greeted with howls of derision from the home supporters. Will Hughes also received a volley of abuse after picking up his customary yellow card for taking out the pirouetting Georginio Rutter. Dunk headed wide from the resulting free‑kick but other than that Brighton had little to show for dominating possession in the opening half‑hour. Their best chance came when a cross from Kaoru Mitoma was not properly cleared but Maxence Lacroix was able to block Maxim De Cuyper’s shot.Palace lacked any cohesion in attack and had to wait until almost half-time to even threaten Bart Verbruggen’s goal. Strand Larsen was ready to pounce when a Lacroix flick-on from a Chris Richards throw caused panic in the Brighton area before Olivier Boscagli just beat Sarr to a dangerous cross from Yeremy Pino. The Senegal forward wasted another opportunity just before the break when Adam Wharton pinched the ball off Carlos Baleba in midfield.Both managers seemed unimpressed with the lethargic way that their sides started the second half and Glasner wasted no time introducing Guessand for his Palace debut after joining on loan from Aston Villa. It did not take long for the Ivory Coast forward to announce himself – a loose header from Dunk was seized upon and Sarr’s finish found the top corner via a deflection off Verbruggen’s face. The Palace captain, Dean Henderson, showed his delight by performing a knee slide in celebration.The England goalkeeper then denied Kostoulas with his legs when he was played in by Rutter and that was the closest Brighton came to scoring. Strand Larsen had two chances to put the game out of reach, but was denied twice by Verbruggen’s legs. Brighton looked devoid of ideas, with one supporter letting his frustration get the better of him. “It just gets shitter and shitter,” he shouted in Hurzeler’s direction as another attack broke down. Even the announcement of six minutes of injury time for the hosts to try to rescue a point barely raised a murmur from the home supporters who seemed resigned to their fate.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionCrystal Palacematch reportsShareReuse this content"

They are still eight points clear of Manchester United and 10 ahead of Arsenal, who have a game in hand over those around them.Arsenal v Manchester City: Women’s Super League – as it happenedRead moreAndrée Jeglertz, their manager, said he is “not worried about the future” after this result. “It’s not going to affect the players. We are fully aware of the situation we are in and we are still in a very good position in the league. We are still confident in what we have done so far. It’s important how you analyse this game and move on as quickly as possible.”Up until a fortnight ago, Renée Slegers’s side, who held on after Olivia Smith’s goal, had struggled against other top‑four teams this season. Until their 2-0 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge two weeks ago, they had collected three points from four Women’s Super League games against City, United and Chelsea, with a defeat by City in the reverse fixture and draws in the others.The Gunners have looked a different side since riding out a slow start to the calendar year, this game against City and the defeat of Chelsea sandwiching their victory in the inaugural Women’s Champions Cup.On their rejuvenation, Slegers said: “Players getting a rest, a break, mentally, physically, has done us really, really well because of course there was a big tournament last summer with a high load on players. There’s a couple of tactical tweaks that we’ve been working on that have clicked really well. Then, the players’ investment is so high at the moment.“There’s a lot of things going into why we’re doing well at the moment and we said we want to write it down, make it specific, make it tangible, because then we know what it is and we can keep on going.”There was some home wariness before this clash, though, with Jeglertz’s team having humbled the WSL title holders Chelsea last week, with the Brazilian forward Kerolin scoring a hat-trick in the 5-1 win.View image in fullscreenVivianne Miedema, formerly of Arsenal, is stuck between Lotte Wubben-Moy and Kim Little of Arsenal on a difficult day for Manchester City.Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Getty ImagesCity’s attacking talent is difficult to contain, Khadija Shaw, Lauren Hemp and Kerolin forming a formidable front three and the former Arsenal forward Vivianne Miedema shining in the No 10 role.The home team started the brighter, snapping at the heels of their counterparts. They were hungrier, quicker to second balls and physical in their press.One way to stop City’s domineering attack is to not let them have much of the ball and, for much of the game, that was a super-effective strategy. Defensively, Arsenal were superb, Lotte Wubben‑Moy and Steph Catley’s centre-back partnership really starting to flourish, and allowing for Leah Williamson to be eased back in following her absence through injury. She came on with six minutes remaining.It was in defence where City were lacking and how they were undone for the only goal. Mariona Caldentey played a one‑two with Kim Little before sending a beautifully weighted ball through to Smith. The centre‑back Rebecca Knaak could not keep pace with the Canada international, who shrugged clear of her half‑hearted challenge and rounded the goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita before rolling into the empty net.It was a beautifully worked goal and Arsenal should have extended their lead as time ticked on: Alessia Russo twice went close in quick succession, forcing a smart save.They were lucky too, Caldentey inexplicably not penalised for bringing down Lauren Hemp on the edge of the area when the England forward had only Daphne van Domselaar to beat.“I haven’t seen it afterwards, so I don’t know,” Jeglertz said of the incident. “In the moment I was very frustrated because I really felt that it was a clear free-kick but the fourth official was saying that it was still played but touched the ball.”There was another heart-in-mouth moment with just over 10 minutes remaining. Miedema collected Yui Hasegawa’s through ball only to lose her footing, before pulling back Katie McCabe as she recovered and slid the ball into the net, but it was ruled out for the foul.Arsenal rode their luck and the risk of City punishing their early profligacy was constant but, try as they might, they could not find a way through and on the full‑time whistle the home crowd rose to their feet and celebrated – content with temporarily denting City’s run, even if, surely, unable to wrestle the trophy from them.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueArsenal WomenManchester City WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

We showed a determination to go to the very, very end, and try to create something.”Partick Thistlereached the quarter-finals with an eventful 3-2 win againstElginat Borough Briggs.

But Stalker marked herself as a boarder to watch, entering the 12-strong final ranked sixth.The 22-year-old from Coolum on the Sunshine Coast fell on her first jump but then laid down a backside double cork 1080 in her second to score 82.25. She then showed nerves of steel and scored 82.75 on final jump to leap up the leaderboard and was congratulated by Australian star Scotty James, who was watching on.“It was the first time doing back dub 10 in a competition, so I learned that on the day I came here, so to be able to put it in in comp mode is pretty cool,” Stalker said. “I had so much anxiety throughout the whole day so I think I’m pretty glad to just kind of breathe through it and just get them down.”Coady, who won 2022 Olympic bronze in her preferred slopestyle event, was the first athlete off the jump in the third round and then faced a nervous wait before taking the last spot in the finals.View image in fullscreenTess Coady sticks her tongue out.Photograph: Gregory Bull/AP“I felt like I was sitting in a pretty good position at the start of the last run, but then just kept getting bumped lower and lower, which is just the worst when you’re just waiting and there’s like nothing you can do about it,” the St Kilda product said.Australia’s third entry Ally Hickman wowed the field with her first jump, scoring 85.25 to sit third, but the 16-year-old said she didn’t have another elite-level jump prepared and was thrilled to have an Olympic experience.She was lucky not to be hit by a following drone during her first jump. “I saw on the replay that I nearly got hit by it but I wasn’t aware of it while I was doing it,” Hickman said.Meanwhile, Australia’s four-time Olympian Alex Ferlazzo finished 18th in the men’s luge while Hugo Hinckfuss and Seve de Campo were 57th and 58th in the men’s skiathlon.Explore more on these topicsWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026Australia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not entirely out of the question.Winter Olympics 2026: Malinin and Glenn go for gold in figure skating team event – liveRead moreLate on Sunday evening, Mia Brookes, the 19-year-old British snowboarding superstar, dug herself out of a hole with the help of Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera and Judas Priest to qualify third for the Big Air final on Monday.Before then, Team GB’s mixed curling team of Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds will play in their semi-final in the afternoon, knowing they are odds‑on favourites with the bookies having lost just one game, against Switzerland, in the group stages. Win their last-four encounter and they will guarantee a medal.Then there is the 21-year-old Kirsty Muir, who goes into the freeski slopestyle final full of confidence, having also come third in qualifying. The bookies make her third favourite for gold too, behind only the Swiss skier Mathilde Gremaud and the Chinese star Eileen Gu.Are three Team GB medals likely? No. But can you rule it out? Also no.View image in fullscreenJen Dodds and Bruce Mouat have reached the curling mixed doubles semi-final.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PASunday night, though, was all about Brookes in the Big Air. It is an event not for the fainthearted, given that it requires snowboarders to fly down a 150‑feet high ramp before launching off a ramp, and trying to spin as much as possible before nailing the landing.And Brookes’s Winter Olympics campaign could not have got off to a worse start as she over-rotated on her first run and ended up sliding towards Livigno town centre on her backside.Her score of 29.75 points left her 24th out of 29 competitors. And to add to the jeopardy, she knew that only the top two scores from a ­competitor’s three runs are counted. It meant she needed to score big on her second and third run to be one of the 12 athletes to make the final.The pressure was on. Brookes delivered. First she nailed a backside 1260 melon, with three‑and‑a‑half full rotations while spinning towards her back in the air. That scored 89 points, second highest of the night. She was still in 22nd place going into her final attempt. This time she chose a Cab 1080 stalefish, a safer jump. That scored 78, leaving her with a total of 167, and putting her third overall.“That third one was special to land,” she said. “You’re in the air, thinking about it in the back of your mind, spinning: like, oh, my God, I’ve got to land this. But as much as I hate it in the moment, it’s moments like that that I just love. Because when you land, it’s like the best feeling on the planet. It’s insane.” What was so impressive was that she had conquered her nerves after falling on her first attempt.“After that first run, I was so ­nervous. But I just had to take my time at the top, not rush into anything. I listened to Metallica. Megadeth. Pantera, Judas Priest, stuff like that. It came out of me in an athlete way,” she said when asked about her mindset. “I was just keeping cool under the pressure and not making any rash decisions or rushing anything. Every minute was awesome, but definitely quite scary.”Her proud parents, Nigel and Vicky, were watching on. Brookes learnt to snowboard when the two of them, who work as a mechanic and a hairdresser, drove around Europe in a camper van. They are staying in the camper van here in Livigno too, incidentally, to save money.Meanwhile the other GB competitor, Maisie Hill, looked on the bright side after finishing 29th, having recovered from a lacerated liver to be here. “I was actually leaving hospital three years ago today after my injury,” she said. “I was told I might never be able to walk again and so to be here now is quite cool.”It all adds to Brookes’s charm. “Yeah, they’re actually in the camper, just staying down the road,” she said. “So yeah, they came and watched the night. So yeah, it’s special to do that in my family.”Asked about the possibility of Magic Monday, Brookes said: “It’d just be great to be a part of that, wouldn’t it? I’ve grown up with Kirsty. We’ve known each other since we were younger. So to go into an Olympic final on the same day as her for Great Britain is really special.”It could get even more special still.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But late goals from Bernardo Silva and Erling Haaland reduced the gap to six points and delivered City’s first win at Anfield in front of a crowd since 2003.City win sealed with a kiss after resilience of Guéhi twists title race | Andy HunterRead moreSilva said: “The title race is over if we lost this game.”Guardiola responded: “I’m maybe more optimis­tic than them. Nine points, ­watching Arsenal, it is difficult to think they are going to lose more than three games. But in football you never know.“I have a feeling that improving a little bit will not be enough to compete against Arsenal but still we have margin [to improve]. We have to play them at home, of course we have to beat them. And 13 games in the Premier League, from my point of view and from my little experience, is a lot.“When you go into the last games playing any team in a relegation ­battle, it’s a proper game. Because they live to survive and have long weeks to prepare, [whereas] you come from FA Cup, Carabao Cup, Champions League. That makes an influence in the title race. That’s why being nine, 10, 11 points is more difficult. That’s why all we can do is breathe down the neck of Arsenal, be there, and try if they slip, if they make a mistake, use it.”City thought they had a third in the 100th minute when Rayan Cherki scored from the halfway line with theLiverpoolkeeper Alisson out of his goal. Szoboszlai was sent off for pulling back Haaland as they pursued the ball, ­however, with the striker also ­pulling the ­midfielder’s shirt, and City were awarded a free-kick.Guardiola said: “It’s common sense, no? We won the game and now Szoboszlai can’t play [at Sunderland on Wednesday]. I know we pull him but how many pulls are there in a game that referees play on? So give a goal, 3-1, so he can play and we are happy.”Arne Slot believed Marc Guéhi, who came close to moving to Anfield last summer, should have been sent off for ­pulling back Mohamed Salah when the forward ran through with the game goalless. Guéhi received a yellow card and the home side ­squandered the free‑kick on the edge of the City area.Liverpool’s head coach said: “I can live with the fact, although I don’t like it, that the referee follows the ­rulebook and Dominik makes a foul on Haaland in that situation which is a clear shirt‑pull and he was through on goal so he would have scored. That’s a red card.“If you follow the rulebook, and you have a clear shirt‑pull by Guéhi on Mo Salah, who for eight years has been scoring that ball 100 times out of 100, and it is not a red card, then there is more of my frustration.“My main frustration is in the shirt‑pull on Mo Salah at 0-0. Clear and open, one vs one on the goalkeeper.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolBrighton & Hove AlbionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Exeter winger will be out for “a number of weeks”, ensuring he misses the trip to Murrayfield and the visit of Ireland to Twickenham a week later. He has not yet been ruled out of England’s entire campaign but the chances of him appearing seem remote and he has been left out of the 36‑man squad called into camp on Sunday night.‘We let people down’: Dewi Lake apologises to Wales fans after England thrashingRead more“Manny looks like he will be out for a number of weeks,” Borthwick said. “We’ve got to get specialist opinion before I know exactly how many weeks he is, but [it’s] a number [of weeks], which is disappointing.”Furbank sustained a head injury in training and must pass the return‑to‑play protocols if he is to face Scotland. He has not played for England since November 2024 but Borthwick had hoped to have the Northampton full‑back available for the Calcutta Cup. Billy Sela also has a head injury and has been replaced in the squad by George Kloska.Genge was replaced by Bevan Rodd at half-time against Wales. The Bristol loosehead prop was deemed fit to start but Borthwick admitted afterwards that he was only going to play 40 minutes amid suggestions Genge was carrying a hamstring niggle.In better news for the head coach, the Bath centre Ollie Lawrence is in contention to face Scotland while the Northampton fly-half Fin Smith is also in the frame after both players returned to the squad. Max Ojomoh has dropped out as a result.England are on a run of 12 successive wins going in to the meeting with a Scotland team who were beaten by Italy on Saturday, but they have won at Murrayfield only once since 2016. Borthwick is expecting an aerial bombardment with poor weather forecast for the weekend and he has predicted Gregor Townsend will recall Blair Kinghorn to the side.“From what I hear, they went for a huge number of contestable kicks [against Italy], that was their strategy,” Borthwick said. “And if I reflect on how they played against us last year, there will be a mammoth amount of contestable kicks.“Potentially, they are going to pick Kinghorn. He may come back into the team because he’s so good in the air. I reckon that’s the challenge we’ll probably face. If you look historically over the last number of years, that’s exactly what Scotland have chosen to do against England.”Two years ago England began brightly before succumbing to a Scotland comeback, prompting some soul-searching during a training camp in York. The second-row Ollie Chessum has warned his teammates to expect hostility from the moment they arrive at Murrayfield. “It’s a huge challenge,” Chessum said. “I love going up there, the hostility of the place only adds to the fire. You get off the bus at Murrayfield and there are just people on top of you, there is a tone. Once you hear that boo it just hits you in the face and it doesn’t stop until the whistle goes.”While England are unbeaten in 12 months, their most impressive wins under Borthwick have either come at Twickenham or on neutral territory during the 2023 World Cup. A statement victory on away soil has so far eluded them, something that has not been lost on the back-row Ben Earl.“You can sometimes lose sight of yourself and be like ‘let’s do a smash-and-grab plan’, or talk about the crowd and all that stuff, but at the end of the day if you play well you’ve got a good chance of winning,” he said. “We’re a slightly different team now and have developed the scar tissue for however long we’ve had this journey, started a bit of a roll and got a bit of momentum.”George Ford has called on England to embrace their impressive run of form, suggesting previous teams have been reluctant to lean into the confidence that comes with an unbeaten stretch. “We’ve got to definitely use it, it’s such a positive thing, why wouldn’t we use it? I think a lot of the time in England we get told to temper it all the time, but let’s use it. We feel like we’re a good team, we feel like there’s improvement but let’s back ourselves and keep going for it.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026Steve BorthwickEngland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The retailer has teamed up with The Hacking Games, a startup that identifies talented gamers to test companies’ IT systems, which wants youngsters to use their skills to help companies fight back against criminal hackers.Conor Freeman, 26, from Dublin, was jailed for just under three years in 2020 for his role in a $2m cryptocurrency theft and spoke to students at Connell Co-op College near Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium last week.Freeman became a part of the Com – short for “community” – after being groomed online by an older teenager while playing Minecraft. The association spiralled into attending hacking forums on the dark web and eventually hacking people’s crypto wallets along with other Com members.“I stumbled on these various different dark-net hacking forums and that’s when things really started to escalate,” he says. “I just fell into these different communities, different groups, befriended a couple of different people, and then found myself involved with large-scale cryptocurrency theft.”Freeman served 11 months of his sentence and is now employed by TheHackingGames as an ethical hacker.View image in fullscreenThe Hacking Games designer John Madelin with students at the event at Connel Co-op college.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianFergus Hay, co-founder and chief executive of The Hacking Games, said there was a “100% overlap” between gaming and hacking. Describing gaming as a “live laboratory for skills development”, Hay said skills learned in gaming – particularly “modding” or creating software that helps you alter a video game – can be used in either hacking or cybersecurity.“And the people who’ve worked that out are the bad guys,” says Hay. He adds: “So what you’ve got is a whole generation of natural-born hackers who’ve got incredible aptitude, but they’re invisible. No one’s seen their skill sets because they aren’t advertised on LinkedIn.”Hay’s company has designed an AI-powered test to identify skills among proficient gamers who could make the jump to cybersecurity and help companies detect flaws in their IT systems via “red teaming” – or ethical hacking – where their networks are subjected to attacks by expert computer users.Freeman was joined via video link by Ricky Handschumacher, a 30-year-old US citizen who was part of the same crypto heist and served four years in prison for the crime. The talk at Connell College was the first time Freeman and Handschumacher had ever seen each other physically. Handschumacher, who also fell into the Com via gaming, told the audience that he would have taken a different path had he known that you could be “paid a lot of money to do the right thing”.Computing students who attended the talk said they had been inspired.“The lesson is there’s great opportunities for you to go into computing, but you have to be watchful of what you’re doing because if you do something wrong, it will quickly harm your future,” said Suheil, 17.Rob Elsey, the Co-op group’s chief digital officer, who led the organisation’s fight back againsta ransomware hack that cost £120m in lost profits, said the talks were about “helping young people recognise that the digital skills they already have can be a force for good, protecting people, organisations and communities rather than being misused or exploited”.The Co-op is planning more Hacking Games talks across its 38 school academies this year.In July last year four people including three teenagers were arrested at addresses in the West Midlands, Staffordshire and London as part of an investigation intoa trio of cyber-attacks on the Co-op, Marks & Spencer and Harrods.Explore more on these topicsHackingCybercrimeCo-operative GroupInternetProgrammingGame cultureYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

Intensified competition for resources isn’t helpingSun 8 Feb 2026 12.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 17.04 ESTShareWhen Donald Trump boasted recently that he had stopped the conflict between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo – though fighting persists in the DRC, atappalling human cost– he made clear that his goals went beyond a long-sought Nobel Peace prize.“They said to me, ‘Please, please, we would love you to come and take our minerals.’ Which we’ll do,” the US president added. Now he is following through. Last Monday he launcheda new strategic reserveplan, “Project Vault”, worth almost $12bn. Two days later, JD Vance hosted a summit seeking tocreate a trade zonefor critical minerals.The US – and others – are trying to counter the dominance of Beijing, which was far quicker to grasp the strategic importance of such resources. Key to its plan is a deal touted as a way to bring the DRC wealth and create incentives for peace. Few on the groundare convinced. The deal does nothing to help the DRC build processing capacity and requires it to freeze its tax and regulatory regimes for a decade. The EU likes to portray itself as taking higher ground. But in December, the parliament and councilagreed to weakenkeydue diligence rules.The incredible resources of the DRC have been violently plundered over centuries for the benefit of richer nations and a handful of individuals on the ground.Four-fifths of the populationlive below the poverty line. Extraction has meant exploitation and danger. The week before the Washington gathering,at least 200 artisanal minerswere crushed to death or suffocated when a coltan mine in Rubaya in the eastern DRC collapsed. It became,said one survivor, a tomb.As the journalist Nicolas Niarchos writes in his new bookThe Elements of Power, “tech profiteers, politicians, and battery-makers have made a trade-off: cleaner power at home for pollution and suffering elsewhere”. Meeting climate goals will require many times the current production of materials such as lithium and cobalt. But environmental despoliation, the eviction of communities and the exploitation of labourers including children are not the inevitable results of the necessary shift away from fossil fuels. And the NGO Global Witnesssuggeststhat Mr Trump’s mineral-hunger is better explained by their use in military technology. Tantalum, extracted from coltan, is essential to jet engines and missiles as well as smartphones and laptops.Just asgrowing conflicthelps to drive demand, so demand is fuelling conflict. Rubaya is part of the swathes of land seized by M23 rebels in the eastern DRC in recent years, with mines theregenerating an estimated $800,000 monthly, funding the insurgency. The group is backed by Rwanda (though Kigali denies it) and experts say Rwanda is now selling far more coltan than it can produce, with smuggling across the border reaching unprecedented levels. The EUminerals deal withKigali has been rightly criticised.Natural resources are increasingly intertwined with security policies across the continent, the African Policy Research Institutenoted recently, via Russian private military companies, the US promise of peacebrokering and China’s infrastructure-for-resources model. Its report suggests that resource demand could give African states leverage to negotiate more equitable partnerships that benefit their populations. But that depends, as the authors note, on institutional strength, regional coordination and transparency in deal-making – as well as determination not to compromise human rights, environmental standards or national sovereignty. The DRC’s example is not encouraging.Explore more on these topicsAfricaOpinionDonald TrumpeditorialsShareReuse this content"

We need a new movement for global peaceDavid CortrightWith the end of the New Start treaty, we face a potentially catastrophic arms race. It can still be preventedSun 8 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 13.03 ESTShareThe risk of nuclear war is greater now than in decades – andrising. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists recently set its famousDoomsday Clock closer to midnight, indicating a level of risk equivalent to the 1980s, when US and Soviet nuclear stockpiles were increasing rapidly. In those years, massive waves of disarmament protest arose in Europe and the United States. Political leaders responded, the cold warended, and many people stopped worrying about the bomb.Today, the bomb is back. Political tensions are rising, and nuclear weapons have spread to other countries, including Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea. China is rapidly increasing its nuclear arsenal. The US-Russia arms competition may accelerate soon with the expiration on 5 February of the last remaining arms control agreement, the New Start treaty. To prevent the growing nuclear threat, we need a new global peace movement.Donald Trump had a chance to prevent nuclear escalation in the months preceding the expiration of New Start. Russian President Vladimir Putinofferedto voluntarily maintain the limits established by the treaty and invited the US to follow suit, but the White Houserefused. The administration has proposed instead to negotiate an entirely new strategic arms treaty, a process that could take years.Political leaders and security experts talk about nuclear weapons as if they are mere pieces on a chess board, to be brandished and maneuvered for strategic advantage. We are told that nuclear weapons are necessary for peace, but there can be no genuine peace if security rests on the threat of using instruments of indiscriminate mass annihilation. One large bomb detonated over a modern city could kill millions of people from the catastrophic blast and the spread of genetically damaging radioactive fallout.Research estimatesthat a nuclear war between the US and Russia could kill up to 5 billion people.Nuclear deterrence does not create peace. It has not prevented major wars, by Russia in Ukraine, or by the US in Iraq and Vietnam. The number of armed conflicts in the world today is at anall-time high. The supposed deterrent effect of nuclear weapons lacks credibility. Deterrence is achievable bynon-nuclear means, the scholar Mary Kaldor reminds us. Wars can be avoided by strengthening mechanisms of global cooperation and applying proven methods of conflict prevention and peacemaking diplomacy.Current leaders in Washington ignore these realities and are pushing ahead with a massive weapons upgrade, at acost of trillionsof dollars. TheUS is creatingan entirely new fleet of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, new ballistic missile-firing submarines, updated strategic aircraft and air-launched cruise missiles, a new system of sea-launched nuclear cruise missiles, and enormous new facilities to produce plutonium components for an estimated 80 new nuclear warheads per year.This enormous nuclear construction program is euphemistically termed “modernization” in Washington. It is more properly understood as a vast program for enhancing the capacity to use nuclear weapons. “A nuclear war can never be won and should never be fought,” then US president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev famously declared in the 1980s. Political leaders oftenrepeat the phrase, but their actions betray their words.Nuclear arms control agreements traditionally provided guardrails against unconstrained arms racing, but those protections have been discarded in recent decades and are gone completely now with the expiration of the New Start treaty. In the absence of agreed weapons restrictions, US and Russian officials could deployhundreds of warheadsin the coming months.An accelerated arms race can still be prevented if the US would agree to maintain current weapons limits as it pursues potential negotiations. Moscow expressedregretthat Washington did not accept its offer to maintain weapons restrictions, but it did not withdraw the proposal. The deal could still be on the table.All that’s needed is for the White House to state that the US will not exceed current strategic weapons limits as long as the Kremlin agrees to exercise similar restraint. This small but important mutual step could reduce the near-term threat of nuclear escalation. It could open political space for more fundamental change.An agreement to refrain from weapons increases would create a positive atmosphere for negotiating a new arms reduction treaty. Ideally, it could also lead to a statement of support for the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons, as specified in theUN treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons.To build pressure for such steps, renewed peace activism is needed. Change will require political pressure from the bottom up. In the history of the arms race, steps for weapons limitation and disarmament usually have beenthe result of citizen pressureand grassroots political action. We need more of the same now.David Cortright, a visiting scholar at Cornell University’s Reppy Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies, was the executive director of Sane, the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, during the 1980sExplore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsOpinionRussiaDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

In his final book, published just a year before his death, Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?,he argued that we were standing at a crossroads: one path leading toward chaos – deepening poverty, violence, and repression – while the other required us to collectively choose and build community.Too few of us answered his call. At times, we chose distraction, comfort and complacency. At others, we turned away from the violence this country inflicted on the world, allowing the corruption of those in power to harden and accumulate. We can blame politicians and corporations, or those who remained neutral – but the truth is, we all carry some level of responsibility.And still, the challenge remains: are we ready to do what is necessary to build community? To protect one another? To stop outsourcing our power?ThisBlack History Month, we must go beyond the passive commemorations that have become commonplace in our culture. We need to go beyond the hashtags, curated quotes, safe tributes, and parades and learn about how change was actually made – and take responsibility for continuing it.Learning from those who didn’t waitIf we want a model for that responsibility, the activist Ella Baker is essential. Often working behind the scenes, she helped build some of the most important organizations of the civil rights movement. One of her most enduring contributions was her insistence on building strong people – so they would no longer need strong leaders.Baker, who died in 1986, believed that people must organize where they are: in their neighborhoods, workplaces and schools. Not by waiting for charismatic saviors, but by developing leadership from below. She understood that young people and poor and working-class communities already possessed knowledge, strength and leadership – and that those capacities, when nurtured, could be mobilized for real social change.That legacy is alive today in organizations like Students Deserve in Los Angeles. This youth-led group has organized students across race to winhistoric victories, including a $30m reduction to school police funding and the reinvestment of those resources into a Black Student Achievement Plan. These gains were not granted out of the goodwill of elected officials; they were won through struggle and disciplined, student-led organizing.Just as important, Students Deserve understands that struggle does not end with a win. The organization continues defending these victories against white supremacist backlash, holding the principle Baker taught us: responsibility is ongoing, and the struggle is eternal.Getting up and doing somethingThat same clarity lives in Fannie Lou Hamer, who fought for civil rights, voting rights and women’s rights in the 1960s and 70s and made it clear that neither wealth nor formal education were prerequisites for resistance. At some point, being “sick and tired of being sick and tired” had to turn into action.That spirit remains today in organizations like Pillars of the Community, which organizes with people often written off as “unorganizable”: currently and formerly incarcerated people and others most affected by state violence.Pillars leadspolice-watch efforts, coordinates legal defense work, and – when historic floods devastated parts of California in 2024 – provided disaster relief when government response fell short. This is Hamer’s legacy in practice: people deemed disposable by the system deciding to protect one another anyway.Prayer was never enough. Today, scrolling isn’t either. At some point, we must decide to do everything within our power to become free and recognize that our freedom is bound up with the freedom of others.Protection, powerand imaginationI think, too, of the Black Panther Party, and their unapologetic commitment to protecting Black communities, even against the state. In a moment when masked agents detain people in public spaces without accountability, that legacy is not abstract.In Oakland, organizations like the Anti Police-Terror Project, Communities United for Restorative Youth Justice and others are carrying that tradition forward – building community-led infrastructure to respond to violence, mental-health crises and emergencies without relying on policing or incarceration. We are also seeing communities build safety networks and protect one another in real time from ICE attacks.But resistance must also be imaginative. Revolution is both an art and a science. Art that avoids struggle, or stays safely on the surface, is not neutral, it participates in the choice of chaos. And we need our writers, actors and artists connected to these fights, not necessarily to lead them, but to help people reimagine what is possible– to teach, to energize, to amplify the work and to refuse capitulation to the demands of the capitalist machine.Staying in the struggleThere is another impulse we must name and refuse: the temptation to tap out, to disengage out of frustration when others do not participate, do not vote the “right” way, or do not move fast enough. A person defeated in spirit will soon be defeated in reality, and forgetting that social change is a protracted struggle is a sure path to lost morale.History is often taught as a series of dramatic moments: a march, a speech, a bill signed into law. What gets erased are the decades of organizing that made those moments possible. When people expect immediate transformation without understanding the long arc of struggle, disappointment is inevitable.None of our ancestors waited for mass participation before acting. They organized amid apathy, repression and isolation. To abandon the work because others have not yet joined is not radical – it is a misunderstanding of how change has always happened.Here, the activist Kwame Ture (formerly known as Stokely Carmichael) offers needed clarity. Voting once every few years is not democracy – it is delegation. As Ture said, politics is daily. It lives in workplaces, schools, housing and food systems. Resentment toward people who did not vote the “right” way is not political maturity. This moment requires building the conditions for participation, not shaming people for their absence.Taking responsibility nowFor the Alliance for Boys and Men of Color, this moment requires taking our work to the next level, and refusing to remain confined by what liberalism tells us is acceptable. As fascism actively dismantles the liberal world order we were told to trust, clinging to those limits is no longer strategic; it is dangerous.Now is the time to become the ancestors future generations will thankToo often, we exhaust ourselves naming external enemies while ignoring the internal forces that limit our ability to build real power. Many of our organizations – and many of us within them – remain constrained by liberalism in ways that actively undermine our ability to win tangible gains for poor and working-class communities. If we are serious about building multiracial, multigenerational power rooted in those most harmed by violence and exclusion, then we must be just as serious about outgrowing the frameworks that no longer serve this moment.And the work is already happening every day in communities across this country. There are organizations to join, movements to plug into, people already doing the hard, unglamorous work of building power. Each moment is an invitation to learn, to be imaginative and to begin where you are. Movements are not born fully formed – they begin when ordinary people decide to act anyway. And maybe, just maybe, the work will be a little easier for those who come after us because you decided to begin.Now is the time to become the ancestors future generations will thank, to take our place in history as people who stood against fascism and chose community over chaos.What’s giving me hope nowHope matters to me. But one thing I’ve learned over the years is that hope without struggle is hollow, and struggle without hope is unsustainable. The truth is, hope ebbs and flows. There are moments when it feels abundant, and moments when it feels distant. But whether we feel hopeful or not, our responsibility does not change.What keeps me grounded is this: if political prisoners can continue to fight from inside cages, and if people experiencing genocide can continue to resist under conditions meant to break them, then I have a responsibility to keep fighting here, in the United States. Not because I always feel hopeful, but because the struggle demands it.Whether the wind is pushing us forward or pushing us back, the task is the same. To fight. Some people say the will to fight comes from believing another world is possible. I’d add this: if you want people to have hope, get them into struggle. Help them win something real. Because hope doesn’t just live in ideas – it lives in action, in collective effort, and in the knowledge that we are not facing this alone.Eric Morrison-Smith is executive director of the Alliance for Boys and Men of ColorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And I see it now in the US and IsraelJanine di GiovanniIt’s chilling to watch as Trump and Netanyahu adopt the methods of regimes their countries once condemnedJanine di Giovanni is a war correspondent and the executive director of The Reckoning Project, a war crimes unit in Ukraine, Sudan and GazaSun 8 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 05.52 ESTShareIn Syria, where I worked during the years of Bashar al-Assad’s terror, people were often taken away to torture cells before dawn by masked men. The timing was deliberate. It disoriented them at their most vulnerable, ensuring the torture to come would be even more agonising. The testimonies I recorded from survivors almost always contained the same phrase: “The morning they came for me.” One young woman, shattered by rape and violence, later told me that her life had split in two – before and after the masked men came for her.In Iraq, those who spoke against Saddam Hussein – even abroad, even casually –were punishedin cruel ways by a vengeful leader determined to crush any hint of dissent.In Egypt in 2016,Giulio Regeni, a 28-year-old Italian academic researching labour unions, was abducted, beaten and tortured to death, it is thought, by president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi’s security services. His own motherhad difficulty recognisinghis mutilated body.During the second Chechen war, I met the journalistAnna Politkovskayain Chechnya. She repeatedly attacked Vladimir Putin’s policies, documenting human rights abuses during Russia’s military campaigns. To punish her, a bullet was put in her brain on Putin’s birthday – a warning to other truth-seekers. Stay silent or die.In the West Bank and Gaza, Israeli soldiers, masked and unmasked, kill, torture and imprison Palestiniandoctors,journalists,teachers,activistsandscholarsnot for what they have done – but because of who they are.After decades of documenting state terror, I know how it starts. Governments begin to use words like security, order, deterrence.Every excuse for Benjamin Netanyahu’s conduct in Gaza isframed as “security”. ICE agents are trained in a language of order in which violence becomes procedure.What happens when democratic states adopt the methods of the regimes they once condemned? Terror is not only masked men and arbitrary detention. It also operates through fear. Policies are designed to make people more compliant, more submissive. As the historian Timothy Snyder warned in his 2017 book,On Tyranny, this is how societies slide into danger: people obey in advance.In Donald Trump’s US, I have watched CEOs, academics, journalists and government officials allow fear to override decency and moral authority. I have seen this pattern before. It begins with claims that certain people are dangerous. That ordinary legal safeguards should not apply to them. It ends with a society diminished – more compliant, more cynical, more brutal. State terror is rarely announced. In my experience, it becomes normalised. It seeps quietly into the machinery of government.Authoritarian regimes make no serious claim to moral legitimacy. Their violence is explicit. Saddam did not apologise when hekilled 182,000 Kurdsduring the Anfal campaign. Sisi did not apologise when about1,000 Muslim Brotherhood supporterswere mowed down in Rabaa and al-Nahda squares in central Cairo. Hafez al-Assad never acknowledged thetens of thousands killed in Hamain 1982. (To this day, the exact numbers remain unknown and the disappeared unaccounted for. The regime cynically built hotelsover mass graves).Democracies operate in an entirely different way. Their actions are often technically above the law. Constitutions are invoked and obscure laws brought back to defend aggressive policies. Governments talk of “necessary action”. They point to courts that still function, a press that is still somewhat free, elections that still take place – even as all of these institutions disintegrate. This is how democracies begin to resemble the regimes they once condemned. It is a subtle, devastating shift.The tools are familiar. A journalist whose reporting aligns closely with the political interests of the US president and the Israeli prime ministeris installedto lead CBS, once one of the most respected networks in the US. On university campuses,surveillance now includesphotographing students who attend or lead pro-Palestinian demonstrations, and are deemed troublemakers. I was told by one student at an Ivy League university that some are quietly warned they will never find work on Wall Street, at the best law firms, or in government offices if they continue. Other student activists are removed from their homes,illegally detained, andthreatened with deportation.Academic deans face threats of punitivefunding cutsunless they impose requirements that constrain academic freedom. AtNorthwestern University in Chicago, students were forced to complete antisemitism training thatthey said was inaccurateand biased in favour of Israel before they could enrol in classes.Instructors are quietly told to toe the line. Journalists are disciplined through language that is carefully crafted as editorial policy – thensome of them are arrested. Those who resist are increasingly labelled enemies of the state.ICE tactics themselves are not new. They have long been used disproportionately against political radicals, Muslims, Black Americans and migrants. What has changed is their visibility – and increasingly, their acceptance. Today, ICE mirrors the same patterns of state terror I have documented for decades: arbitrary detention, secret evidence, militarised policing. The criminalisation of dissent. All of this is justified by the guardians of legality: the White House, the Knesset, the office of the prime minister.Bit by bit, lists are drawn up. Loyalty tests reminiscent ofthe red scarehave returned. Dual citizens are facing pressure to choose a country of “loyalty”. Immigration enforcement is reframed as a hunt for “criminals” rather than a legal process. Activists, NGOs and humanitarians are punished. In Gaza, organisations such as Doctors Without Borders are told thatunless they provide listsof healthcare workers – placing those staff at grave risk – they will not be allowed to operate.The United Nations, founded to prevent the scourge of war, is rendered toothless. Then sidelined and derided.True, the US and Israel are not Russia or North Korea. But democracies erode. The early stages are not just the national guard on the street, but legal arguments over definitions. Judges deferring to power. Congress taking moneyfrom powerful lobbying groups, then using social media to spread propaganda. Disinformation acts as a weapon of truth. Good men and women look away, fearful they will lose jobs, visas, publishing contracts, social standing.The most chilling thing is what happens to society, but also to individuals. Fear becomes internalised, and we begin to censor our own thoughts. We wonder if the law will actually protect us if they come for us one day.The true irony is, state terror does not make a state safer. When democratic states adopt the methods of tyrannies, they become weaker. Their global credibility frays. They sacrifice the legitimacy they once held that distinguishes them from the regimes they claim to oppose.I know state terror when I see it. It is not just Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, Russia’s FSB or Egypt’s National Security Agency. It’s lawyers in suits and bureaucrats at desks and journalists spinning a narrative so the truth is distorted. It’s ICE agents breaking car windows andshooting unarmed citizens. It is militarised borders; family separations and deportations without due process. It is turning fear into a policy, a goal.We should be listening, urgently, to all of those who have lived through it. The hundreds of testimonies I have taken over the years from those haunted voices are an early warning signal we cannot afford to ignore.Janine di Giovanni is a war correspondent and the executive director of The Reckoning Project, a war crimes unit in Ukraine, Sudan and Gaza.

Except for viewers in the USBryan Armen Grahamin MilanThe real risk for American broadcasters is not that dissent will be visible. It is that audiences will start assuming anything they do not show is being hiddenSat 7 Feb 2026 21.19 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 17.58 ESTShareThe modern Olympics sell themselves on a simple premise: the whole world, watching the same moment, at the same time. On Friday night in Milan, that illusion fractured in real time.When Team USA entered San Siro during the parade of nations, the speed skater Erin Jackson led the delegation into a wall of cheers. Moments later, when cameras cut to US vice-president JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance, large sections of the crowd responded with boos. Not subtle ones, but audible and sustained ones.Canadian viewers heard them. Journalists seated in the press tribunes in the upper deck,myself included, clearlyheard them. But as I quickly realized from a groupchat with friends back home, American viewerswatching NBC did not.NBC appears to cut crowd’s booing of JD Vance from Winter Olympics broadcastRead moreOn its own, the situation might once have passed unnoticed. But the defining feature of the modern sports media landscape is that no single broadcaster controls the moment any more. CBC carried it. The BBC liveblogged it.Fans clipped it. Within minutes, multiple versions of the same happening were circulating online – some with boos, some without – turning what might once have been a routine production call into a case study in information asymmetry.For its part,NBC has deniedediting the crowd audio, although it is difficult to resolve why the boos so audible in the stadium and on other broadcasts were absent for US viewers. But in a broader sense, it is becoming harder, not easier, to curate reality when the rest of the world is holding up its own camera angles. And that raises an uncomfortable question as the United States moves toward hosting two of the largest sporting events on the planet: the 2026 men’s World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.If a US administration figure is booed at the Olympics in Los Angeles, or a World Cup match in New Jersey or Dallas, will American domestic broadcasts simply mute or avoid mentioning the crowd audio? If so, what happens when the world feed, or a foreign broadcaster, shows something else entirely? What happens when 40,000 phones in the stadium upload their own version in real time?The risk is not just that viewers will see through it. It is that attempts to manage the narrative will make American broadcasters look less credible, not more. Because the audience now assumes there is always another angle. Every time a broadcaster makes that trade – credibility for insulation – it is a trade audiences eventually notice.There is also a deeper structural pressure behind decisions like this. The Trump era has been defined in part by sustainedhostility toward media institutions. Broadcasters do not operate in a vacuum; they operate inside regulatory environments, political climates and corporate risk calculations. When presidents and their allies openly threaten or target networks, it is naive to pretend that has no downstream effect on editorial choices – especially in high-stakes live broadcasts tied to billion-dollar rights deals.But there is a difference between contextual pressure and visible reality distortion. When global audiences can compare feeds in real time, the latter begins to resemble something else entirely: not editorial judgment, but narrative management. Which is why comparisons to Soviet-style state-controlled broadcasting models – once breathless rhetorical exaggerations – are starting to feel less hyperbolic.The irony is that the Olympics themselves are built around the idea that sport can exist alongside political tension without pretending it does not exist. The International Olympic Committee’s own language – athletes should not be punished for governments’ actions – implicitly acknowledges that governments are part of the Olympic theater whether organizers like it or not.Friday night illustrated that perfectly. American athletes were cheered, their enormous contingent given one of the most full-throated receptions of the night. The political emissaries were not universally welcomed. Both things can be true at once. Crowd dissent is not a failure of the Olympic ideal. In open societies, it is part of how public sentiment is expressed. Attempting to erase one side of that equation risks flattening reality into something audiences no longer trust. And if Milan was a warning shot, Los Angeles is the main event.Since Donald Trump’s first term, American political coverage around sport has fixated on the micro-moments: Was the president booed or cheered? Did the broadcast show it? Did he attend or skip events likely to produce hostile crowds? The discourse has often felt like a Rorschach test, filtered through partisan interpretation and selective clips.The LA Olympics will be something else entirely. There is no hiding from an opening ceremony for Trump. No ducking a stadium when the Olympic Charter requires the host country’s head of state to officially declare the Games open. No controlling how 200 international broadcasters carry the moment.If Trump is still in the White House on 14 July 2028, one month after his 82nd birthday and in the thick of another heated US presidential campaign, he will stand in front of a global television audience as a key part of the opening ceremony. He will do so in California, in a political environment far less friendly than many domestic sporting venues he has appeared in over the past decade. And he will do it in a city synonymous with the political opposition, potentially in the back yard ofthe Democratic presidential candidate.There will be some cheers. There will almost certainly be boos. There will be everything in between. And there will be no way to make them disappear. The real risk for American broadcasters is not that dissent will be visible. It is that audiences will start assuming anything they do not show is being hidden. In an era when trust in institutions is already fragile, that is a dangerous place to operate from.The Olympics have always been political, whether through boycotts, protests, symbolic gestures or crowd reactions. What has changed is not the politics. It is the impossibility of containing the optics.Milan may ultimately be remembered as a small moment – a few seconds of crowd noise during a long ceremony. But it also felt like a preview of the next phase of global sport broadcasting: one where narrative control is shared, contested and instantly verifiable. The world is watching. And this time, it is also recording.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsJD VanceNBCUS television industryTelevision industrycommentShareReuse this content"

There can be no more excusesSun 8 Feb 2026 12.42 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 14.41 ESTShareHere is something they can’t take away from him:Morgan McSweeneyis often credited for Labour’s remarkable turnaround from the abyss of the 2019 election to the astounding landslide of 2024. Few thought it could be done. The Tories did all they could to help, but it took clever strategy and ruthless tactics to pull off what no pollsters predicted in the immediate wake of Boris Johnson’s 80-seat majority. But it turned out that the skills that win election campaigns are not those that run a government.His resignationtoday will do little to shore up Keir Stamer’s precarious position. “Man or woman overboard!” has been the frequent cry from the decks of No 10. After just 18 months, here’s a roll call of the drowned, all from senior posts selected by Starmer with fanfare, only to make themwalk the plank: Sue Gray, Steph Driver, Liz Lloyd, James Lyons, Matthew Doyle, Nin Pandit, Paul Ovenden and probably more I’ve forgotten. It’s not a good look: in a company, shareholders would ask what was wrong with their CEO.McSweeney became the punch bag for everything that has gone wrong in the Labour party: it was ever harder to tell exactly when he was or wasn’t to blame. “I take full responsibility,” he says, for advisingthe disastrous Peter Mandelson appointment. As Mandelson’s protege, follower and third-way mimic, he tugged the party rightwards to chase votesfor ever lost to NigelFarage, when all the polls said go left, fetch back Green and Liberal Democrat supporters: the times had changed since his mentor’s hero days of 1997.No, it was not McSweeney’s responsibility: it was only the leader’s, as is every decision made around his cabinet table, but Starmer never had the political brain or impulses to see where danger lay, even when warned. U-turns have become the most memorable thing about his political style.There are three years left before the next general electionand a colossal majority, for whoever can take Labour forward now it has shed the Mandelson-McSweeney drag anchors pulling it towards the right. The party and potential candidates are nowhere near ready yet for a leadership election.The barring of Andy Burnhamfrom standing as an MP in the Gorton and Denton byelection so that he could not enter the contest will look worse as days go by. That none has dared step forward with a challenge in the last week of thiscrisis suggests the usual pusillanimity on the Labour benches, riven by factions, more afraid of losing to internal rivals than of doing nothing at the risk of losing the next election catastrophically.Keir Starmer himself could signal that he is ready to begin the process of turning his ship of state in a new direction, and plenty in his cabinet areready to push some of the missing radicalism he has been frightened away from. As he said in hisexcellent conference speech, there is only one overriding duty: to keep Farage out, whatever it takes.That means a new leader, but that will never be enough without new purpose.

Yet all around me – in classrooms, in conversation and in alarming statistics – I see many young people struggling rather than flourishing.In Aotearoa New Zealand, where I live, the numbers paint a stark picture.Unicefranks us lowest among 36 OECD and EU countries in child mental wellbeing. High levels ofbullyingand anxiety among young people are said to compound this picture, contributing to depression, school avoidance and isolation.Global reports tell a similar story, with some economists describing youth happiness “in decline worldwide” .Technology and economic pressuresmay play a role, but they are not the whole story. A void seems to sit beneath the surface: have we cultivated the intellect but neglected the soul?Spirituality isn’t rigid dogma. It’s a living, breathing practice that helps make sense of an incomprehensible world | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreWhat we know about spiritual educationAotearoa offers a powerful framework for understanding this gap.Te whare tapa whā, a Māori framework for wellbeing, describes life as a house supported by four walls: physical, mental, social and spiritual. Schools tend diligently to the first three. Buttaha wairua– the spiritual foundation – is often treated as incompatible with secular education.Yet according to the framework, it is precisely this dimension that gives coherence to the others:wairuais the breath of life and the foundation of identity, belonging and meaning. Without it, the house leans.Spiritual education does not have to be religious instruction or proselytising. It can begin with a premise found across traditions: every child is a noble soul with spiritual faculties that should be developed.Mostwellbeing programsfocus on an individual’s emotional regulation. Important, yes – but spiritual education reaches deeper. It transforms character, strengthens moral agency and orients children towards contributing to the wellbeing of others.Guiding children to explore their relationship with the sacred – however they understand it – helps them to knowwho they areandwhy they matter.Teaching identity and belongingPsychologistDr Lisa Miller, author of The Spiritual Child and The Awakened Brain, argues that spirituality should be considered a core human capacity.Her work echoes otherresearchthat claims young people need experiences of awe, sacredness and moral elevation to thrive. When children feel theybelong– to family, community, land, and to a spiritual reality that transcends the self – the epidemic of loneliness, they argue, seems to loosen its grip.Spiritual education should therefore not be considered a luxury; it should be available to all since it aims to respond to some of the most urgent challenges of our time.We see this kind of learning emerging, and being strengthened, across cultures and traditions. Māori pedagogies centrewairua. In Buddhist traditions, the breath anchors insight. In Islam and Christianity, the heart is the seat of spiritual perception. In the Bahá’í writings, the human being is described as“a mine rich in gems of inestimable value”, with education as the means to reveal those capacities – not just for personal fulfilment, but for service to humanity.Some community-led programs reflect this in practice. Globally, including in New Zealand, theBahá’í Children’s Classes programis offered voluntarily in neighbourhoods and, occasionally, in public schools with parental consent. These classes use stories, reflection, creative expression and simple acts of service that help children practice qualities such as kindness, honesty, courage and cooperation. They also open space for children to relate to a higher reality and to recognise their connection to one human family. Parents often observe their children becoming more confident, thoughtful and socially connected: precisely the qualities our education system struggles to cultivate.Across diverse traditions, the insight is consistent: children thrive when spiritual faculties are nurtured.What if the world’s religions aren’t competing but rather one unfolding truth? |  Kat EghdamianRead moreStarting with small, meaningful practicesSpiritual education starts with a shift in how we see the child, and with small, meaningful practices that help cultivate their inner life and relationship with transcendence, such as brief moments of silence or reflection, journalling on gratitude, spending time in nature and optional contemplative practices like meditation.Thesepracticesdo not impose belief; they create conditions in which innate spiritual capacities can grow.Education that develops the mind but neglects the inner life leaves children unanchored in a world that demands depth and moral clarity. And when something so essential is lost in childhood, its absence reverberates across a lifetime, and across generations.Young people are not asking for more tests or busier timetables. They are hungering for meaning and are asking us – through their questions and their struggles – to remind them of who they truly are.Dr Kat Eghdamian is a human rights expert, writer and adviser on religion, ethics and social justice.

Morgan McSweeney’s resignation won’t change their mindsJohn HarrisWhoever succeeds Keir Starmer will still have an almost impossible task: convincing voters that politicians will serve the people, not themselvesSun 8 Feb 2026 08.13 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 14.52 ESTShareSo,there goes Morgan McSweeney, leaving Keir Starmer even more exposed, and the British side of the vast Jeffrey Epstein scandal still unfolding. The resignation note penned by the prime minister’s former chief of staff is as clear as it had to be, and acknowledges that McSweeney advised Starmer to make the most fateful choice of his time as Labour leader. “The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong,” it says. “He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself.” The vetting process for such decisions, it goes on, “must now be fundamentally overhauled”. But the key question festers on, and it has always been political rather than procedural: between late 2024 and early 2025, despite knowing that Mandelson had maintained his friendship with Epstein after the latter’s conviction for what US law calls soliciting prostitution from a minor, why did McSweeney, Starmer and their inner circle still conclude that he was the right man to be the UK’s ambassador in Washington DC?There is a very important contextualelement of the story, which began to surface at the end of last week, aboutthe absence of alarm – in both politics and the media– at the appointment at the time it was made, suggestive of an amazing collective amnesia about details of the Mandelson/Epstein relationship that had been made public. But even so, that doesn’t detract from the awfulness of what the prime minister and his people did, which sits at the heart of the story like an incurable headache. They surely know it, and so does everyone else: presented witha due diligence reportbased on a vivid account of what Mandelson had been up to (much of which was well known anyway), they apparently took his denials at face value. Despite warnings to the contrary – from, we now hear,the-then foreign secretary David LammyandStarmer’s then-deputy Angela Rayner– they gave Mandelson exactly what he wanted.Self-evidently, that choice involved a blithe disregard for Epstein and his associates’ victims, and the women – not least in theLabourparty – who have spent whole lifetimes campaigning against such cruelty and abuse. That plain fact, moreover, blurs into whether Starmer, McSweeney or any of the other people involved had any meaningful awareness of how Mandelson’s appointment might sooner or later look to the public. Apparently not. They made their choice, and have been hit by what they failed to foresee: not just Mandelson’s unravelling, but a hardening of many people’s contempt for both the current government and most of the structures of politics and power.As I wrote last week, I recently spent three days in the Mancunian constituency of Gorton and Denton, whose looming byelection – on 26 February – could well decide Starmer’s fate. Just before the latestMandelson scandal broke, what most people told me echoed views I have heard all around the country over the past 15 years, in the midst not just of elections, but such landmark events as theScottish independence referendumof 2014 andthe Brexit votetwo years later. Whoever they were thinking of voting for – and particularly if they were not voting at all – most people in Gorton and Denton had a bitter disdain for politics and politicians, and a belief that the whole Westminster game is largely about wealth and privilege. In Gorton’s covered market, one woman got straight to the point: “I don’t believe none of them. They don’t live how we live. My mum’s 78: she can’t afford to put the heating on, and she’s got terminal cancer. [But] they’re all right. They’re rich. Don’t set me off, honestly.”It’s tragic that a decent PM will be brought down by Mandelson’s sleaze – but it’s a matter of when, not if | Polly ToynbeeRead moreOther people I spoke to expressed the same resentment about the difference between existing at the sharp end and the pleasures of life at the top. They also talked – unprompted – about stories that may have been opportunistically seized on and twisted by politicians on the hard right, but that sit at the heart of whole swathes of public opinion: grooming gangs, the tensions surrounding housing large numbers of men in hotels used for asylum seekers, and many people’s keen sense that we live at a time of rising danger for women and girls, from men of all kinds. Even if some of those issues are often talked about in ugly ways, their place in our politics feels immovable.A YouGov pollconducted last week showed that 95% of the public were aware of the Mandelson story, with 44% following it either “very” or “fairly” closely. A huge number of people, I would imagine, vividly appreciate its defining themes: women and girls reduced to trafficked commodities, the kind of organised abuse that depended on private planes and secluded islands, the involvement of royalty, the roles in the whole terrible saga given to such fellow personifications of boundless privilege as Richard Branson, Bill Gates and Elon Musk.Think also aboutMandelson’s loathsome insistencethat he couldn’t “live by salary alone”, his frantic moves in defence of bankers’ bonuses, and his bizarre driveto pass minute-by-minute accounts of government businessto a multimillionaire financier and child sex offender. A scandal as sprawling and tangled as this one (which may now be widening intosuggestions of insider tradingandquestions over big government contracts) was always going to be a multifaceted reflection of its time. But one of its most startling aspects is how perfectly it chimes with the fears and grievances of millions of people who live metaphorical light years from where everything happened.For a long time,there have been reportsthat many voters firmly believe that Starmer was privately educated. Some think his knighthood was somehow inherited. The same people, I would imagine, would disbelieve the fact that we are now governed by the cabinet withthe largest share of comprehensive school alumniin history. One of the many consequences of the Mandelson scandal is that these views will not just be even more firmly embedded, but combined with a perfectly understandable belief that too many of the people at the top have had far too indulgent attitudes to the kind of wealth and power that tends to curdle into corruption. And, yes, you could – and probably should – say some of the same things about the rightwing populists who now present themselves as avengers of the elites. Unfortunately, in its current state, there is not much Labour can do about that.Which brings us back to that nagging question: in the wake of the decision – in 2021 – to bring Mandelson back into Labour’s uppermost circles, what explains that surreally consequential decision to make him the US ambassador? Was it somehow traceable to the presence in Starmer’s senior team ofveterans of the Blair years, still wedded to the wealth-worshipping mores of the 1990s, and guilty of a failure to understand how much the public’s perceptions of politics and power have changed since the crash of 2008, the MPs’ expenses saga, the Jimmy Savile scandal and all the rest? Did they think that so far out from the assumed date of a general election, the views of voters could safely be disregarded? Were they simply full of machismo and a careless pomposity? There is probably truth in all those things, and they shine stark light not just on this scandal, but on why Starmer’s premiership has been such a contorted disappointment.They also show that whoever turns out to be his successor – which, now McSweeney has gone, is the unavoidable Labour question –will need a lot more than another working-class backstory. There are elements in Labour who require a bracing reminder of the times we live in, the toxicity of the years when its leading figures were dazzled by money, and the urgent need for a plan – and a political narrative – to conclusively show that the party serves the people who keep society running. As a matter of urgency, they also need to be jolted into understanding that social justice, equality, feminism and the party’s other articles of faith need to define every choice it makes. In that sense, the meaning of the current crisis is obvious: if Labour cannot meet these challenges, it will look every bit as compromised and small as the man who, at the time of writing, was still nominally in charge.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionPeter MandelsonKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

In a rare interview, she talks about the shock of losing him, and how a revival of one of his plays has helped her healSun 8 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTShareAdd the Guardian on GoogleSimone Ledward Boseman is reflecting on the five years that have passed since the death of her husband, actor and writerChadwick Boseman. “The edges of grief get less sharp over time,” she says. “Five years definitely feels like a marker. I’ve had to gradually figure out how I talk about Chad. What do I want to share, and what do I feel comfortable sharing? Can I find something that I might want to share in the midst of something I don’t want to share?” We meet on a video call across time zones – it’s 9am in California, where she lives. “Except for my mom, I’m not talking to anybody before 10am,” she laughs. She’s made an exception to give a rare interview ahead of the UK premiere of her late husband’s play Deep Azure, which is currently in previews in London at Shakespeare’s Globe.When Boseman’s death was announced at the end of August 2020, the shock reverberated across the globe. He was devastatingly young – only 43 – and the world was just getting to know him. The release of the movieBlack Panthertwo years earlier, in which he played the eponymous character also known as T’Challa, had skyrocketed his fame. Before then, he had been a successful Hollywood actor. Now? He was a global megastar – the first Black superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The news was doubly shocking because the family had not previously revealed that he had been suffering with colorectal cancer.Boseman’s diagnosis in 2016 had been a closely guarded secret. “Something like a cancer diagnosis can get in the way of a lot of things,” Ledward Boseman says by way of explanation. The actor worked throughout his treatment, shooting seven movies – including Black Panther – and making countless public appearances. “He never wanted to be treated differently. A lot of the roles he did were so physical, and he still wanted to do them. He did not want to be judged by what he was experiencing. He didn’t want his diagnosis to interfere with the work.”View image in fullscreenThe couple holidaying in St Lucia.Photograph: Courtesy of Simone Ledward BosemanIn the six years they were together, there was a growing interest in Boseman, and by extension, people became interested in Ledward Boseman, too. She acknowledges that curiosity isn’t necessarily fuelled by malicious intent; that sometimes idle chatter can come from genuine concern, “but there’s that danger in any sharing, because one person says something else, then another person says something else, and then it’s on the wind. And the wind is going to carry it wherever it does,” she says. This meant that the couple’s privacy was already a priority. “When you’re in a position like Chad’s, everything you’re doing has to be protected. You just have to be careful who you tell your plans to,” she says. “And if you are someone who only wants to have deep, meaningful relationships and conversations, you very quickly come to find that your circle is going to be small because you can’t have those conversations with very many people.”When it came to people who knew about Boseman’s health, “it was a couple of family members and a couple of friends. I had my therapist and my mom, and that was basically it. The circle became a dot.”To the outside world, there were some signs he was unwell, most notably in April 2020 when heappeared on social mediato mark Jackie Robinson day during lockdown – Boseman had portrayed the first African American Major League Baseball player in the 2013 biopic 42. He hosted an Instagram Live to announce #Operation42, an initiative to send a $4.2m donation of PPE equipment to hospitals that served the African American communities hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic. During the broadcast, comments from fans rolled in expressing concern over his dramatic weight loss. But the speculation was neither confirmed nor denied and soon fizzled out under the cover of the lockdown, which offered a plausible explanation for limited sightings in the final stages of his decline.The pair met for the first time at the Hollywood Bowl in August 2014. Ledward Boseman was working at the venue as an events executive, and Boseman was there to perform a duet with D’Angelo for a James Brown tribute concert. The event marked the US release of the biopic Get On Up – in which Boseman stars as Brown – earlier that month. The first time she spoke to him it was to ask about his travel arrangements. “He looked up at me with puppy dog eyes!” she giggles as she talks about their first encounter, though she admits this detail is something they playfully disagreed about. In her version of the story, he struggled to get any words out, managing only an incoherent splutter of sounds. He, on the other hand, was adamant that he was cooler, calmer, more collected.He was really charming. Huge, huge laugh. Huge smileWhen Boseman came to soundcheck the following day, Ledward Boseman had done her hair and put on some makeup. “I was making an effort to look a little pretty for him; I felt there was maybe a spark,” she admits. Although she’d seen Boseman act in 42, she was surprised the producers at the venue were treating him as such a big deal, and was expecting a diva to show up. “He was so not that. He was really charming. Huge, huge laugh. Huge smile. And he started flirting with me. He stole my clipboard, took me by the hand and started spinning me into a dance. But he was also very aware, very respectful. He was cautious about not doing too much and also not doing anything when my bosses were around.” She watched the performance from the wings and at the end of the night as they passed each other in the hallway he took her by the hand and said: “Well, I already have your number, but can I call you?” She said yes. Their first date was in the bohemian Los Angeles neighbourhood of Franklin Village: dinner at La Poubelle, followed by a game of pool at the Bourgeois Pig. They continued dating, and two years later, they moved in together – first to a city apartment they both loved but had to leave when a neighbour’s pest control problem became unbearable. Ultimately, they settled in a house in Franklin Village, just around the corner from where they had their first date.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jessica Chou/The GuardianWhile their romance was not a secret, it was private. But that wasn’t to last. The beginning of their third year together coincided with the release of Captain America: Civil War, where Boseman made his MCU debut as T’Challa. This came with a lot more attention – not all of it positive. On a visit with Boseman to his alma mater, Howard University, Ledward Boseman was warned by a student host that she might have to “defend her Blackness” at an event she was due to attend the following day, as a Black woman of mixed heritage and a lighter skin tone (Ledward Boseman’s mother is African American and her father is Hawaiian-Japanese). “It was shocking, but it wouldn’t have been the first time I had encountered that. I grew up in a space with a lot of multiracial people but I was always made to know by schoolmates that there’s a difference. That I’m Black, but I’m not Black-Black.” After the release of Black Panther she remembers “a lot of voices on the internet” were criticising her because of her heritage. “It was a kind of pitting his real life relationship against his movie relationship [with Lupita Nyong’o],” she says.Ledward Boseman was born the youngest of two siblings in Vallejo, a small city in the San Francisco Bay Area. She was raised in a conservative religious community – predominantly by her mother, after her parents divorced when she was three years old, “though they actually have a great relationship for a couple of divorced people”, she’s quick to clarify. She has fond memories of growing up: “As a kid, my mom was a flight attendant, so we did quite a bit of travelling, which is awesome to look back on as an adult. She was flying to London and Germany, and if she ever had a layover that was more than 24 hours then we would just fly with her, which was a lot of fun. It was really special – my mom and I are really close.”‘You are all the Black Panther’: the electric theatre of Chadwick BosemanRead morePerhaps it’s because of her religious upbringing that she wasn’t particularly motivated about higher education once she finished school. People from her community were discouraged from pursuing anything that took them away from their ministry: “There’s three meetings a week, and then you’re going door-to-door a couple of times a week. You’re discouraged from making connections and associating with people not of the faith.” Rather than head to a top university like UC Berkeley or UCLA in common with her peers, Ledward Boseman planned on becoming an ultrasound technician. It was a pragmatic decision: “You get paid good money, and you can learn to do it in two years.”One day, though, she came across a flyer for a music industry studies course at California Polytechnic State University and a childhood dream of becoming a singer was reignited. Performing was out of the question for religious reasons, but she thought it could be a route to a desk job in the music industry. She was already feeling disconnected from her faith, and stopped practising before she moved to Los Angeles to begin her studies. She would live there for 10 years, falling in love with Boseman along the way. She takes a moment to think before she explains her reasons for leaving the organisation. “My mother is still very much devout – I want to be careful about how I talk about this, because I don’t want to offend her,” she says. “The issue I take with most organised religions is the way God is presented as something separate from you. I just don’t subscribe to that. I believe that God, quite literally, is love, which is what Scripture says.”Those first two years were the most challenging of my life. When you lose someone dear to you, two years might as well be two days. The shock of itWhen Boseman died, there was a great outpouring of love from people all over the world. As his wife, Ledward Boseman felt the weight of the expectation for her to grieve publicly. Was there anger from people who felt they should have been in on the secret? “I’m sure there was,” she sighs. “But I didn’t bear any of that. It’s normal to have questions but I just said, ‘If Chad didn’t talk to you about it, I’m not going to talk to you about it.’” Since his passing, she has fulfilled only a handful of public engagements. The first couple of years saw her accept a slew of awards on Boseman’s behalf – mostly for his performance in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, an adaptation of the August Wilson play that was his final film project. “Those first two years were the most challenging of my life,” she says. “When you lose someone dear to you, two years might as well be two days. The shock of it. The shock of losing that person. For a year I was still waking up, having to remember. And just completely not knowing what to do with myself. The only reason I got out of bed was because I have a dog.” The pair got a giant schnauzer together in May 2020 and named her Sophia; I can hear her protective bark in the background as we speak.In addition to grieving for her husband, Ledward Boseman had to consider how she would carry him forward in the public sphere. “There was a real swirling of feelings going on and pressures to make decisions about what his legacy would be. How do you know, while you’re still grieving? How do you know what is important to talk about and what’s not important to talk about? I’m figuring out how to step into the role I am in now while dealing with the reality that I don’t have the one person I want to talk to who can help me through all this. Also, I had just turned 30.” (Boseman died a few days before her birthday.) She is speaking slowly, pausing often, her voice occasionally unsteady. “So my response was: I’m not talking to nobody and I’m not doing nothing, which is another lesson I learned from Chad. Two, actually – he taught me that I can’t always be nice. You can always be respectful, but you can’t always be nice. He also taught me that sometimes ‘no’ is a full sentence and sometimes silence is the most eloquent response.”View image in fullscreenLupita Nyong’o, Boseman and Danai Gurira in 2018’s Black Panther.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyShe has settled on a useful guiding principle – “I don’t have to create his legacy, I just have to protect it,” she says. “I just have to make sure that it doesn’t get flattened. That’s why I love talking about him – I think it’s important that people understand him as a full human being, that they get the full picture of who he was.” The first major opportunity to do this was with the Black Panther sequel, Wakanda Forever, which was released in 2022. The decision was made early on that T’Challa would not be recast and so the script, which the film’s writer and director Ryan Coogler finished just before Boseman’s death, had to be rewritten in a way that not only explained his absence but also honoured the life of his friend. She was in touch with Coogler throughout the process. I ask her about the speech T’Challa’s love interest, Nakia – played by Lupita Nyong’o – makes towards the end of the movie: “He was King and Black Panther to everyone. But to me, he was everything. My T’Challa.” It’s poignant, as if Ledward Boseman herself is addressing the world – did she know that was in there? “Ryan did specifically ask me about that scene. The only thing I added to it was that she said his name.”In March 2023, Ledward Boseman accepted an invitation to the White House where she gave a speech advocating for those affected by colorectal cancer. Talking about Boseman in cancer-specific spaces is something she continues to be cautious about: “I never want his life story to be distilled down to the way that he died. I want his life to be about the way that he lived.” She’s slowly becoming more vocal about the disadvantages faced by Black communities when it comes to knowledge and resources to combat the disease. “Chad’s case was not unique, and I was shocked to find out that information. Livid.” Connecting with individuals who understand the experience was healing; she also came to understand that her presence was healing for other people. “I wanted to approach this group not as the partner of a famous person, but as a widow who had lost her husband to colorectal cancer. I felt for the first time part of this community.”THIS WEEK, one of Boseman’s plays, Deep Azure, is being revived for a nine-week run at Shakespeare’s Globe theatre in London. It will be the biggest professional production of the piece since Boseman himself first staged it more than 20 years ago. The play tells the story of the aftermath of the death of an unarmed Black man, Deep, who is murdered by a police officer. It mirrors a real life situation Boseman experienced while studying at Howard University. His friend, fellow student Prince Jones, was murdered by a Black police officer in September 2000. “It’s about what’s happening to the characters and how they’re dealing with their grief both individually and collectively,” says director Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu. “Survival is demanded of us, but how do we get there?” There is something poetic about staging Boseman’s play about grieving a prominent Black man in the wake of an untimely death in this moment.Deep Azure is not an immediately obvious choice for Shakespeare’s Globe. London-based Fynn-Aiduenu discovered the script in an anthology of plays, while researching hip-hop theatre in early 2020. Fynn-Aiduenu also found out that Boseman had strong links not only to the UK theatre scene, but also to Shakespeare specifically. He studied the Bard at Balliol College, Oxford, with the British American Drama Academy – paid for by Denzel Washington – an opportunity facilitated by the actor Phylicia Rashad, who was a teacher and mentor to Boseman during his time at Howard.“I want audiences to celebrate and be inspired by the multifaceted life of Chadwick Boseman, which includes his playwriting,” says the director. “I want to create a safe space in which to explore Black communal grief.”Ledward Boseman didn’t read the play until after Boseman’s death. It has only ever been professionally performed once – in a 2005 production by Congo Square Theatre Company in Chicago. “I think, like most artists, sometimes it can be hard to share things that are from so long ago because it doesn’t always feel like they still represent who you are now as an artist. And then after he passed, it was really difficult to read the play. To see him. In the end, it was incredibly healing for me, but I had to take it in very small steps.” She has had some involvement in the London production – mostly approving edits to help contextualise the play for a British audience, but is yet to get to the end of the script – both because “it was just challenging to read and also because I still want to be surprised”. In their relationship, Boseman routinely kept the details of his projects under wraps while he was working on them so that she could experience the work as an audience member. Not reading all of the play is her way of continuing to honour that tradition.View image in fullscreenThe couple on holiday.Photograph: Courtesy of Simone Ledward BosemanWe had to lean on each other so heavily, and we got so close. And, oh my God – he was just so beautiful!She remembers 2018 as the couple’s best year together. Black Panther had made $1.3bn on its initial release, breaking numerous box office records. It was the most successful launch for a non-sequel superhero film. “They were opening up theatres in countries where movies had been banned for 20 years just so people could watch this movie. He had worked so hard to make it what it was. And it was this full circle moment in his life where he got to use so much knowledge that he had been gathering over the last two decades in this film. A beautiful, beautiful moment,” she says.But the main reason Ledward Boseman thinks so fondly of that year is that for the majority of it, Boseman was cancer-free. Getting through the two years following the initial diagnosis really galvanised their relationship. “We had to lean on each other so heavily, and we got so close. And, oh my God – he was just so beautiful! He’d been doing all those Black Panther workouts and he was just, sofine!” She elongates the vowel sounds in the word, as if the one syllable does not adequately convey the level of attractiveness she is trying to describe.Remission gave Boseman a renewed zest for life: “Imagine you’re ready to live a hundred times beyond what you’ve already been doing. Our appreciation for each other, his appreciation for his own time – it was just a really, really beautiful year. We were travelling, seeing the world, and we were so in love.” At the end of that year, the cancer had not only returned, but progressed, and the couple found themselves teetering between pragmatism and faith. “To acknowledge what might happen almost felt like a betrayal of that faith. So there wasn’t any talk around him not making it.”We found a way to celebrate in the midst of all this sadness, and hopelessness, and griefIf Ledward Boseman has any regrets, this is one of them. “Sometimes I wish we had been able to talk about those things, so that he could even start to dream about it – and look at death with less fear. I would have liked to be more comfortable asking him what he wanted. Not just for himself, but for me, for his family. When we did talk about it, he told me it made him happy to know we were going to be OK.”The two of them first started talking about marriage in the aftermath of the diagnosis in 2016, “when it was early and we weren’t scared of it. It was all full steam ahead, but then he started to express some concerns about the ‘what ifs’. They’re such hard conversations to have – but I had to explain that it wasn’t going to hurt less if we weren’t married.” They finally got engaged in the autumn of 2019, after which Boseman’s health quickly took a turn for the worse. There was no doubt that one of the things he wanted to do in the time he had left was get married. When describing their wedding, the first thing Ledward Boseman thinks to say is that it was a hard day. There’s a long silence before she continues, “We found a way to celebrate in the midst of all this sadness, and hopelessness, and grief.” The gathering was small: her sister helped her get ready; her parents walked her down the aisle.View image in fullscreenHair and makeup: Moni SebestyenPhotograph: Jessica Chou/The GuardianIt would be wrong to assume Ledward Boseman now has little time for anything but serving her husband’s legacy. She is clear that’s not the case: “He would be upset if I made my life about his life.” She recently moved from Los Angeles back to Vallejo to be closer to family. She’s deep in the planning stages of her first business venture – a neighbourhood wine bar in her home city. She’s also been working on her music career as a singer under her artist name, sahn, performing around the US – including at the Apollo Music Café in New York. Her second album, the garden, will be released in May this year.“From the point I met Chad, it’s been hard to talk about myself and my work without talking about him. He just changed my whole life and my perspective of my life – he was my most important spiritual teacher. My mother laid the foundation for my spirituality and my artistic practice, but Chad expanded that view astronomically.”And she loves talking about Boseman, because she says to talk about him is to remember him. “I love knowing that he lived and his spirit still does. I love being able to commune with him in the spirit now, which is the hardest thing about grief – trying to rebuild a connection you once had in the physical that you now only have in the spiritual. There’s this poem that I read very early on that speaks about continuing to say their name –” She stops to do an internet search for the poem, Death is Nothing at All by Henry Scott Holland, and then reads: “Call me by the old familiar name. Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. Put no difference in your tone. Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.”Deep Azure runs until 11 April at the Globe theatre’s Sam Wanamaker Playhouse,shakespearesglobe.comExplore more on these topicsChadwick BosemanBlack PantherMarvelCancerHealthinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But as he publishes his memoir, why does he believe the artform he made  his name in is in such decline?Rebecca LiuSun 8 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 07.50 ESTShareRoger Deakins – cinematographer to theCoen brothers, Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes, whose work has earned him 14 Oscar nominations and two wins, five Baftas, a knighthood and a reputation for being the greatest practitioner of his craft alive – is struggling to explain just exactly what he does. “Argh!” he exclaims, when confronted by the question: what is cinematography?“Well, I started off trying to be a still photographer, someone like Don McCullin. And it’s been a whole arc through cinematography. Now what is cinematography? I don’t know. It’s very different from still photography. But the essentials are the same. You’re trying to tell a visual story.” It is “very much a collaboration”, he continues; working with “hundreds of people” on films can be a “wonderful experience … I suppose I’m not answering your question, because actually I’ve got no idea,” he says. “The cliche is visual storytelling, but it’s much more than that.”The “visual storytelling” he’s done throughout his 50-year career has been spectacular and immense, encompassing the austere desert landscapes ofNo Country for Old Mento the hallucinatory urban vistas ofBlade Runner 2049. He’s captured the rich, dream-like imagery of Martin Scorsese’s Dalai Lama biopic Kundun, the shadowy action of James Bond’sSkyfall, and – to go back to one of his earliest feature films – the tragic romance of Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and girlfriend Nancy Spungen in Sid and Nancy, set against the golden age of punk in London, Paris and New York. That film shoot, in 1985, was his first proper trip to the US; he had no idea then that he’d be back.Today he is in his Santa Monica home, wearing a baggy black T-shirt and rectangular spectacles secured in place by a glasses cord. His conversational manner is off-the-cuff, straight-talking, devoid of any pretensions while displaying quiet assurance in his own judgments. “I can rattle on for ages,” he jokes, and you can easily imagine him idly shooting the breeze while pursuing his other great love: fishing in Devon, where he grew up. I wonder how that disposition survives in the notoriously egoistic and political world that is Hollywood.View image in fullscreenBowled over … Jeff Bridges in the Deakins-shot Big Lebowski.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyA clearer picture emerges when speaking to his wife, James Ellis Deakins, who joins him today. The two met on set of the 1992 thriller Thunderheart, when she was a script consultant, and have since worked as a team on film sets, with James coordinating communication with the production team and other departments. Where Deakins sprawls and gesticulates and flits from one thought to another, James sits upright, a pink scarf tucked above her (not baggy) black shirt, arms neatly folded, eyes focused in concentration. She will often supply crucial context, pick up on strands Deakins has missed – and subtly rein him in whenever he’s in danger of becoming too indiscreet.“But isn’t the cinematographer also thinking,” she adds, after Deakins admits to being lost, “how can I tell the story visually in the frame?” To consider how to frame, light and compose a film shot so it will convey the requisite joy or sadness or fear. Say “there’s a shot that makes you feel melancholy or afraid, and you don’t know why”. For James, a cinematographer has succeeded when their camerawork encapsulates the feeling of the story. “Because it’s so visceral, people might not come out of the theatre and go: ‘That was great cinematography.’ They just think: ‘Oh, it’s a great movie; I was so scared.’ But they don’t know the cinematography helped that.”1984 was the first film where I did a lot of studio work. It felt like a real movie. I thought: How did I get here? I want moreA fuller picture of the craft emerges in Deakins’s new book, Reflections: On Cinematography. Co-written with James, it’s part memoir, part technical guide that takes readers behind the scenes of his projects throughout his career. In it, a cinematographer emerges as not only the director of camerawork, but also a sculptor of light; a watcher of the weather; a fleet-footed problem solver and illusionist; and, in Deakins’s case, a leader of a technical crew who have long become collaborators.Deakins takes us behind how he mimicked daylight in the blacked-out factory that served as the central cell block in The Shawshank Redemption (skylights in the ceiling with diffusion panels). It was so successful that, months later, he was amused to overhear a fellow cinematographer question the film’s award nominations, because he had erroneously assumed it had been shot in natural light.Many an hour is spent waiting for the right weather conditions to appear: for snow on the Coen brothers’ Fargo, or for the clouds to roll in on Sam Mendes’s 1917 (as the film appears as one long take, the lighting had to be consistent). Deakins is delighted when his dolly operator finds a lo-fi way to film a tumbling bowling ball in The Big Lebowski – they pushed the camera down the alley with a pole – and for Skyfall,  Deakins’s chief electrician lit the back of Liverpool Street station in vivid green, in order to mimic the colour palette of Shanghai, where the scene was supposed to take place, as well as disguise the area to sharp-eyed Londoners.Writing the book has prompted plenty of reflection. “I think my career path has been unlikely. It certainly seems unlikely if I look back at myself at 16,” Deakins says. It strikes me that his work may soon appear unlikely for a whole new set of reasons. He and James also wrote the book, he says, because “the film industry is in a bit of a decline at the moment”.Hollywood is now confronting the arrival of artificial intelligence from an already convulsive backdrop of diminished earnings, the rise of streaming and the dominance of franchise reboots and superhero films that rely heavily on green screens and CGI. Deakins’s work – known for its naturalistic, even painterly, scenes, with delicate interplays of light and shadow – may well soon look like a rarity; the stuff of legend from a fast-disappearing past.Deakins’s childhood in Torquay was not particularly happy: “It led me to be a bit angry.” His parents met during the second world war: his father, William, was an explosives expert with the Royal Engineers and his mother, Josephine, served in the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force. She developed multiple sclerosis in 1949, the year Roger was born, became bedridden, and died nine years later. Meanwhile, Roger spent his teenage years indulging in occasional “excessive drinking” and skipping his studies to go fishing. “I was lost,” he says. He loved watching films in the five local cinemas around Torquay, and was moved in particular by Stanley Kubrick’s Dr Strangelove and Peter Watkins’s The War Game, but never thought of it as something he could do himself.All he knew then was that he didn’t want to work at a bank: a fate that his school teachers had said would be the “highlight of his life”. Off he went to art school in Bath, where he developed an interest in photography, but still didn’t have a sense of a career. The National Film School was soon accepting its first intake: he was rejected, but was told he’d be allowed in the year after. In the meantime, he took on a job photographing life in north Devon, capturing a community being pushed into modernity through the arrival of mass tourism.View image in fullscreenThe war game … George MacKay in a scene from 1917 directed by Sam Mendes and shot by Roger Deakins.Photograph: François Duhamel/APThe first time Deakins had a sense that cinematography was his calling was only when he was in his mid-30s, on the set of Michael Radford’s adaptation of 1984. He had done plenty of camerawork before then: he shot documentaries that took him to Zimbabwe during the war of independence; followed yachtsman John Ridgway’s journey sailing round the world; and also shot music videos for Eric Clapton, Meat Loaf and Marvin Gaye. However, it was on the set of 1984, the “first film where I did a lot of studio work” and “felt like it was a real movie”, where he thought: “Wow. How did I get here? I want more.”The arc of his career recalls another figure who grew up in a British town far outside the metropole, who found his way into feature film-making relatively late before becoming a Hollywood grandee: Ridley Scott. Scott has credited his early career in advertising with his later success in movies. Did Deakins’s circuitous journey also prove useful?There’s a certain director who used to operate the camera himself. We agreed that wasn’t going to work. I operate the cameraDocumentaries “gave me a lot of confidence”, he says. “That was the thing I was really lacking as a kid: the experience of life and travelling, and seeing there are many things to worry about than what’s happening in your own interior.”“From a practical viewpoint,” James adds, “when you’re shooting a documentary, you’re shooting something that’s only going to happen once. So you have to determine what angles are the best, you have to do it quickly. You don’t get a second chance.”Deakins believes his adventurous early jobs were important in his development. “Life experience is something that is not talked about a lot,” he says of the industry. “I think some of the directors that are raised in the bubble of the film world, they keep reinventing the same damn movies. They don’t really reach out outside of their movie world.”Part of the reason why cinematography might be so hard to define is that the job can vary greatly between directors. His longstanding collaboration with the Coen brothers began in 1991 with the comedy Barton Fink, and has extended on to A Serious Man, True Grit and others. Deakins says the pair are “very knowledgable and quite specific about every aspect of a film”, with a “clear idea visually of what they want. Some people might say that might be restricting for a cinematographer, but I find it refreshing because you start at a point and can work further. Another director I’ve worked with, I’m not going to say the name, said: ‘I don’t know anything about the camera, but I want you to do that, and I just want to concentrate on the script and acting.’”Meeting a director is kind of like “interviewing a potential roommate”, James says: you’re trying to determine whether you’d work well together. “I’ve always loved operating the camera,” Deakins says. “There’s a certain director whose name you mentioned earlier” – which makes James laughs and wave her hand about in mock exasperation – “who I’ve been to interviews with, who always used to operate the camera himself. We agreed at the end of the interview it wasn’t going to work. Because I operate the camera, and he operated the camera. So how’s that going to work?” The director in question is, judging from hispast comments, Ridley Scott.“And yet you guys got along so well,” James adds, “and always do every time we run into him.”Deakins’s insistence on operating the camera himself, it seems, reflects a broader principle he values in his work: specificity and intentionality. “I don’t like shooting films with dozens of cameras,” he says. “I like the precision, that’s why I’ve loved working with Joel and Ethan [Coen], and with Denis [Villeneuve.] … I love that process of finding the scene rather than shooting a lot of stuff and finding it in the cutting room. That’s just sloppy and lazy.” He prefers “stripping things down to the basics”; his still photography tends to capture desolate, mournful scenes in black and white. Good cinematography, for Deakins, shouldn’t announce itself; in fact, it shouldn’t be noticed at all. He and James recently rewatched the 1963 Paul Newman film Hud, directed by Martin Ritt with cinematography by the pioneer James Wong Howe. “It’s magnificent. Everything about it is so simple, and so precise and deliberate. But you’re totally immersed in the characters and the world it creates.”By contrast, “so often, especially on modern movies, you see the camera swooping all over the place, flashy coloured lighting. It’s just a distraction, because it makes you aware that you’re watching the movie.” Other pet peeves: lens flare (also distracting); excessive cuts (can drain the tension out of a scene); overenthusiastic and unthinking adoption of new technology (“How often do you watch a TV series, and when they cut to a wide shot it’s actually done by a drone? And you go: ‘Oh no, another one.’”)The world changes; people get their entertainment from different sources now. It’s just a natural evolutionFilm sets can be famously stressful places. In his book, Deakins recounts being publicly insulted by directors; once, a night shoot was held up while its lead actors sparred over whose trailer would park closest to the set. He doesn’t seem like someone who is happy to indulge egos, as seen by his marked lack of interest when I ask about his two – and to many, wildly overdue – Oscars (“It’s the work that matters, not all that stuff”).“Where I lose my patience is when I don’t feel people have the passion, or make the most of opportunities,” he says. “I find it really hard to put up with. I’m not the easiest person to get on with on set, frankly.”“That’s not true, actually,” counters James.“Well I don’t know, people say that.”“Well, people who are actually there and working love working with you, because you’re so focused and ready to do it. It’s the politics you’re not good at.”The Hollywood that Deakins grew up admiring – he references multiple Paul Newman films – is very different from the Hollywood of today. He’s not a fan of big action films: when Sam Mendes called him about shooting Skyfall, the first thing the director said was: “Don’t put the phone down when I tell you what I’m doing next.” I ask Deakins about something he’s previously said: “I’m nostalgic for the kind of films that used to be made that aren’t being made any more.”“Don’t be too bitter,” cautions James.“The world changes,” Deakins says even-handedly, “people get their entertainment from different sources now, it’s just a natural evolution.Would they make Hud today? Probably not.”“There are less character-based movies,” adds James. “‘Event’ movies are great to see and fun, but it’s also nice to have ‘character movies’ to learn about how a different human being is. That’s what we’re missing.”Meanwhile, there has also been a backlash against the state of cinematography. Aviral essayon the archetypical Netflix film criticised its “terrible lighting”, and how scenes look “both oversaturated and flat, with the blacks brightened and the highlights dulled”.Legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins’ best photograph: Weston-super-Mare in the rainRead more“I think part of the reason is that [digital camera] technologies have advanced to such a state that you don’t have to light a shot,” Deakins says. Beforehand, when you had to think about how to reproduce the effect of, say, car headlights coming on to a road at night, you “had to make decisions about light and shade”. Now, James says, “producers don’t want to spend the time on lighting, because if you can see the image, then you must have it. So the whole concept of making the [camera] frame tell the story, alongside the dialogue, has been disappearing.” It is increasingly popular, Deakins says, to “shoot something fairly flat and manipulate it” in post-production. As for AI? “All I’ve experienced is the real world, and shooting a film on location, and that collaborative process,” he says. “I don’t want to experience 24 weeks on a volume [a wall made of LED screens] with a virtual reality background.”All this may suggest the pair have begun to turn their backs on the film world, but they are busy running theirTeam Deakins podcastandwebsite, which they hope demystifies the industry for newcomers. They do considerable outreach: the website hosts a forum where they chat with all manner of posters – even students seeking help with their school projects. Deakins is also working on his second book of photography. Although they have dedicated much of their lives to the film world, they’re keen to maintain a sense of perspective. “Oftentimes, in the business, people tend to think this is the most important thing in the world,” says James.“I met a farmer once, and he was doing a stone wall up in Dartmouth,” Deakins says. “They just lay these stones together without any mortar or anything. It’s just brilliant what they do. And he was just loving the work.“Isn’t that just life?” he continues. “You’ve got to love what you do, whatever it is. It doesn’t have to be film-making; it can be anything.”Reflections: On Cinematography by Roger Deakins is published by Octopus on Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFilmCoen brothersSam MendesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s hard to imagine the frantic toil of such an endeavour. But watching this adaptation from Kyoto-based company, ChitenTheatre, will give you a taster: it is a dizzying, challenging 90 minutes – especially for those not familiar with the plot.Constructed from fragments of Dostoevsky’s text – which charts the ricocheting financial and romantic fortunes of roulette addict Alexei Ivanovich, and the family he tutors for – it is delivered in Japanese at largely break-neck speed, subtitles vying for attention with a spinning set, kooky dancing and a cast that bang billiard balls on a central table before they speak. The thrashings of onstage rock trio, Kukangendai, adds to the theatrical onslaught.If you can fight the overwhelm, though, there is much invention to admire. Itaru Sugiyama’s roulette-wheel set, and the cast sat atop it, are kept spinning not by some hidden mechanism but by the increasingly frenzied pushes of an exhausted Alexei – a neat representation of the thrills and drudgery of gambling addiction. Above, a circle of LEDs glow in series, tracking the roulette ball on which so many fates hang.View image in fullscreenDynamic … a scene from The Gambler.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDirector Motoi Miura abandons naturalism for rhythmic dialogue and highly stylised movements. Mostly these emphasise, to chest-tightening effect, the characters’ financial precarity. But there is humour – led by Satoko Abe’s outspoken Grandmother – and shrewd nods to Dostoevsky’s discussions of Russian and European traits, with each character given a signature move and phrase. “HA HA HA!” barks Mademoiselle Blanche, the woman who will marry Alexei’s employer only if his wealthy grandmother dies, her hands moving up and down like weighing scales as she dispassionately deliberates.The dynamic, seven-strong cast are ably led by Takahide Akimoto, whose ferocious, babbling monologues as Alexei reveal the depths and danger of his obsessions with roulette and his employer’s stepdaughter, Polina.This production is not for those who enjoy watching a story unfold through its characters’ connections. The cast recount rather than enact much of the plot, and even lines meant for one another are delivered to the audience. But if you’re looking to be immersed in the panicked slog of addiction, then ready your chips.At the Coronet theatre, London, until 15 February.Explore more on these topicsTheatreFyodor DostoevskyreviewsShareReuse this content"

On the surface Mozart and Da Ponte’s opera is full of cynicism, cruelty and outdated sexual politics: if a production skates over these, isn’t that a cop-out? Now, though –and this week in particular– you could argue thatPhelim McDermott’s 2014 ENO staginglands as something of a relief, serving up those issues with a witty garnish and presenting them as sheer entertainment.The overture sets up what’s to come: in front of a lamé curtain, 12 circus performers unfold themselves one by one from a trunk, carrying placards promising Lust! Intrigue! Big Arias! This staging has its tongue firmly in its cheek from the start. The setting is Coney Island in the 1950s: Act 1 is Happy Days meets motel farce, thanks to the nimbly rotating walls of Tom Pye’s set, with Guglielmo and Ferrando channelling the Fonz in their disguises.There’s a lot of potential distraction – from those dozen extras, who bend, tumble, sword-swallow and fire-eat their way through the show, and to a lesser extent from the ENO chorus as the mostly silent fair-goers (is that a real candy-floss machine?). But our attention stays where it needs to. By the end even the circus performers seem to know that they’re not the main attraction here – something even more mind-boggling has been going on in their midst. Nor is the cynicism one-sided. When Guglielmo rants about women’s fickleness he is watched from behind the hamburger stand by an increasingly large posse of the female extras, looking bored and unimpressed as they wipe the beer glasses.

Jeremy Sams’s agile, funny translation of the text comes across clearly, the harpsichord zipping along underneath. Andrew Foster-Williams is on superb form as spivvy Don Alfonso, just occasionally offering a tantalising glimpse of self-doubt, and Darwin Prakash andJoshua Bluemake a nice double act as Guglielmo and Ferrando, Blue especially standing out for the smooth line of his tenor and his warmth on stage.Meanwhile, Taylor Raven’s quieter but well-sung Dorabella is a good foil for an outstanding Fiordiligi from the sopranoLucy Crowe: her Act 2 aria, sung from a Ferris-wheel carriage, is a rare but effective moment of intense focus. Ailish Tynan is on cracking form as Despina, balancing mischievous energy with the sense of having seen it all before. Why two such respectable girls are staying unchaperoned at her cheap motel is unclear – but such nitpicking questions are beside the point.

Has it come of age? Not exactly. It sounds very much of its time, all jaggy riff and angsty yelp. Yet the Newcastle band play the hell out of these songs. They sound better now than back then.They won’t perform the album in full and in order, Smith explains. They’ll throw in tracks from other records. “But,” he reassures, “you will probably hear 97% of it.”Lacking a pie chart, let’s just say the selection is well judged. The inclusion of recent-ish single Favourite Songs feels pointed. Smith sings the opening words – “My best years are behind me” – with a finger in the air, and then pats his chest in mild defiance: “But I’m damned if I’m giving up.”Anniversary shows often carry this unspoken question: how to stay dignified and present when selling tickets based on youthful success? Maxïmo Park achieve it through split-atom energy, a dash of humour and the sort of chops you develop from years on the road.Much attention, understandably, is given to Smith’s stage moves; his pointing technique is such that he could understudy Jarvis Cocker. Worth saying, though, that he has become an impressive singer. The held note at the end of I Want You to Stay is thrilling, and they do well to follow it with Versions of You. A tender reflection on parenthood and absence, it may be their best song.The rest of the band keep things modest. Guitarist Duncan Lloyd, a human shrug, cranks out tune after tune as if they have nothing to do with him. Only Jemma Freese, exuberant on keys, comes close to pulling focus from the frontman.They end with Going Missing. One last banger, one last leap from the drums.

At the mercy of the systems that determine which corridors open and when, and who gets routed where, an overwhelmed customer service agent suggested I charter a boat to nearby St Maarten, fly to Amsterdam, and then stitch together a series of flights to avoid the affected airspace. I understood the Caribbean, then, less as a string of proximate islands and, instead, as a set of routes connected by powers elsewhere.Power doesn’t just regulate airspace, it also governs cultural transmission – who gets broadcast, who gets heard, and on what terms. That’s why thehandwringingoverthe Puerto Rican artistBad Bunnyheadlining the Super Bowl halftime show, and the characterization of his almost exclusive use of Spanish in his music as an intrusion, feel so disingenuous. The drama isn’t about understanding the lyrics. Rather it’s a claim about Bad Bunny and his music as fundamentally un-American, stemming from a fear of feeling left out, or the more colloquially known fear of missing out (Fomo).Feelings of Fomo usually go in one of two directions: they either sour into resentment or they’re leavened by productive curiosity. While some are promoting bespoke counter-events to watch during halftime, such as Turning Point USA’s so-called All-American Halftime Show, my neighbor Susie has been spending a few minutes every night at the dinner table with her kids, going over the appropriately slack pronunciation ofmás beso’ y abrazo. Some folks crash out, others tap in. Both reactions are shaped by the same routes of power that decide what it sounds like to be American, and what gets stiff-armed as foreign.The US has long relied on the Caribbean while insisting the region remains culturally elsewhere. Puerto Rico’s status as an unincorporated territory was engineered to keep it close enough to claim (to own, that is), while still withholding full belonging from its inhabitants. There’s nuance to this arrangement, of course. Empire relies on these hidden infrastructures, ones that create invisible borders between places and people.Caribbean artists, for their part, make these invisible borders graspable – often dance- and sing-along-worthy, too. Much of what I know about the shape of imperialism comes through Caribbean sounds: Peter Tosh, The Mighty Sparrow, Singing Sandra and Ruben Blades, to name a few. Before I could understand exactly what they meant when they sang about freedom, liberation and colonization, the sticky melodies and body-rocking rhythms kept me close long enough to learn more and learn better.That’s why I’m not moved by the claim that music sung in Spanish willalienateviewers. Bunny’s 2022 song El Apagón, for example, references the frequent blackouts in Puerto Rico’s long run of infrastructural failures – an electrical grid left to rot and wider colonial abandonment. Over a heavy percussive beat, stripped of its digital sheen, the song sounds out the lo-tech conditions named in its title, The Blackout. It’s still a party song; it makes you move, but the political center is unavoidable. Caribbean music like Bad Bunny’s – inflected with reggaeton and its dembow backbone, alongside salsa and bomba, fortified by trap and their diasporic cousins – performed on a stage like the Super Bowl halftime show is an invitation into a shared situation, and people want in.My point isn’t that music is universal or that Bad Bunny’s is a transcendentally global sound. It is not. It is very specifically rooted in and routed through his island home. His music doesn’t transcend language so much as it holds our attention long enough to do the actual labor of getting beyond surface lyrics. It invites us to do the work of figuring it out, and that feels especially poignant (crucial, even) in a political landscape where nativism is dressed up as logic and fear is marketed as patriotism.In a time of waning attention spans, what conservative critics of Bad Bunny are forgetting – willfully or not – is that contemporary audiences consume music with unlimited study guides. Throughout his career, Bad Bunny’s music videos have done the heavy lifting for those of us who don’t immediately understand his colloquial Puerto Rican Spanish. On his most recent project, Debí Tirar Más Fotos(DtMF), the music videos (short films, really) tell moving stories of change, loss, family, immigration and a desire to have a good time. What people may lack in comprehension of a foreign language is made up for by myriadtranslations,tutorials, and real people who are happy to spell out stakes and clarify meanings.One captivating moment during this year’s Grammys came when the South African–born Trevor Noah sang the lyrics to the single DtMF back to El Conejo Malo himself. Noah was modeling a contemporary ethic of listening: an ordinary willingness to cross a small distance for the payoff of mutual recognition. So many people are waiting for a similar moment while watching the halftime show.When fear is being peddled as nationalism, the productive curiosity that Fomo can inspire becomes a counterforce – an imperfect one, surely, but catalyzing nonetheless. And in a moment defined by so many fears – fear of the future, or the felt absence of one – many of us are choosing the work of joining in over fearing each other.Jessica Swanston Baker is an associate professor of music at the University of Chicago who specializes in contemporary Caribbean popular music.Explore more on these topicsBad BunnySuper BowlSuper Bowl LXPuerto RicocommentShareReuse this content"

RetaliateFaced with economic coercion, Europe has trodden carefully. My experience tells me that’s not enoughEdward FishmanSun 8 Feb 2026 07.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 8 Feb 2026 12.46 ESTShareIn February of last year, Donald Trump convened the first full cabinet meeting of his second term in the White House. He proudly announced his intention to impose sweeping tariffs on the US’s closest allies in Europe. When asked by a reporter whether Europe might retaliate, Trump sounded confident. “They can’t,”he said. Pressed to explain, he continued: “We are the pot of gold. We’re the one that everybody wants. And they can retaliate, but it cannot be a successful retaliation.” As Trump saw it, Europe was weak and feckless – a minnow compared with the American economic juggernaut. When confronted with a US president prepared to throw his country’s weight around, Europe would certainly cave.Having spent years in the state department designing and negotiating sanctions, I’ve seen how economic pressure worksIn the year since, Trump has repeatedly wielded America’s economic might against Europe, from coercing the EU and the UK to swallow lopsided trade deals to pressuring Denmark to sell him Greenland. And time and again, his assessment of European countries – that they would scurry to him, hat in hand, eager to make a deal – has been vindicated.To survive another three years of Trump, European leaders will need a different approach. Having spent years as a state department official designing and negotiating sanctions, I’ve seen how economic pressure works in practice – and how it can fail when the target is prepared to absorb pain and push back.India, Brazil and China have faced similar Trumpian economic coercion and managed to survive while preserving their core interests. In the process, they demonstrated that they are serious geo­economic players who can’t be bullied. Though their strategies differed, each combined three elements: resolve, resilience and retaliation. Europe will need all three to withstand Trump with its dignity intact.The first step is to rally public support for defiance. While losing access to the US market is painful – after all, the US is the world’s biggest importer – for most countries, it’s survivable. India is a case in point. Last summer, piqued by the refusal of its prime minister, Narendra Modi, to nominate him for the Nobel peace prize, Trump slapped a 50% levy on India, making it among the most heavily tariffed countries in the world. Instead of hastily penning a Nobel nomination letter, Modi dug in his heels. “India will never compromise on the interests of its farmers, livestock rearers and fisherfolk,”he declared.Modi’s resolve galvanised the Indian people. Lawmakerscoordinated boycottsof American products, andbusinesses refusedto cut prices to keep selling into the US market. Eventually, Trump grew frustrated and turned his attention elsewhere. By rejecting appeasement and standing ready to endure short-term pain, India survived Trump’s onslaught and gained grudging respect in the White House.The second step is to redirect trade. Around the same time his relationship with Modi broke down, Trump picked a fight with Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Lula had committed the sin of allowing his government to prosecute his predecessor, the rightwing populist Jair Bolsonaro, for plotting a coup after his 2022 electoral defeat. To try to force Lula to drop the charges, Trump slapped steep tariffs on Brazilian goods and imposed sanctions on the supreme court judge who was overseeing Bolsonaro’s case.Brazil’s response centred on adaptation. Instead of scrambling to regain access to the US, Lula’s government moved quickly to reorient to other markets. Shipments of beef and coffee that had been heading for America were rerouted to China, the Gulf and south-east Asia, aided by state-backed finance and quiet coordination with buyers. By the end of the year, Brazilian exports had hit a record high, while US consumers grumbled about rising prices for their morning coffee. Having failed to force Lula’s hand, Trump ultimatelyremoved the tariffsand lifted sanctions on the Brazilian judge. By showing Brazil’s resilience to US pressure, Lula stripped Trump of his leverage.The third and final step is retaliation. During Trump’s first term, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, met a group of CEOs before the opening round of US tariffs took effect. “In the west, you have the notion that if somebody hits you on the left cheek, you turn the other cheek,”Xi said. “In our culture, we punch back.”At the time, Beijing was unprepared for an economic war. But it started meticulously mapping the choke points it could one day weaponise against the US. When Trump returned to the White House and swiftly unleashed a new wave of tariffs and tech restrictions on China, Beijing unveiled its plan: in addition to reciprocating Trump’s sky-high duties, it cut off America’s access to the rare-earth minerals it needs to build everything from automobiles to fighter jets. As China refines 90% of the global supply of these minerals, the impact was immediate, forcing companies such as Ford and Suzuki to close factories. The one-two punch of the tariffs and rare-earth restrictions erased trillions from the US stock market and raised fears of a recession. Trump hurriedly agreed to a truce, and within months he was allowing Chinese firms to buypowerful Nvidia AI chipsand referring to the US and China asthe “G2”.The Greenland crisis was not the first time Trump has threatened economic war against Europe, and it won’t be the last. Europe needs a strategy.Like Modi, European leaders must show resolve – rallying their publics to accept some economic pain in defence of their autonomy. A number of leaders have started moving in this direction, but the effort remains uneven, and Trump will read division as weakness. Like Lula, Europe will also need to improve economic resilience. This is where it has made the greatest progress, with the EU concludingnew trade pactswith South American countries andIndia.But any European strategy will fail unless it also learns from Xi. Retaliation makes many in Europe uncomfortable, and for good reason. Yet the transatlantic relationship is not one of one-way dependence; it is one of interdependence. Silicon Valley earns a large share of its profits in Europe. American ambitions to manufacture advanced semiconductors at home would crash without Dutch chipmaking equipment. European investors own $8tn of US stocks and bonds.Europe’s goal, of course, should not be to play all these cards. The result would be economic calamity for both sides. What Europe needs is something simpler and more credible: a plan to play some of them when the next crisis arrives.Over the past year, Europe has learned that Trump’s economic threats won’t just go away on their own. They stop only when they become expensive.Edward Fishman is director of the Center for Geoeconomic Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author ofChokepoints: How Economic Warfare Is Changing the World (published by Elliott & Thompson in the UK and Portfolio in the US).Further readingThe Economic Consequences of Mr Trump: What the Trade War Means for the Worldby Philip Coggan (Profile, £7.99)The Fractured Age: How the Return of Geopolitics Will Splinter the Global Economyby Neil Shearing (John Murray, £25)The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Five Hundred Years of History of Fluctuating Economic Muscle and Military Mightby Paul Kennedy (William Collins, £16.99)Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe big ideafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It features the kind of couple who find their partner’s way of breathing offensive – or just that the other isstillbreathing. She wishes him dead, he pretends to rise above it but is biding his time. They seem to exist on co-dependent hate, not love.So if in bleakest British mid-winter this Nordic blast of nihilism seems too chilly a prospect to sit through, there is a surprise afoot: Richard Eyre’s candescent adaptation brings comedy and tenderness alongside the savagery. Strindberg’s couple is turned from merely horrible to humorously, movingly, horrible.It is awful yet entertaining as they fight it out on Ashley Martin-Davis’s drawing room set design, full of long-faded grandeur. You can see the play’s influence on Edward Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf but here the existential depth and questioning enters into the realm of tragicomedy with black laughs.Also directed by Eyre, it is helped by two astonishing lead actors in Will Keen as the ailing army captain, Edgar, and Lisa Dillon as his thwarted wife, Alice – a one time actor who repeatedly reminds him she might have been a star of the stage had she not married him. They stew in a pool of mutual regret and irascibility, playing power games reminiscent ofHamm and Clov in Samuel Beckett’s Endgame (who is master and who is slave here?), but also bearing something of the desperately isolated, absurdist couple in Ionesco’s The Chairs. Geoffrey Streatfeild is able but a little overshadowed as Alice’s cousin, Kurt, who becomes a pawn between them.View image in fullscreenStewing in a pool of mutual regret … Will Keen as Edgar.Photograph:  /© Nobby ClarkBecause this production really is a two-hander in spirit, balancing the question of who is the protagonist and who the antagonist within the marriage – and the drama. Keen and Dillon bring such spark and mischief to their parts. You laugh at each of them, but feel for them too. He exudes pursed-lipped stoicism until his lashing out; she is childlike in her spite yet you suspect she is the real victim here.Eyre moves its original 1900 setting to the time of the Spanish flu, in 1918. It is an inspired idea, to impose this compulsory closeness on the couple, which rings of reports over the Covid pandemic of domestic disharmony and rising divorce rates in its aftermath.The set intermittently opens up to azure strips of sea waves, as if to suggest that there is more to life out there than this terrible claustrophobia. Yet, there is anxiety around isolation, absent children and most of all the fear that there is nothing out there, beyond mortality. The ailing Edgar is not so much terrified of death as the spectre of no afterlife in a Godless universe. Is it a play about mortality dressed up as a marital drama? Do the characters tear pieces out of each other to fill their void? These are questions I had not asked myself until seeing this production.So, a terrible tango to the death but one which brings a rare and captivating pathos. For a play that risks shrinking into joyless desolation, this expands into something much bigger than a mere marital misery-fest. Not to be missed.At Orange Tree theatre, London, until 7 March.Explore more on these topicsTheatreOrange Tree theatreAugust StrindbergreviewsShareReuse this content"

Rachel-Leah Hosker and Alex McCauley flit between reeling off community guidelines for social media with fierce fixed smiles, and playing a pair of teens unable to escape the story of the girl who was murdered in the woods.

Shattered text, sometimes over-reliant on lists, loops and jumps, like our short attention spans provoking us to consume one more slice of horror between clips of cats and silly dances. Parents and teachers flail for the right words to console and protect, while the guidelines select only the phrases that cover their own backs.The script is deliberately vague. We get specific details of gore, but names and character specifics are absent. Roaming in the context-less world that makes up much of our interaction online, it hints at a universality of the dangers of social media combined with the cruelty of teenage girls, but the lack of specificity holds the emotion of the story we’re told at a distance. A period coda jolts the play into the safety of satire, but the strength of this production is in its effort to capture the spiraling feeling of watching horror play out online, questioning our capacity to consume and be consumed by violence.At New Diorama theatre, London, until 14 February.Explore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Pomegranate juice sellers are setting up pyramids of fruit on their carts at gaps in the crowd and waiters are trying to reel in passersby with happy hour prices for Aperol spritzes. Amid the noise and movement, it’s easy to walk straight past number 206, whose arched doorway features a stone cross stained black with dirt – a clue to the building’s former use.Convento dei Crociferi was abandoned for 30 years, until Sicilian power couple Andrea Bartoli and Florinda Saievi took over and transformed it into Palermo’s newest arts space, theMuseum of World Cities, due to open at the end of February. Inside, a cloister with high, scalloped porticoes frames a verdant courtyard filled with palms and banana trees. Bartoli comes to meet me and enthusiastically pumps my hand before leading me up to the grand, marble-floored rooms on the first floor, which have been given over to a rather self-referential exhibition on urban change.View image in fullscreen“Cities change because people make them change,” Bartoli tells me. This is the ethos behind their organisationFarm Cultural Park, which has rehabilitated four different urban sites across western Sicily,starting with the city of Favarain 2010. The former sulphur mining town suffered rapid depopulation when its mines closed after the second world war, and many buildings across the historical centre were abandoned by owners who emigrated abroad.Bartoli and Saievi decided to transform a warren of empty, crumbling palazzos into a colourful casbah of art studios, exhibition spaces and hipster cafes. It had the effect of reviving the town, making it a destination for holidaymakers. One oft-repeated statistic is that before Bartoli and Saievi came along, there was only one six-room hotel in Favara – now the town has 600 tourist beds.There has been a resurgence in Sicily’s cultural scene, and vacant churches, prisons and convents are being snapped up“What happened in Favara was a miracle. But you can’t just put art in a place and hope it solves all of the problems,” says Bartoli pragmatically. “Contemporary art can’t change Sicily. It can’t improve the healthcare system or education.” But it can be used as a tool to draw in visitors, generate employment and, potentially, lure back residents. Farm Cultural Park, along with other art foundations, gallery owners and artists, has seized on a moment of opportunity. Sicily’s depopulation crisis is occurring in tandem with a resurgence in the island’s cultural scene, and vacant churches, prisons and convents are being snapped up.View image in fullscreenA huge stainless steel star – Stella d’ingresso al Belice by Pietro Consagra – welcomes visitors to Gibellina Nuova.Photograph: Fabrizio Robba/AlamyClose to Palermo harbour, another arts organisation,Fondazione RIV,has transformed the cavernous, dark interior of the deconsecrated San Mamiliano church into a contemporary art exhibition, plunging the church’s ornate frescoes and tapestries into darkness to better spotlight the artworks on display. Nearby, in the heart of the Vucciria district, Cristina Giarnecchia and Adriano La Licata have turned an unused storage space and former warehouse intoAll, a studio, exhibition venue and incubator for contemporary artists and curators.The same creative energy can be found outside Palermo. Gibellina, the next stop on my contemporary art tour of western Sicily, has been an art hotspot for decades, but is only now getting wider recognition. Art is present even as you enter the town – in fact, you drive right through it. An enormous star, Stella d’ingresso al Beliceby Pietro Consagra, built out of stainless steel, straddles the dual carriageway.Gibellina was built from scratch after the original town was razed by an earthquake in 1968, and the then-mayor, Ludovico Corrao, invited artists and architects to reimagine the city, weaving art into the town’s fabric. His audacious post-disaster reconstruction plan turned Gibellina into a carousel of experimental postmodern buildings, sculptures and mosaics.This is how a dream becomes reality – art becoming an economic driver for the regionAntonella Corrao“The founding principle of Gibellina is that artists would live here and work with the community to create works of art they would then leave behind,” explains Ludovico Corrao’s daughter, Antonella Corrao, who runs local arts organisationFondazione Orestiadialongside her sister. “Gibellina has never been a place where art is commodified.”In recognition of its heritage, the national government has just designated Gibellina the country’s firstItalian Capital of Contemporary Art, hoping it will breathe life back into a town that has mostly dropped off the tourist map.View image in fullscreenA sun sculpture by artist Mimmo Rotella in Gibellina, and a concrete tower with colourfulwings by architect Alessandro Mendini.Photograph: Abaca Press/AlamyAn old civic centre designed by Nanda Vigo has been emptied of debris after decades of disuse and repurposed for residencies for visiting artists, dance troupes and performers. Graffiti has been scrubbed from Francesco Venezia’s roofless, postmodern spiralGiardino Segreto I-II.Torre Civica, a concrete tower with colourful wings designed by architect Alessandro Mendini, was originally fitted with speakers that played regional folk songs several times a day. In 2026, the tower will once again play music.When I asked Antonella whether the Capital of Contemporary Art designation was the culmination of her father’s vision for Gibellina, she was moved to tears, describing it not as an end point, but a new beginning for the town: “This is how a dream becomes reality – with art truly becoming an economic driver for the region.”I was reluctant to move on from Gibellina, as even after several days of wandering I still hadn’t seen every artwork or postmodern building in the town, but I wanted to go further south, to check out where this drive for urban revitalisation had begun.My partner and I stayed atSciabica Suitein Favara in the heart of Farm Cultural Park, a pocket of quiet luxury inside the riddle of the casbah. We were there on a blustery, rainy night in late November, so couldn’t take advantage of our beautiful suite’s roof terrace and hot tub, but were perfectly placed to explore the exhibitions just outside our front door. Favara is a good place to base yourself – from there, you can hop over to Agrigento’sValley of the Templesor visit one of Farm Cultural Park’s newest additions, the formerSan Vito prison.View image in fullscreenPart of Museum of World Cities, Palermo’s newest arts space, is due to open this month.Photograph: Catherine BennettIt was a monastery before it was a prison, and its different uses are layered through the building like geological strata: pinched, austere monks’ quarters with thick stone walls made ideal solitary cells, and now one-room art installations. Many local mafiosi served time in this prison until it closed in 1996, and the cells are like time capsules: walls are still decorated with football scores, pages from pornography magazines, and a poster of Robbie Williams sporting impressive sideburns.I explored the exhibitions with Lorena Caruana, a local architect who works with Farm Cultural Park, and we walked around the prison’s perimeter as the sun set, watching murmurations of swallows ribbon through the sky. “There’s so much collective memory associated with this place,” she explained. “We don’t want to paint over it. The idea is not to transform the space entirely.”It is a noble goal: art helping to revitalise Sicily’s ghost towns and deserted urban spaces without replacing or stifling the history of the place; the present sitting happily alongside the past.Accommodation was provided byB&B Carellain Palermo (doubles from€80) andSciabica Suitein Favara (suitefrom €110)Explore more on these topicsSicily holidaysItaly holidaysCultural tripsEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As content creatorCamila Hurstputs it, “It’s basically not a party without them.” Quick and simple to make from everyday ingredients, they’re also an ideal last-minute gift for someone you love.The chocolateView image in fullscreenOlivia Mesquita uses dark chocolate for her brigadeiros. All inset photographs by Felicity Cloake.Older recipes tend to call for hot chocolate powder, but plain cocoa powder makes for a less intensely sweet result. Mesquita’s book, Authentic Brazilian Home Cooking, uses dark chocolate, and TV chefLeticia Moreinos Schwartzsuggests combining the two. But, delicious as the results are, they’re more like dense, butterychocolate trufflesthan light, silky party treats. LikeYotam Ottolenghi, I’ve gone for four tablespoons of cocoa, but feel free to adjust this to suit your palate.The dairyView image in fullscreenNatalie Pereira’s mother used a mix of sugar and milk for her brigaderios, but Felicity recommends tinned condensed milk.Chef Natalia Pereira told theNew York Timesthat her mother in Minas Gerais would stir milk and sugar together over the wood stove to produce her brigadeiros – though homemade condensed milk is easier than I expect, the flavour is lost here, so I’d recommend the tinned variety.Almost everyone uses butter, with the exception of the recipe on the Carnation condensed milk website, which substitutes margarine, making me think a vegan version might be possible with plant-based condensed milk. Schwartz also adds a spoonful of double cream, tempering the intense sweet bitterness of the cocoa and condensed milk into something mellower; it’s optional but worthwhile, in my opinion.The extrasView image in fullscreenYotam Ottolenghi’s brigadieros call for crushed biscuits to be stirred into the mix.Salt, though not traditional, is a must, and you might also like to flavour the brigadeiros with sweet spices such as vanilla or cinnamon, or coffee powder, or stir in crushed biscuits (like Ottolenghi), fruit or nuts for texture.Once they’re firm enough to roll – and the mixture is often eaten from the pan at home – you can coat them in more cocoa powder, ground nuts, chocolate flakes or desiccated coconut as takes your fancy … though nothing says “party’” to me like crunchy, colourful hundreds and thousands.Perfect brigadeirosPrep10 minCook15 minMakes1830g butter4 tbsp cocoa powder, plus extra to coat1 tbsp double cream(optional)1 x 397g tin condensed milk½ tsp flaky sea salt(or to taste)Hundreds and thousands, coarsely ground nuts or desiccated coconut, to coatPut a small heatproof tray or plate near the hob. If you have a cooking thermometer, get that ready too, though it’s not vital here.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenMelt the butter in a small saucepan (not non-stick) on a low heat and sift in the cocoa powder. Stir into a smooth paste, then beat in the cream, if using, and the condensed milk, plus the salt. Whisk or stir until well combined.View image in fullscreenTurn up the heat slightly and cook, still stirring continuously (a silicone spatula is useful for getting into the edges of the pan), until the mixture has thickened and you begin to see the bottom of the pan consistently as you stir. It should read between 95 and 99C (203-210F) on a thermometer and take about 10 minutes but will vary slightly depending on your pan and hob.View image in fullscreenPour on to the tray or plate, leaving behind any stuck to the base of the pan (this can be reheated with a little milk to make a delicious hot chocolate that saves you scrubbing the pan), then set aside to cool until fairly firm.View image in fullscreenScoop out teaspoons of the cooled mixture and use your hands to roll them into balls. Tip your coating of choice into a small bowl and roll the balls in it to coat. Put in the fridge to firm up a little if necessary before serving.Brigadeiros: marketing gimmick or Brazilian icon?

She’s a beautiful woman, but has six dog heads, all grumpy and snarling, as well as a serpent’s tail.If Scylla herself were ever to turn up at Cylla, dogs’ heads barking and tail flapping, they’d have to seat her in one of the gorgeous private booths at the front as you enter the room. These are the spots to grab if you want a little privacy, which is why we eschewed the long, prettily lit cocktail bar and headed straight to this cosy hidey-hole for a round of Poseidon’s Wrath. “It’s a bit like a dirty martini,” explained our server, who was one of those warm, bright, commanding, knowledgable souls who, in a hospitality setting, is worth her weight in drachma. This invigorating, mega-bitter tipple of vodka and vermouth laced with piney, herbaceous mastiha, seaweed and kalamata olive brine is the cocktail equivalent of being rescued by the RNLI: salty, breathtaking and head-spinning. Fret not, sweetness seekers, because they also offer a dozen other honey-, peach- and even meringue-based cocktails, if those are your thing, and all with equally dramatic, Greek myth-related names. Aphrodite’s Bloom, anyone? It’s a sensuous ode to the golden hour, the menu says.View image in fullscreenCylla’s prawn saganaki: ‘Firm king prawns in a well-balanced garlic and ouzo tomato sauce.’Brilliantly, Cylla, which is a recently revampedAll Bar One, manages to pull off all this high drama without tipping into Del Boy from Only Fools and Horses territory. Instead, there’s simply something rather reassuring about the place’s commitment to delivering an experience that’s seriously, elegantly Greek, but in a playful way. We went on a wet Wednesday in mid-January, when restaurants across the land tend to be deserted, unheated or just plain shut. Not Cylla, though: it was nicely heaving with plenty of tables of two, as well as several larger client groups – this is, after all, the businessy end of town. Convivial midweek, mid-winter dining can be hard to find, but I’m pleased to report it’s happening here.The menu is roaringly trad Greek with the occasional Mediterranean and Brit leaning. A smoked aubergine meze was outstanding: smooth, rich and with a hugely impressive depth of smokiness that could come only from truly cared-for veg, all laced with parsley, garlic and vinegar. Prawn saganaki was also very good indeed, with a generous amount of firm, grilled king prawns in a well-balanced garlic and ouzo tomato sauce. The basket of warm homemade bread is essential.View image in fullscreenCylla’s rather underwhelming lamb baklava.Lamb baklava, however, was less exciting, and pretty much just traditional sweet bakalava but stuffed with cumin and thyme-flavoured lamb. In hindsight, we should have gone for the grilled octopus with pearl onions and fava puree. A Greek-tinged beef tartare was laced with plenty of chopped gherkins, capers, truffle and Tabasco, and came with a nicely pungent chive mayo and a smoked egg yolk on top, as well as someroditikipitta, a crisper, flatter style that’s authentic to Rhodes; these little touches make Cylla’s menu feel quite personal.Central Birmingham has an array of dining options, but many of them are chains, albeit good-quality, if pricey ones. At Cylla, however, you get a real feeling that this is a restaurant that’s ploughing its own furrow, which in this day and age is increasingly rare.View image in fullscreenCylla’s beef fat potatoes are ‘quite possibly the best fondant potatoes I’ve ever eaten’.A main course of red snapper offered up a generous, nicely cooked piece of flaking fish on a subtle, bouillabaisse-style sauce that could have done with a bit more basil, fennel and star anise, although by this stage my full attention was taken by the beef fat potatoes, which are mesmerising. Yes, they sit there coyly on the sides menu, speaking nothing of their greatness, but they are quite possibly the best fondant potatoes I’ve ever eaten, and maybe even the best potato side dish served in the UK today. To the naked eye, they resemble that all too familiar rectangular gastropub-style confit potato stack, as made famous bythe Quality Chop House, among others, and copied everywhere, but these are so much more than that. The centre of these spuds is more like fluffy mash, while the exterior has a crisp whack of beef fat on all four surfaces.View image in fullscreenCylla’skaridopitawalnut dessert is ‘a diversion into fancy-schmancy’.Thekaridopitawalnut dessert, meanwhile, was a diversion into fancy-schmancy plating, with its smears, foams and puddles of pecan cremeux, chocolate namelaka, vanilla and chocolate pâte à cigarette. But it was delightful, all the same.Cylla is winner. In fact, I’ve already recommended it three times, which is the restaurant critic’s equivalent of saying I’d sell this Ford Mondeo to my nan. Cylla is both a dependable place to take groups and a rather lovely spot for a romantic tête à tête, especially if you can bag one of those booths and settle down in the home of a glamorous sea monster. Wear a life jacket, because some things are worth getting wet for.Cylla43 Newhall Street, Birmingham B3, 0121-714 9443. Open all week, noon-11pm.
